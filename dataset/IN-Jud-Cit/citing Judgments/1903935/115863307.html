                    Sabha elections for the Vellore Parliamentary Constituency as scheduled

                    on 18.04.2019.



                          2.    Prayer in W.P.No.11978 of 2019, filed by an independent

                    candidate, Mr.K.Sugumar, is also for the same relief.



                          3.    As both the writ petitions are filed for the same relief,

                    prayer with averments and submissions in common, they are taken up

                    together and disposed of by a common order.



                    Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> in W.P.No.11977 of 2019 are as follows:
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                          4. It is the case of Mr.A.C.Shanmugam, petitioner, that he is a

                    candidate contesting in the 17th Lok Sabha Elections from the Vellore

                    Parliamentary Constituency in Tamil Nadu, representing the AIADMK

                    party. The polling for the said election is to be held on 18.04.2019.</blockquote>

<p id="p_2">                    While so, the Petitioner came across news reports published by several

                    leading media houses regarding raids conducted by the Election

                    Commission officials along with officials from the Income Tax

                    Department in premises allegedly belonging to or associated with a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                         4</span>

                    candidate contesting the elections on behalf of a rival political party,

                    during the night intervening between 29.03.2019 &amp; 30.03.2019 and

                    thereafter. It is understood from these news reports that excess cash

                    amounting to several lakhs, if not crores, have been seized from the

                    premises belonging to the said candidate as well as those belonging to

                    his associates. It is understood that the Election Commission has

                    subsequently initiated investigations into allegations that the said cash

                    was intended to be used for the purpose of illegally influencing voters.
</p>


<p id="p_3">                          5. It is further contended that if the same is proved, it would only

                    establish that the candidate has indulged in multiple violations of

                    election laws, including Clause I(4) of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)

                    which mandates that candidates shall not commit any 'corrupt

                    practices'. The said conduct is in violatin of other statutory provisions as

                    well as the Manual on the MCC (March 2019 -Document No. 21, Edition

                    No.l) issued by the Election Commission of India [Para 4.4.2(B)(IX)]. The

                    said Manual mandates that Candidates shall not carry / possess "huge

                    amounts of cash during elections".
</p>


<p id="p_4">                          6. According to the petitioner the conduct of the said candidate is

                    also liable to be investigated for violation of <a href="/doc/135165626/" id="a_2">Section 8A</a> of the

                    Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 (hereinafter, referred to as the 'RP

                    Act'). However, as is evident from a bare perusal of the said provision,

                    the statutory mechanism envisages only the disqualification of a

                    candidate for the commission of such corrupt practices. As such, the

                    proper remedial measure in the present case, assuming that the Election

                    Commission's findings are accurate, would be the disqualification of the

                    concerned candidate.

<p id="p_5">                          7.    In such circumstances, the 1st Respondent herein has

                    however proceeded to issue the impugned notification numbered

                    F.No.H-11024/1/2019-Leg.II dated 16.04.2019, wherein, it has sought to

                    "partially rescind the Notification No.1389, dated 19th March 2019 in so

                    far as it relates to calling upon the said 8- Vellore parliamentary

                    constituency in Tamil Nadu to elect a member to the Lok Sabha...", and

                    the same is ex facie illegal, arbitrary and disproportionate and that the

                    same is also in violation of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_3">Representation of the

                    People Act</a>, 1951. Challenging the impugned notification, Petitioner has

                          circumstances. It is submitted that, while <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_4">Article 324</a> of the

                          that vests with the Hon'ble President of India lies under

                          constitutionally to the Election Commission, as evinced
                          from a plain reading of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_6">Article 324</a> of the Constitution.

                          excluded as a ground for countermanding or adjournment
                          under these provisions. In such circumstances, it is
                          respectfully submitted that the RP Act does not permit
                          countermanding or adjournment or elections in any
                          manner, directly or indirectly, on account of 'corrupt
                          practices' by any candidate. The statutory remedy in such
                          cases is the disqualification of the candidate and not the
                          cancellation of an election itself.

                          administrative action, but an action taken based on a
                          quasi-judicial    finding   of   culpability     by    the     Election
                          Commission. In so far as the Election Commission has
                          proceeded on such a quasi judicial determination carrying
                          serious civil consequences, the same cannot be given effect
                          to vide an administrative order. It is well-settled that

                          remedial proceedings envisaged are judicial, whereby the
                          issue must be heard in accordance with <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_16">Section 80</a> and the

                          conducted in violation of the principles of natural justice.
                          The impugned notification seeks to bye-pass the judicial
                          process envisaged under law for determination of the
                          existence of such corrupt practices by ostensibly penalizing

                          indirect manner, what cannot be achieved directly. It is
                          evident, as enunciated hereinabove, that the RP Act itself
                          envisages   the   circumstances     in   which   the   Election
                          Commission may countermand or adjourn an election. As
                          such, the Election Commission has sought to overstep its
                          prescribed jurisdiction in the instant case by seeking to do
                          indirectly what it has not been permitted to do directly. It
                          is a well settled proposition of law that, when a statute
                          envisages a certain act to be done in a certain manner, it
                          shall be done in that manner or not at all. As such, the
                          Impugned Notification is a colorable exercise of power that
                          falls afoul of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_18">                                (xiii) A bare perusal of the EC Recommendations
                          clearly demonstrates that all the findings in the instant
                          case were admittedly against only one candidate of another
                          party, who is a rival of the petitioner. There have been no
                          allegations levelled against the petitioner, let alone any
                          opportunity for hearing for the Petitioner, or for any other
                          candidate contesting from the said constituency. In such
                          circumstances, the Impugned Notification seeks to penalize
                          all candidates for the alleged violation of law by one
                          candidate. The said act is patently disproportionate in so
                          far as the desired effect of remedying the corrupt practice
http://www.judis.nic.in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                        12</span>

                          can be achieved by disqualifying just the concerned
                          candidate. As such, the Impugned Notification contravenes
                          <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_19">                                (xiv) Impugned Notification also fails to achieve the
                          objective of dissuading corrupt practices On the contrary,
                          the present action may set a precedent for the setting up
                          of dummy candidates who may openly propagate corruption
                          with the objective of having an election cancelled with the
                          sole intention of harming any candidate who has a certain
                          chance of victory. The legislature, in its wisdom, has
                          penalized corrupt practices by any candidate by imposing
                          sanctions against the said candidate. The Impugned
                          Notification, in so far as it seeks to penalize all candidates
                          for the same, is manifestly arbitrary and unjust.
</p><p id="p_20">                                (xv) Impugned Notification also occasions grave losses
                          to the public exchequer, directly and indirectly, in so far as
                          the amounts expended towards the conduct of the election
                          as well as the time devoted by several government
                          functionaries to carry out the same has been rendered
                          worthless by the Impugned Notification. While the conduct
                          of free and fair elections is no doubt the paramount
                          consideration, the same can be achieved by disqualification
                          in the present case, In such circumstances, the aforesaid
                          wastage occasioned to the public exchequer is wholly
                          needless and, as such, the Impugned Notification suffers
                          from arbitrariness and lies in violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_19">Article 14</a> of the

                          arbitrariness in as much as the EC Proceedings itself record
                          that the tainted candidate was "making preparations" to
                          target votes in the constituency and that the same was
                          prevented. In such circumstances, it is unclear as to how
                          there can be said to exist a vitiated atmosphere for the
                          conduct of elections. There are seizures of cash every day
                          across the state and the country and, in view of the
                          efficient discharge of its duties by the Election Commission,
                          there is no question of any corrupt practices having been
                          commissioned. In such circumstances, the action of
                          effectively countermanding the elections itself, despite the
                          bribing of voters admittedly having been prevented, is
                          excessive and arbitrary.

                    actions as mentioned under Section 8A of the Representation of Peoples

                    Act, 1951, and after following the due process, to disqualify the

                    candidate from contesting in the elections for the Vellore Lok Sabha

                    Constituency. However, instead of disqualifying the candidate from

                    contesting in the elections, the entire Lok Sabha elections for the

                    Vellore constituency in effect, has been cancelled, through the

                    impugned notification F.No.H-1 1024/1/2019-Leg.II, dated 16.04.2019,

                    wherein the 1st Respondent has “partially rescinded the notification

                    No.1389, dated 19th March 2019 in so far as it relates to calling upon

                    the said 8-Vellore parliamentary constituency in Tamil Nadu to elect a

                    member to the Lok Sabha...” Annexure to the Impugned Notification

                    elaborates the proceedings of the Election Commission of India, dated

                    14.04.2019, clearly detailing the history and timeline, relating to the

                    seizures of the alleged undeclared monies.

<p id="p_28">                          11.     It is the further case of the petitioner that though the

                    Election Commission has got adequate materials to take action, against

                    the accused candidate in accordance with law, the Commission has

                    instead     decided   to   recommend    to   the   President   of   India   to

                    rescind/cancel the 8-Vellore Parliamentary Constituency Election in

                    Tamil Nadu. In the present case, the Election Commission has prevented

                    the alleged corrupt practice from being carried out by seizing the

                    undeclared monies. In fact, as mentioned in Paragraph 19 of the

                    Proceedings, the DGIT (Inv.) himself notes that:

                          labels, which were also seized clearly indicate that the
                          candidate was making preparations (Emphasis added) to
                          cover all the target voters in the said parliamentary

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                    Therefore, even assuming that the allegations of corrupt practices are

                    true, bribing of voters has been prevented by the Election Commission

                    and there is no necessity to recind the voting process for the entire

                    constituency.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                          12.   The petitioner has further submitted that though in the

                    past, elections have been rescinded on similar circumstances, the

                    present case is distinguishable, on the grounds that the present election

                    relates to Lok Sabha, not assembly or Rajya Sabha and even assuming

                    that the power to rescind is available, it was exercised by the Election

                    Commission and not the President. Therefore, the petitioner has

                    contended that the Impugned Notification is illegal and unconstitutional

                    and mainly discriminates against an independent candidates like him,

                    who has already invested their meagre savings for contesting the

                    elections, and does not have the financial capability to re-contest the

                    elections. The Election Commission, on the one hand, has clearly stated

                    that the electoral process has been vitiated on account of alleged

                    unlawful activities, on behalf of the accused candidate and some

                    members/workers of the political party in question, while on the other

                    hand, the Election Commission has recommended action to be taken,

                    which will directly affect innocent contestants, including the petitioner.

                          Articles 14, 19 &amp; 21 of the Indian Constitution.

                          aside in so far as the Impugned Notification actively
                          discriminates against independent candidates like the
                          Petitioner herein. While major political parties have the
                          financial bandwidth necessary to conduct and compete in
                          re-elections, independent candidates like petitioner will
                          not have the financial capacity to take part in the electoral

                          means and has taken part in the electoral process at his
                          own expense and cost, and cannot be made to suffer due to
                          the alleged corrupt actions of another. Therefore, the
                          Impugned       Notification   is    discriminatory    against
                          independent candidates like the Petitioner, is a colourable

                          preventing corrupt practices, and in fact enables them. It is

                          one candidate alone, it will lead to a situation where
                          political parties under the fear of losing the elections, will
                          voluntarily set up dummy candidates and engage in corrupt
                          practices, so as to rescind the elections. It is submitted
                          that this is especially damaging to independent candidates
                          like the Petitioner herein, who will not have the capacity
                          to constantly take part in elections and whose chance to
                          win the elections will be greatly compromised. Therefore,
                          the Impugned Notification is liable to be set aside.

                          admitted that while an attempt was made to influence the
                          voters, it has been prevented due to the prompt actions of
                          the Election Commission. It is submitted that when the
                          alleged     offence   has   been     prevented,   the   Election
                          Commission has, without basis, stated in its proceedings
                          that allowing the current electoral process to proceed and
                          to conduct the poll in the constituency in such a vitiated
                          atmosphere, will severely jeopardize the conduct of free
                          and fair elections. However, the Election Commission fails
                          to mention the reasons as to why instead of taking actions
                          against the accused candidate and other members of his
                          political party, the entire election needs to be rescinded.

                          It is humbly submitted that while the seizure of allegedly
                          undeclared monies from the associates of a major political
                          party's secretary has resulted in the rescission of the Lok

                          respect of the Assembly elections in Vellore is arbitrary and
                          discriminatory       and   contravenes      <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_25">Article   14</a>    of   the
                          Constitution.

                          mind.     Election    Commission       in   its   proceedings    has
                          admittedly compiled precise details of alleged corrupt
                          activities against a candidate of another party and has also
                          stated categorically that unlawful activities have been

                          others of that political party alone. However, instead of
                          taking disciplinary actions against that candidate alone, the

                          itself, it is clear that the power to countermand or rescind

                    of 2019, submitted that the power exercised by the Hon'ble President, is

                    a hybrid power, invoking <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_33">Article 324</a> of the Constitution of India and

                    <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_34">Section 21</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897. According to him, the

                    Hon'ble President of India cannot exercise the power, under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_35">Article 324</a>

                    of the Constitution of India, to cancel the election.

                    that the Election Commission of India can only disqualify a person, who

                    has indulged in corrupt practices and in the case on hand, the rival

                    candidates and that there is no need to countermand the entire

                    W.P.No.11977 of 2019, submitted that the said statue enumerates

                    certain Acts to be taken into consideration for ordering fresh poll, ie.,

                    destruction of ballot papers, booth capturing, etc., and when the

                    legislation provides for specific instances, countermanding of the

                    elections and allegations of corrupt practices by a candidate, cannot be

                    a reason for cancelling the elections. According to him, this is a classic

                    case of corrupt practice by one of the candidates and for the sole act of

                    one candidate, the entire election need not be stalled. Heavens would

                    not fall down, the elections can go on and results be kept in abeyance,

                    till the matters are finally disposed of. He further submitted that

                    cancelling of elections, is highly disproportionate.

                    the petitioner in W.P. No.11977 of 2019 contended that once a

                    Notification is issued by the President under Section 14 of the RP Act,

                    1951, then the Election Commission of India has to conduct the elections

                    the RP Act, 1951 exists. He further submitted that the Election

                    Commission of India does not have the powers to countermand the

                    elections in any other circumstances. He also contended that a reading

                    of the entire recommendation would show that the allegations in the

                    recommendation to rescind the election is directed only against one

                    candidate. He submitted that for this purpose, the entire election need

                    not be rescinded. He submitted that the consequences of corrupt

                    practices are given in the RP Act, 1951. The Election Commission ought

                    not to have countermanded the entire election.

<p id="p_44">                          19.   Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that the entire

                    allegation in the recommendation, dated 14.4.2019 is that the Election

                    Commission of India has unearthed huge amounts of cash from a

                    candidate belonging to a political party which was meant for distribution

                    to the voters and this according to the Election Commission will have

                    the effect of affecting the purity in elections. He submitted that an FIR

                    has already been lodged and the candidate concerned will face trial. He

                    further submitted that if the candidate is found to be guilty then he will

                    be punished under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_39"> the Penal Code</a> and at the same time, will be

                    the allegations against the candidate are proved, he is elected his

                    election will be set aside, but if he is not elected, then there will be no

                    effect on the final outcome of the result, but he will be disqualified

                    from contesting any elections for a period of six years from the date of

                    conviction. He submitted that Election Commission was therefore not

                    justified in recommending cancellation of the elections to 8-Vellore

                    Parliamentary Constituency.

<p id="p_45">                          20.   Mr.Sathish Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel appearing for

                    the petitioner in W.P.No.11977 of 2019, further submitted that the

                    reading of the recommendations would show that distribution of money

                    to the voters has been prevented and therefore the purity of elections

                    has not been disturbed. He also contended in any event, the Hon'ble

                    President does not have the power to rescind the election. He

                    submitted that if elections are countermanded/rescinded on the

                    allegation of distribution of money, then it will amount to inserting to a

                    new provision in the RP Act, 1951 after from <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_41">Section 58</a> and <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_42">58-A</a>. He

                    further submitted that on the facts of the present case countermanding

                    election is too drastic step. In the alternative, he contended that even if

                    it is to be assumed that the Election Commission of India does have the

                    power to make such a recommendation, then the circumstances must be

                    such that it was not in the contemplation of the authorities and should

                    have come as a surprise. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that

                    if the recommendation of the Election Commission has to be accepted,

                    then in every constituency where there is a seizure of money, election

                    must be rescinded. He submitted that no yardstick is available to

                    determine as to when election must be cancelled, when money meant

                    for distribution to voters is seized.

<p id="p_46">                          21.   According to the learned Senior Counsel, corrupt practices

                    alleged to have been indulged by a candidate, is not a serious issue, to

                    rescind the election, contrary to the legitimate expectation, to exercise

                    the right of voting by the voters and also the other contestants, who

                    are in the fray of election and not alleged to have been indulged in any

                    corrupt practices. Election Commission should not countermand,

                    because of the corrupt practices of only one candidate. He submitted

                    that the reasons assigned in the impugned order are extraneous,

                    arbitrary, and therefore, the notification is liable to be set aside.

                    Constituency. In support of the above contentions, he took this Court to

                    the relevant passages in the recommendation of the Election

                    Court to the relevant dates of election notification, dated 19.03.2019,

                    16.04.2019, is an allegation of seizure of cash on 30.03.2019, but the

                    candidate, his father and one Mr.Pooncholai, a party functionary of

                    DMK, have denied about cash found. Between 30.03.2019 and

                    14.04.2019, the dates on which, seizure and recommendations, sent to

                    the candidate is punished for the offences, stated supra, he will suffer

                    disqualification. Acts alleged would fall under the definition of corrupt

                    practices, which attracts disqualification under <a href="/doc/135165626/" id="a_46">Section 8-A</a> of the

                    Representation of the People Act, 1951. In any event, if prosecution

                    succeeds, he would be punished for corrupt practices and lateron, he

                    would be disqualified. But that alone cannot be the reason to

                    countermand or cancel the elections. He further contended that to

                    maintain purity and for conducting free and fair elections, it does not

                    require to rescind the instant election, without any justifiable reason

                    and that there is no rational behind the decision taken by the Election

                    in the recommendation for coming to the conclusion that distribution

                    was going on at a larger scale and in a clandestine manner. Nowhere, in

                    severely jeopardize the conduct free and fair elections in 8-Vellore

                    there was only a seizure on 30.03.2019 and that there was no

                    distribution. Mere seizure cannot be a sole reason for the conclusion of

                          in the premises where the cash was found but expressed

                          some associates of Sh. Kathir Anand had called him on

                          place or not. This, prima facie, explains the nexus

                          DMK Party functionary. He stated that cash was
                          exchanged in 3 to 4 instalments in March, 2019 and the
                          stated purpose was to meet incidental party expenses
                          and to distribute to people brought for party meetings.

                          unearthed a systematic design to influence voters
                          through inducements. These activities come under the
                          ambit of “corrupt practices" as per Section 123 of the RP
                          Act, 1951. The Special Expenditure Observer is of the
                          opinion that the situation is not conducive for the

                          proposed assembly segment, ward and booth wise money
                          distribution suggests a clear cut pattern and design to

</p><p id="p_165">                                 25. The Commission has carefully analysed and
                          examined the whole situation as prevailing in the said
                          constituency. It is apparent from the facts and the
                          evidence brought on record, which is narrated above,
                          that inducement and allurements to electors by the
                          candidate, political party and their associates by
                          distribution of money has been going on at a large scale
                          and in a clandestine manner, vitiating the purity of the

</p><p id="p_166">                                 26. It may be noted that the election law seriously
                          frowns upon acts of ‘bribery’ during elections and those
                          indulging in such acts are visited upon with severe
                          penalties under the law. Bribing any person during
                          elections with the objective of inducing him or any other
                          person to exercise any electoral right or, even inducing
http://www.judis.nic.in   or attempting to induce any person to exercise any such

                          right for such consideration, is an electoral offence under
                          <a href="/doc/298814/" id="a_98">section 171B</a> of the Indian Penal Code, and is punishable
                          with imprisonment of either description for a term
                          extending up to one year or, with fine, or with both. Any
                          conviction for the offence of ‘bribery’, even if lesulting
                          in the imposition of a very nominal fine, will
                          automatically disqualify the convicted person for a
                          minimum period of six years under <a href="/doc/185912055/" id="a_99">section 8(1)</a> of the
                          Representation of the People Act, 1951. Further, such
                          ‘bribery’ at elections is also a corrupt practice under
                          <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_100">section 123(1)</a> of the Representation of the People Act,
                          1951 which can result in the election of the returned
                          candidate being declared void and the candidate found
                          guilty of commission of such corrupt practice can also be
                          disqualified by the President on the recommendation of
                          the Commission for a further period of six years. The
                          above provisions in the law, making ‘bribery’ an electoral
                          offence and also a corrupt practice, have been made
                          with the manifest object of ensuring purity of the
                          election process. Purity of electoral process has been
                          placed on a higher pedestal than even the secrecy of
                          ballot which is considered to be sacrosanct in democratic
                          elections. It is worthwhile to point out that in order to
                          maintain purity of election process, even the voting
                          system at elections to the Rajya Sabha has been
                          amended in 2003 to provide for ‘open voting’ where
                          allegations were often made that the electors at those
                          elections were being offered various forms of
                          allurements and inducements to obtain their votes. The
                          Hon’ble Supreme Court, before whom the above
                          amendment to the law to provide for open voting at
                          elections to Rajya Sabha was questioned, observed in
                          <a href="/doc/1903935/" id="a_101">Kuldip Nayar v. Union</a> o f India and Ors. [AIR 2006 SC
                          3127] that though the secrecy of ballot and purity of
                          elections should normally co-exist, the principle of
                          secrecy of vote must yield to the purity of election to
                          further the object of a free and fair election.
                          Observations to the same effect were made earlier also

</p><p id="p_167">                                 27. It is pertinent here to take note of the fact
                          that the above mentioned provisions relating to offence
                          of ‘bribery’ in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_103"> the Indian Penal Code</a> were introduced in
                          the year 1920 and the “corrupt practice” of bribery
                          found its mention in the <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_104">Representation of the People
                          Act</a> in 1951, as originally enacted, when these acts were
                          considered as aberrations and exceptions, whereas the
                          facts narrated above and the reports received by the
                          Commission now paint a wholly different picture in as
                          much as the said aberrations and exceptions seem to
                          have become the main features of election campaigning
                          in the said constituency.

                          also aims to eliminate the role and influence of big
                          money in the electoral process. Therefore, the law has
                          prescribed limits of election expenses which the
                          candidates may incur or authorise in connection with
                          their election. The incurring or authorising expenditure
                          in excess of the prescribed limit is a corrupt practice
                          under <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_105">section 123(6)</a> of the Representation of the People

                          election of the returned candidate being void and also
                          attracting a disqualification for a period up to six years.
                          The law further requires each contesting candidate to
                          maintain a true and separate account of his election
                          expenses under section 77 of the RP Act and the failure
                          to render a true and correct account of the election
                          expenditure may invite disqualification for three years
                          under <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_106">section 10A</a> of the said Act.

                          Election Commission finds it extremely difficult to
                          control such a menace. There is no truthfulness in the

                          that such requirement of incurring bona fide and correct

                    assembly segments polling took place on 16.03.1977. In respect of 5

                    assembly segments polling took place on 20.03.1977 and the remaining

                    on the next day. Appellant Mohinder Singh Gill and third respondent

                    therein were the principal contestants. Appellant contended that when

                    counting in all the assembly segments was completed at the respective

                    segment head quarters, copies of the results were given to the

                    destroyed. Ultimately it turned out to be postponing the declaration of

                          prescriptions in the Act and the Rules. The secrecy of the

                          have been thoughtfully provided for. Myriad other matters

                          national and State elections and, therefore, the necessary
http://www.judis.nic.in   powers to discharge that function. It is true that <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_174">Article 324</a>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                                                        89</span>

                          has to be read in the light of the constitutional scheme and
                          the 1950 Act and the 1951 Act. Sri Rao is right to the extent
                          he insists that if competent legislation is enacted as
                          visualised in <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_175">Article 327</a> the Commission cannot shake itself
                          free from the enacted prescriptions. After all, as Mathew,
                          J. has observed in Indira Gandhi (p. 523) (see p. 136, paras
                          335-6):
</p><p id="p_214">                                 “In the opinion of some of the Judges constituting the
                          majority in Bharati's case [<a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_176">Kesavananda Bharati v. State of
                          Kerala</a>, (1973) 4 SCC 225.] rule of law is a basic structure of
                          the Constitution apart from democracy.
</p><p id="p_215">                                 The rule of law postulates the pervasiveness of the
                          spirit of law throughout the whole range of Government in
                          the sense of excluding arbitrary official action in any
                          sphere.”
                          And the supremacy of valid law over the Commission argues
                          itself. No one is an imperium in imperio in our
                          constitutional order. It is reasonable to hold that the
                          Commissioner cannot defy the law armed by <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_177">Article 324.</a>
                          Likewise, his functions are subject to the norms of fairness
                          and he cannot act arbitrarily. Unchecked power is alien to
                          our system.
</p><p id="p_216">                                 39.Even so, situations may arise which enacted law
                          has not provided for. Legislators are not prophets but
                          pragmatists. So it is that the Constitution has made
                          comprehensive provision in <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_178">Article 324</a> to take care of
                          surprise situations. That power itself has to be exercised,
                          not mindlessly nor mala fide, not arbitrarily nor with
                          partiality but in keeping with the guidelines of the rule of
                          law and not stultifying the Presidential notification nor
                          existing legislation. More is not necessary to specify; less is
                          insufficient to leave unsaid. <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_179">Article 324</a>, in our view,
                          operates in areas left unoccupied by legislation and the
                          words “superintendence, direction and control, as well as
                          ‘conduct of all elections’, are the broadest terms”. Myriad
                          maybes, too mystic to be precisely presaged, may call for
                          prompt action to reach the goal of free and fair election. It
                          has been argued that this will create a constitutional
                          despot beyond the pale of accountability; a Frankenstein's
                          monster who may manipulate the system into elected

                          history. To that the retort may be that the judicial branch,
                          at the appropriate stage, with the potency of its benignant
                          power and within the leading strings of legal guidelines, can
                          call the bluff, quash the action and bring order into the
                          process. Whether we make a triumph or travesty of
                          democracy depends on the man as much as on the Great
                          National Parchment. Secondly, when a high functionary
                          like. the Commissioner is vested with wide powers the law
                          expects him to act fairly and legally. <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_180">Article 324</a> is geared
                          to the accomplishment of free and fair elections
                          expeditiously. Moreover, as held in <a href="/doc/1475436/" id="a_181">Virendra [Virendra v.

                          in a high functionary may be reasonably trusted to be used

                          Court has power to strike down the act. This is well
                          established and does not need further case law
                          confirmation. Moreover, it is useful to remember the

                          of natural justice and its pro tem exclusion on grounds of
                          necessity and non-stultification of the on-going election.
                          The Commission claims that a direction for re-poll is an
                          “emergency” exception. The rules of natural justice are
                          rooted in all legal systems, not any “new theology” and are
                          manifested in the twin principles of nemo judex in causa
                          sua and audi alteram partem. We are not concerned here
                          with the former since no case of bias has been urged. The
                          grievance ventilated is that of being condemned unheard.
                          Sporadic applications or catalogue of instances cannot
                          make for a scientific statement of the law and so we have
                          to weave consistent criteria of application and principles
                          for carving out exceptions. If the rule is sound and not
                          negatived by statute, we should not devalue it nor hesitate
                          to hold every functionary who affects others' right to it.
                          The audi alteram partem rule has a few facets two of which
                          are (a) notice of the case to be met; and (b) opportunity to
                          explain. Let us study how far the situation on hand can
                          coexist with canons of natural justice. While natural justice
                          is universally respected, the standards vary with situations
                          contracting into a brief, even post-decisional opportunity,
                          or expanding into trial-type trappings.

</p><p id="p_222">                                 54. The learned Addl. Solicitor-General welcomed the
                          dramatic pace of enlargement in the application of natural
                          justice. But he argued for inhibiting its spread into
                          forbidden spaces lest the basic values of <a href="/doc/1797219/" id="a_188">Article 329</a> be
                          nullified. In short, his point is that where utmost
                          promptitude is needed — and that is the raison d'etre of
                          exclusion of intermediate legal proceedings in election
                          matters — natural justice may be impractical and may
                          paralyze, thus balking the object of expeditious
                          completion. He drew further inspiration from another
                          factor to validate the exclusion of natural justice from the
                          Commission's actions, except where specifically stipulated
                          by statute. He pointed out what we have earlier mentioned
                          — that an election litigation is one in which the whole
                          constituency of several lakhs of people is involved and, if
                          the Election Commission were under an obligation to hear
                          affected parties it may, logically, have to give notice to
                          lakhs of people and not merely to candidates. This will
                          make an ass of the law and, therefore, that is not the law.
                          This reductio ad absurdum also has to be examined.
</p><p id="p_223">                                 55. Law cannot be divorced from life and so it is that
                          the life of the law is not logic but experience. If, by the
                          experiential test, importing the right to be heard will
                          paralyze the process, law will exclude it. It has been said
                          that no army can be commanded by a debating society, but
                          it is also true that the House of Commons did debate,
                          during the days of debacle and disaster, agony and crisis of
                          the Second World War, the life-and-death aspects of the
                          supreme command by the then British Prime Minister “to
                          the distress of all our friends and to the delight of all our
                          foes” — too historic to be lost on jurisprudence. Law lives
                          not in a world of abstractions but in a cosmos of
                          concreteness and to give up something good must be
                          limited to extreme cases. If to condemn unheard is wrong,
                          it is wrong except where it is overborne by dire social
                          necessity. Such is the sensible perspective we should adopt
                          if ad hoc or haphazard solutions should be eschewed.

                          connotation commencing from the Presidential notification
                          calling upon the electorate to elect and culminating in the
                          final declaration of the returned candidate.

                          elections in the Election Commission. This responsibility
                          may cover powers, duties and functions of many sorts,

                          or any State Legislature has made valid law relating to or in
                          connection with elections, the Commission, shall act in
                          conformity with, not in violation of, such provisions but
                          where such law is silent <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_190">Article 324</a> is a reservoir of power
                          to act for the avowed purpose of, not divorced from,
                          pushing forward a free and fair election with expedition.
                          Secondly, the Commission shall be responsible to the rule
                          of law, act bona fide and be amenable to the norms of
                          natural justice insofar as conformance to such canons can
                          reasonably and realistically be required of it as fairplay-in-
                          action in a most important area of the constitutional order
                          viz. elections. Fairness does import an obligation to see
                          that no wrongdoer candidate benefits by his own wrong. To
                          put the matter beyond doubt, natural justice enlivens and
                          applies to the specific case of order for total re-poll,
                          although not in full panoply but in flexible practicability.
                          Whether it has been complied with is left open for the

                          have been resorted by the Election Commission and in case
                          of any of voter, as alleged in the case that three of the
                          Voters, namely, Shri Vishnu Bhaiya (JVM), Shri K.N. Tripathy
                          of Indian National Congress and Shri Suresh Paswan (RJD)
                          shown their ballot to the person other than their
                          representatives or agent and thus violated the prescribed
                          voting system, which is contrary to Rule 39AA. Then in that
                          situation, the Polling Officer of the poling under the
                          direction of the Presiding Officer could have taken back the
http://www.judis.nic.in   ballot paper from the voter and could have marked
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                                       100</span>

                          "cancelled" over the ballot paper, but it was not done by the
                          Presiding Officer or the Polling Officer. However, because
                          of this reason, the Election Commission could not have
                          recommended for rescinding the election notification itself.
                          Because of the reason that consequence of showing the
                          marked ballots to unauthorized persons has its own
                          consequence under the proviso to <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_219">Section 59</a> read with Rule
                          39A and 39AA. Learned counsel for the petitioner relying
                          the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, delivered in
                          Kuldip Nayar's case (supra) submitted that the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court has considered in paragraph 441 and notice
                          the difference between the elections to the Council of
                          States and General elections. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
                          observed that in General elections, electorates have to vote
                          in a secret manner without fear and if their votes would be
                          disclosed to anyone it may result in victimization. For voter
                          in general election, there is no party affiliation and hence
                          the choice is entirely with the voter. The Hon'ble Supreme
                          Court held that so is not in the case when elections are held
                          to the Council of States as the electors are elected Members
                          of the Legislative Assemblies, who, in turn, have party
                          affiliation. Then in para-451 observed that it cannot be
                          forgotten that existence of political parties is an essential
                          feature of our Parliamentary democracy and that it can be a
                          matter of concern for Parliament if, it finds that electors
                          were resorting cross voting under the garb of conscience
                          voting, flouting party discipline in the name of secrecy of
                          voting. This would weaken the party discipline over the
                          errant legislators. Political parties are the sine qua non of
                          parliamentary democracy in our country and the protection
                          of party discipline can be introduced as an essential feature
                          of purity of elections in case of indirect elections.

                          submitted that where a candidate has reached the end of
                          the battle and the whole poll is upset, he has right to notice
                          and to be heard. Therefore, before taking any decision by
                          the Election Commission, the Election Commission should
http://www.judis.nic.in   have heard the petitioner, particularly, Pradeep Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                                      101</span>

                          Balmachu, who is the candidate in the present Rajya Sabha
                          election, which has been recommended to be cancelled by
                          the Election Commission to the President of India. The
                          petitioner,     Pradeep    Kumar     Balmuchu,      submitted
                          representation to the Election Commission on 31st March,
                          2012 and also submitted representation of the same date
                          i.e., 31st March, 2012 to Her Excellency, the Hon'ble
                          President of India. Then before taking a decision even by
                          the Election Commission for sending a recommendation for
                          rescinding the election notification dated 12th March, 2012,
                          the petitioner should have been given an opportunity, which
                          has not been given. Therefore, that recommendation
                          deserves to be quashed and set aside. Learned counsel for
                          the petitioners relied upon the same judgment of Mohinder
                          Singh Gill's case (Supra) whereby the Hon'ble Supreme Court
                          after setting down the limits to the plenary powers of the
                          Election Commission held that when Parliament and State
                          Legislature has made any valid law relating to or in
                          connection with elections, the commission, shall act in
                          conformity with, not in violation, such provisions and
                          further held in paragraph 75 that people's faith in
                          democratic process is hyper- sensitive, it is republican
                          realism to keep alive audi alteram even in emergencies,
                          even amidst the clash of arms. Therefore, even in the case

</p><p id="p_249">                          And in paragraph 40 of the said judgment, the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court held that the Supreme Court in earlier

                          Therefore, in view of the observations made by the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court in paragraph 39 of the said case, the

                          by declaring that the retort may be that the judicial branch,
                          at the appropriate stage with the potency of its benignant

                          process. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the
                          fact that such high functionary like the Election
                          Commission, as has been the view shown by the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court in the case of Pundu Swami (1952) SCR 218
                          and held that such authorities vested with wide powers the

                          Court has power to strike down the act. Therefore, in the
                          present case, the Election Commission was right in it's
                          wisdom to take immediate action and recommend

                          counsel for the petitioners, we are of the considered
                          opinion that the Parliament has not amended <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_234">Section 59</a> and
                          inserted Rule 39A and Rule 39AA as a measure to deal with
                          all contingency of money power play and horse trading in
                          the election process. The two steps taken of the removal of

                          Union Territory for contesting election to the Council of
                          States from that State or Union Territory and provided for
                          open ballot, may be two of the mode prescribed so as to
                          reduce the chance of money power play and horse trading in
                          the process of election . What will happen , when outsider
                          is involved such immoral, unethical and criminal activities?
                          This is only a one of narrow question to find out that
                          whether above amendments are the only answer to the
                          grave problem of play of money power? It is true that
                          validity of the amendment has been upheld by the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court in the case of Kudeep Nayar(Supra). At this
                          juncture, we would like to observe that issue before the
                          Hon'ble Supreme Court , in that case, was with respect to
                          the challenge of the abovesaid amendment only made by
                          the <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_235">Representation of the People Act</a>(Amendment (Act 40 of
                          2003) by which requirement of residence/domicile has been
                          dispensed with and open ballot was declared to be valid
                          mode of fair poling. While considering this issue, the
                          Hon'ble Supreme Court already considered the issue of
                          cross-voting and corruption in the voting and corrupt
                          consideration. However, it was confined to subject of
                          affiliation of the member of the political party. The Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court in para-459 clearly observed that
                          amendment has been brought in on the basis of the need to
                          avoid cross-voting and wipe out evils of corruption as also to
                          maintain the integrity of our democratic set up. The Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court took note of the fact that it has already
                          been noted by the Parliament that in election to Council of
                          States , members elected on behalf of the political parties
                          misused the secret ballot and cross-voting . It was reported
                          that some members indulged in cross voting for
                          consideration. Then it was observed that breach of
                          discipline for collateral and corrupt consideration removed
                          the faith of the people in a multi party democracy.
</p><p id="p_252">                                 24. We may reiterate that the issue raised before the
                          Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kuldip Nayar's case(Supra) was
                          with respect to challenge to the validity of the amendment,
                          which we referred above, and in that context the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court held that the members of legislative
                          assembly may indulge in cross-voting , which may be against
http://www.judis.nic.in   the whip of the political party and against the party
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                                                       108</span>

                          discipline and therefore, the party's representative may see
                          the ballot marked by the electoral to maintain the
                          discipline of the party and avoid the cross-voting.
</p><p id="p_253">                                 25. There was no issue involved in the case of Kuldip
                          Nayar of seeking cancellation of election notification on
                          allegation of horse trading and money power play. In the
                          case in hand, according to the writ petitioner themselves
                          the allegation of money power play is upon independent
                          candidate and not on any party candidate (we are not
                          deciding or holding any of the candidates or member of
                          legislative assembly guilty and considering the allegation
                          only) and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme
                          Court in the judgment of Kuldip Nayar the voters who are
                          the members of political party alone are required to show
                          the ballot paper to parties representative and not to others.
                          Three members of the political party shown ballot paper to
                          unauthorized persons. And one of allegation with proof
                          presented before the Commission was that several political
                          parties MLAs proposed to independent candidates. Such
                          facts were taken into account by the Election Commission,
                          which independently may not be of importance but in
                          background of facts of present case are very important.
                          Their votes have not been cancelled, may be due to mistake
                          of the officer conducting the election, but fact is that those
                          votes had been cast. The open vote may secure the
                          discipline of political party and may avoid the cross voting
                          in horse trading and money play to some extent but while
                          interpreting the power of the high functioning authority like
                          Election Commission, we cannot hold that apart from what
                          has been provided by the said amendment of removal of
                          condition of domicile and open vote system is full and
                          complete answer to the grave problem. Now the time has
                          come to look into the availability of huge funds which
                          availability has been proved in this case and not disputed by
                          the politicians rather admitted by them and there is
                          allegation of paying money to the party itself (fact yet not
                          proved). If it happens so, then in that situation, the
                          amendments are of no use because they take care of
                          securing the discipline of the members of the political party
                          within the political party. It may avoid the corruption if
http://www.judis.nic.in   party is strong as the party can reject any wrong doers by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">                                                      109</span>

                          claiming that all had cast votes in favour of such person who
                          was not indulged in horse trading. This is not imaginary but
                          the allegation has come in almost all newspapers in
                          circulation in the State of Jharkhand with one voice and
                          have raised doubt without any bias and ill-feeling about the
                          involvement of not only members to political party but offer
                          of money to parties (we wish so may not be true) but in
                          future such cases may come through also whether Election

                          Court in the case of M.S. Gill (Supra). We can take judicial
                          notice of the newspaper reportings because of the fact that,
                          that was unanimous voice of media in State and the
                          language used by the media was not derogatory, defamatory
                          or with any bias for one or others. Not only this but the
                          Election Commission has also taken note of the media
                          report shown by one of the members of Parliament Gurudas
                          Dasgupta and it is also reported in the media that the seized
                          amount was not only the amount which has been sent from
                          Jamshedpur to Ranchi and petitioners themselves admitted
                          in their petition that, at least, Rs. 2.15 crores was
                          intercepted by the Income Tax Department and that was
                          sent for the votes. Assuming that none of the party was
                          involved in illegal consideration for vote of its member then
                          also in the fact situation where the involvement of the
                          money was so much and out of which some of the money
                          has been intercepted by the vigilant cell of the Income Tax
                          Department on the instruction of the Election Commission
                          and the Election Commission has presumed that it was a
                          grave case of large scale horse trading and money power
                          play and took the extraordinary steps in extraordinary
                          situation and which is not contrary to any statutory
                          provisions of law and which action is based on substantive
                          material evidence, then at this juncture, it would be
                          relevant to quote from the judgment of the Hon'ble
                          Supreme Court delivered in the case of M.S. Gill (Supra),
                          wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that "once the

                          situations. He must lawfully exercise his power
                          independently, in all matters relating to the conduct of
                          elections, and see that the elections process is completed
                          properly in a free and fair manner. "An express statutory
                          grant of power or the imposition of a definite duty carries
                          with it by implication, in the absence of a limitation,

                          the Hon'ble Supreme Court expects from high functionary
                          authority like Election Commission that, even if the law and
                          the rules are absent even then if Election Commission
                          comes across such a situation and he is to tackle that
                          situation then he should not remain with folded hands and
                          pray to God for divine inspiration to enable him to exercise
                          his functions and to perform his duties or to look to any
                          external authority for the grant of powers to deal with the
                          situations. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly held that
                          the question raised by the petitioner that Election
                          Commission must exercise his power independently in all
                          matters relating to the conduct of free and fair elections
                          and see that election process is completed properly in a
                          free and fair manner.
</p><p id="p_255">                                 The Hon'ble Supreme Court further in paragraph 115
                          of M.S Gill's case (Supra) clearly held that the Election
                          Commission is entitled to exercise certain powers under
                          <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_236">Article 324</a> itself on its own right, in an area not covered by

</p><p id="p_256">                                 27. In these cases, we are of the considered opinion
                          that the Election Commission has acted befitting to its
http://www.judis.nic.in   office by taking extraordinary steps of stopping the counting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                                       111</span>

                          promptly and stopping the result of the poll and forthwith
                          recommended for rescinding the election notification to Her
                          Excellency the President of India. The Election Commission
                          recommendations are since based on facts and materials
                          and this Court is not appellate Court to re-examine the
                          evidence and material to find out the correctness in the
                          process of the Election Commission. The petitioners also
                          rightly did not pray for appreciating the evidence which
                          were considered by the Election Commission and very
                          interestingly none of the fact narrated in the
                          recommendation of the Election Commission, made in
                          recommendation to rescind the election notification has
                          been disputed by the petitioners and yet the petitioners
                          assailed the recommendation of the Election Commission to
                          the President of India. The petitioners even did not dispute,
                          rather say admitted that three of the Members of the
                          legislative Assembly violated the rules and it inadvertently
                          or for any reason their votes have not been cancelled by the
                          Incharge of the election. So, is in addition to the fact that
                          the petitioners themselves have stated in the writ petitions
                          that money was meant for the election in question and
                          intercepted by the Income Tax Department and thereby
                          only this money could not be paid to the relevant persons to

                          the writ petitioners in these circumstances to take the help
                          of technicalities of the law , but the writ petitioners
                          ignored the fact that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_237">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
                          is the extraordinary equitable jurisdiction of the High Court
                          and it is not an ordinary jurisdiction of any Court where on
                          the basis of legal right , one can claim the relief which
                          cannot be denied by the court on account of misconduct of
                          the party and that relief cannot be denied on equitable
                          ground. There are number of cases, which already lay down
                          that even if there is illegality the High Court in writ
                          jurisdiction i.e., in extraordinary equitable jurisdiction need
                          not to correct that illegality if the conduct of the petitioner
                          disentitles him from the relief. So is the position in this
                          case. The petitioners after admitting all the fault and flaws

<p id="p_258">                                 Before proceeding to decide this issue we make it
                          clear that the challenge in this petition is to the
                          recommendation of the Election Commission made to
                          President of India. The Commission itself has not
                          countermanded the election. Such recommendation of
                          Commisison may be accepted by the Her Excellancy
                          President of India. We may recapitulate here that the
                          Election Commission is vested with the power under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_238">Article
                          324</a> of the Constitution of India and is discharging this
                          responsibility by following procedures provided in the
                          Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_239">In the Act</a> there is no
                          provision for submitting a request for rescinding of the
                          election notification to the President of India. <a href="/doc/87324915/" id="a_240">Section 12</a> of
                          the Act of 1951 provides that on the recommendation of the

                          notification published in the Gazette of India call upon the
                          elected members of the legislative assembly of each of the
                          State concerned to elect Members in accordance with the
                          provisions of Act of 1951 for Council of States. Learned
                          counsel for the petitioners submitted that <a href="/doc/87324915/" id="a_241">Section 12</a> clearly
                          indicate that on recommendation of the Election
                          Commission the President shall issue notification for
                          election and, therefore, it is mandatory upon the President
                          of India to accept the recommendation of Election
http://www.judis.nic.in   Commission. Therefore, according to the learned counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">                                                      113</span>

                          for the petitioners by the same analogy the President of
                          India shall be bound by the recommendation made by the
                          Election Commission by which the Election Commission has
                          requested for rescinding the election. The argument is far
                          fetched as well as far away from the law. We are not going
                          to interpret the word "shall" used in <a href="/doc/87324915/" id="a_242">Section 12</a> with
                          reference to the action to be taken the President of India,
                          on recommendation of the Election Commission and if it is
                          held that the word "shall" mandate duty upon President of
                          India to accept the recommendation of the Election
                          Commission even then that principle cannot be applied on
                          recommendation submitted by the Election Commission to
                          the President of India in its administrative function and the
                          Hon'ble President of India can either accept or can reject
                          the recommendation of the Election Commission for want of
                          any law putting a command upon the highest office in India
                          i.e., upon the President of India, which can take away the
                          discretion of the President of India in the matter of such
                          serious issue of cancellation of notification issued by the
                          President of India itself. Therefore, the contention of the
                          petitioners that the recommendation is binding upon the
                          President of India is rejected.
</p><p id="p_259">                                 29. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that
                          the order to start the process of election is quasi judicial
                          order as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
                          Mohinder Singh Gill (Supra), therefore, an appropriate
                          hearing should have been given to the petitioner which not
                          having been given even on demand of the petitioner. In the
                          case of M.S. Gill (Supra), the facts were entirely different.
                          That was the case of booth capturing and order was passed
                          by the Election Commission for re-poll and not for a new
                          election, which clearly indicated by the Supreme Court in
                          paragraph 13, wherein it has been specifically made clear
                          that the order of Election Commission was for re-poll and
                          fresh poll and not a new election. The Election Commission
                          has power to countermand the election under Section 58 A
                          sub-section 2 of Clause (b) but <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_243">Section 58A</a> has no
                          application to the facts in the case in hand and learned
                          counsel for the petitioner also rightly submitted that there
                          was none of the contingency as given under Section 58 A
http://www.judis.nic.in   sub-section 2 of Clause (b) and, therefore, no order
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">                                                       114</span>

                          countermanding could have been passed by the Election
                          Commission. The Election Commission also has power to
                          order for adjournment of poll and re-poll. All those powers
                          may be exercised under Statutory provisions of R.P. Act,
                          1951 and if some of those orders, may be quasi judicial, but
                          it could not be held that every order of the Election
                          Commission is quasi judicial order, if it relates to the
                          Election and particularly when Election Commission is
                          addressing to President of India in such matter. As we have
                          noticed that the recommendation of Election commission to
                          the President of India has not been under any specific
                          provision of the Act of 1951 or but is specific provision of
                          the Constitution of India i.e. <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_244">Article 324</a>, which cast duty
                          upon the Election Commission to conduct the election,
                          obviously with utmost fairness and purity. The power to
                          superintendence, direction and control includes to take
                          appropriate steps by the Election Commission and it is not
                          necessary for the Election Commission to merely order for
                          re-poll in a case when allegation of corrupt practice in
                          entire process of election has been substantiated by the
                          evidence and Election Commission satisfied that without
                          cancellation of entire election there cannot be free and fair
                          election for the post of the Rajya Sabha then this decision is
                          under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_245">Article 324</a> of the Constitution of India and is taken in
                          administrative and supervisory jurisdiction of the Election
                          Commission for which no opportunity of hearing can be
                          demanded by anybody. We may further expand the issue of
                          principles of natural justice and of requirement of hearing.
                          The principle of natural justice require opportunity of
                          hearing to the parties who may be effected by the decision
                          of the authority. If any election is cancelled by the Election
                          Commission who is the effecting party? Only candidate?
                          Whether public is not the affected party? Whether the
                          Election Commission should hear the candidates only in a
                          matter where there is allegation of corruption at highest
                          possible extent and persons who are to be represented by
                          candidate selected in such polluted election are not
                          required to be heard and take decision after hearing only
                          candidates who may satisfy the authority only ex-parte, in
                          absence of public hearing?

                          prevented from filing nomination papers. The resultant

                          i.e., on 8-11-1994. In a situation where candidates
                          representing political parties are prevented from filing
                          nomination papers and if the election process is allowed to

                          free and fair? And whether the results of such an election
                          would truly reflect the will of the people of that particular
                          constituency This is a million dollar question. When a
                          candidate of a political party is prevented from filing his
                          nomination by certain elements, would the gullible
                          electorate of 163-Gorantla Assembly Constituency be free
                          to exercise their franchise. It is not the case that the
                          electorate enmasse exercise their franchise in favour of one
                          candidate only. It is immaterial to which party a candidate
                          belong to. But the electorates are handicapped in choosing
                          a candidate of their choice when some candidates are
                          whisked away from the arena of contest. In this view of the
                          matter, what is to be seen is whether purity in electoral
                          process could be achieved. When candidates are abducted
                          and prevented from filing nominations, could it be
                          presumed that ordinary voter would be free to exercise his

                          based on certain grounds, its validity must be judged by the
                          reasons so mentioned ,and cannot be supplemented by fresh
                          reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise. The
                          argument advanced by Sri S. Ramachandra Rao counsel for
                          the petitioner in W.P. No. 20130/94 and Sri Seshagiri Rao,
                          learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
                          petitioner's counsel Sri C. Kodanda Ram in W.P. No.
                          20283/94 that the first respondent has acted arbitrarily and
                          with a mala fide intention in canvassing for the cause of a
                          particular political party is not acceptable to; this Court.
                          The action of the first respondent in recommending the
                          rescission of election process in 163-Gorantla Assembly
                          Constituency cannot be looked in isolation in respect of a
                          particular, political party's point of view, but has to be
                          looked in the overall facts and circumstances of the case. In
                          the given circumstances, the first respondent felt that the
                          purity of the election process has been irretrievably sullied
                          in 163-Gorantla Assembly Constituency and if the election
http://www.judis.nic.in   process is allowed to be completed in the said constituency,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                                                       122</span>

                          it cannot reflect the true choice of the electorate of the
                          Constituency. Therefore, no mala fides could be attributed
                          to the first respondent inasmuch as he recommended
                          rescission of the election process in 163-Gorantla Assembly
                          Constituency as the circumstances are not conducive to
                          allow the election process in the said constituency. After
                          all, the first respondent did not rescind the election process
                          in 163-Gorantla Assembly Constituency once for all. It is
                          made clear in the notification issued by the Governor of
                          Andhra Pradesh, dated 11-11-1994 that election process in
                          the said constituency would be commenced anew.
                          Therefore, I see no force in the contention of Sri S.
                          Ramachandra Rao, learned counsel for the petitioner in
                          W.P. No. 20130/94 that the electorate of 163-Gorantla
                          Assembly Constituency are denied from exercising their
                          franchise. The rescission of election process in the said
                          constituency is not without valid reasons inasmuch as a
                          candidate of a political party was abducted and prevented
                          from filing his nomination papers. The first respondent felt
                          that in the given circumstances, it is not conducive to allow
                          the election process to go on as. the atmosphere is vitiated
                          and the election if allowed to continue, would not reflect
                          the true choice of the electorate. In all probability, election
                          process to 163-Gorantla Assembly Constituency, is deferred
                          for the time being in view of the volatile situation prevelant
                          in the said Assembly constituency.

                          provided for. Legislators are not prophets but pragmatists.
                          So it is that the Constitution has made comprehensive
                          provision in Art.'324 to take care of surprise situations. That
                          power itself has to be exercised, not mindlessly nor mala
                          fide, not arbitrarily nor with partiality but in keeping with
                          the guidelines of the rule of law and not stultifying the
                          Presidential notification nor existing legislation. More is not
                          necessary to specify; less is insufficient to leave unsaid.
                          <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_286">Article 324</a> of the Constitution of India, to my mind,
                          operates in areas left unoccupied by legislation and the
                          words 'superintendence, direction and control' as well as
                          'conduct of all elections' are the broadest terms. When a
                          high functionary like the Election Commissioner is vested
http://www.judis.nic.in   with wide powers, the law expects him to act fairly and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                                                       123</span>

                          and fair elections expeditiously. Moreover, discretion vested
                          in a high functionary may be reasonably trusted to be used
                          properly, not perversely. If it is misused, certainly the Court
                          has power to strike down the act.

                          Denning, which are instructive :
</p><p id="p_271">                          'Law does not stand still. It moves continually. Once this is
                          recognised, then the task of the Judge is put on a higher
                          plane. He must consciously seek to mould the law so as to
                          serve the needs of the time, must not be a mere mechanic,
                          a mere working mason, laying brick on brick, without
                          thought to the overall design. He must be an architect-
                          thinking of the structure as a whole building for society a
                          system of law which is strong, durable and just. It is on his
                          work that civilised society itself depends.'
</p><p id="p_272">                                 29. The words of Lord Denning are so inspiring and
                          pragmatic. The Courts are to be pragmatic in adjudicating a
                          dispute by consciously seeking to mould the law so as to
                          serve the needs of the time.
</p><p id="p_273">                                 30. The facts and circumstances of the case on
                          record, undoubtedly, disclose that the purity of election
                          process was irretrievably sullied in 163-Gorantla Assembly
                          Constituency at the threshold itself as a candidate of a
                          political party was abducted and prevented from filing his
                          nomination papers. Therefore, in my view, the action of the
                          first respondent in recommending the rescission of election
                          notification dated 1-11-1994 insofar as.it relates to 163-
                          Gorantla Assembly Constituency cannot be held to be
                          exercising of power arbitrarily and with a mala fide

                          referred to in para 11, highlighting that search warrants
                          were issued based on information on record and the search

                          voters. The report mentions that due to the presence of a
                          large crowd which had entered the premises and prevented
                          any further activity of the search team, the proceedings
                          were concluded at 10:50 a.m. on 30.03.2019.

                          searched from 8:00 a.m. onwards on 30lh of March, 2019 as
                          the search teams had not been allowed to enter early in the
                          morning by the security personnel purportedly due to the
                          presence of ladies in the girls’ hostel. The search team
                          observed that evidently there was prior rummaging of the
                          premises and removal of material including the control
                          panel of the CCTV as well as the hard disks of the
                          computers. Further discreet surveillance resulted in the
                          confirmation that a large amount of cash and other
                          incriminating material had indeed been shifted out of the
                          college premises while the teams were being denied entry.

                          intelligence gathered during the discreet surveillance,
                          certain premises of close associates of the candidate Shri
                          Kathir Anand and their relatives were identified and fresh
                          searches u/s 132 of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_332">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961, at Katapadi

                          totalling Rs. 11.48 Cr., kept in cartons, gunny bags, plastic
                          bags etc. was found from the residence of one Sh.

                          DMK functionary. The cash found in bags was further packed
                          in plastic packets on which computer-generated labels were
                          pasted. The labels contain the name of the assembly

                          amount at the rate of Rs. 200 per vote. The total amount of
                          cash in the plastic packets tallied with the amount written
                          on the label. Most of the currency found was of the
                          denomination of Rs. 200. Only an amount of Rs. 99 lakhs
                          was in the denomination of Rs. 2000 and Rs. 500 and this

                          distribution. In addition, unused labels, loose sheets with
                          details of ward-wise breakup of voters and documents

                    has also considered that how bribery during the elections would affect

                    the purity of the elections. Paragraphs 26, 27 and 28                of the

                    recommendation, dated 14.04.2019, are extracted hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_175">                                  "26. It may be noted that the election law seriously
                           frowns upon acts of ‘bribery’ during elections and those
                           indulging in such acts are visited upon with severe
                           penalties under the law. Bribing any person during
                           elections with the objective of inducing him or any other
                           person to exercise any electoral right or, even inducing
                           or attempting to induce any person to exercise any such
                           right for such consideration, is an electoral offence under
                           <a href="/doc/298814/" id="a_335">section 171B</a> of the Indian Penal Code, and is punishable
                           with imprisonment of either description for a term
                           extending up to one year or, with fine, or with both. Any
                           conviction for the offence of ‘bribery’, even if resulting
                           in the imposition of a very nominal fine, will
                           automatically disqualify the convicted person for a
                           minimum period of six years under <a href="/doc/185912055/" id="a_336">section 8(1)</a> of the
                           Representation of the People Act, 1951. Further, such
                           ‘bribery’ at elections is also a corrupt practice under
                           <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_337">section 123(1)</a> of the Representation of the People Act,
                           1951 which can result in the election of the returned
                           candidate being declared void and the candidate found
                           guilty of commission of such corrupt practice can also be
                           disqualified by the President on the recommendation of
                           the Commission for a further period of six years. The
                           above provisions in the law, making ‘bribery’ an electoral
                           offence and also a corrupt practice, have been made
                           with the manifest object of ensuring purity of the
                           election process. Purity of electoral process has been
                           placed on a higher pedestal than even the secrecy of

                    construed as considered as aberrations and exceptions, but they have

                    also meant bribery or any other acts, as inducement and allurement to

                    authority who has issued the notification to conduct the election can

                    decisions when there is evidence of malpractices committed by

                    Election Commission to act and pass orders even in the absence of a

                    specific provision under the RP Act, 1951. Rescinding a poll or ordering a

                    re-poll for the entire constituency under circumstances, not specifically

                    stated in the legislation, can still be recommended by the Election

                    Commission of India provided, it is necessary for the conduct of a free

                    and fair election and the action/s complained of, are such, which have

                    the effect of affecting the purity in elections. The Hon'ble Supreme

                    Court has time and again held that the words "and the conduct of" has to

                    be given an under interpretation. It is the duty of the Election

<p id="p_358">                          113. A perusal of these materials would show that huge amount of

                    cash was intended to be used to lure voters. The reliance of the Election

                    Commission on paragraph 53 of the judgment of the Hon'ble supreme

                    Court in <a href="/doc/808119/" id="a_358">Ashok Shankar Rao Chawan vs. Madhava Rao Kinhalkar</a>

                    noticed that in elections payment of cash to the electorate is rampant

                    and the Election Commission finds it difficult to control such a menace

                    is not unjustified.
</p>


<p id="p_359">                          114. On the materials placed before the Election Commission, it

                    cannot be said that the Election Commission was not justified in

                    recommending to rescind the notification already issued for 8-Vellore

                    Parliamentary Constituency.
</p>


<p id="p_360">                          115. The fact that the candidate against whom allegation of

                    corrupt practice or bribery is made, if found guilty will be disqualified

                    from contesting elections for a period of six years from his release and

                    that even if he is elected, his election will be set aside is no answer to

                    permit an election to be conducted if the purity of election is affected.
</p>
<p id="p_361">                    To repeat menace of luring voters by paying money has to be dealt with

                    iron hands. As stated earlier it is not the number of candidates who

                    have indulged in giving money to the voters to be seen, but the overall

                    effect on the election process has to be considered. Elections cannot be

                    permitted to be conducted when there is evidence that huge amount of

                    cash kept for distribution to the voters. The report of the Joint Director

                    of Income Tax (Inv.) Unit I, would state that money has been

                    distributed. Election therefore cannot be permitted to be conducted in

                    such an vitiated atmosphere.

                    raise the said plea? It is open for an electorate/candidate to challenge

                    in the Election Petition? Whether the Election Commission, can consider

                    the same, during the period between the date of notification issued

                    under Section 14(2) of the RP Act, 1951, till results are declared keeping

                    in mind, what the Constitution of India, mandates Election Commission

                    powers on the Election Commission of India, to consider all the

                    case may be, to question corrupt practice of a candidate, by way of a

                    Election Petition is altogether different from Election Commission of

                    cannot be ignored by courts, to arrive at a conclusion that the Election

                    arrive at any decision, either subjective or objective, based on
