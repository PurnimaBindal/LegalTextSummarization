                           Registration, as sought by the defendant, has not been granted, as the
                          defendant&#x27;s application has been opposed by the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_9">                          10.   One of the protestations of the plaintiff, in the present plaint, is
                          that the package, in which the defendant is marketing its product, uses
                          a blue background. This, according to the plaintiff, is a deliberate
                          departure from the mark which the defendant sought to register (which
                          has a black background), so as to achieve proximity between the
                          defendant&#x27;s mark and the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademarks.            The
                          defendant, thus alleges the plaintiff, wants to ―come as close‖ to the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s mark as possible.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                          11.   According to the plaintiff, the mark ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖ was
                          coined and adopted by the plaintiff&#x27;s predecessors in 1973. It is
                          claimed that the mark was initially registered in favour of Seagram,
                          Canada in the same year, whereafter it passed various hands till, under
                          Deed of Assignment dated 27th June, 2018, the plaintiff succeeded the
                          proprietorship of the mark. In India, it is claimed that, IMFL has been
                          sold by the plaintiff&#x27;s predecessors since 1995.

                          uninterrupted use, become indelibly associated with the plaintiff and
                          have, thus, become source identifiers. Both ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖ as

                          and the package in which the bottle is sold, deliberately infringed the

<p id="p_20">                          18.    Apropos ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖, Mr. Hemant Singh submits
                          that the mark was a fancifully structured and coined trademark,
                          registered in favour of the predecessor of the plaintiff on 25th March,
                          1994. There is, therefore, he submits, no dispute regarding priority of
                          user, by the plaintiff, of its marks, vis-à-vis, the impugned ―CASINOS
                          PRIDE‖ mark of the defendant. Mr. Hemant Singh submits that the
                          plaintiff has been using ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖, with ―PRIDE‖ as the
                          distinctive feature thereof, in respect of whisky since 1995. As such,
                          he submits that use of any composite mark by others, with ―PRIDE‖
                          as the second component of the mark would not only infringe the
                          plaintiffs&#x27; ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖ reputation but would also subject
                          the plaintiff to irreparable loss.

</p><p id="p_22">                           19.   Mr. Hemant Singh submits that there is, indeed, no compulsion
                          for anyone to use ―PRIDE‖ as part of its registered mark, as, ―PRIDE‖
                          is not descriptive of alcoholic beverages. The use, by the defendant, of
                          the mark ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ - which, as Mr. Hemant Singh points
                          out, has no etymological meaning, whatsoever, with ―PRIDE‖ as the
                          distinctive part thereof, is clearly with a view to capitalize on the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s goodwill and reputation and deceive consumers into
                          mistaking the product of the defendant with that of the plaintiff or into
                          drawing an association between the two.

                          ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖ and ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ are phonetically
                          similar. He has also questioned the validity of the defendant&#x27;s
                          contention that the expression ―PRIDE‖ is common to the alcoholic
                          beverage trade, stating that no sufficient evidence, to that effect, has
                          been placed on record by the defendant.

                          IMFL. According to Mr. Hemant Singh, the defendant has copied
                          ―PRIDE‖, which is the distinctive part of the mark ―BLENDERS

                          mark since 2nd August, 2017.
</p>

<p id="p_39">                          25.   The defendant, it is submitted, pointed out this fact to the
                          plaintiff in its reply dated 12th December, 2017 filed by way of
                          response to the notice of opposition dated 14th April, 2017 of the
                          plaintiff, while opposing the defendant&#x27;s application dated 19th
                          December, 2016 for registration of the ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ mark. It
                          is pointed out that, in the evidence by way of affidavit filed by the
                          defendant before the Registrar of Trademarks in support of its
                          application, the defendant has claimed continuous and extensive use of
                          the ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ mark since 2nd August, 2017. Invoices in
                          support thereof have also been placed on record.
</p>

<p id="p_40">                          26.   Learned Senior Counsel for the defendant has also invoked
                          Section 17 of the Trademarks Act to contend that the plaintiff cannot
                          claim exclusivity in respect of part of its composite mark
                          ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖. It is sought to be submitted that, in order to
                          overcome this objection, the plaintiff had, in fact, applied on 14 th
                          December, 2020 for registration of the mark ―PRIDE‖, but could not
                          register the mark as an objection was raised by the Registrar of
                          Trademarks on 5th January, 2021 on the ground that the same mark
                          had been earlier registered in respect of similar goods. The present
                          plaint, according to the defendant, is an oblique attempt by the
                          plaintiff to obtain exclusivity in respect of the ―PRIDE‖ mark having
                          failed to obtain registration thereof.

                          any manner, infringed the plaintiff&#x27;s ―BLENDERS PRIDE‖
                          trademark. By adverting to various examples, learned Senior Counsel
                          have sought to contend that the suffix ―PRIDE‖, in the context of
                          alcoholic beverages, has become common to the trade, and is used by
                          several manufacturers. It cannot, therefore, it is submitted, be sought
                          to be contended that ―PRIDE‖ is the dominant part of the plaintiff&#x27;s

                          of the consuming public. No evidence of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark of the
                          ―PRIDE‖ mark having acquired any such secondary meaning is, it is
                          submitted, forthcoming on the record. ―PRIDE‖ is, therefore, submits

                          make out the case of infringement against persons who use ―PRIDE‖
                          as part of their registered trademark in respect of their alcoholic
                          beverages.

                          equally to the plaintiff&#x27;s allegation of infringement, by the defendant,
                          of its ―IMPERIAL BLUE‖ label. The learned Senior Counsel for the
                          defendant submits that there is no similarity between the ―CASINOS
                          PRIDE‖ label of the defendant and the ―IMPERIAL BLUE‖ label of
                          the plaintiff. The manner in which the words ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ are
                          written on the label of the defendant between diagonal golden lines,
                          the shade of blue used on the labels and the arrangement of the
                          features on the labels, it is submitted, are totally different from those
                          used by the plaintiff on its ―IMPERIAL BLUE‖ label. Purveyors of
                          IMFL, it is submitted, are least likely to get confused between the
                          defendant&#x27;s and plaintiff&#x27;s products. In this context, learned Senior
                          Counsel has also highlighted the fact that the plaintiff&#x27;s products are
                          much more expensive than those of the defendant, so that the customer
                          segments, to which the plaintiff and the defendant cater, are also

                          such, learned Senior Counsel submits that the plaintiff cannot seek to
                          make out a case of infringement by combining two marks and alleging
                          that a case of deceptive similarity is made out.        Besides, learned
                          Senior Counsel submits that the defendant&#x27;s label has sufficient added
                          matter, as would disabuse the possibility of any confusion in the mind
                          of the imbibing public, between the products of the defendant and the
                          plaintiff. Learned Senior Counsel emphatically denies any deceptive
                          similarity between the ―IMPERIAL BLUE‖ label of the plaintiff and
                          the ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ label of the defendant. It is submitted that
                          the only similarity between the two labels is the blue colour and, in all
                          other respects, the labels are different. Even the descriptions on the
                          labels, the manner in which the letters are written and all other
                          features, they submit, are distinct from one other.

                          submissions initially advanced by him and further submits that the
                          plea of ―PRIDE‖ being common to the trade would require the

                          ―PRIDE‖, to the knowledge of the plaintiff, without the plaintiff
                          seeking to challenge such registrants. He draws my attention to the
                          fact that the plaintiff has filed a number of legal proceedings, asserting

                          the trade. Injurious association, submits Mr. Hemant Singh, exists
                          where the products are available from the same source, even if the
                          defendant&#x27;s product may not be mistaken for that of the plaintiff, for
                          which purpose he relies on Parle Products12 and B.K. Engineering10.
                          He further cites <a href="/doc/1444734/" id="a_23">William Grant &amp; Sons Ltd v. McDowell &amp; Co. Ltd19</a>
                          to contend that, if the acts of the defendant dilutes the plaintiffs
                          goodwill in its product, the plaintiff is entitled to relief even if there is
                          no confusion.

<p id="p_51">                          35.      Learned Senior Counsel for the defendant has also cited various
                          authorities, essentially for the proposition that no exclusivity could be
                          claimed in the mark ―PRIDE‖, as it is laudatory in nature, and that
                          there is no deceptive similarity between the marks of the plaintiff and
                          the impugned mark of the defendant, to wit, the judgements of the
                          Supreme Court in J.R. Kapoor v. Micronix India20, Khoday

                           thereof.‖ An action for passing off is, therefore, independent of the
                          <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_32">Trade Marks Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_57">                          38.      Several judicial pronouncements have recognised the distinction
                          between infringement and passing off. <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_33">In Satyam Infoway v. Sifynet
                          Solutions Pvt. Ltd31</a> , the Supreme Court noted that an action for
                          passing off is based on the goodwill that the trader has in the trade
                          name, whereas an action for infringement is based on the trader&#x27;s
                          proprietary right in the trade name. An action for passing off is
                          intended, as per the said decision, to preserve the reputation of the
                          plaintiff and to safeguard the public against being deceived into
                          believing the goods of one person to be those of another. The raison
                          d&#x27; etre of passing off is that one cannot carry on one&#x27;s business, or
                          deal with one&#x27;s goods, so as to make the public believe that the
                          business or goods belong to another. It is, therefore, intended as a
                          means of protection against unfair competition.32 Passing off is,
                          therefore, an action for deceit, which seeks to proceed against one who
                          passes off one&#x27;s goods as those of another, whereas an action for
                          infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the proprietor of a
                          registered trade mark, for vindication of his exclusive right to use the
                          trademark in relation to the goods in respect of which it is registered.33


</p><p id="p_58">                          39.      Though an action based on deceit, fraud is not a necessary
                          element to maintain a successful prosecution for passing off if,
                          otherwise, it is clear that the defendant has imitated or adopted the

                          believing the goods of the defendant to be those of the plaintiff.34
                          Passing off, therefore, requires proof of misrepresentation, even if not
                          of intent.35        Though the intent of the defendant is, therefore, not
                          relevant for establishing an allegation of passing off, by the defendant,
                          of its goods or services as those of the plaintiff, the intent may be
                          relevant at the stage of final adjudication, to decide the relief to which
                          the plaintiff would be entitled.36 Passing off may, therefore, be alleged
                          by a claimant who owns sufficient proprietary interest in the goodwill
                          attached to the trade mark or name which is imitated by the defendant,
                          and which is likely to be damaged by the alleged misrepresentation.37
                          Proof of actual damage is, however, not necessary.38

                           so alleging.43 ―Confusion‖ was perhaps most precisely defined by the
                          Supreme Court, in Cadila Health Care33, as meaning the state of mind
                          of a customer who, on seeing a mark, thinks that it differs from the
                          mark on the goods which he has previously bought, but it is doubtful
                          whether the impression is not due to imperfect recollection.
                          Following on this, the ingredients of confusion or deception have been
                          set out in decision after decision. Even so, in Khoday Distilleries21,
                          Amritdhara Pharmacy15 and Cadila Health Care33, the Supreme
                          Court has cautioned that the tests to be applied would depend on the
                          facts of each case and that precedents, in such matters, are valuable
                          only for the tests enunciated therein, and not on facts.

<p id="p_65">                          44.      Khoday Distilleries21 holds that, in assessing deceptive
                          similarity, the look, the sound and the nature of the goods are all
                          relevant considerations.                  Surrounding circumstances are also,
                          according to the said decision, relevant. The question, in each case, is
                          that of first impression.44 This is especially so in the case of phonetic
                          similarity, where the Court must avoid a meticulous comparison of the
                          words, syllable by syllable, and must provide for the effect of careless
                          pronunciation and speech, on the part of the buyer walking into the

                          while trying to recollect whether he has seen that before, has been held
                          in Amritdhara Pharmacy15 and Cadila Health Care33. F. Hoffman-
                          La Roche45 holds that the test is whether the totality of the proposed
                          trademark is likely to cause deception/confusion or mistake in the
                          minds of persons accustomed to the existing trademark (the issue

                          deserved to be registered or not). Amritdhara Pharmacy15 and Cadila
                          Health Care33 also hold that the common part of words forming
                          competing marks would not be decisive and that overall similarity of
                          the composite words is required to be seen, having regard to the

                          refused. Thus, marks which are not distinctive, which are common to
                          the trade, or which are purely descriptive of the goods or services in
                          respect of which they are used, cannot be registered. The proviso to
                          <a href="/doc/520333/" id="a_47">section 9(1)</a>, however, engrafts an exception to this principle, by
                          permitting registration of marks which have acquired a distinctive
                          character owing to longevity of use, or which are ―well-known

                          Marks Act. Thus, it was held, in J.R. Kapoor20 that no exclusivity can
                          be claimed over a descriptive mark, or even over a descriptive part of
                          a mark. The Supreme Court in F. Hoffman-La Roche45 and this
                          Court in Rhizome Distilleries22 held, similarly, that no exclusivity
                          could be claimed over laudatory, generic or common words. The

                                respect of which the marks were used, on the ground that,
                                owing to extensive usage, the latter mark had acquired
                                distinctiveness and a secondary meaning, and was exclusively

                                the former mark was, therefore, it was held, liable to dilute the

                                entitled to registration, as buyers of Scotch whisky were
                                educated and niche, and would not be likely to be confused into
                                believing that ‗Peter Scot&#x27; related to a brand of Scotch whisky.
                                It may be noted, however, that this was not a case of alleged
                                infringement, but was in the nature of an action by the Scotch
                                Whisky Association, opposing the registration of the mark
                                ‗Peter Scot&#x27; on the ground that the market could confuse
                                customers into believing that the product was Scotch whisky.

                                       two marks, i.e. ‗nix&#x27; and ‗tel&#x27; were dissimilar both phonetically
                                      and otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_95">                          51.         It is apparent, from a reading of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_55">Trade Marks Act</a>, that actus
                          reus, and not mens rea alone, is necessary to constitute a tort of
                          infringement.            Equally does this principle apply to passing off.
                          Deceptive - or, at the very least, confusing - similarity is the sine qua
                          non both for infringement and passing off.                Absent confusion or
                          deception, there can, quite obviously, be neither infringement nor
                          passing off.
</p>

<p id="p_96">                          52.         Nonetheless, two important principles, which do not emanate
                          directly from the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_56">Trade Marks Act</a> but are obviously enunciated in
                          furtherance of its objectives and to ensure its proper implementation,
                          have evolved over a period of time. These are that (i) where there is
                          clear imitation with an intent to deceive, the Court must not bend
                          backwards to presume that the intent is not successful, and (ii) where
                          there is intent to deceive, the Court must pay greater attention to the
                          similarities between the competing marks, and avoid searching,
                          instead, for dissimilarities. The former owes itself to the exhortation
                          of Lord Lindley, LJ in <a href="/doc/30560910/" id="a_57">Slazenger &amp; Sons v. Feltham &amp; Co</a>.62 and the

                          the plaintiff that the defendant&#x27;s mark ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; infringes
                          the plaintiffs ‗BLENDERS PRIDE&#x27; registered word mark, there is

                          nature, apparently intended to signify the pride that the blenders would
                          have in their product. That apart, it is a word of common usage, and

                          whisky.

<p id="p_102">                          57.   That being so, any claim for exclusivity over the ‗PRIDE&#x27; part
                          of the ‗BLENDERS PRIDE&#x27; marks would be hit by <a href="/doc/139511/" id="a_58">Section 17(1)</a> as
                          well as 17(2)(b) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_59">Trade Marks Act</a>. The right of the plaintiff,
                          under <a href="/doc/139511/" id="a_60">Section 17(1)</a> would be to the ‗BLENDERS PRIDE&#x27; mark as a
                          whole. Any claim to exclusivity over the ‗PRIDE&#x27; part of the mark
                          would be hit by <a href="/doc/1737244/" id="a_61">Section 17(2)(b)</a>, as it is not distinctive in nature.
</p>

<p id="p_103">                          58.   The law, as contained in the judicial authorities cited supra,
                          permits a departure from this principle only where the part of the
                          mark, in respect of which exclusivity is being claimed, is the dominant
                          part of the mark. Though Mr. Hemant Singh has sought to contend
                          that ‗PRIDE&#x27; does constitute the dominant part of the ‗BLENDERS
                          PRIDE&#x27; mark, the contention is not easy to accept. The plaintiff has
                          not placed any material on record which could lead to a prima facie
                          conclusion that, over a period of time, the public has indelibly come to
                          associate the ‗PRIDE&#x27; suffix with the plaintiff&#x27;s product. The test of
                          discerning the dominant part in a mark is, essentially, a ‗plain glance&#x27;
                          test. At a plain glance, if one part of the mark stands out over the
                          others, it would constitute the dominant part of the mark. That, again,
                          has to be assessed from the perspective of the man in the street, who
                          intends to purchase the product, or avail the service. Else, if one part
                          of the composite mark has, by dint of longevity of usage, become
                          identified with the plaintiff, it could be treated as the dominant part of
                          the mark. To apply the ‗dominant part&#x27; test and, thereby, overcome

                          a registered mark, the Court must be able, definitively, to come to a
                          conclusion that, in the perception of the customer of the goods, or the
                          person availing the service, one part of the mark would stand out from

                          judge, and the matter must, ultimately, rest with the dispassionate
                          appreciation of the judge herself, or himself.
</p>

<p id="p_104">                          59.   ‗PRIDE&#x27; being a plainly generic, commonplace and laudatory
                          expression in the ‗BLENDERS PRIDE&#x27; mark, one would be inclined,
                          rather, to treat the initial the ‗BLENDERS&#x27; part of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark
                          as the dominant part thereof, if at all. I say ―if at all‖ because it is also
                          apparent that, even as a whole, ‗BLENDERS PRIDE&#x27; is purely
                          descriptive of the plaintiff&#x27;s product, which is blended whisky.
</p>

<p id="p_105">                          60.   For this reason, I am also unable to accept the submission, of
                          Mr Hemant Singh, that the only purpose for anyone to use ‗PRIDE&#x27; as
                          a part of her, or his, mark, in respect of whisky, can be to imitate the
                          plaintiff, and capitalize on the plaintiff&#x27;s goodwill. ‗PRIDE&#x27; being a
                          purely laudatory expression, the desire of any manufacturer, of any
                          product, to use ‗PRIDE&#x27; as a part of the trade name of the product is
                          perfectly understandable, and the plaintiff just happens, in my opinion,
                          to be one such manufacturer. It is clearly not open to the plaintiff to
                          arrogate, to itself, all rights to use ‗PRIDE&#x27; as a part of its brand name,

                          ‗CASINOS&#x27; parts of the plaintiffs and the defendant&#x27;s marks. No case

                          of the defendant. This is obvious when the marks are viewed plainly.
                          Indeed, Mr. Hemant Singh did not even seek to argue device mark
                          infringement, insofar as the defendant&#x27;s ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; mark was

                           Infringement qua IMPERIAL BLUE marks


</p><p id="p_111">                          65.   Even less convincing is the contention of Mr. Hemant Singh
                          that the defendant&#x27;s ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; bottle, label or packaging
                          infringes the plaintiffs ‗IMPERIAL BLUE&#x27; registered marks.
</p>

<p id="p_112">                          66.   The plaintiff does not possess any registration in respect of the
                          colours used in its ‗IMPERIAL BLUE&#x27; mark, or in any individual part
                          of the design, including the dome shape.          ―Mark‖ is defined, in
                          <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_63">Section 2</a> (m) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_64">Trade Marks Act</a> as including ―a device, brand,
                          heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of
                          goods, packaging or combination of colours or any combination
                          thereof‖. It was open, therefore, to the plaintiff, to seek registration in
                          respect of the combination of colours used in its label, or for the shape
                          of its bottle. It has not done so. What it has obtained are registrations
                          of the label in full, and the labelled bottle, as individual device marks.
                          Any claim to exclusivity in respect of a part of such device marks
                          may, therefore, again infract <a href="/doc/803952/" id="a_65">Section 17(2)</a>, as well as the law
                          regarding ‗anti-dissection&#x27;, as there is precious little for the Court to
                          hold, even prima facie, that the individual elements of the plaintiffs
                          registered marks, such as the blue colour, the golden dome, or the
                          arrangement of letters on the label, or even the shape of the bottle,
                          have acquired secondary meaning over a period of time, or have
                          become indelibly associated with the plaintiffs ‗IMPERIAL BLUE&#x27;

                          the plaintiff&#x27;s mark, such as the blue colour or the golden dome

                          individual parts have indelibly come to be associated with the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s product.

<p id="p_114">                          68.   Viewed thus, it cannot be said, prima facie, that the defendant&#x27;s
                          mark infringes the plaintiffs. For one, the name of the product, which
                          figures prominently on the two labels, are entirely different, with the
                          plaintiffs being ‗IMPERIAL BLUE&#x27; and the defendants ‗CASINOS
                          PRIDE&#x27;. The name figures prominently on the label, and is by itself
                          sufficient to hold that the labels of the plaintiff and the defendant are
                          clearly distinguishable from one another. Besides, the arrangement of
                          letters and overall appearance of the defendant&#x27;s mark can also not be
                          said to be deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff, especially where
                          the names of the products are thus completely dissimilar. Viewed
                          purely as rival trademarks, I am unable, prima facie, to hold that the
                          defendants ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; infringes any of the plaintiffs
                          ‗IMPERIAL BLUE&#x27; marks.

                          or duplicated in the ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ label, so as to outweigh the
                          differences, the distinction between ―IMPERIAL BLUE‖ and
                          ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ might have ceded place. That, however, is not so.
                          Barring the fact that the background of the ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ mark
                          is blue, and a thin golden dome shaped border is also present on the
                          ―CASINOS PRIDE‖ label, no other features of similarity rest between
                          the labels.   Usage, by the defendant of white lettering cannot be
                          regarded, in my view, as copying of an ―essential‖ feature of the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s ―IMPERIAL BLUE‖ mark. Be it noted, at the cost of
                          repetition, that the plaintiff does not hold any separate trademark
                          registration either regarding the blue colour or regarding the golden
                          dome shaped border.

                           with respect to infringement. The Court is not required, therefore,
                          while examining the claim of passing off, to feel itself bound by the
                          specific ingredients of the tort of infringement, as statutorily contained
                          in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_68">Trade Marks Act</a>.
</p>

<p id="p_119">                          73.   A person is not permitted, in law, to pass off his goods, or
                          services, as those of another. If the manner in which the person is
                          marketing his product, especially the label or mark used by the person
                          concerned, indicates an attempt to pass off its goods as those of
                          another, a prima facie case of passing off exists. Though conclusive
                          proof of mens rea, or mala fide, is not essential for succeeding in an
                          action for passing off, a possibility of the defendants goods being
                          regarded, by a customer of average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection, as emanating from the plaintiff&#x27;s stable, must be found to
                          exist. At the Order XXXIX stage, this finding, obviously, need only
                          be prima facie.
</p>

<p id="p_120">                          74.   Infringement is a mark specific tort, whereas passing off is
                          product specific. Relief in an action for infringement is, therefore,
                          aimed at protecting the mark whereas relief in an action for passing off
                          protects the product and the goodwill and reputation commanded by
                          the product. The comparison in an infringement case is, therefore,
                          mark to mark, whereas the comparison, in a case of passing off, is,
                          product to product. So long as sufficient factors are found to exist, as
                          would indicate that the defendant seeks to pass off its product as that
                          of the plaintiff, the tort of passing off stands committed. This act of

                          distinctive trade dress, or by any other means. For this reason, while it
                          is not open, in an action for infringement, to allege that one mark
                          infringes two marks, or vice-versa, it is always open to a plaintiff to
                          show that, by combining distinctive features of different marks of its
                          goods, the defendant is seeking to create an overall picture of
                          association between the products of the defendant and the plaintiff so
                          as to persuade a person of average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection to believe that the defendants&#x27; product emanates from the
                          plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_121">                          75.    When, with this legal position in mind, one views the
                          defendants ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; label, the manner in which it is
                          employed, and the manner in which the product is sold, it does appear,
                          prima facie, that the defendant is seeking to create an association, in
                          the mind of a customer of its product, with the plaintiff.            The
                          coincidences are just too many. The defendant has used the mark
                          ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; while, incidentally, the mark of the plaintiff is
                          ‗BLENDERS PRIDE&#x27;. Again incidentally, the mark is used in the
                          form of white colours on a blue background, similar to the colour
                          combination in which the plaintiff packages and markets its
                          IMPERIAL BLUE&#x27; whisky.            Again, incidentally, the defendant&#x27;s
                          product also contains a golden dome shaped design, which is present
                          on the plaintiff&#x27;s label. The shape of the defendant&#x27;s bottle is identical
                          to that of the plaintiff. Though, viewed individually, these likenesses
                          may not suffice to justify a conclusion even prima facie of
                          infringement, by the defendant&#x27;s ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; marks, as used

                          ‗IMPERIAL BLUE&#x27; marks of the plaintiff to create an overall label
                          and packaging which, in the mind of a customer of average
                          intelligence and imperfect recollection, who has earlier in point of
                          time purchased the plaintiffs ‗BLENDERS PRIDE&#x27; and ‗IMPERIAL
                          BLUE&#x27; beverages, and is aware thereof, is perilously likely to invite

                          plaintiff. Applying Munday63, in view of the apparent dishonest intent
                          of the defendant, the similarities between the defendant&#x27;s and the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s labels would have to be accorded precedence over the
                          dissimilarities. The intent of the defendant, therefore, to pass off its
                          ‗CASINOS PRIDE&#x27; whisky as that of the plaintiff appears, prima
                          facie, to be apparent.
