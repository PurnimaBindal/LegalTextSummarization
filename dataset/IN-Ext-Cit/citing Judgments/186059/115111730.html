</p><p id="p_3">1.    Strange are the ways of love. Neither the love of husband nor
the affection of four minor children could put a check on the intense
love of appellant Baljeet Kaur for Surender Singh, the deceased. Even
the sanctions of the society or its reaction to such relationship or what
people will say or think and how her children would face their friends,
adverse effect on the marriage prospects of her two grown-up
daughters, nothing could stop the appellant to desert her family so that
she could live only for and with Surender Singh (deceased).
</p><p id="p_4">2.    The appellant before us was settled in her matrimonial home
consisting of her husband and four grown up children, before falling in

 love with Surender Singh, who was not only unmarried but much
younger to her. The deceased Surender Singh was brother of her
Nandoi. The close relationship and family ties provided her the
opportunity to meet him and this relationship nurtured during their
frequent trips to Singapore and other foreign countries visited by them
to import goods to India for sale. When the 'love' between the two
became known to the family members of both the sides, it met with
opposition. At that stage, she preferred to walk out and break all
family ties to live separately so that there is no surveillance on them
and they could live for each other in their own world.
</p><p id="p_5">3.    However, the destiny had something else in store for them. The
appellant is before us for committing the murder of the person in
whose love she just walked out of the marriage and left everything.
Not only that, she also filed a divorce petition to clear her way to
marry the deceased. What an irony! Surender Singh met his end at the
hands of the lady who loved him more than anyone else in the world.
The rage appeared to be such that it was not satisfied by just killing.
She, despite being follower of 'Sikh' religion and the deceased also a
'Sikh', shaved his head and beard and cut the body into pieces. None
could anticipate such a tragic end of this love story.
</p><p id="p_6">4.    After being convicted for committing the murder of Surender
Singh and destruction of evidence, she is before us challenging her
conviction under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_1">Section 302</a>/<a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_2">201</a> IPC and the sentence awarded to her
by the Trial Court thereunder.

offence punishable under Sec.201 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_6">IPC</a>
</p><p id="p_8">6.    The prosecution case unfolds with recording of DD No.4A
dated 13.08.1988 at Police Station Shalimar Bagh, Delhi. On that day,
Shri Joginder Singh, cousin of the deceased informed the police that
he along with his cousin Inder Vir Singh had visited the Flat No.127,
Income Tax Colony in search of Surender Singh. Smt. Baljeet Kaur
present in that flat informed about presence of parts of human body in
that flat which he had come to inform, for necessary action.
</p><p id="p_9">7.    The DD entry was handed over to Inspector Jagjit Singh, SHO,
who along with staff made departure entry in the official vehicle
No.DBL 8693. When the SHO along with staff reached the flat of
Baljeet Kaur, he met Inder Vir Singh and Baljeet Kaur and presence of
two human hands in the kitchen was also noticed, which were
identified by Inder Vir Singh to be that of his brother Surender Singh.
Foul smell was emitting from the flat. Inder Vir Singh made statement
(Ex.PW-6/B) stating about the illicit relations between his brother
Surender Singh and Baljeet Kaur for about four years prior to that and
that his brother left home on 10.08.1988 at about 6 PM informing that

 he was visiting Baljeet Kaur at her house in Pitam Pura and would
return by next day. When he failed to return, he went along with his
cousin Joginder Singh in search of Surender Singh. On opening of the
door by Baljeet Kaur, foul smell was noticed and on enquiry by him
about his brother Surender Singh, she informed that Surender Singh
had killed and cut into pieces some person in her absence and thrown
the pieces in the house and left for some unknown place. She also
informed that she herself was disturbed and sought his help.
Thereafter, he sent Joginder Singh to inform the police and waited for
arrival of police at the place. After arrival of the police on noticing the
two human hands, one of which was clearly visible from the bag in
which the hands were kept. He identified them to be of his brother
Surender Singh.

were also recovered from a trunk, but the legs were missing. The
matter was investigated and crime team was also called. Spot was got

found to be right leg. After making endorsement to the effect that
somebody has been murdered and in order to destroy the evidence, the
legs have been thrown there, the endorsement on DD Ex.PW13/A was

Flat No.127, Income Tax Colony in possession of Baljeet Kaur, the
two legs recovered by the police of Police Station Patel Nagar along
with remaining pieces of bodies recovered from 127, Income Tax
Colony were sent for post mortem which was conducted by PW-3 Dr.
Bharat Singh and as per postmortem report Ex.PW3/A, the cause of
death has been given as 'asphyxia due to strangulation' and it was also
confirmed that two legs recovered were the part of the same body.
</p><p id="p_13">11.   The appellant Baljeet Kaur was interrogated and arrested by the
police in this case from the same flat. The police also recovered razor,
scissor, knife, churi etc. from the flat which were used by her to
remove hair from the head and face etc. of the deceased Surender
Singh as well as to cut the body parts into pieces and to destroy the
same. During the course of investigation, the Appellant Baljeet Kaur

installation of VCP the said Sardarji was present at the flat, but at the
time of taking back the VCP only the appellant Baljeet Kaur was

Mrs. Malivarghese, PW-5 Virender Singh, PW-2 Surinder Kumar

IPC was framed, the appellant entered the plea of not guilty and
claimed trial.
</p><p id="p_16">13.   Besides various exhibits, 37 witnesses were examined by the
prosecution in order to prove the guilt of the appellant. She was
examined under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_15">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. to enable her to explain the
circumstances appearing against her. Despite detailed statement under
<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_16">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., she preferred to give 10 typed pages in reply to
the last question put to her i.e. anything else she has to say, submitting
that the same be read as answer to this question. She has also
examined DW-1 Jaswinder Singh to prove that he met the deceased

circumstances established by prosecution to base her conviction,

deceased Surender Singh consisting of his arms, his
clean shave head and other parts of his body were
recovered from the flat of the accused;
</p><p id="p_32">17) that the parts of human body were identified by
PW Indervir Singh from his face and from his arms

the deceased had gone was found parked on the ground
floor in a garage and the keys Ex. P23/1 to 3 were

 had pointed out the place where she had thrown the
burnt clothes/ashes and the hair of deceased;
</p><p id="p_35">20) that the accused had pointed out the place at West
Patel Nagar where she had thrown away the legs of
deceased in polythene cover;
</p><p id="p_36">21) that the accused had got recovered the portable
T.V. and the gold ornaments consisting of gold kara and
two rings from the house of her friend Mrs. Jasbir Kaur,
situated at 25/60 West Patel Nagar;
</p><p id="p_37">22) that the said portable T.V. and the gold kara and
two rings were identified by PW10 Indervir Singh to be
belonging to his brother Surender Singh;
</p><p id="p_38">23) that the post-mortem on all the parts of human
body was conducted by PW3 Dr. Bharat Singh, who had
opined that the death of deceased Surender Singh was
caused by strangulation and his body was cut into pieces
after his death;

clothes of the accused consisting of lady shirt, chunnies
and salwar recovered from her flat and the human blood
of B-group was also found on the trunk in which the parts
of the body of deceased Surender Singh were found.
</p><p id="p_40">       So, from the said chain of circumstances proved by
the prosecution, the only inference which can be drawn is
that it was the accused and none-else, who had
committed the heinous offence of murdering the deceased
and then cutting his body into pieces. In my opinion, the
chain of evidence against accused is so complete that it
only leads to the guilt of accused and only conclusion
can be drawn from the above preponderance of the
circumstances brought on record by the prosecution that
within all human probability this ghastly act must have
been committed by the accused.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">   CRL.A. 79/1998                          Page 10 of 36</span>
<p id="p_41"> 15.   Mr. Sanjay Suri, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
Appellant has submitted that the prosecution case is based on
circumstantial and last seen evidence and the prosecution has
miserably failed to prove either of the two. It has been submitted that
in respect of last seen evidence, the prosecution examined PW-7 and
PW-20 and both of them stated that they were maintaining record of
providing VCPs on hire basis, which could have been a clinching
evidence in this matter. Non-seizure of the same is fatal to the case of
the prosecution. Reason for them to depose against the appellant was
pressure of the police. Regarding the testimony of Inder Vir Singh and
Joginder Singh, it has been submitted that Surender Singh (deceased)
was the youngest and his elder brother Harbans Singh had already
expired and with a view to grab the entire business and property,
Surender Singh was killed and the appellant was falsely implicated in
this case to settle the score. The family of Surender Singh had a
grudge against her for the reason that Surender Singh used to visit her
frequently. It has been further submitted that there is no evidence of
illicit relationship between the appellant and the deceased.
</p><p id="p_42">16.   On behalf of the appellant, it has been further contended that the
entire police record is manipulated to suit the design of Inder Vir
Singh to falsely implicate the appellant in this case. It was not on 13 th
that the appellant came to know about lying of pieces of human body
parts at the flat of Baljit Kaur. PW-5 Virender Sigh is a witness to the
fact that on the night of 12.8.1988 itself on getting foul smell coming
from the flat of the appellant, seeing her concerned, he along with his
bhabhi, mother and the appellant visited Police Post Pitam Pura and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 11 of 36</span>
 met SI Reval Singh and informed him about the same. The police
visited the spot in the night itself. The appellant was not having the
key, hence the door was broken open and thereafter the pieces of
human body were detected in the flat. He has further deposed that on
the night intervening 12/13th August, the police was on job which fact
is further proved from the statement of PW-28 Sardar Waryam Singh -
husband of the appellant that he got the call from the SHO early in the
morning enquiring about the whereabouts of Baljeet Kaur and the
police visited him along with Baljeet Kaur in the early morning itself.
The testimony of PW-19 Jasbir Kaur also established that she was
with the police from early morning of 13th August throughout the day
and in these circumstances statements of PW-19 Jasbir Kaur and PW-
28 Sardar Waryam Singh prove that the police was already in action
since the night of 12th August itself. So, whatever documents were
prepared by the police on the morning of 13th August, 1988 have to be
disbelieved. It has also been contended that the crime scene was got
photographed but the photographs did not reveal the presence of razor,
knife, churi, scissor etc. which is sufficient to presume that these
things were planted later on to falsely implicate the appellant in this
case at the behest of brother of the deceased.
</p><p id="p_43">17.   He has further submitted that the credibility of the defence
witnesses have to be treated at par with that of the prosecution
witnesses and from the testimony of DW-1, while presence of
Surender Singh on 10.08.1988 at Palam Airport is established, the
testimony of DW-2 Joginder Singh is sufficient to prove that the
appellant was staying with them during the period from 10 th August to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">         CRL.A. 79/1998                           Page 12 of 36</span>
 12th August. In these circumstances, there was neither any question of
Surender Singh visiting the flat of the appellant on 10 th August in the
evening nor the question of installation of any VCP on hire basis by
PW-7 and PW-20 at that flat. It has also been emphasized that from
the statement of SI Ravel Singh, who was the In-charge of PP Pitam
Pura as well as the statement of crime team that information was
received from P.P Pitam Pura, it can be inferred that everything was
happening at PP Pitam Pura and SI Ravel Singh, who was informed
about foul smell being emitting from the flat of the appellant came to
know of everything during that night itself, but for the reason known
to the prosecution, they have shown the information being given to
P.S. Shalimar Bagh and investigation being conducted by Inspector
PW-25 Jagjit Singh, the SHO, which is falsified from the statement of
SI Ravel Singh (PW-23). It has been contended that Inspector Jagjit
Singh expired during trial without his statement being completed and
his incomplete statement cannot be read in evidence, so SI Om
Prakash was examined by the prosecution twice; once in his own
capacity and secondly after the death of Inspector Jagjit Singh. It has
also been pointed out that it has come in the statement of PW Inder
Vir Singh that on 12th he checked the RML Hospital to find out the
whereabouts of his brother Surender Singh. He has also stated that
Surender Singh left home on 10.08.1988 for meeting the appellant and
if it was so then where was the need to check Surender Singh in RML
Hospital instead of checking at the house of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_44">18.   It has been strongly contended that as per prosecution, the
appellant was having illicit relationship with the deceased. If it was so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 13 of 36</span>
 then she had absolutely no motive to commit the murder of a person
with whom she was in love and for whom she deserted her husband
and children. While submitting that the nature of 'last seen' and
circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution is very weak,
stress was laid on absence of motive for the appellant to commit the
alleged offence of murder. It has been further submitted that Scooter
bearing registration No. DHQ-4810 claimed to have been owned by
the deceased Surender Singh and its keys recovered from the flat of
the appellant also could not be proved, as it has come on record that
the scooter could not be started with the key Ex.PW-23/1 and there is
no evidence on record to connect the appellant either with the key or
with the scooter.
</p><p id="p_45">19.   Learned APP for the State, supporting the impugned judgment,
submitted that this is a case based on last seen and circumstantial
evidence, which have been proved by the prosecution beyond
reasonable doubt to the extent that all the circumstances proved
against the appellant are inconsistent with hypothesis of her innocence
and consistent with her guilt.
</p><p id="p_46">20.   This case is based on 'last seen' and circumstantial evidence.
When a case rests on such evidence, such evidence must satisfy the
following conditions :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (i)    The circumstances from which an inference of
      guilt is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly
      established;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      (ii) Those circumstances should be of a definite
      tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the
      accused;

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (iii) The circumstances, taken cumulatively, should
      form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the
      conclusion that within all human probability the crime
      was committed by the accused and none else; and

      conviction must be complete and incapable of
      explanation of any other hypothesis than that of guilt of
      the accused and such evidence should not only be
      consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be
      inconsistent with his innocence.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">21.   Now the question arises, whether the evidence adduced by the
prosecution satisfies the above conditions, for which we have to look
into each and every circumstance leading to death of Surender Singh.
Recovery of body parts:
</p><p id="p_48">22.   It is not in dispute that the appellant alone was occupying the
flat No.127, Income Tax Colony, allotted to PW-27 Ramji Lal, a Govt.
employee and let out to her through PW-5 Virender Singh. Recovery
of body parts from that flat is not only proved from the photographs,
but undisputedly the appellant complained of foul smell being
emitting from her flat and the matter was reported to the police. The
only dispute is as to whether or not it was done on the night
intervening 12th/13th August, 1988. From the testimony of PW-10
Inder Vir Singh and PW-11 Joginder Singh, it has been proved by the
prosecution that parts of the body were recovered from the kitchen
(except legs) as well as from the trunk which were identified by PW-
10 to be that of his brother Surender Singh. Recovery of body parts
from the kitchen of the appellant on 13th August has also been proved
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">         CRL.A. 79/1998                          Page 15 of 36</span>
 by the police officials, who reached the spot after being informed. The
spot has also been got photographed and recovery of parts of body of
Surender Singh on 13th August except legs stands duly proved from
the flat of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_49">23.    From the testimonies of PW-4, PW-18 (public witnesses), PW-
13 ASI Pooran Singh and PW-9 SHO Vijay Pal Singh of PS Patel
Nagar, it stands proved that on getting information from the public
witnesses regarding lying of human legs they visited the spot and
found human legs lying at some distance from each other.
Medical evidence;
</p><p id="p_50">24.    The post mortem on the two legs recovered by police persons
from Police Station Patel Nagar on 12th August, 1988 was conducted
by PW-17 Dr. L.T. Ramani and vide his report Ex.PW-17/A he opined
that the pair of limbs were human legs belonging to an adult male and
that the time elapsed between death and postmortem examination was
about 30 hours. After the recovery of remaining parts of the dead
body from the flat of the appellant, the two legs recovered within the
jurisdiction of police station Patel Nagar and the remaining parts were
sent for post mortem which was conducted by Dr. Bharat Singh. In
his detailed report (Ex.PW-3/A), he opined as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">       "Cuts on the legs below the knee joints are of similar
       nature i.e. soft tissues are cut in a sharp manner and
       bones show irregular broken ends. We can fit them on
       these cuts ends of both the legs, those two leg portions
       received earlier on 12.08.88, skin, hair and
       circumferences of the bones are similar."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">The CFSL results Ex. PW25/K and PW25/L prove that blood of group
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">          CRL.A. 79/1998                          Page 16 of 36</span>
 'B' of human origin i.e. of deceased, was found on Ex.18 i.e.
numerous black strands of hair; Ex.20 i.e. fleshy like material
described as skin pieces; Ex.21a i.e. one wet dirty cloth piece having
stains; Ex.21b i.e. two polythene bags stained with brown stains at
places; and Ex.22 i.e. brown gauge cloth piece.
</p><p id="p_52">'Last seen'
</p><p id="p_53">25.   In this case the prosecution has examined PW-7 Sanjeev
Kumar, an employee of Video Hut, who had gone to install the VCP at
the flat of the appellant as per the order placed for the same by the
appellant and the deceased Surender Singh, who visited their shop on
the evening of 10th August, 1988. He has specifically stated that the
appellant along with the deceased (whose photograph was identified
by him at PS Shalimar Bagh visited their shop and he went to the flat
of the appellant to install the VCP. The channel's knob was not
working properly. It was an imported B/W T.V. He took a thread and
set it in working order. In the meantime Sardarji also arrived with a
plier. At that time, deceased was present in the flat of the appellant.
The cassette was provided by the appellant which he inserted inside
the VCP and started the VCP and TV. At that time when he left,
except the appellant and one Sardarji, there was none else in that flat.
He also stated that he was called at the police station where he was
shown the photograph (Ex.PW-6/A) which he identified to be that of
same Sardarji, who visited their shop with the appellant and at whose
flat he installed the VCP.
</p><p id="p_54">26.   PW-20 Shri Anupam Arya, owner of Video Hut also deposed
about the visit of the appellant with the Sardarji at his shop for hiring a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">          CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 17 of 36</span>
 VCP for night and after some time he sent his employee Sanjeev
(PW-7) for installing the same who returned after installing the same
at about 9 PM. He also stated that on 11.08.1988 at about 8:30 AM, he
visited the said flat to collect the VCP and after about two minutes of
knocking, the door was opened by the appellant and he saw some lady
suit scattered on a cot in the room and VCP was also kept on the same
cot. The appellant gave him Rs.40/- as hire charges for VCP and he
took the VCP and returned to his shop. On 13.08.1988, he as well as
PW-7 were called at police station Shalimar Bagh where they were
shown photograph (Ex.PW-6/A) which they identified to be that of
same Sardarji who visited their shop along with the appellant.
</p><p id="p_55">27.   It has come in the statement of PW-7 and PW-20 that they were
maintaining some record of providing VCR/VCP on hire basis and
they were having two video cassette players at that time of make
Monex. They used to make entry in the register i.e. recording address
of the person to whom it was provided on hire and in routine that
register used to be destroyed every month. We agree with learned
counsel for the appellant that the said register that had the record of
installing VCP at the flat of the appellant should have been seized by
the Investigating Officer, but at the same time its non-seizure is not
fatal to the case of the prosecution for the reason that small shop
keepers providing VCPs/VCRs on hire basis for one night on nominal
charges of Rs.40/- are not expected to maintain record in an organized
manner. Both these witnesses are independent public witnesses, not
even known to the appellant prior to this date. They had absolutely no
motive to depose about the deceased Surender Singh being last seen in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">         CRL.A. 79/1998                           Page 18 of 36</span>
 the company of the appellant when PW-7 visited the flat of the
appellant in the night of 10th August, 1988. Despite lengthy cross-
examination, their testimonies could not be challenged and we have no
hestitation to hold that PW-7 Sanjeev Kumar, an employee of PW-20
has seen the deceased alive in flat No.127 of the appellant. From the
testimony of PW-20, it is proved that next day morning at about 8:30
AM when he visited the said flat to collect the VCP, only the appellant
was there who paid him the hire charges and he returned after
collecting the VCP.
</p><p id="p_56">Appellant seen leaving her flat with bag and TV
</p><p id="p_57">28.   PW-1 Mrs. Moly Verghese was the immediate neighbour of the
appellant residing in quarter No.124, Her statement is to the effect that
entrance door of flat Nos.124 and 127 open in the same corridor and
she used to see the appellant standing in her balcony and one Sardarji
used to visit her. She has also stated that about 2/3 days before she
came to know of the murder; she had returned from her office at about
7.00 PM.    When she saw that the appellant was standing in the
corridor with a portable T.V and a bag. Though this witness did not
fully support the case of the prosecution, but her testimony to the
extent it supports the case of the prosecution that one Sardarji used to
visit the flat of the appellant and her seeing the appellant leaving with
bag and TV can be relied upon by this Court, as this part of her
testimony further stands corroborated by PW-2 Surinder Kumar,
General Secretary of the Residents Welfare Association of the Income
Tax Colony. His testimony is sufficient to establish that on seeing the
lady going with a TV and bag he made enquiry and came to know that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 19 of 36</span>
 she was the resident of flat No.127 and her name was Baljeet Kaur
and that lady was seen going on a three wheeler scooter along with a
TV and bag. This witness was frank enough to give reason for not
being able to identify the appellant to be the same lady as when he
saw her, she was well dressed and in make up and stressing that if she
is again dressed like that, he would be able to identify her. Thus, the
testimony of PW-1 &amp; PW-2 proved the appellant leaving her flat with
the bag and portable TV 2/3 days prior to the date of murder of
Surender Singh was detected. Here again, it is relevant to mention that
as per prosecution, murder of Surender Singh came to light on 13 th
August, 1988 when his legless body was recovered and the two legs
had already been recovered on 12th August, 1988 in the early morning,
from which it can be calculated that from 13th August, 1988, 2/3 days
before means on the evening of 11th August, 1988.
Recovery of scooter
</p><p id="p_58">29.   As     per    prosecution   witness   (PW-29),   scooter      bearing
registration No.DHQ 4810 was found registered in the name of
Surender Singh s/o Shri Dharam Singh, r/o 3247, Bahadurgarh Road
and this fact was confirmed from the record of Transport Authority at
Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi and the date of transfer in the name of
Surender Singh was recorded as 08.02.1987, he being the second
owner. This scooter was seized by the IO, while it was lying parked in
open garage of Income Tax Colony. Its keys have been recovered
from the flat of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_59">30.   Although lot of emphasis has been laid on the fact that when
during evidence it was tried to be started with the key recovered, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">           CRL.A. 79/1998                           Page 20 of 36</span>
 could not be started, so it was doubtful whether the keys recovered
were that of scooter or not. This contention is liable to be rejected for
the simple reason that the keys chain recovered contained three keys.
Other two keys could open the dickey but the third could not start the
scooter not because it was not of that scooter, but there could be many
technical reasons as scooter was lying parked in the malkhana of
police station for a long time, If a vehicle remained parked for a long
time, it becomes a junk. Even absence of petrol could be a reason due
to which it could not be started. Non-start of scooter at the stage of
evidence with one of the keys is insignificant. Once the deceased is
proved to be the registered owner of the scooter, keys of the same
being recovered from the flat of the appellant and even the scooter was
found parked on the ground floor garage, it is proved beyond
reasonable doubt that the deceased visited the appellant on the scooter
in the evening of 10th August, 1988. As he met homicidal death, his
scooter and keys remained there only at the place of the appellant.
Recovery of kada, ring and TV from PW-19 Jasbir Kaur
</p><p id="p_60">31.   It has been proved by PWs 1 &amp; 2, residents of Income Tax
Colony that 2/3 days prior to detection of murder of deceased
Surender Singh, the appellant Baljeet Kaur was seen going with a bag
and TV. PW-19 Jasbir Kaur stated that on 11th (year she could not
recollect), but 2 ½ years ago (she was examined on 14.05.1991), she
was present in West Patel Nagar, the appellant came to her house at
about 8 or 8:30 AM with a small TV. On that night she stayed at her
house claiming that she was unwell. Next day morning she handed
over a packet containing gold kara and two rings with a promise to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 21 of 36</span>
 take the same back at noon time on the same day, but she did not
return thereafter. It was only on 13.08.1988 that the appellant visited
her house accompanied by the police and she handed over kada, rings
and TV to the police vide memo Ex.PW-10/A3. She identified TV
Ex.P25, kada Ex.P26 and gold rings Ex.P27 &amp; P28 which were left by
the appellant at her house. During cross-examination, she tried to
change the time of the visit of the police and recording of her
statement as early morning of 13th August to strengthen the defence of
the appellant that the police came to know of the incident on the night
of 12th August itself. On this plea of the appellant, we would advert
later on. Here suffice to say that testimony of PW-19 Jasbir Kaur
proved leaving of TV, one kada and two gold rings at her house by the
appellant on 11th August, 1988 which she handed over to the police at
the instance of the appellant on 13th August.
</p><p id="p_61">Relationship with the deceased
</p><p id="p_62">32.   As per prosecution case, the appellant was in illicit relationship
with the deceased and due to this reason she left her family and started
residing separately four years prior to this occurrence. She was living
alone and the deceased used to visit her frequently and stay with her. It
has also come in the statement of PW-10 Inder Vir Singh, brother of
the deceased Surender Singh that the appellant Baljeet Kaur was the
wife of brother-in-law (sala) of his elder brother Harbans Singh. He
has stated about illicit relationship between the deceased and the
appellant and that on the evening of 10th August, 1988 the deceased
left home to visit the appellant, but failed to return thereafter and on
13th August, 1988 when the family members became worried about
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 22 of 36</span>
 him, he along with his brother joginder Singh visited the flat of the
appellant to look for him.
</p><p id="p_63">33.    The contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that there
was no illicit relationship between the appellant and the deceased
Surender Singh and there is no proof of the same. Statement of PW-28
Waryam Singh, husband of the deceased as well as admission of
appellant herself in her statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_18">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. is
sufficient to prove the kind of relationship she had with the deceased.
She not only walked out of her matrimonial home, leaving her
husband and four children but also arranged for a separate flat so that
the deceased could visit her any time. It is her own admission that she
wanted to marry the deceased and for that she even filed a divorce
petition which was dismissed in default after her arrest in this case.
The circumstances brought on record and admission of the appellant
herself is sufficient to clear the cloud, if any, on their relationship.
Motive
</p><p id="p_64">34.    The prosecution has not come out with any motive for
commission of this crime by the appellant. The case of the prosecution
rests on 'last seen' and circumstantial evidence. The motive always
remains locked in the head of offender. Motive is an emotion which
impels a person to do a particular act. It may not always be possible to
discover that impelling factor. In the case reported as <a href="/doc/1622549/" id="a_19">Sahadevan @
Sagadevan v. State</a> rep. by Inspector of Police, 2003 (1) SCC 534, the
Supreme Court held that in case of circumstantial evidence, if the
circumstances relied upon by the prosecution are beyond doubt, then
the absence of motive would not hamper a conviction.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">          CRL.A. 79/1998                               Page 23 of 36</span>
<p id="p_65"> 35.   In the case reported as <a href="/doc/186059/" id="a_20">Ujjagar Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (2009)
1 SCC (Cri) 272, it was held as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "In a case relating to circumstantial evidence, motive
      does assume great importance, but to say that the
      absence of motive would dislodge the entire prosecution
      story is giving this one factor an importance which is not
      due. Motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom
      be fathomed with any degree of accuracy."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">36.   Here in the given facts, deceased and the appellant were in the
relationship and appellant was living separately in that flat which was
frequently visited by the deceased which fact was well known not only
to her husband and family but also to the family of the deceased so
much so that before visiting the flat of the appellant on 10.08.1988,
deceased informed his family that he was visiting Baljeet Kaur. It has
earlier been observed by us that the prosecution has not been able to
prove on record any motive for the appellant to kill the person for
whom she left the entire world, but the question arises whether
inability to prove the motive in itself is sufficient to acquit the
appellant in this case. To our mind, the answer is in negative. In every
relationship there are hiccups and if we can term it as live-in-
relationship, it had also its own share of problems. What happened
that night within the four walls of the flat of Baljeet Kaur that resulted
into strangulation of deceased is not known but it is certain that
inability to prove the motive in this case has hardly any negative effect
on the case of prosecution.
</p><p id="p_67">Probability of defence version
</p><p id="p_68">37.   The contention of the appellant is that regarding foul smell
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 24 of 36</span>
 emitting from her flat was noticed by her when returned on the
evening of 12.08.1988 which she brought to the notice of family of
PW-5 Virender Singh who accompanied her to PP Pitam Pura. SI
Reval Singh and Inspector Jagjit Singh came to the spot during night
itself and on finding parts of the dead body at her flat, she was forced
to identify which she could not. During that intervening night, her
husband was contacted and Jasbir Kaur was also brought to the PS
early in the morning which fact stands established from the testimony
of PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh, PW-9 Sh. Vijay Pal Singh - SHO and
PW-28 Sardar Waryam Singh.          In these circumstances, the entire
prosecution case regarding intimation being received on the morning
of 13.08.1988 collapsed as the public witnesses, who are prosecution
witnesses, have supported the version of the appellant as to who was
the first informant.
</p><p id="p_69">38.   First of all, the version of the appellant as given by her during
her examination under Sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_21">CrPC</a> is to be considered. As already
mentioned, apart from the answers given during her examination
under Sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_22">CrPC</a>, in reply to the last question whether she had to
say anything else, she submitted ten typed pages duly signed by her
stating that the same be considered as her reply to the last question. In
her statement under sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_23">CrPC</a>, she has admitted having a
relationship with deceased Surender Singh due to which she walked
out of her matrimonial home about four years prior to the occurrence.
She also admitted having taken on rent Flat No.127, Income Tax
Colony which used to be visited by deceased Surender Singh. She
also admitted filing of a divorce petition by her so that after taking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">          CRL.A. 79/1998                            Page 25 of 36</span>
 divorce from PW-28 Sardar Waryam Singh, she could marry the
deceased Surender Singh and dismissal of that petition in default after
her arrest in this case. She also stated that there were two keys of the
lock of the flat, one used to be with her and other used to be with
Surender Singh.
</p><p id="p_70">39.   Referring to the incident of 12.08.1988, she stated that when she
came to her flat at about 5.00 pm, foul smell was coming from her flat
and on opening, she found blood stains on the ground and some dead
body pieces. She was so much shocked on seeing all this. She
immediately closed the door and locked the same and went to the
house of PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh where she met his wife. She
continued waiting for the return of Virender Singh and when he
returned at 10.00 pm, she narrated entire incident to him.         PW-5
Virender Singh alongwith his mother and sister-in-law (Bhabhi)
accompanied her and they reached PP Pitam Pura at about 11.45 pm
on 12.08.1988 itself and narrated the entire incident to SI Reval Singh
</p><p id="p_71">- Incharge, PP Pitam Pura who accompanied them at 2.00 am to the
spot. Inspector Jagjit Singh - SHO also reached the spot and lock of
the door was opened by police after taking the keys from her and
thereafter, the police showed her two severed arms of a dead body and
other parts of the dead body were recovered from a trunk with bottom
legs/feet missing, which she could not identify. It is further mentioned
in this written note that at 2.00 or 2.30 am, police knocked the door of
PW-1 Malivarghese and recorded her statement, took search of the
house and seized all the articles lying there. Thereafter police asked
her to take them to the residence of her husband at 200, Parmanand
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">         CRL.A. 79/1998                            Page 26 of 36</span>
 Colony, Mukerjee Nagar from where her husband was brought to the
police station. At the police station, Mohinder Kaur - sister of her
husband and Harbans Singh - brother of the deceased and husband of
Mohinder Kaur were found present and at about 5.30 pm, they again
returned to the flat accompanied by her husband. She claimed to have
been    arrested     at    2.30   pm   on    the   night     intervening
12.08.1988/13.08.1988 and that the SHO left the PS and returned at
about 7.30 am on 13.08.1988 alongwith Jasbir Kaur who remained
present in the police station throughout the day and did not produce
any of the articles as claimed by the police nor she (appellant) was
taken to Patel Nagar by the police. she also claimed that two rings and
kada were got made by her to present Surender Singh at the time of
marriage and that Surender Singh never used to wear the same.
</p><p id="p_72">40.    She also stated that since her TV was out of order, she took the
same for repair but as the shop was closed, it could not be repaired and
when the TV was out of order, there was no question of asking for
VCR from the Video Hut Shop.
</p><p id="p_73">41.    PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh tried to support the appellant by
making improvements in his statement recorded under Sec.161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_24">CrPC</a>
by introducing a new version of his visit to the Police Station on the
night of 12.08.1988 with the appellant as well as his mother and sister-
in-law (Bhabhi). It is pertinent to note here that prior to recording of
DD No.4-A dated 13.08.1988, no DD entry was recorded either at PP
Pitam Pura or PS Shalimar Bagh pertaining to any incident at flat
No.127, Income Tax Colony. Even DD record was also summoned
from PP Pitam Pura for cross examination of PW-23 SI Reval Singh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">          CRL.A. 79/1998                           Page 27 of 36</span>
 but it could not help the appellant. So it is necessary to find out
whether, infact, appellant visited PP Pitam Pura on the night of
12.08.1988 accompanied by PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh and his
relations. The falsity in this plea of appellant is exposed from the
statement of PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh himself as while deposing
before the Court, he stated that when he returned home on 12.08.1988
at about 10.30 or 11.00 pm, his wife was weeping because foul smell
was coming from the flat of the deceased. First of all, foul smell can
be because of any reason like, dead rat in the house or any other
reason which could not be a cause for wife of PW-5 Sh. Virender
Singh to cry. As per PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh, the keys of the flat
were not available with the appellant and when the police
accompanied them during night, they had to break open the kunda of
the door. He also stated that PW-23 SI Reval Singh initially expressed
his inability to visit the spot due to non-availability of any vehicle in
the Chowki, then he alongwith SI Reval Singh and the appellant came
in a taxi to the quarter of appellant on the same night. He omitted to
mention as to how his mother and Bhabhi returned from the Chowki
and from which Taxi Stand they hired the taxi. This entire story as
narrated by PW-5 as to what happened during the intervening night of
12.08.1988/13.08.1988, does not find any corroboration either from
the version of appellant given under Sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25">CrPC</a> or from the
statement of PW-1 Ms. Malivarghese whose entrance door is just
opposite to the entrance door of the house of the appellant in the same
corridor. It is just not possible for her to remain unaware of visit of
the police at midnight in the flat just opposite to her flat. Though PW-

<p id="p_74"> 5 Sh. Virender Singh claims to be present at the spot for ten hours, but
he does not speak about associating PW-1 Ms. Malivarghese in the
proceedings by the police on that night.
</p><p id="p_75">42.   PW-28 Sardar Waryam Singh - husband of the appellant though
stated that about 2½ years back (he was examined on 05.06.1990) his
brother received information on telephone inquiring about his wife on
which he informed that he had no knowledge. On the same early
morning at about 5.00 am, police came to their house alongwith his
wife and then he came to know about murder of Surender Singh and
that at that time, his wife was staying in Pitam Pura.         Here, the
question that remains unanswered by the appellant is that she does not
claim to have given the telephone number of her husband to the SHO
and if she was already with the police right from about 11.00 pm on
12.08.1988, where was the occasion for the police to telephone her
husband and ask where she was especially when divorce petition was
pending. Surprisingly, even as per PW-28 Sardar Waryam Singh, at
the time when he was contacted by the police, he came to know about
the murder of Surender Singh but appellant has preferred to claim
through DW-1 Sh. Jaswinder Singh that Surender Singh was seen
alive on the night of 10.08.1988 at Palam Airport, It is different that
the statement of DW-1 Sh. Jaswinder Singh cannot be trusted as even
he was not aware about the appellant being staying separately from
her family i.e. husband and children, four years prior to the incident
and the place i.e. Palam Airport where he claims to have spotted the
deceased at about 10.30 pm, was otherwise not possible in view of
statement of PW-7 Sh. Sanjeev Kumar who had seen the deceased
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">         CRL.A. 79/1998                            Page 29 of 36</span>
 alive in the company of appellant about 9.00 pm on 10.08.1988 at the
time of installation of VCP at the said flat and even the scooter of the
deceased was lying parked at the ground floor and keys of the same
were recovered from the flat of the appellant.
</p><p id="p_76">43.   The testimony of PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur further falsifies the
statement of the appellant regarding recovery of TV, Kada and rings.
It has come in the statement of PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur that she
started knowing the appellant just 6-7 months prior to the occurrence
as they used to meet in Gurudwara. She categorically stated about the
perplexed condition of the appellant on her visit to her house on the
evening of 11th August, 1988 alongwith one TV, Kada and two rings
and that Kada and rings were left with her next day morning with the
assurance to collect the same on the same day from her which she
failed to do. PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur is a witness to the recovery of
T.V., Kada and rings from her possession and Kada and rings as well
as the TV have been claimed by the appellant to be belonging to her.
How these articles reached the house of Jasbir Kaur at Patel Nagar if
the appellant was staying with DW-2 Sh. Jagjit Singh during this
period i.e. 10.08.1988 to 12.08.1988, remains unexplained by her.
Another important factor that requires consideration is that DW-2 Sh.
Jagjit Singh claims himself to be a goldsmith having prepared Kada
and rings out of two gold bangles given by the appellant to him so that
she could present the same to Surender Singh at the time of marriage.
This statement of DW-2 Sh. Jagjit Singh is not finding any support
from the statement of appellant herself. Not only that, he admitted
that it did not bear any mark or stamp to show that the same were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">         CRL.A. 79/1998                            Page 30 of 36</span>
 manufactured by him.       While appellant claimed in her statement
under Sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26">CrPC</a> that these kada and rings were never worn by
Surender Singh, DW-2 Sh. Jagjit Singh admitted during his cross
examination that they were used one. Appellant has failed to reconcile
this contradictory version, one coming from her mouth and another
from her nephew (DW-2). Another aspect that requires consideration
is as to whether appellant was staying at her sister's house during
10.08.1999 to 12.08.1988. DW-2 Sh. Jagjit Singh claims that from
10.08.1988 to 12.08.1988 appellant did not move out of their house
and remained with them. If it is so, then how PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur
could come into possession of the TV, Kada and rings etc. belonging
to the appellant and left by her with PW-19 Jasbir Kaur during her
visit on 11.08.1988. She not only visited but also stayed there during
night pretending ill-health. This statement of PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur
stands corroborated from the statement of PW-1 Ms. Malivarghese
and PW-2 Sh. Surinder Kumar who had seen the appellant leaving the
premises where she was staying, alongwith one bag and TV.           That
bag was subsequently found lying empty with blood stains at the flat
of the appellant and two legs lying in the area of Patel Nagar visited
by the appellant on the evening of 11.08.1988. This material available
on record is sufficient to discard the statement DW-1 Sh. Jaswinder
Singh and DW-2 Sh. Jagjit Singh in toto.
</p><p id="p_77">44.   Lot of emphasis has been laid on behalf of appellant on the
photographs of the crime scene which do not show scissor, shaving
razor and axe and claimed that all these articles were planted to falsely
implicated the appellant. Deceased being 'Sikh' did not require any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 31 of 36</span>
 shaving razor and the photographs reveal that head and beard of the
deceased were found shaved at the time of recovery of the body
pieces. If the photographer has concentrated on the body pieces while
taking photographs of the crime scene, the recovery of axe, scissor,
shaving razor etc. does not become doubtful just because they are not
shown in the photographs. If these articles were planted one, the
police officer planting them would have been ensured that these
articles are duly photographed alongwith the body pieces. So this
contention is also liable to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_78">45.   A doubt has been tried to be created as to whether the deceased
Surender Singh was killed by someone and cut into pieces and thrown
at the flat of appellant. Till the date of arguments before this Court, it
has not been claimed that Surender Singh was seen alive by anyone
after 10.08.1988 till 13.08.1988 i.e. when he was seen alive in the
company of appellant and the subsequent date when the pieces of his
body were recovered from the flat of the appellant. The body has been
duly identified by brother of the deceased and absolutely no doubt
about the parts of body and legs recovered from Patel Nagar to be of
the deceased Surender Singh.
</p><p id="p_79">46.   From the testimony of PW-7 Sh. Sanjeev Kumar who came to
install Video at the flat of Appellant, recovery of scooter keys from
the flat of the appellant as well as that of scooter form the ground floor
(open garage), visit of Surender Singh to the house of appellant on the
evening of 10.08.1988 stands proved. The testimony of PW-20 Sh.
Anupam Arya who had gone to collect VCP from the said flat, it is
proved that at that time only appellant was seen in the flat. These
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">          CRL.A. 79/1998                            Page 32 of 36</span>
 witnesses are independent witnesses and had no axe to grind in the
matter. The loopholes in the version of the appellant that the police
was informed by her on the night of 12.08.1988 and the support she
tried to take from PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh, PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur,
PW-28 Sardar Waryam Singh as well as DW-1 Sh. Jaswinder Singh
and DW-2 Sh. Jagjit Singh in this regard boom ranged her defence.
Conclusion
</p><p id="p_80">47.   The testimony of PW-23 SI Reval Singh and Inspector Jagjit
Singh is sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that prior to
lodging of DD No.4-A, the police was not aware of presence of pieces
of dead body at the flat of appellant and their presence in the
residential complex where appellant was residing on the night
intervening of 12.08.1988/13.08.1988 is not proved at all. Had they
visited on the night of 12.08.2011/13.08.2011 to the house of the
appellant, not only case of the recovery of two severed legs could have
been solved immediately, there was hardly any need for getting two
postmortem conducted on the legs, one by PW-17 Dr. L.T. Ramani
and another by PW-3 Dr. Bharat Singh alongwith other parts of body.
</p><p id="p_81">48.   The statement of appellant under Sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_27">CrPC</a> that when she
alongwith PW-5 Virender Singh and police returned to her flat, the
door was opened with key, is in contrast to the version of PW-5 that
key was not with her and the kunda of the door was to be broken open.
Otherwise also, the version of the appellant that initially she opened
the flat and on seeing the body pieces and blood on the floor, she was
shocked and immediately she came out and after locking the door, she
went to inform PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh, is contrary to version of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">         CRL.A. 79/1998                           Page 33 of 36</span>
 PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh as per whom, she has only complained
about foul smell emitting from her flat without knowing the cause. As
stated by appellant under sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_28">CrPC</a>, after opening the flat on the
evening of 12.08.1988, she came to know about the presence of pieces
of human body in her flat. In that case, nothing stopped her from
calling the PCR, informing the office of Residents Welfare
Association and her acquaintance/well-wishers like PW-5 Sh.
Virender Singh or even her immediate neighbourer Ms. Malivarghese.
She could not have waited for return of PW-5 Sh. Virender Singh till
10.30/11.00 pm and then visit PP Pitam Pura, which statement is
falsified from the police record.
</p><p id="p_82">49.   Here in the instant case, the murder has been committed within
the four walls of flat No.127, Income Tax Colony which was in
exclusive possession of the appellant. The plea of alibi during the
period 10.08.1988 to 12.08.1988 from her flat has been found to be
false especially in view of the testimony of PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur.
In the case reported as        <a href="/doc/845834/" id="a_29">Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of
Maharashtra</a> (2006) 10 SCC 681, while referring to the cases where
the offence takes place in the privacy of house without any eye
witness available, it was held as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "If an offence takes place inside the privacy of a house
      and in such circumstances where the assailants have all
      the opportunity to plan and commit the offence at the
      time and in circumstances of their choice, it will be
      extremely difficult for the prosecution to lead evidence to
      establish the guilt of the accused if the strict principle of
      circumstantial evidence, as noticed above, is insisted
      upon by the Courts. A Judge does not preside over a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">         CRL.A. 79/1998                             Page 34 of 36</span>
       criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is
      punished. A Judge also presides to see that a guilty man
      does not escape. Both are public duties. (See Stirland v.
      Director of Public Prosecution 1944 AC 315 quoted with
      approval by Arijit Pasayat, J. in State of Punjab v
      Karnail Singh MANU/SC/0585/2003: 2003CriLJ3892).
      The law does not enjoin a duty on the prosecution to lead
      evidence of such character which is almost impossible to
      be led or at any rate extremely difficult to be led. The
      duty on the prosecution is to lead such evidence which it
      is capable of leading having regard to the facts and
      circumstances of the case."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_83">50.   The postmortem was conducted on 14.08.1988 and time since
death is given as about four days prior. In this case of last seen
evidence, the time gap between the point of time when the deceased
and the accused were seen alive and the time of death is so small that
possibility of the offence being committed by any other person
becomes impossible and ruled out.
</p><p id="p_84">51.   We find that prosecution has been able to discharge its onus by
proving that deceased was lastly seen in the company of appellant at
about 9.00 or 9.15 pm on 10.08.1988 in her flat. The factum of
leaving the premises alongwith a bag and TV in an auto and her visit
to Patel Nagar to the house of PW-19 Smt. Jasbir Kaur and recovery
of two severed legs from that very area on 12.08.1988 further proves
beyond any reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had taken
away the two severed legs for disposal of the body cut into pieces.
The recovery of pieces of body of Surender Singh from the flat of the
appellant when PW-10 Inder Vir Singh and PW-11 Sh. Joginder Singh
came in search of Surender Singh, makes the appellant liable to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">         CRL.A. 79/1998                          Page 35 of 36</span>
 explain as to how the pieces of human body were found in her flat or
to own the liability for homicide. No doubt, the initial burden is
always on the prosecution to discharge the onus but the facts which
are within the special knowledge of the appellant, the prosecution is
not required to prove such facts as part of its primary burden.
</p><p id="p_85">52.   In view of the foregoing discussion, we do not find any error or
infirmity in the impugned judgment and order. The appeal is without
any merits and is therefore, to fail.       The same is accordingly
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_86">53.   The appellant shall surrender before the Trial Court on
15.12.2011 to serve the balance of her sentence. The registry shall
transmit the Trial Court Record and this judgment, forthwith, to ensure
compliance.
