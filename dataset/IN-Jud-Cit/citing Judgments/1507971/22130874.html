Shekhar B. Saraf, J.:


Facts:

1.     The plaintiff/petitioner has filed the present suit against an advertising

       campaign containing five impugned advertisements issued by the

       defendant/respondent one after the other during October and November

       2021 in relation to its product &quot;Baidhyanath Chyawanprash Special&quot;.

       Details of the impugned advertisements are as follows:



     a) Impugned Advertisement No. 1 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Annexure I&quot;)

        was    released    by   the   defendant     on   its     official    website

        (https://www.baidyanath.com/chyawanprash-special.html) and was

        also available for viewership on the websites of various e-commerce

        platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and others. The same has been

        removed by the defendant/respondent on November 25, 2021 based on

        an order passed by this court on the same date. In this advertisement

        the   defendant/respondent    had    published   a     comparative     chart

        describing the qualities of its product with other rival products in the

        market. The respondent had claimed that its Chyawanprash has &#x27;52

        herbs&#x27; whereas its rivals have only &#x27;42 ingredients&#x27;. Thereafter, the

        advertisement mentions that respondent&#x27;s product is made from &#x27;100%

        pure ghee&#x27; whereas its rivals have a &#x27;mixture of vegetable oil and ghee&#x27;.

        The pictorial representation of this impugned advertisement is

        extracted below:
                                     3




b) Impugned Advertisement No. 2 or Print Advertisement-1 (hereinafter

   referred to as &quot;Annexure-J&quot;) was released by the defendant in print

   media in a national daily newspaper Dainik Jagran on October 17,

   2021. It was circulated only in the month of October, 2021 in the State

   of Uttar Pradesh. In this advertisement the respondent/defendant asks

   a question to the viewer as to whether their Chyawanprash is

   complete. Thereafter, the respondent highlights in the advertisement

   that its own product is complete and contains 52 ingredients. The

   advertisement conveys that while other Chyawanprash uses a &#x27;mixture

   of oil and ghee&#x27; in their preparation, Baidyanath Chywanprash

   contains only &#x27;100% Pure Desi Ghee&#x27;. The advertisement further

   elucidates   that   other   Chyawanprash   which   contains   only   &#x27;42

   Ingredients&#x27;, Baidyanath Chywanprash has the power of &#x27;complete 52

   Ayurvedic Ingredients&#x27; with benefits of fresh Amla and Saffron which

   gives you better immunity, more energy and sharp mind. The pictorial

   representation of this impugned advertisement is extracted below:
                                   4




c) Impugned Advertisement No. 3 or Print Advertisement-2 (hereinafter

   referred to as &quot;Annexure-K&quot;) was released by the defendant in print

   media in national daily newspaper Amar Ujala on November 12, 2021.

   It was circulated in the month of November, 2021 in the State of Uttar
                                5
Pradesh. In this advertisement the respondent states that complete

Chyawanprash is the one, which is formulated as per correct

formulation. Thereafter, it further communicates that Baidyanath

Chyawanprash is a complete Chywanprash which is made with

traditional recipe. While other Chyawanprash uses &#x27;mixture of oil and

ghee in their preparation&#x27;, Baidyanath Chywanprash uses only &#x27;100%

Pure Desi Ghee&#x27;. The advertisement further elucidates that other

Chyawanprash    which   contain    only   42   Ingredients,   Baidyanath

Chywanprash has the power of complete 52 Ayurvedic Ingredients with

benefits of fresh Amla and Saffron, which gives you better immunity,

more energy and sharp mind. The pictorial representation of this

impugned advertisement is extracted below:
                                    6
d) Impugned Advertisement No. 4 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Annexure-

   L&quot;) is a L-band TV advertisement (L-shaped advertisement played on

   TV along with the content program for short duration) released by the

   defendant on national television channels from November 12, 2021 in

   channels like Dabangg TV, which is available for viewership across all

   major cable networks, DTH and online OTT platforms. In this

   advertisement the respondent states that complete Chyawanprash is

   the one that is formulated as per correct formulation. Unlike Annexure

   I, J and K it does not make any claim with respect to the number of

   ingredients present in its product versus the product of other rivals.

   The picture format of this advertisement is delineated below:




e) Impugned Advertisement No. 5 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Annexure-

   M&quot;) is a full-fledged video advertisement, released by the defendant in

   social media on November 15, 2021, on its official YouTube channel

   named    &quot;Baidhyanath     Chyawanprash&quot;.     The    contents    of   this
                                 7
advertisement are presented below in a tabular format with the

dialogues delivered by the actors engaged for such purpose:


      Frame/ Visual Depiction             Description       including
                                          the Voice Over


                                          The        advertisement
                                          opens up with a shot
                                          where      husband            (a
                                          celebrity actor) walks
                                          into the living room
                                          with a bag containing
                                          grocery items in his
                                          hand and places the
                                          bag on dining table.


                                          He switches on the TV
                                          and                    cricket
                                          commentary could be
                                          heard            in          the
                                          background:


                                          Wife     takes        out    the
                                          bottle                        of
                                          Chyawanprash                from
                                          the grocery bag. On
                                          the         label             of
                                          Chyawanprash bottle,
                                          &#x27;42      ingredients&#x27;         is
                                          written.

    The wife is shocked
    and disappointed to
    see that her husband
    has bought ordinary
    &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27; with
    only &#x27;42 ingredients&#x27;.
    Therefore          she
    questions the choice of
    her   husband:- &quot;Ye
    kaunsa
    Chyawanprash hai!&quot;

    (In English - Which
    Chyawanprash      is
    this!)

    Husband       responds
    dismissively:

    He says - &quot;Arrey, hai
    to Chyawanprash hi,
    bas naam alag hai,
    kya farak padta hai?&quot;

    (In English - &quot;Hey it is
    Chyawanprash      only,
    just the name is
    different, how does it
    matter.&quot;)

    Husband gets back to
    watching        cricket
    match      and     says
    &quot;jitenge, sirf 52 run
    chahiye.&quot;
    (In English: His team
    has to make only 52
    runs to win)

    Wife is flabbergasted
    with her husband&#x27;s
    ignorance &amp; choice of
    Chyawanprash,
    correlates          the
    ingredients of ordinary
    Chyawanprash       with
    the ongoing cricket
    match and poses a
    question: - &quot;agar sirf
    42 run banaye toh?&quot;



    The husband with a
    mocking            look,
    responds - &quot;Yeh kaisa
    sawal hai? pure 52
    run chahiye 42 nahi,
    tabhi toh jetenge na!&quot;

    (In English - &quot;What
    kind of question is
    this? Total of 52 runs
    is required and not 42,
    to win!&quot;)

    The wife says - &quot;Vohi
    toh! Theek usi tarah
    beemariyo se bachne
    ke liye hume chaiye
    pure    52   ayurvedic
    tatvo ki shakti. 42
    nahi.    Tabhi     toh
    jeetnge na.&quot;

    (In English - &quot;That&#x27;s
    true! Just like your
    cricket   match,     to
    prevent illness, we
    need the power of total
    of    52    ayurvedic
    ingredients        are
 10
     required and not just
     42. Only then we will
     win.&quot;)




     Wife convinces the
     husband that he has
     made a wrong choice
     by buying any other
     Chyawanprash as the
     husband     from   his
     earlier      statement
     &quot;doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;, now
     says - &quot;toh farak,
     padta hai!&quot;

     (In English - &quot;yes, it
     does matter!&quot;) Both
     are shown happy to
     now found Baidyanath
     Chyawanprash          -
     which is the only
     Chyawanprash       with
     complete     ayurvedic
     ingredients, made with
     right formulae and
     protects from illness
     and            provides
     immunity, etc.
          Voice Over:

     Husband with a dazed
     look, ponders over the
     ingredients         of
     Baidyanath
     Chyawanprash banta
     hai    sadiyo   purani
     ayurvedic vidhi se.

     (In     English   -
     &quot;Baidyanath
     Chyawanprash is the
 11
     one which is made
     with  centuries    old
     Ayurvedic recipe&quot;)




     Now the husband is
     convinced that only
     Baidyanath
     Chyawanprash Special
     is pure and as per
     Ayurvedic texts, and
     other Chyawanprash
     should     not     be
     purchased/consumed.
     He   has   a    happy
     expression with his
     purchase decision.

                                                immunity!&quot;)




2.   The existence of the impugned advertisements being Annexure &#x27;I&#x27; to &#x27;M&#x27;

     came to the knowledge of the plaintiff on November 12, 2021. For

     seeking   remedy    against    the   impugned     advertisements      the

     petitioner/plaintiff had moved this application, praying for an order of

     injunction restraining the respondent from issuing, publishing or

     uploading the impugned advertisements disparaging the goodwill and
                                        13
     reputation of the petitioner and its product &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27; being sold

     under the trademark &quot;DABUR&quot;. The petitioner also prayed for an order

     of injunction directing the defendant/respondent to remove the

     impugned advertisements from all electronic medium, TV channels and

     other print media. On November 25, 2021, the Court granted ad interim

     ex parte order of injunction in terms of the above prayers. Thereafter, on

     December 1, 2021, the injunction granted on Annexure L was lifted and

     a direction for filing Affidavit-in-opposition was given. Both the parties

     have filed their respective affidavits for consideration by this court to

     decide the instant interlocutory application.



     Arguments:

3.   Mr. Sudipta Sarkar, Senior Advocate, appearing on behalf of the

     petitioner made the following arguments:

     a)   It is admitted by the defendant/respondents that the impugned

          advertisements are comparative in nature, thus, such untruthful

          comparisons are actionable in nature. The advertisement mentions

          &#x27;ordinary&#x27; Chyawanprash containing &#x27;42 ingredients&#x27; but the

          respondent admits that there is no &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27; in the market

          that contains 42 ingredients. Hence, the claim is untruthful, false

          and actionable.

     b)   The petitioner&#x27;s product was identified and targeted. Dabur

          Chyawanprash advertises with &#x27;more than 41 Ayurvedic herbs&#x27;, for

          this reason the reference of 42 ingredients is deliberate and

          malicious in nature. Further, a malicious comparison has been
                                     14
     made by the respondent in stating that its product is made with

     &#x27;100% pure ghee&#x27; whereas petitioners&#x27; product is made with a

     mixture of ghee plus vegetable oil spreading further misinformation

     and confusion because Dabur uses a mixture of til oil and pure

     desi ghee based on ancient ayurvedic texts. The respondent

     mischievously uses the term &quot;vegetable oil&quot; instead of &quot;til oil&quot;. The

     color scheme of the bottle of red and golden is also similar to that of

     petitioner&#x27;s product which is widely recognized and recalled by the

     consumers. Thus, it identifies to the petitioner&#x27;s product. Further,

     the petitioner has 63 % of the market share, therefore, the primary

     target of the impugned advertisements is to persuade consumers

     away   from     Dabur   Chyawanprash         and   shift   to   buying   the

     respondent&#x27;s product instead.

c)   If it is assumed that no direct reference is made to Dabur, there

     still exists a generic disparagement to the entire class of

     Chyawanprash thus giving a cause of action to the petitioner as a

     manufacturer of the product. The relevant judgments relied on by

     the petitioner to support the above arguments are <a href="/doc/82898733/" id="a_1">Dabur India

     Limited -v. Emami Limited</a> reported in 2004 (75) DRJ 356 and

     <a href="/doc/1507971/" id="a_2">Dabur India Limited -v. Colgate Palmolive India Ltd</a>. reported

     in 2004 (77) DRJ 415.

d)   A   &#x27;Serious&#x27;    comparison,        false   and    misleading    impugned

     advertisements are not mere puff. The respondent has made an

     untruthful comparison by exploiting the lack of knowledge of the

     ordinary   consumers.    The        respondent&#x27;s    advertisement    using
                                     15
     &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;aam&quot; (hindi) is misleading because under <a href="/doc/798638/" id="a_3">Section 3(a)</a>

     of the Drugs &amp; Cosmetic Act, there cannot be an &#x27;ordinary

     Chyawanprash&#x27; because no Chyawanprash in the market contains

     only 42 ingredients, and therefore, this amounts to disparaging the

     entire class of &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27;. The First Schedule to the Drugs

     and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_4">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940 provides for various ayurvedic texts that

     may be followed to manufacture Chyawanprash and in none of

     these texts a Chyawanprash can be made with 42 ingredients. In

     fact, the minimum number required is 47 ingredients. Ergo, the

     reference   to   &#x27;42&#x27;   is   false   and   consequently   amounts   to

     disparagement. Relevant judgment relied on by the petitioner is

     <a href="/doc/64885934/" id="a_5">Hindustan Unilever Ltd. -v. Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd</a>.

     reported in 2014 (2) CHN (Cal) 1.

e)   The respondent has admitted that ayurvedic texts have different

     formulations and merely because it has less than 52 ingredients

     does not make the formulation incomplete or insufficient. Such

     admission is contrary to the respondent&#x27;s claim that they were just

     giving mere imagery to the consumers to actively start questioning

     the number of ingredients in the Chyawanprash they buy. Ergo, the

     intent and the manner of representation in the impugned

     advertisements are false and misleading. According to the petitioner

     unfair or deceptive advertising is not protected under commercial

     speech as laid down in <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_6">Article 19 (1) (a)</a> of the Constitution of India

     but hits <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_7">Article 19(2).</a> Hence, it is impermissible.
                                  16
f)   The   respondent   misleadingly    implies     that   the     respondent&#x27;s

     Chyawanprash is complete where as other Chyawanprash are

     incomplete. The question posed in Annexure &quot;J&quot; as to &#x27;whether your

     Chyawanprash is complete?&#x27; which clearly creates doubt in the

     minds of consumers that the Chyawanprash they consume is not

     complete. The impugned advertisements mention that unlike other

     Chyawanprash       which    have        42   ingredients,      Baidyanath

     Chywanprash has the complete power of 52 ayurvedic ingredients.

     It implies that the respondent&#x27;s product is made with the correct

     recipe/formula where as other products in the same class of

     products   are   not.   Message    being     conveyed    is    that    other

     Chyawanprash are insufficient and therefore not Chyawanprash at

     all. Relevant judgment relied on for this argument is Reckitt

     Benckiser Health Care (India) Pvt. Ltd. -v- Emami Ltd. &amp; Ors.

     reported in 2015 (4) CHN (CAL) 19.

g)   False statements have been made before the Court by the

     respondent. The respondent says 42 ingredients have been used in

     the   advertisements    because    it    rhymes   with      52   but    the

     advertisement is released in Hindi and &#x27;baavan&#x27; and &#x27;bayalees&#x27; do

     not rhyme and hence, it is a false claim. The intent and manner of

     advertisements is to convey a message that other Chyawanprash in

     the market are &#x27;ordinary&#x27; or &#x27;deficient&#x27; as they contain only 42

     ingredients and are not manufactured as per correct text, hence are

     deficient and do not provide health benefits. Further, it is

     submitted by the petitioner that the reference to &quot;42 ingredients&quot; in
                                        17
          the impugned advertisements clearly identifies and targets &#x27;Dabur&#x27;

          Chyawanprash&#x27; as the plaintiff through its website advertises that

          its Chyawanprash contains more than &quot;41 Ayurvedic herbs&quot;.



4.   Mr. Manish Biala, Counsel appearing for the Defendant/Respondent,

     made the following arguments:

     a)   The defendant&#x27;s advertisement and right to commercial speech is a

          part of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_8">Article

          19 (1) (a)</a> of the Constitution. It is settled law that any restraint or

          curtailment of advertisements would affect the fundamental right

          under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_9">Article 19 (1) (a).</a> The purpose of advertising is dissemination

          of information regarding the product advertised and public at large

          is benefitted by the information disseminated. Free flow of

          commercial information is indispensable in a democracy, and the

          economic system in a democracy will be handicapped without the

          freedom of commercial speech. Thus, the defendant has the right to

          advertise its products as part of its right to &quot;commercial speech&quot;

          which is a part of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed

          under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_10">Article 19(1) (a)</a> of the Constitution. Furthermore, the

          protection under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_11">article 19(1) (a)</a> is also available to the recipient of

          the speech, and it also protects the rights of an individual to listen,

          read and receive the said speech. In the present context, it is the

          rights and interest of the consumers which is getting affected if the

          defendant&#x27;s advertisement is restrained from informing them about

          the benefits of the product. He places reliance on Tata Press Ltd. -
                                   18
     v- MTNL &amp; Ors reported in (1995) 5 SCC 139 to make the above

     argument.

b)   The plaintiff ought not to be hyper-sensitive about the defendant&#x27;s

     advertisement. It is settled law that comparison between products

     is allowed, and it is permissible for an advertiser to proclaim that

     its product is the best. However, the said implication is natural and

     allowed, as one consumer may look at the advertisement and

     conclude that one product is superior while some other consumer

     may look at it from another point and think that the other product

     is inferior. This does not constitute disparagement under the law,

     and the advertisement cannot be restrained. The counsel places

     reliance on Dabur India Ltd. -v- Wipro Ltd. reported in 2006 (32)

     PTC 677 (Del) to make the above argument.

c)   The plaintiff has attempted to create a monopoly in the market by

     abusing the process of law. It is settled law that the plaintiff cannot

     restrain others from advertising on the ground that the plaintiff has

     major market share for a particular product and thus, it is the

     obvious target of any advertisement. Such claims have been

     dismissed by the courts as the sub-text of such claims is an

     intention to create monopoly in the market or to entrench a

     monopoly in the market that the plaintiff claims to already have.

     Furthermore, it has been held that if such claims of the plaintiff

     were to be accepted, then no other manufacturer would be able to

     advertise its product, because in doing so, it would necessarily

     mean that the plaintiff&#x27;s product is being targeted. Reliance on the
                                   19
     judgement passed      in   Dabur   India   Ltd.   -v-   M/s   Colortek

     Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors reported in ILR 2010 (IV) Del 489 has

     been placed to buttress the above submission.

d)   The defendant&#x27;s advertisements make the public at large aware of

     the beneficial knowledge for consumers. The defendant, through its

     advertisements, has given the true and correct knowledge to the

     consumers, and made the public at large, aware about the truth as

     well as the benefits of its own product, which contains all necessary

     ingredients. The plaintiff is aware of the aforesaid, and it is scared

     that such fact might come out in the public domain when the

     public at large starts questioning the product that they buy or

     consume. To make this averment, reliance has been placed on

     Reckit Benckiser (India) Ltd. -v- Naga Ltd. &amp; Ors reported in

     ILR (2003) 1 Delhi 325.

e)   It is settled law that comparative advertising is permissible under

     the law. Furthermore, in the present matter, the defendant&#x27;s

     advertisement is not comparative in the strict sense as the

     defendant&#x27;s advertisement only compares the defendant&#x27;s product

     with an unnamed fictitious product. When the main thrust of the

     advertisement is to showcase the benefit of the defendant&#x27;s

     product, the same must be allowed. To buttress this averment

     reliance has been placed on Dabur India Ltd. -v- Emami Ltd.

     reported in 2019 (79) PTC 299 (Del).

f)   The defendants&#x27; product is as per the approved Ayurvedic texts. The

     plaintiff&#x27;s entire claim is based on the fact that a Chyawanprash
                                        20
     has at least 47 ingredients as per the approved textbooks of

     Ayurveda.    The     plaintiff    has     itself        stated     therein   that     a

     Chyawanprash can have any number of ingredients above 47.

     Furthermore, the plaintiff has not denied that the defendant&#x27;s

     product contains 52 ingredients as per the approved ayurvedic

     texts. Thus, it is evident that there is no misrepresentation or

     untruthful statement by the defendant for its product, and the

     plaintiff   has    falsely   claimed       that         there      has    been      any

     misrepresentation by the defendant in its advertisement.

g)   It is an admitted case of the plaintiff that its own Dabur

     Chyawanprash or any other Chyawanprash for that matter does

     not have 42 ingredients. However, on the other hand, the plaintiff

     has claimed that any reference to a Chyawanprash having 42

     ingredients is a direct reference to the plaintiff&#x27;s product &quot;Dabur

     Chyawanprash&quot;.       Thus,       the    plaintiff       has      itself   made    self-

     contradictory claims. The defendant&#x27;s advertisements do not refer

     to the plaintiff&#x27;s product at all. The terminology, the number, and

     the representation of an unnamed fictitious product in the

     defendant&#x27;s advertisements has no reference whatsoever to the

     plaintiff or its product Dabur Chyawanprash. The plaintiff cannot

     claim its rights over any number and restrain the defendant from

     using it.

h)   Defendant/Respondent         states      that       a    bare      perusal   of     the

     defendant&#x27;s advertisements reveals that it neither mentions the

     plaintiff or its product. It is further stated that the figure 42 was
                                         21
          used by the advertisement creators for the reason that it rhymes

          with 52, and it is also a round figure (less by 10) which will make

          an impact in the minds of the consumers. Furthermore, the said

          fictitious number was used by the defendant as none of the

          Chyawanprash manufacturers, including the plaintiff, use 42

          ingredients for their product, and thus, no disparagement could

          take place by using the said fictitious number. The said figure of 42

          is a mere indicator and figurehead of an unnamed fictional

          Chyawanprash brand with 42 ingredients. It is submitted that the

          defendant was simply giving model imagery to the consumers to

          actively start questioning the number of ingredients in the

          Chyawanprash.

     i)   Finally, it is argued by the defendant/respondent that the intent of

          the defendant&#x27;s commercial is to suggest that the product of the

          defendant is better than others. While doing so, the commercial

          does not denigrate or disparage the product of the plaintiff which is

          allowed as per settled law.



     Analysis:

5.   I have heard the counsels appearing for both the parties. The sole issue

     for consideration before this court is that whether the impugned

     advertisements published by the defendant/respondent amount to

     disparagement or not. For adequate settlement of this issue it is

     pertinent to discuss some of the relevant case laws cited by both the

     parties on the issue of disparagement.
                                         22



6.   In the case of Hindustan Unilever Ltd. -v- Reckitt Benckiser (India)

     Ltd. reported in 2014 (2) CHN (Cal) 1, I.P. Mukerji J. subsequent to

     discussing a plethora of precedents came to the conclusion that

     comparing the qualities of one&#x27;s product with those of another is only

     permitted if it is in the nature of a puff, but a trader should not be

     permitted to advertise facts, data, figures and deficiencies of the

     products of another, especially a rival, directly or indirectly by an

     innuendo. Relevant paragraph of the judgment is extracted below:


         &quot;57. It follows that comparing the qualities of one&#x27;s product with those of
         another is only permitted, if it is in the nature of a &quot;puff&quot;. This is so
         because while making a serious comparison of the qualities of a rival
         product, one may directly or indirectly denigrate another product:

              &quot;Counsel for the plaintiffs, on the other hand, accepts that a mere
              puff by any trader of his own products is not actionable, but says
              that the matter becomes quite different if the trader descends to
              particularize precisely why his product is better than his rival&#x27;s or
              his rival&#x27;s is worse than his; and, he says, fairly read, what Tech-
              Data/I in the present case is doing is to say in substance not merely
              that MBS-70 is superior to DEBDUST, but that DEBDUST is not
              proper for its purpose.&quot; (De Beers Case)

         58. Hence, a trader should not be permitted to advertise facts, data,
         figures, deficiencies etc. of the products of another, especially a rival,
         directly or indirectly by an innuendo. This is so, because, one must
         presume a constant bias in the mind of such a trader towards his rival.
         When one presumes this constant bias, one would expect that the
         representations that are made, seriously about a rival&#x27;s product are
         bound to be false, misleading, unfair or deceptive. This is more so
         because one is not in a proper position to make an impartial appraisal of
         a rival&#x27;s product.&quot;



     The court further examined the argument in relation to whether

     comparative advertisements can be supported by the right to freedom

     enshrined in the <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_12">Article 19 (1) (a)</a> of the Constitution of India, and after

     discussing several case laws held as follows:
                                           23
           &quot;75. But I find nothing, in the existing law to permit, a serious
           comparison by a trader of his product with the product of another. This
           would invariably result in the denigration of the latter product or in the
           consumer being prejudiced by it against the other product, as held
           earlier. When this happens, immediately the &quot;commercial speech&quot;
           becomes unfair. In fact, the Division Bench of Delhi High Court in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_13">Dabur
           India Ltd. v. M/s. Colortek Mekhalaya Pvt. Ltd</a>. decided on 2nd February,
           2010 approved a passage from Anson&#x27;s Law of Contract (27th Edn.) that
           commendatory expressions regarding a product are not to be taken as
           serious representations of fact. In other words advertisements lauding a
           product are not to be taken as a representation of fact with regard to the
           product at all. Hence, an action for misrepresentation would not lie. It
           follows, as stated in the De Beers case that generally advertisements are
           not taken seriously by the people. This was reiterated by another Division
           Bench of the Delhi High Court in the case of <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_14">Pepsi Co. Inc. v. Hindustan
           Coca-cola Ltd</a>. reported in 2003 (27) PTC 305 (Del).
           76. In my judgment comparison should not be more than a &quot;puff&quot;.
           Serious comparison invariably tends to denigrate another product and is
           not permitted. Otherwise, the Courts would be reduced to, &quot;a machinery
           for advertising rival productions by obtaining a judicial determination
           which of the two was better&quot;, as rightly observed in White v. Mellin about
           120 years ago.&quot;



7.   In the case of Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. -v- Hindustan Unilever

     Ltd. decided in A.P.O. No. 352 of 2013 on March 14, 2014 it was held

     by a Division Bench, comprising of Ashim Kumar Banerjee, J. &amp; Arijit

     Banerjee, J., of this Hon&#x27;ble Court that comparison should not be more

     than a puff and the use of rival trademark must be in accordance with

     the   honest    practice   without    taking   unfair   advantage    or   being

     detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of the other mark.

     Relevant paragraph of the judgement is extracted below:


           &quot;We have given a close look to the judgment and order impugned. His
           Lordship dealt with all the precedents cited at the bar and summarized
           the proposition of law very correctly, we would produce as hereunder:

             &quot;The principles of law governing disparagement of goods seem to be
             well entrenched and only need to be elucidated.

             The law, in its most general terms, relating to disparagement of goods
             was laid down by the House of Lords in the above case. The House
             opined as follows:
                                          24
             a) A trader can laud his product.

             b) He can even say that his product is the best in the world.

             c) He can declare that his product is better than his rival&#x27;s and in what
             respect it is better.

             d) He cannot say that his rival&#x27;s product is bad, injurious or
             deleterious or make an intentional misrepresentation to mislead
             customers. (Lord Shand at Page 171)

             e) In order to succeed, the plaintiff has to prove special damages. To
             obtain an order of injunction he has to satisfy the Court that damages
             have been suffered or will be suffered in future. (Speech of Lord
             Waston)

             f) Some speeches in White v. Mellins seem to suggest that in the case
             of downright disparagement of another&#x27;s goods, without proof of actual
             or future damages, an action in disparagement will lie. A passage from
             the speech of Lord Shand suggests that in such a case even a pleading
             of special damage is not necessary.&quot;

         His Lordship, after holding as above, observed as follows:

             &quot;But I find nothing in the existing law to permit, a serious comparison
             by a trader of his product with the product of another.&quot;

         &quot;In my judgment comparison should not be more than a &quot;puff&quot;. Here we
         join issue. Trade Mark Act clearly prohibits one registered mark holder to
         take unfair advantage of another mark holder by any advertisement
         detrimental to its distinctive character and reputation. <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_15">Section 30</a> would
         make it clear, nothing in <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_16">Section 29</a> would prevent identifying his own
         goods or service provided the use is in accordance with the honest
         practice and not take unfair advantage or detrimental to the distinctive
         character or repute of the other mark. In our considered view, if someone
         is in a position to justify the comparison even seriously that would not
         offend any statute. Be it puffery, be it serious. On other issues his
         Lordship&#x27;s understands of the law as quoted above, is accurate subject, to
         our view, being expressed herein before. With this mind set in the
         backdrop may we proceed to decide the subject controversy.&quot;&quot;



8.   In the case of Dabur India Ltd. -v- Emami Limited reported in (2019)

     261 DLT 474 it was held by a Single Bench, presided by Sanjeev

     Narula, J., of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court that the primary

     consideration for the Court to discern disparagement is to go into the

     heart   of   the   matter   and   see    the   impact   and   impression     the

     advertisements create. It further observed that the advertisements
                                         25
should be &quot;comparison positive&quot;; message that broadly highlights

slanderous or indiscriminate &quot;negative comparison&quot; should be restricted

by the Courts immediately. In this case Sanjeev Narulla, J. was

examining the Dabur Chyawanprash product and an advertisement by a

rival    brand     that   highlighted    in   the   advertisement     that   Dabur

Chyawanprash contained 50 % sugar while its own product was sugar

free. As the statements in the advertisement were factually true, the

Court refused to injunct the advertisement. Relevant paragraphs of the

judgment are highlighted below:

        &quot;28. From the reading of the above noted judgement, it emerges that the
        Court has to necessarily examine the intent and overall effect of the
        advertisement. The &quot;look and feel&quot; of an advertisement and the message
        conveyed by the story line to an average person, are the critical factors
        which assist the Court to come to a right conclusion. If one were to view
        the proposed modified print advertisement, it can be clearly discerned
        that the Plaintiff&#x27;s product is not the subject matter of comparison. The
        comparison is with Chyawanprash as a generic product. As discussed
        earlier the law permits comparison. While making a comparison, a
        competitor can declare his goods to be the best in the world even though
        the declaration is untrue, however, while claiming that its goods are
        better than his competitor, he cannot say that the competitor&#x27;s goods are
        bad. Thus, puffery is allowed, but slander and defamation of the goods of
        the competitor is impermissible. The proposed Print advertisement is only
        making a comparison with the generic product &quot;Chyawanprash&quot; where a
        declaration is being given that the product of the Defendant does not
        contain sugar. The impugned advertisement in its modified version is
        highlighting the benefits of the sugar free variant. Plaintiff&#x27;s contention
        that Chyawanprash has been shown to be bad or unhealthy is misplaced.
        The way I see it, the modified advertisement only gives the information
        and a choice or option to the viewers/consumers who would like to buy a
        product that is giving the benefit of Chyawanprash without sugar. The
        comparison in the present case is inevitable. The benefit of a product
        without sugar can be best showcased by juxtaposing with the variant that
        has sugar in it. The question whether the sugar free variant is indeed a
        healthier option, is being left for the consumer to decide. But, certainly it
        cannot be said that the advertisement is in any manner implying
        disparagement of &quot;Chyawanprash&quot; generically.

        advertisements is designed with the objective to sway the consumers and
        coax them to buying a particular product or service. Advertisements are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                          26</span>
         used to artistically express and convey the messages to the public. There
         is bound to be creativity, pun and a storyline in such messages, so that it
         creates an impact on the viewers or the readers. To keep the story
         engrossing, companies indulge in making comparisons, to claim that they
         are better than the rest. Some leeway has always to be given to the
         advertiser, but at the same time right to free speech cannot be stretched
         to allow them to become defamatory, disparaging or denigrating. One
         cannot ignore the fundamental characteristic of comparative
         advertisements is appraisal by contrasting the products. There will often
         be an element of negative or adversarial comparison. This is the natural
         outcome or byproduct of &quot;comparison&quot;. Defendant has to be allowed to
         manifest the differentiators in the competing products and also to give
         justifications for encouraging the consumers to prefer its product over
         that of the competitors. The intent behind the comparative
         advertisements will invariably be to persuade the consumers to give
         preference to one of the competing products. Such advertisements either
         expressly or subtly make a claim that the product of the advertiser is a
         better choice. This is permissible in law. The advertisements in question
         do nothing more than that. The paramount consideration for the Court to
         discern disparagement is to go into the heart of the matter and see the
         impact and impression the advertisements create. This simple aspect
         should not be made complex. I am not suggesting that Court should take
         a view instinctively. Of course, in order to decide the question, the Court
         would have to reflect, inquire and assimilate all the relevant factors, but
         the crux of the matter is always the intent and effect, that I have
         described as &quot;look and feel&quot;. The Courts, guided by principles enunciated
         in judicial precedents, should test the merits of the claims of challenge by
         evaluation of the message and effect of the advertisements. The
         comparative advertising campaign should thus be &#x27;comparison positive&#x27;.
         Advertisements often contain valuable information for the consumers and
         can promote healthy competition in the market. If this is the message
         conveyed, the courts would be resilient and allow the negative derivatives
         of comparison. This is because the final outcome is positive. However if it
         can be gauged that the message broadly demonstrates slanderous or
         indiscriminate negative comparison or insinuation, Courts should not be
         slow in ensuring that such messages do not spread. If it does hurt or
         annoy the Plaintiff, it is nothing but display of an over sensitive approach,
         that can&#x27;t be helped.&quot;

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         &quot;37. From this discussion, it is apparent that the advertisement
         disparages the plaintiffs soap and it is not an advertisement which seeks
         merely or only to promote the superiority of the defendant&#x27;s LIFEBUOY
         soap over an ordinary antiseptic soap. As I have already pointed out, if it
         were a case of mere promotion of superiority of the defendant&#x27;s product,
         alone, the plaintiff would not have had a case as that would have only
         entailed a permissible &quot;better&quot; or &quot;best&quot; statement. The advertisement
         comprises of two parts: one which denigrates and disparages the product
         of the plaintiff and the other which promotes the purported superiority of
         defendant&#x27;s LIFEBUOY soap. The part that disparages does so because it
         indulges in the &quot;good versus bad&quot; comparison. The &quot;good&quot; being the
         defendant&#x27;s LIFEBUOY Skin-guard and the &quot;bad&quot; being the orange

    (2021) 85 PTC 83 it was observed by a Single Bench, presided by S.C.

    Gupte, J., of the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court that if the impugned

    advertisement of &#x27;Amla Hair Oil&#x27; released by the defendant portrays that

    other products of &quot;Amla Hair Oil&quot; that are priced lesser than the

    defendant&#x27;s product and are inferior in quality or that it lead to hair fall

    or hair breakage then in such a situation the advertisement campaign

    would fall under the ambit of disparagement. The Court applied the test

    of reasonable/ordinary man while examining the advertisement and

    came to the conclusion that the advertisement did not denigrate the

    product of the plaintiff, and accordingly refused the injunction prayed

    for. Relevant paragraph of the judgment is delineated below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         &quot;8. First of all, this Court cannot persuade itself to believe that in
         substance, the impression sought to be conveyed to an ordinary man on
         the street or buyer of the goods in question is that all products of &#x27;Amla
         Hair Oil&#x27;, which are priced lesser than the Plaintiff&#x27;s &#x27;Amla Hair Oil&#x27;, are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         28</span>
        inferior in quality or that they lead to hair fall or hair breakage. That
        certainly, in my opinion, is not the impression meant to be conveyed or is
        likely to be conveyed to a reasonable man on the street or an ordinary
        consumer of the subject goods. The Defendant, of course, as I have noted
        above, may be said to have meant to use the words &#x27;cheap oil&#x27; or &#x27;sasta
        tel&#x27; as suggestive of lesser price and not necessarily of inferior quality. It
        is, certainly arguable, as Mr. Tulzapurkar suggests, that the word here
        conveys both meanings; it may, in fact, in that sense have been used
        tongue in cheek; but it, by no means, suggests that what the
        advertisement disparages are products of lesser price as a class. What the
        advertisement, taken at its plain face value, conveys is that there could
        be products which are cheap (that is, of lesser price), but the consumers
        better beware-these might be cheap, not just in terms of price, but even
        in terms of quality; these might yet be harmful and lead to conditions
        such as hair fall or hair breakage. In comparison, the Plaintiff&#x27;s products
        are shown as True Amla&#x27;, that is to say, of a purer variety. There is no
        disparagement in this of the whole range of cheaper (in terms of price)
        variety of amla hair oil generally, much less of any one product in
        particular, or, for that matter, the Plaintiff&#x27;s amla hair oil. All that this
        suggests is that the Defendant, in its advertisements, calls upon
        consumers to pay more attention to quality rather than go merely by
        price. The disparagement, in other words, if at all there is any, is of
        products, which are &#x27;cheap&#x27;, not just in terms of price, but also of quality.
        It may well be that both senses of the word &#x27;cheap&#x27; or &#x27;sasta&#x27; are invoked
        in the present case to convey the above. Ambivalence such as this,
        refected in the copy, actually lends literary merit or artistic value or adds
        punch to the advertisement. There is no suggestion here, as Mr.
        Tulzapurkar suggests, that all products of lesser price are generally
        inferior, much less that the Plaintiff&#x27;s product in particular is inferior.&quot;

    J. and Biswanath Somadder, J., of this Hon&#x27;ble Court that a tradesman

    can say that his goods are better than those of the rival. But when the

    impugned statement in the advertisement falls between the two

    extremes i.e. puffery and disparagement, the test is to ask the alleged

    infringer whether they have pointed to a specific allegation of some

    defect or demerit in the competitor&#x27;s product and if such be the case an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       29</span>

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       &quot;It is also held by the House of Lords that in cases where the statement

       a serious claim or not. A possible alternative test is to ask whether the
       defendants have pointed to a specific allegation of some defect or demerit
       in the plaintiff&#x27;s goods. These observations clearly tend to show that in
       case the claim would be seen by the reasonable man as a serious
       assertion and the assertion is false, the action would lie. The same
       proposition has been reiterated in the case of Reckitt &amp; Colman of India

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">12. In the case of Dabur India Ltd. -v- Wipro Limited, Bangalore

   reported in (2006) PTC 677 (Del) it was held by a Single Bench,

   presided by Madan B. Lokur, J., of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court that an

   advertisement that involves comparison between two products, the

   hidden message in such advertisement may be that the product of the

   plaintiff is inferior to that of the defendant but that will always happen

   in case of a comparison. As per law, it is permissible for an advertiser to

   proclaim that its product is the best. This does not necessarily imply

   that all other similar products are inferior. Relevant paragraphs of the

   judgement are mentioned below:
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                         30</span><blockquote id="blockquote_11">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">         &quot;22. The intent of the commercial is to suggest that the product of the
         defendant, that is, Wipro Sanjivani Honey is far superior to that of the
         plaintiff, that is, Dabur Honey. While doing so, the commercial does not
         denigrate or disparage the product of the plaintiff--it merely compares the
         two brands of honey and proclaims that the product of the defendant is
         superior. It seems to me that it is one thing to say that the defendant&#x27;s
         product is better than that of the plaintiff and it is another thing to say
         that the plaintiff&#x27;s product is inferior to that of the defendant. The
         commercial clearly intends to say (and so it does) that as compared to the
         product of the plaintiff, the product of the defendant is far better. The
         hidden message in this may be that the product of the plaintiff is inferior
         to that of the defendant but that will always happen in a case of
         comparison--while comparing two products, the advertised product will
         but naturally have to be shown as better. The law, as accepted by this
         Court, is that it is permissible for an advertiser to proclaim that its
         product is the best. This necessarily implies that all other similar
         products are inferior.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         23. In comparative advertising, a consumer may look at a commercial
         from a particular point of view and come to a conclusion that one product
         is superior to the other, while another consumer may look at the same
         commercial from another point of view and come to a conclusion that one
         product is inferior to the other. Disparagement of a product should be
         defamatory or should border on defamation, a view that has consistently
         been endorsed by this Court. In other words, the degree of disparagement
         must be such that it would tantamount to, or almost tantamount to
         defamation. In the present case, the overall audio-visual impact does not
         leave an impression that the story line of the commercial and the
         message that is sought to be conveyed by it is that Dabur Honey is being
         denigrated, but rather that Wipro Sanjivani Honey is better.

         counted, adverse advertising may temporarily damage its market
         acceptability, but certainly not in the long run.&quot;

    Sharma, J., of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court that even if there is no

    direct reference to the product of the plaintiff, a reference is made to the

    entire class of Chyawanprash in its generic sense and in such

    circumstances disparagement is possible. Relevant paragraphs of the

    judgement are presented below:
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                31</span><blockquote id="blockquote_17">
</blockquote><p id="p_8">&quot;7. In the light of the aforesaid legal position, I have to scrutinize and
examine the position in the present case to come to a conclusion as to
whether or not an injunction should be granted in favour of the plaintiff,
as prayed for, for any disparagement or defamation or insinuation to the
goods of the plaintiff in the advertisement in question. The aforesaid
advertisement appears on the electronic media for a few seconds and it
shows Sunny Deol saying that Chayawanprash is not to be taken in the
summer months and instead Amritprash is to be taken. The message that
is sought to be conveyed by the aforesaid T.V commercial is that
consumption of Chayawanprash during the summer months is not
advisable and Amritprash is more effective substitute for Chayawanprash
in summer season. The plaintiff is manufacturing and marketing and has
a market share of 63% of the total market of Chayawanprash throughout
India and, therefore, is vitally interested in seeing that Chayawanprash is
sold through India during all the seasons. If, on the other hand, the said
product is sold and marketed only for a few months of the year and not
throughout the year the business of the plaintiff is going to be vitally and
prejudicially affected. It is also brought on record that the defendant has
a market share of about 12% of the total market in Chayawanprash
throughout India whereas in the market of Amritprash, which is a new
product being brought out by the defendant, there is no other competitor
in the market. Therefore, what is sought to be done by the defendant is to
forbid and exclude user of Chayawanprash during the summer months so
that it can exclusively capture the Indian market during the summer
months, which is sought to be done by sending a message that
consumption of Chayawanprash during the summer season serves no
purpose and Amritprash is more effective substitute thereof and thereby
attempting to induce an unwary consumer into believing that
Chayawanprash should not be taken in summer months at all and
Amritprash is the substitute for it. The aforesaid effort on the part of the
defendant would be definitely a disparagement of the product
Chayawanprash and even in generic term the same would adversely affect
the product of the plaintiff. The presence of the defendant in the market
is only to the extent of 12% of the total market of Chayawanprash in
India whereas the plaintiff has about 67% share/presence in the Indian
market and if sale of Chayawanprash is weeded out from the market
during the summer months, the plaintiffs presence in the market for sale
of Chayawanprash is adversely affected. In my considered opinion, even if
there be no direct reference to the product of the plaintiff and only a
reference is made to the entire class of Chayawanprash in its generic
sense, even in those circumstances disparagement is possible. There is
insinuation against user of Chayawanprash during the summer months,
in the advertisement in question, for Dabur Chayawanprash is also a
Chayawanprash as against which disparagement is made. To the same
effect is the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_17">Reckitt &amp; Colman of
India Limited v. M.P. Ram-chandran &amp; Another</a> (supra).
....
</p><p id="p_9">....
</p><p id="p_10">9. In my considered opinion, when the defendant is propagating in the
advertisement that there should be no consumption of Chayawanprash
during the summer months, it is also propagating that the plaintiffs
Chayawanprash should not also be taken during the summer months as
it is not good for health and instead Amritprash, which is the defendant&#x27;s
product, should be taken. Such an advertisement is clearly disparaging to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                        32</span>

        in the said advertisement.&quot;

    without specifically identifying or pin pointing the rival product is

        bad is not permissible. I respectfully agree with the views of the two
        Single Judges and indeed am bound by such decisions.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">        11. According to the counsel for the plaintiff, a learned Single Judge in
        Dabur India (supra) has followed the Calcutta High Court judgment in
        Reckitt Coleman (supra) and specifically held that a generic
        disparagement would entitle even a plaintiff with 12% market share to
        complain and the present plaintiff with 80% share of the market of the
        decried generic product is thus entitle to impugn advertisements which
        disparage the generic product.

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        12. In my view the law relating to generic disparagement of a specified
        commodity and the entitlement of one of such unidentified manufacture
        of such decried product is settled by Dabur&#x27;s judgment following the
        Reckitt Coleman judgment. The Dabur&#x27;s judgment (supra) indeed in
        paragraph 9 refers specifically to and proscribes generic disparagement.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">        13. While Mr. Rohtagi is right in submitting that the generic

        Judge in Reckitt &amp; Coleman&#x27;s case (supra) which was followed in Dabur&#x27;s
        case, yet I am of the view that the position of law about generic
        disparagement in Dabur&#x27;s case was not only justified but also warranted.
        Even if the ratio of the two learned Single Judges&#x27; judgments of this Court
        is considered to be only in respect of an identified product, in principle
        there is no reason why the manufacturer of a disparaged product, which
        though not identified by name, cannot complain of and seek to injunct
        such disparagement.

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">        19. I am further of the view that generic disparagement of a rival product
        without specifically identifying or pin pointing the rival product is equally
        objectionable. Clever advertising can indeed hit a rival product without
        specifically referring to it. No one can disparage a class or genre of a
        produce within which a complaining plaintiff falls and raise a defence
        that the plaintiff has not been specifically identified. In this context the
        plaintiff has rightly rejected the offer of the defendant to drop the
        container from its advertisement so as to avoid the averred identification
        of the plaintiff&#x27;s product.&quot;

</blockquote><p id="p_14">15. Upon a close and conjoint examination of the judgements cited by the

    parties, in my view, certain undisputable principles emerge. The key

    principles that are required to be kept in the Court&#x27;s mind before

    deciding on whether the offending advertisement is disparaging or is a

    mere puffery are elucidated below :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">        a) While deciding the issue of disparagement the court has to apply

        the reasonable man test, that is, whether a reasonable man would

        take the claim being made as being a serious claim or not.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">        b) The impugned advertisement campaign has to be looked into

        with a broader perspective to decide whether a serious comparison

        is made by the alleged infringer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">        c) The comparison in the nature of &quot;Better or Best&quot; based on

        truthful claims is permitted, but comparison in the nature of &quot;Good

        v. Bad&quot; is not.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">        d) The impact and impression of the impugned advertisements has

        to be examined and if it gives out an impression that the rival

        product has a defect or demerit (which is not true) then such

        impression would make it disparaging.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       34</span><blockquote id="blockquote_30">
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">        e) The comparison between rival products is allowed only to the

        extent of &quot;Puff&quot; and honest trade practice. Any malicious or

        deliberate depiction of rival product in a bad taste is not permitted.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">        f) Generic disparagement of a rival product without specifically

        identifying or pin pointing the rival product is equally objectionable,

        clever advertising can indeed hit a rival product without specifically

        referring to it. No one can disparage a class or genre of a product

        within which a complaining plaintiff falls and raise a defence that

        the plaintiff has not been specifically identified.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_33">        g) The comparative advertising campaign should be &#x27;comparison

        positive&#x27;. If the advertisements contain valuable information for the

        consumers and can promote healthy competition in the market, the

        courts should be resilient and allow the negative derivatives of such

        comparison. This is because the final outcome is positive. However

        if it can be gauged that the message broadly demonstrates

        slanderous or indiscriminate negative comparison or insinuation,

        Courts should not be slow in ensuring that such messages do not

        spread.

</blockquote><p id="p_15">16. In Hindustan Unilever Limited (supra), the court dealt with the

    impugned advertisement of kitchen cleaning liquid. The petitioner was

    successful in getting relief from the court because the nature of

    advertisement was serious. The two rival products were compared with

    each other in a manner which highlighted that the advertised product is

    far superior in cleaning the dishes as compared to its rival. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      35</span>
    superiority of the advertised product was established by pointing and

    insinuating that the rival product is deficient and lacks cleaning

    property. Overall impression of the advertisement portrayed the rival

    product in a bad light and the claim with regard to deficiencies of the

    rival product was not established as a true statement by the advertiser.

    In light of such facts, the court held that the comparison of qualities

    was not in the nature of a &quot;puff&quot;, moreover, the court held that

    advertising data, figures etc. of the rival products should not be

    permitted. The above case squarely applies to the present dispute

    because the comparison made by the defendant/respondent is

    specifically pointing towards deficiency of the other rival products

    including the petitioner&#x27;s product. Moreover, the claim made by the

    defendant/respondent with regard to number of ingredients of the

    rival product is false and misleading.
</p>
<p id="p_16">

</p><p id="p_17">17. The argument raised by the Counsel for the respondent with regard to

    generic disparagement that the impugned advertisements do not identify

    petitioner&#x27;s product is not relevant because it is obvious that the

    petitioner being the leading brand in the market with 63 % share will be

    hit the most by such serious comparison. The above finding is in

    consonance with the ratio of Hindustan Unilever Limited (supra) and

    Emami Ltd. (supra) reported in 2004 (75) DRJ 356. Therefore, the

    argument made by defendant with regard to no specific identification of

    petitioner&#x27;s product does not hold water.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       36</span><p id="p_18">
</p><p id="p_19">18. In Dabur India Ltd. (supra) reported in (2019) 261 DLT 474, relied on

    by the defendant, the court dealt with a comparison between a sugar-

    free Chyawanprash and a normal Chyawanprash. It decided the issue in

    favour of the defendant advertiser because the impugned advertisement

    only sent an impactful message that Chyawanprash, as a matter of fact,

    contains 50 % sugar. In such a case, the defendant&#x27;s right of free speech

    permits it to state the benefits of its product and is also entitled to make

    the comparison to such extent. However, in the present case, the

    defendant did not exercise its right to free speech in an honest manner.

    When the defendant highlights that other Chyawanprash contain

    only 42 ingredients, which is an untrue statement, it cannot claim

    right to free speech as the same is not allowed to communicate

    untruthful facts about the other rival products. Hence, the present

    case does not help the defendant in any manner. The case of Tata

    Press Limited (supra), relied on by the defendant/respondent with

    regard to the right to free speech is also not applicable due to the above

    reason.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">19. The other cases relied on by the defendant do not apply to the present

    fact scenario. The case of M/s Colortek Meghalaya (supra) is not

    applicable to the present case and it is distinguishable on facts. The

    advertisement in that case did not target the product overtly or covertly.

    The advertisement was playing around the grey area which is

    permissible as per the law. However, in the present case, direct

    comparison of number of ingredients between the two products is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                          37</span>
    not in the realm of grey area as it points towards the very

    composition and data of the generic product available in the

    market.        Furthermore,    the   comparison       with      a   number    of

    ingredients, that is, 42 ingredients, is malicious and slanderous as

    the product cannot be complete with 42 ingredients and the

    product of Chyawanprash in the market are all having at least 47

    ingredients as per the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_18">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940. Ergo, a

    comparison with a fictitious number that is lesser than the

    minimum requirement, insinuates that those products are not in

    compliance with the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_19">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940. Such a

    comparison       is   slanderous and       mischievous,       and   accordingly,

    amounts to disparagement.

<p id="p_22">

    Conclusion:
</p>
<p id="p_23">20. Annexure &quot;I&quot; is in the form of a comparative chart issued by the

    respondent on its website and also made available for viewership on e-

    commerce websites including Amazon Flipkart, Snapdeal, etc. The

    respondent       in   this    advertisement    claims        that   Baidhyanath

    Chyawanprash Special is &quot;enriched with 52 Ayurvedic herbs&quot; whereas

    &quot;ordinary Chyawanprash&quot; are made &quot;with 42 ingredients only&quot;; thereby

    suggesting to an unsuspecting consumer that Ordinary Chyawanprash

    are incomplete or deficient. In my view, such comparison falls under the

    ambit     of    &quot;negative    comparison&quot;    because     it     portraits   Dabur

    Chyawanprash as inferior or lacking in ten more ingredients that are

    allegedly essential for it to be complete. The statement made by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                              38</span>
    defendant/respondent            is    not     positive     because         calling     other

    Chyawanprash in the market as &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; is serious

    comparison which is not protected as commercial speech under the law.

    More importantly, the comparison made in the above advertisement is

    based on false information as the respondent has admitted in its

    affidavit that its product has qualities of &quot;52 ingredients&quot; and does not

    contain &quot;52 herbs&quot;. Furthermore, the comparison with &quot;42 ingredients&quot;

    is not proper and is misleading the consumers. Mr. Biala has fairly

    submitted before the Court that the advertisement does contain false

    and      misleading       statements.        Therefore,    this    advertisement          is

    permanently injuncted.
</p>
<p id="p_24">

</p><p id="p_25">21. Annexure        &quot;J&quot;    refers   to    other    Chyawanprash         including        Dabur

    Chyawanprash as &quot;Ordinary&quot; or &quot;Aam&quot; (in Hindi) and raises a question

    &quot;whether        your    Chyawanprash          is   complete&quot;      (i.e.,    &quot;kya     aapka

    Chyawanprash Sampoorn hai?, in Hindi). The question gives a

    direct/indirect        impression     that    other     Chyawanprash          (which    are

    &quot;ordinary&quot;) are deficient Ayurvedic medicine formulations, not made as

    per the traditional recipe and they do not provide immunity, extra

    energy     or    help     sharp      brain    growth,     while   only      Baidhyanath

    Chyawanprash is &quot;Special&quot;, complete, and provides immunity, extra

    energy and helps sharp brain growth. The argument made by the

    defendant that it has not depicted petitioner&#x27;s product anywhere in the

    advertisement is not tenable as the entire advertisement has to be

    looked at through a broader perspective and through the eyes of an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                        39</span>
    ordinary consumer. Usage of the word &quot;ordinary&quot; (&#x27;Aam&#x27; in Hindi) and

    &quot;others&quot; (&#x27;Oron&#x27; in Hindi) does include petitioner&#x27;s product as well.

    Advertisement campaigns of such nature do not only affect the

    petitioner that has substantial part of market share, but also identifies

    all other products as inferior. Furthermore, the comparison with 42

    ingredients is a false one and disparaging in nature (as explained in

    paragraph 19). In my view, the first part of the advertisement in relation

    to the question &quot;kya aapka Chyawanprash Sampoorn hai (translates in

    English as &quot;whether your Chyawanprash is complete?&quot; is only puffery

    and highlights the product of the defendant only. In the event the

    comparison to &quot;42 ingredients&quot; is removed, the advertisement would not

    be disparaging. Accordingly, the advertisement in its present form is

    injuncted. However, if the defendant removes the reference to &quot;42

    ingredients&quot;, the advertisement may be displayed in future.



</p><p id="p_26">22. In Annexure &quot;K&quot;, the respondent refers to its product as &quot;complete&quot;

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">    (Sampoorn in Hindi) to convey that Chyawanprash comprising of 52

    ingredients is &quot;complete&quot;. The advertisement further communicates that

    respondent&#x27;s product is made with 100% pure ghee while others are

    made with a mixture of vegetable oil and ghee. In my view this

    comparison would not be disparaging as the same is based on a true

    statement. Dabur Chyawanprash contains &#x27;til oil&#x27; which is derived from

    &#x27;til seeds&#x27;, that is, sesame seeds. Sesame oil or &#x27;til oil&#x27; is indeed an edible

    vegetable oil derived from sesame seeds. Ergo, the statement of the

    defendant is not false. Accordingly, this comparison of &#x27;100 % pure ghee&#x27;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      40</span>
    with &#x27;a mixture of vegetable oil and ghee&#x27; is not disparaging. However,

    the comparison of 42 ingredients is based on a false statement and is

    disparaging in nature. (as explained in paragraph 19) In the event the

    comparison to &quot;42 ingredients&quot; is removed, the advertisement would not

    be disparaging. Accordingly, the advertisement in its present form is

    injuncted. However, if the defendant removes the reference to &quot;42

    ingredients&quot;, the advertisement may be displayed in future.



</blockquote><p id="p_27">23. In Annexure &quot;L&quot;, the respondent claims through an L- band television

    advertisement that &quot;Complete Chyawanprash is the one that is

    formulated as per correct formulation&quot; (&quot;Sampoorn Chyawanprash wahi,

    jiski vidhi ho sahi!&quot; in Hindi). The primary distinction between Annexure

    &quot;L&quot; and Annexure &quot;J&quot; and &quot;K&quot; is that there is no mention of the

    comparison of ingredients between two different products of the parties

    i.e. Dabur &amp; Baidyanath. In Annexure &quot;L&quot;, there is no &quot;negative

    comparison&quot; between the products with respect to oil content of the

    Chyawanprash i.e. vegetable oil or ghee etc., it only highlights a generic

    statement about completeness of the Chyawanprash. The broad

    message that could be inferred from the advertisement is not of the

    nature that puts the petitioner&#x27;s product on a lower pedestal. Thus, in

    my view, it would not qualify as disparagement.
</p>
<p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">24. Lastly, in Annexure &quot;M&quot;, the respondent publishes a full-fledged video

    on social media on its official YouTube channel. In this video, there is a

    comparison    between     Respondent&#x27;s     Chyawanprash       and   other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                  41</span>
Chyawanprash. In the advertisement, husband walks into the living

room with a bag containing grocery items in his hand. When the wife

takes out the bottle of Chyawanprash from the grocery bag, the label

read &quot;Chyawanprash &#x27;42 ingredients&#x27; &quot;. After looking at the product the

wife is shocked and disappointed to see that her husband has bought

ordinary &quot;Chyawanprash&quot; with only &quot;42 ingredients&quot;. After that, she

questions the choice of her husband by asking him the name of

Chyawanprash to which the husband responds that it does not matter

and thereafter he continues to watch cricket and says that his team has

to make only 52 run to win. After this, the wife is flabbergasted with her

husband&#x27;s ignorance &amp; choice of Chyawanprash and correlates the

ingredients of ordinary Chyawanprash with the ongoing cricket match

and poses a question: What if the team scores only 42 runs? To this

question, the husband mockingly responds that 52 runs are required

and not just 42. Thereafter, the wife states that just like your cricket

match, to prevent illness, we need the power of total of 52 Ayurvedic

ingredients and not just 42, only then we will win. The entire chain of

events in the video advertisement points out to the comparison which

has been drawn by the respondent in the previous print versions of the

campaign.   Unlike   the   previous   print   advertisements,   this   video

advertisement has a higher degree of serious comparison which portrays

the other rival Chyawanprash brands in a bad light. The message which

is being conveyed to the ordinary consumer is that in order to qualify to

be a complete Chyawanprash one must consume the complete
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       42</span>
    Chyawanprash with all the necessary 52 ingredients otherwise it will not

    be beneficial for their health.
</p>
<p id="p_30">

</p><p id="p_31">25. A misleading advertising, as the term implies, is one that deceives,

    manipulates, or is likely to deceive or manipulate the consumer. These

    commercials have the potential to influence consumer&#x27;s purchase

    preference in the market and it also harms its rivals, hence, they must

    be used with caution. There should be a balance between the right of

    commercial speech and the interest of public and competitors. In the

    present case, the video advertisement is, to a large extent, misleading.

    As agreed by both the parties that comparative advertisement within the

    gambit of puffery under the law is allowed. The problem however, in

    my view, arises when a bottle highlighting 42 ingredients and

    labeled   as    &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27;     is   shown       in   the   respondent&#x27;s

    advertisement. Under <a href="/doc/737172/" id="a_20">Section 3</a> (a) of the Drugs &amp; Cosmetic Act,

    1940 and as agreed by both parties, there can be no Chyawanprash

    available in the market with 42 ingredients. The ayurvedic texts

    prescribed and approved under the First Schedule of the Act lays

    down a minimum of 47 ayurvedic ingredients that are required for

    the product to qualify as &quot;Chyawanprash&quot;. By showing 42 ingredients

    on the bottle of Chyawanprash, and thereafter, referring to the same in

    comparison     to 52   ingredients at two      crucial   junctures in    the

    advertisement, the defendant falls with the realm of slander as the

    advertisement     clearly   compares    its   own    product    with    other

    &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27; that contain only 42 ingredients. As pointed out in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                        43</span>
paragraph 19 above, reference to the number &#x27;42&#x27; is not permissible as

&#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27; cannot be made with only 42 ingredients and would not

qualify as a &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27; as per Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_21">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940. The

very statement that Chyawanprash is available in the market with &#x27;42

ingredients&#x27; is a mischievous and false statement that would create

confusion in the minds of the general public. The reference to &#x27;42

ingredients&#x27; is an innuendo that the Chyawanprash of all other brands

is an incomplete formulation and is not &#x27;Chyawanprash&#x27; at all. Such a

comparison is not only deleterious but a factually false statement that

denigrates all other brands of Chyawanprash. Precedents cited by both

parties make it clear that true statements can be made even if it

denigrates the rival&#x27;s product, but false and misleading statements

cannot be allowed under the guise of free speech. In light of the same,

this video advertisement is disparaging and an action from this Court

would   lie.   In   light   of   the   reasons   provided   above,   this   video

advertisement is permanently injuncted. However, keeping in mind the

various precedents cited by both the parties, and on suggestions that

had fallen from the Bar, a modified version of the video advertisement

may be allowed on the following conditions:
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">    a) The bottle that is shown in the 6th second of the advertisement
