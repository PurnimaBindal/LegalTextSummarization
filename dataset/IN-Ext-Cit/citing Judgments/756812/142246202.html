                     of the prosecution. Admittedly, the appellants and the family of the

                     marriage with the concurrence of the members and elders of both

                     families and there had been no demand of dowry at the time of

                     marriage and after the marriage, the deceased and the first accused

                     were living separately away from their in-laws.        The victim was

                     depressed for being unable to conceive and that the first appellant

                     had been taking her for treatment for conception even as per the

                     case of the prosecution.         There was an earlier complaint dated

                     24.1.2011 on account of misunderstanding and difference of opinion

                     within the family and thereby A1 and the victim had been living in a

                     separate home and based on such complaint, enquiry was conducted

                     and the victim herself had given a written reply Ex.P2 to All Women

                     Police Station that there was difference of opinion between her and

                     her husband and that her in-laws had agreed not to interfere in their

                     problem and that she had also given an undertaking that she would

                     not attempt to commit suicide in any circumstance.       It would show

                     demanded                   Rs.2,00,000/- for repairing a house and that he had

                     made the victim to do the household chores. The allegation of

                     demanding of Rs.2,00,000/- is vague and bald and it is only an

                     improvement made during the trial and the same is not reflected in

                     the RDO Report, Ex.P10 dated 30.1.2012.

                     a difference of opinion between the deceased and A1 and she had

                     gone back to her parents home and gave a complaint before the Perur

                     All Women Police Station on 24.1.2011 with regard to the harassment

                     made by the accused for which CSR No.28/11 was given. PW20, Sub

                     the deceased had come to the house of PW1 and PW2 and had stated

                     accused. P.Ws.1 and 2 had further deposed that on 29.1.2012, at

                     5.00 pm, while PW2 was going near Madukarrai for business, some

                     one called him through phone and come to Alagesan Hospital and

                                    property or valuable security must have some

                                    connection with the marriage of the parties and a

                                  joined the appellant in his house at Kagaziguda. He

                                  has, thereafter, stated that the appellant used to

                                  work in a xerox-cum-typing institute in Nampally

                                  and   in   the    sixth   month    after   marriage,     the

                                  the appellant asked her to bring Rs 50,000 from

                                  them as he was intending to purchase a computer

                                  and set up his own business. Similarly, PW 4 has

                                  stated in her evidence that five months after the

                                  marriage, the appellant sent her away to their

                                  house and when she questioned her, she told that

                                  the appellant was demanding Rs 50,000 and that

                                  the demand for money is to purchase a computer

                                  to start his own business. Thus, the evidence of PW

                                  1 and PW 4 is that the demand of Rs 50,000 by the

                                  appellant was made six months after the marriage

                                  and that too for purchasing a computer to start his

                                  own business. It is only with regard to this demand

                                  of Rs 50,000 that the trial court has recorded a

                                  finding of guilt against the appellant for the offence

                                  under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_38">Section 304-B</a> IPC and it is only in relation to

                                  this demand of Rs.50,000 for purchase           of a

                                  computer to start a business made by the appellant

                                  six months after the marriage that the High Court

                                  has also confirmed the findings of the trial court

                                  with the marriage and was not really a “dowry
