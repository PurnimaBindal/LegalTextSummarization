:COMMON JUDGMENT       
  (Judgment of the Court was delivered by S.MANIKUMAR,J)        
                Since the issue involved in all these writ appeals and review
applications is one and the same, they are heard together and disposed of by
this common judgment.  
                2.The common issue involved in all these writ appeals  and the
review applications is with regard to the approval of the appointments of the
contesting respondents/writ petitioners, who are all working in government
aided private schools as non-teaching staff.
                3.Necessary facts required for the disposal of these writ appeals
and review applications are as follows:
                (a)The contesting respondents/writ petitioners are all working as
non-teaching staffs such as Junior Assistants, Record Clerks, Office
Assistants, Sweeper, Gardener, Waterman, watchman, etc., in Government aided   
private schools.  They were all appointed/promoted against the vacancies
arose due to retirement.    When proposals relating to their appointment were
sent to the concerned educational authorities for approval, they were
returned by the authorities on the ground that the ban imposed by the
Government for filling up of vacant posts has not been lifted in respect of
non-teaching staff and therefore their appointments could not be approved.
Challenging the rejection of their requests for approval, those who were
appointed as non-teaching staff have filed writ petitions before this Court.
                (b)Such writ petitions were allowed by the writ court, following
earlier orders passed in similar writ petitions/writ appeals.  Orders passed
in one batch of writ petitions in W.P.(MD)Nos.6542 and 6544 of  2014, dated
28.04.2014, against which Writ Appeal (MD) Nos.888 to 891 of 2014 have been 
preferred, read as under:
        "In all these writ petitions, the petitioners are aggrieved against the
order passed in refusing to approve the appointment in their respective non-
teaching post by relevant on a letter dated 26.05.2006, issued by the
Government. 
        2.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that the
issue involved in this case is squarely covered by the decision made in
W.P.No.5178 of 2007, dated 01.08.2012, wherein the learned Single Judge has 
discussed the very same Government letter dated 26.05.2006 and found that the
said order was already quashed by this Court by various proceedings.
        3.The learned Additional Government Pleader appearing for the
respondents 1 to 3, is not disputing the said fact.
        4.On perusal of the order passed by the learned Single Judge in
W.P.(MD).No.5178 of 2007, dated 01.08.2012, it is seen that the reasons
stated in the impugned order in these writ petitions cannot be sustained in
any manner. The relevant paragraph Nos.8 to 15 of the above said order is
extracted here-under:   
        "8. The fourth respondent called for an application through the tamil
newspaper "Daily Thanthi" on 17/3/2004 to fill up the vacancy of watchman
that arose due to the retirement of one Ramasamy. The petitioner applied for
the same and he was selected and appointed by the fourth respondent on 
11/6/2004.
        9. The fourth respondent sent proposals for approval of the appointment
to the third respondent and the same was returned by the impugned order dated
5/1/2007 of the third respondent.
        10. The respondents have filed a counter affidavit and it is stated
therein that the third respondent returned proposals in view of G.O.Ms.No.212
P &amp; AR Department, dated 29/8/2011 imposing a ban on recruitment.  
        11. Already this Court has held in the order dated 6/3/2009 in
W.P.No.1722 of 2009 that G.O.Ms.No.212 (Personnel and Administrative Reforms   
- P) dated 29/11/2001 imposing ban on recruitment could not be applied to the
aided Schools, which is governed by the Tamil Nadu Private Schools
(Regulation) Act. Paragraph 12 of the said order is extracted in this
regard:-
"No doubt G.O.Ms.No.212 (Personnel and Administrative Reforms [P] Department   
dated 29/11/2001, a ban has been imposed for appointment. However, the said 
ban would relate only to Government employments and it has not relevance to
the appointments made by the private Schools. Further the ban imposed in the
said Government order had been cancelled by the subsequent Government Order   
namely G.O.Ms.No.14 (Personnel and Administrative Reforms (P) Department)   
dated 7/2/2006. Further more, G.O.Ms.No.115, School Education (D 2) 
Department, dated 30/5/2007 does not prohibit the filling up of Lab
Assistants in private Schools. Perhaps the second respondent is under the
misconception that G.O.Ms.Nos.212 and 115 prohibit the appointment in private
Schools."
        12. The appeal preferred against the said order in W.A.No.267 of 2009
was rejected on 12/8/2009.
        13. Hence, the reason given by the third respondent for returning the
proposal cannot be sustained.
        14. Likewise, the reliance placed on G.O.Ms.No.115 in the counter
affidavit cannot also be sustained, since G.O.Ms.No.115 was issued very much
later to the appointment of the petitioner. Hence the G.O., could not be
applied to the case of the petitioner. The Government letter dated 25/5/2006
and the consequential letter dated 21/8/2006 of the Director of School
Education stating that the vacancies of non-teaching post in aided School
shall not be filled up were quashed by this Court by various writ
proceedings. I have followed those judgment in my order dated 17/7/2012 made
in W.P.(MD) No.1410 of 2007. 
        15. For the aforesaid reasons, this writ petition is allowed and the
impugned order is quashed. The third respondent is directed to approve the
appointment of the petitioner as watchman from the date of his appointment
and to pay all monetary benefits. The said exercise has to be carried out
within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this
order. No costs. Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petitions are
closed."
        5.Considering the fact that the issue involved in these cases squarely
covered by the above said decisions made in W.P.(MD).No.5178 of 2007 dated  
01.08.2012, all these writ petitions are allowed and the impugned orders are
set aside and consequently, the third respondent is directed to approve the
appointment of the respective petitioners and to disburse all service
monitory benefits to them from the date of their appointment and pass the
said order within a period of twelve weeks from the date of receipt of a copy
of this order. No costs."
                4.Aggrieved by the orders, allowing the writ petitions and
directing the authorities to approve the appointments of the writ petitioners
from the date of lifting of the ban, the present appeals have been filed by
the State and its authorities.
                5.Service particulars of the writ petitioners,  as given by the
learned Special Government Pleader, are tabulated as under:

                6.Inter alia, the following are the grounds raised by the
appellants in assailing the orders passed in the writ petitions.
        (i)As per G.O.Ms.No.49, P &amp; AR Department, dated 14.05.2002, Group 'D' 
Category Posts, such as Sweeper, Scavenger, Cleaner, Gardener, Office 
Assistants, etc., have to be outsourced and entrusted on contract basis and
therefore the appointment of writ petitioners, during the ban period, on
regular time scale of pay, is in violation of the guidelines issued in the
above Government Order and this aspect has not been considered by this Court.
        (ii)When proposals were received from the Aided Private Schools to
approve appointments of non-teaching staff made during the ban period, the
authorities concerned sought clarification from the Director of School
Education and in response, the Director of School Education, by letter dated
26.05.2006, has clarified that until further orders, necessity to lift the
ban for recruiting non-teaching staff does not arise and hence the
appointment of writ petitioners during ban period, that too in regular time
scale, is in violation of G.O.Ms.No.49, P &amp; AR Department, dated 14.05.2002.
This aspect also has not been considered and discussed in the earlier
decisions.
        (iii)After lifting the general ban issued vide G.O.Ms.No.212, Personnel
and Administrative Reforms Department, dated 29.11.2001, vide G.O.Ms.No.14, P  
&amp; A.R.Department, dated 07.02.2006, G.O.Ms.No.91, P &amp; A.R.Department, dated    
06.07.2006, came to be issued  to the effect that all estimated vacancies for
all categories of recruitment should be placed before the Staff Committee and
the guidelines issued in G.O.Ms.No.49, Personnel and Administrative
Department, dated 14.05.2002, are to be followed.   Therefore, the
appointments made during the ban period and even after ban period, without
following the guidelines issued in G.O.Ms.No.49, Personnel and Administrative
Department, dated 14.05.2002, are not to be approved and this aspect has not
been dealt with in the earlier orders, which were followed in subsequent
orders.
                (iv)Vide G.O.Ms.No.37,  School Education (R2) Department, dated 
08.02.2007, permission was granted to fill up various categories of non-
teaching staff to the extent of numbers mentioned therein and beyond that,
ban continued in respect of all other categories and this aspect has not been
considered in the earlier decisions.
                (v)In G.O.Ms.No.115, School Education (D2) Department, dated 
30.05.2007, again permission to fill up non teaching staff was given,
pointing out what are the posts and how many posts could be filled up and
which posts should not be filled up and which posts to be filled up by
outsourcing method, etc.  As in these cases, appointments were made in 
violation of this Government Order, those appointments cannot be approved.
                7.Therefore, it is contended by the learned Special Government
Pleader that the judgments relied on by the learned Single Judges cannot be
applied to these cases.  Further, in some cases, orders have been passed
without giving an opportunity to the appellant/respondents to file their
counters touching upon all the Government Orders in this regard.  The review
applications have also been filed raising the same grounds.
                8.Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents/writ
petitioners contended, inter alia, that the issue involved is no more res
integra, as more than one Division Benches of this Court have considered and
discussed about the applicability of G.O.Ms.No.91,  P &amp; A.R.Department, dated
06.07.2006, G.O.Ms.No.37,  School Education (R2) Department, dated 08.02.2007   
and G.O.Ms.No.115, School Education (D2) Department, dated  30.05.2007, in  
approving the appointment of non-teaching staff in aided private schools and
held that they are not applicable to the non-teaching staff working in
private aided schools.  It is also contended that as per Rule 15 of the Tamil
Nadu Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Rules, 1974, prior approval of
educational authorities  need not be obtained in appointing non-teaching
staff and further any regular sanctioned posts should be filled only with
regular appointment and not by any other method, namely outsourcing or on
contract basis and hence those Government Orders are not applicable to the
facts of the present cases.   They further submitted that the writ petitions
were allowed by the learned Single Judges, by following the decisions of
Hon'ble Division Benches of this Court on this issue and therefore the writ
appeals and review applications are liable to be dismissed.
                9.It is the further contention of the respondents/writ
petitioners that pursuant to the orders passed by this Court, the Government
have implemented the orders of this Court by issuing separate Government
Orders in respect of similarly placed persons and therefore the acts of the
appellants in not approving the appointment of the respondents/writ
petitioners would amount to violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution of India.
                10.Before venturing to consider the rival submissions, it is
necessary to extract the relevant Government Orders issued touching upon the
issues involved. The origin of this issue is from G.O.Ms.No.212, P &amp; AR (P)
Department, dated 29.11.2001, wherein the Government issued a complete ban  
order for filling up of vacant posts, except in certain categories of posts,
which reads as under:
                        "GOVERNMENT OF TAMIL NADU        
Abstract
        Public Services - Filling up of vacant posts except certain categories
of posts such as Teachers, Doctors and Police Constabulary completely banned 
- orders issued.

</p><p id="p_139">                20.It is the main contention of the learned Special Government
Pleader that G.O.Ms.No.91,  P &amp; A.R.Department, dated 06.07.2006,  
G.O.Ms.No.37,  School Education (R2) Department, dated 08.02.2007 and   
G.O.Ms.No.115, School Education (D2) Department, dated  30.05.2007, issued by  
the Government in respect of appointing non-teaching staff in aided Private
Schools have not been considered by this Court in its earlier judgments and
therefore the judgments relied upon by the learned Single Judges are not
applicable to the present cases.
</p><p id="p_140">                21.But, we are not in agreement with the submission of the
learned Special Government Pleader.  As rightly contended by the learned
counsel for the respondents/writ petitioners, in all the decisions rendered
earlier, the applicability of above Government Orders and letters issued
thereafter have been considered and discussed.  Even in the decision rendered
by a Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in W.A.(MD)No.36 of 2010, dated
16.07.2013, against which Review Application(MD)No.98 of 2015 has been filed,
the Hon'ble Division Bench has considered those Government Orders and 
rejected the appeal filed by the Educational Authorities.  It is useful to
extract the whole judgment, which reads as under:
</p><p id="p_141">        "The Chief Educational Officer of the Kanyakumari District and the
District Educational Officer of the Kanyakumari District have preferred this
Writ Appeal as against the order of the learned single Judge dated
06.03.2009, who allowed Writ Petition (MD)No.1718 of 2009 following the
decision of this Court in 2008 (5) CTC 648 (Thiruvalluvar Higher secondary
School, Palamaner Road, Gudiyattam, Vellore District rep. by the Secretary,
School Committee, K.M.Govindarjan ..Vs.. The Government of Tamil Nadu rep. by  
its Secretary, Department of School Education, Fort St.George, Chennai and
three others).
</p><p id="p_142">        2.It is seen that the respondent School herein is one among the
institutions receiving aid of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The post of
Watchman fell vacant on 01.07.2007 due the retirement of then incumbent A.
Mary Michael John with effect from 30.05.2007. In that vacancy, a fully
qualified candidate G. Christu Manohara Dhas was appointed as Watchman with  
effect from 02.07.2007. For the disbursement of the salary, the School
submitted a proposal. The District Educational Officer/2nd appellant herein
returned the proposal. The respondent herein resubmitted the proposal to the
2nd appellant on 17.09.2008 and for this, till now, there is no reply.
</p><p id="p_143">        3.Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that under G.O.Ms.No.212 
(Personnel &amp; Administrative Reforms Department) dated 29.11.2001, the ban 
imposed on Government employments has no relevance to the appointment made by     
the Private Schools and even that ban was lifted by subsequent G.O.Ms.No.14,
Personnel and administrative Reforms (P) Department dated 7.2.2006. Insofar
as G.O.Ms.No.115 (School Education (D2) Department) dated 30.5.2007 is  
concerned, it made no reference to the filling up of the post of Watchman in
Private Schools. The new incumbent was appointed with effect from 02.07.2007.
In the above circumstances, aggrieved by the return of the proposal by the
second appellant, the respondent filed the writ petition.       
</p><p id="p_144">        4.Referring to the decision of this Court reported in 2008 (5) CTC 648
cited supra, the learned single Judge pointed out that this Court had
considered the scope of G.O.Ms.212 (Personnel &amp; Administrative Reforms  
Department) dated 29.11.2001 that there was absolutely no prohibition to
appointment as non-teaching staff in private schools and that the 2nd
appellant was under a misconception that G.O.Ms.No.212 (Personnel and  
Administrative Reforms-P) Department dated 29.11.2001 and G.O.Ms.No.115   
(School Education (D2) Department) dated 30.5.2007 prohibited the appointment
of Watchman. In the circumstances, following the decision of this Court
reported in 2008 (5) CTC 648 (Thiruvalluvar Higher secondary School,
Palamaner Road, Gudiyattam, Vellore District rep. by the Secretary, School
Committee, K.m.Govindarjan vs. The Government of Tamil Nadu rep. by its 
Secretary, Department of School Education, Fort St.George, Chennai and three
others), the prayer sought for by the respondent was granted and the
appellants were directed to disburse the grant-in-aid towards the salary of
the said Watchman along with all the attendant benefits.
</p><p id="p_145">        5. Learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the appellants
submitted that the ban on appointment is uniformly followed; it being a
policy decision, it will not be a subject matter of judicial review. He
further pointed out that even as per G.O.Ms.No.115 (School Education (D2)
Department) dated 30.5.2007, there is no mention regarding the filling up of
the post of Watchman. G.O.Ms.No.14, Personnel and administrative Reforms (P)  
Department dated 7.2.2006 and G.O.Ms.No.91, Personnel and administrative  
Reforms (P) Department dated 6.7.2006 prescribe the guidelines for
preparation of estimation of vacancies for filling up the posts by direct
recruitment as well as by other methods. The guidelines issued by the
Government have to be strictly followed in the matter of appointment.  Since
the respondents have failed to intimate the vacancies for the post of
Watchman, the respondent herein cannot, as of right, claim the relief for the
aid.
</p><p id="p_146">        6. It is seen from the affidavit in the writ petition that intimation
was sent to the respondent about the vacancy that had fallen. In paragraph 8
of the affidavit, the respondent specifically averred that for the
disbursement of grant in aid towards salary, the school submitted its
proposal to the District Educational Officer, which was returned. The school
is stated to have re-submitted the proposal on 17.09.2008. There is no denial
of the said fact by the appellants herein. Hence, in the absence of any
material to show that the respondent herein had not intimated as to the
vacancy to be filled up and there being no action taken on the representation
made on 17.09.2008, we do not find any error in the order of the learned
single Judge granting the prayer of the respondent. Further, by G.O.Ms.No.14,
Personnel and administrative Reforms (P) Department  dated 7.2.2006, the ban
that was imposed in G.O.Ms.No.212 (Personnel &amp; Administrative Reforms  
Department) dated 29.11.2001 was cancelled. Quite apart from this,
G.O.Ms.No.115 (School Education (D2) Department) dated 30.5.2007 makes no    
reference to the appointment of non-teaching staff. In any event, as rightly
pointed out by the respondent herein on intimation about the vacancies that
had fallen, no action was taken by the appellants. Hence, no exception could
be taken as to the order passed by this Court directing the appellants herein
to disburse the grant in aid towards the salary of the Watchman along with
the attendant benefits. Contrary to the assertion of the appellants, there is
no interference as far as the policy decision is concerned. The decision
given by the learned single Judge goes along with the policy of the
Government and it is imperative that the educational institution does not
suffer on account of the lethargy of the authorities.
</p><p id="p_147">        7. Hence, the Writ Appeal is dismissed. Consequently, the connected
M.P.(MD)No.1 of 2010 is closed. No costs."
</p><p id="p_148">                21.Likewise, recently another Hon'ble Division Bench of this
Court, to which one of us (SMKJ) was a party, had an occasion to consider the
same issue in W.A.(MD)No.2 of 2015, dated 10.04.2015, and dismissed the writ 
appeals filed by the Department, holding as under:
</p><p id="p_149">        "8.We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and
perused the materials on record.
</p><p id="p_150">        9. From the materials on record and pleadings, it is seen that the
appellants have rejected the proposal for approval of appointment of the
first respondent, on the ground that prior approval is not obtained and
subsequently, as per G.O.(Ms)No.115, School Education (D2) Department,dated   
30.05.2007, the Government must permit the appointment of nonteaching staff.
This Court in the Judgment, dated 30.11.2010, made in  W.A.(MD) No.813 of 
2010 [The District Educational Officer, Paramakudi, Ramanathapuram District
Vs. I.Michaelammal and another] held that prior approval is not necessary.
</p><p id="p_151">        10.The contention of the first respondent that G.O.(Ms)No.115, School
Education (D2) Department, dated 30.05.2007, is not applicable to the
appointment of the first respondent as Library Clerk, has considerable force.
The appellants themselves have admitted in paragraph 5 of the counter filed
in the writ petition that G.O.(Ms)No.115, School Education (D2) Department,
dated 30.05.2007, is not applicable to the post of Library Clerk. The
appellants have not rejected the proposal, for approval of appointment of the
first respondent, on the ground of ban order or take a stand that the
appointment of the first respondent can be approved only from lifting the ban
order, dated 07.02.2006. Therefore, the appellants cannot be allowed to
improve their case in appeal, by relying on various Judgments of this Court,
including the Judgment of this Court, dated 24.03.2014, made in Review
Application (MD)No.101 of 2013, to which, one of us [V.M.VELUMANI, J.] was a 
party, wherein it has been held that the appointment of non-teaching staff
should be approved only from the date of lifting of the ban order, i.e.,
07.02.2006.     
</p><p id="p_152">                11. In all these Judgments, the proposal for approval of
appointment of non-teaching staff was rejected on the ground of ban order. In
the present case, the proposal to approve the appointment of the first
respondent was rejected on the ground of no prior permission was obtained for
approval.
</p><p id="p_153">        12. For the reasons stated above, the writ appeal fails and the same is
dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is
dismissed."
</p><p id="p_154">                22.Therefore, it is not correct to contend that this Court has
not considered and discussed about the applicability of the Government Orders
and letters, referred to above, issued in respect of appointment of non-
teaching staff in aided private schools.  Therefore, the contention of the
learned Special Government Pleader on this aspect is liable to be rejected
and accordingly it is rejected.
</p><p id="p_155">                23.It is the submission of the learned counsel for the
respondent/writ petitioners that with regard to the appointment of non-
teaching staff, in aided private schools, there is no need to get prior
permission from the educational authorities, as Rule 15 of the Tamil Nadu
Recognised Private Schools (Regulation) Rules, 1974 will apply only to
teaching staff.  In this regard, the learned counsel for the respondent/writ
petitioners relied on a judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in
<a href="/doc/94381695/" id="a_1">A.Murugesan  v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, reported in (2007) 4 MLJ 561.   They
have also relied upon a Hon'ble Division Bench decision of this Court in
W.A.(MD)No.213 of 2014, dated 26.02.2014, wherein the Hon'ble Division Bench 
has held as follows:
</p><p id="p_156">        "2.The writ petition has been filed for Mandamus to direct the District
Educational Officer, Tuticorin to approve the appointment of one P.Rajavel as
Lab Assistant in the respondent School and to release grant-in-aide towards
his salary, allowances and other attendant benefits.
</p><p id="p_157">        3.The learned single Judge relied upon Rule 15 of the Tamil Nadu
Private Schools (Regulation) Rules 1974 which states that a prior approval is
required for appointment of teaching staff and not in respect of non-teaching
staff which was upheld by the learned Single Judge as per the decision of
this Court in A.Murugesan  Vs. State of Tamil Nadu,k rep.by its Secretary and
others reported in 2007(4) MLJ 561, and allowed the writ petition on the same
lines.
</p><p id="p_158">        4.We have perused the Rules as such and also the letter of the Chief
Educational Officer, Tuticorin dated 17.10.2012.  The said letter is not a
rejection but only states that approval will be given in future. Therefore,
we are included to accept the finding of the learned single Judge that no
prior permission is required in respect of non-teaching staff."
</p><p id="p_159">                24.The learned Special Government Pleader does not dispute the 
above law laid down by this Court.  However,  he submitted that the issue
involved in these cases is as to whether while making appointments, the
school authorities have followed the guidelines issued in the above mentioned
Government Orders.  We have already rejected the contention of the learned
Special Government Pleader in this regard.
</p><p id="p_160">                25.One more contention put-forth by the learned counsel for the
respondents/writ petitioners is that the action of the concerned educational
authorities in not approving the appointment of the respondents/writ
petitioners would amount to violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution, inasmuch in similar cases where the orders of this Court have
been complied with and appropriate Government Orders have been issued, 
implementing the orders of this Court.  In support of the above submission,
learned counsel for the respondents/writ petitioners relied on G.O.(4D)No.9,
School Education (D2) Department, dated 06.03.2012 and  G.O.(4D)No.25, School  
Education (D2) Department, dated 04.09.2012, wherein the orders of this Court
have been complied with, in letter and spirit. Those two Government Orders
are extracted hereunder.

of this Court, the Government have issued the above orders in respect of
similarly placed persons.  Hence, we find every force in the submission of

dismissed. 
</p><p id="p_173">                30.Coming to the review applications, we would like to reiterate
that review is not an appeal in disguise.  Review can be made only if there
is any mistake or apparent error on the face of the record or there is any
clerical error in the order sought to be reviewed.  We deem it fit to
consider few decisions on the point of review.
</p><p id="p_174">                (i)The Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/80351/" id="a_2">Lily Thomas v. Union of India</a>,
reported in 2000 (6) SCC 224, while considering the scope of review and the
limitations imposed on its exercise under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_3">Article 137</a> of the Constitution of
India, held as follows:
</p><p id="p_175">        ?52.    The dictionary meaning of the word "review" is the act of
looking, offer, something again with a view to correction or improvement. It
cannot be denied that the review is the creation of a statute. This Court in
Patel Narshi Thakershi &amp; Ors. Vs. Pradyunmansinghji Arjunsinghji [AIR (1970)
SC 1273], held that the power of review is not an inherent power. It must be
conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication. The review
is also not an appeal in disguise. It cannot be denied that justice is a
virtue which transcends all barriers and the rules or procedures or
technicalities of law cannot stand in the way of administration of justice.
Law has to bend before justice. If the Court finds that the error pointed out
in the review petition was under a mistake and the earlier judgment would not
have been passed but for erroneous assumption which in fact did not exist and
its perpetration shall result in miscarriage of justice nothing would
preclude the Court from rectifying the error. This Court in S.Nagaraj &amp;
Ors.etc. Vs. State of Karnataka &amp; Anr.etc. [1993 Supp. (4) SCC 595] held:
</p><p id="p_176">                "19. Review literally and even judicially means re- examination
or re-consideration. Basic philosophy inherent in it is the universal
acceptance of human fallibility. Yet in the realm of law the courts and even
the statutes lean strongly in favour of finality of decision legally and
properly made. Exceptions both statutorily and judicially have been carved
out to correct accidental mistakes or miscarriage of justice. Even when there
was no statutory provision and no rules were framed by the highest court
indicating the circumstances in which it could rectify its order the courts
culled out such power to avoid abuse of process or miscarriage of justice. In
Raja Prithwi Chand Law Choudhury v. Sukhraj Rai [AIR 1941 FC 1] the Court 
observed that even though no rules had been framed permitting the highest
Court to review its order yet it was available on the limited and narrow
ground developed by the Privy Council and the House of Lords. The Court
approved the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Rajunder Narain Rae
v. Bijai Govind Singh (1836) 1 Moo PC 117 that an order made by the Court was
final and could not be altered:
</p><p id="p_177">                '...nevertheless, if by misprision in embodying the judgments, by
errors have been introduced, these Courts possess, by Common Law, the same   
power which the Courts of record and statute have of rectifying the mistakes
which have crept in.... The House of Lords exercises a similar power of
rectifying mistakes made in drawing up its own judgments, and this Court must
possess the same authority. The Lords have however gone a step further, and
have corrected mistakes introduced through inadvertence in the details of
judgments; or have supplied manifest defects in order to enable the decrees
to be enforced, or have added explanatory matter, or have reconciled
inconsistencies.?
</p><p id="p_178">Basis for exercise of the power was stated in the same decision as under:
</p><p id="p_179">                'It is impossible to doubt that the indulgence extended in such
cases is mainly owing to the natural desire prevailing to prevent
irremediable injustice being done by a Court of last resort, where by some
accident, without any blame, the party has not been heard and an order has
been inadvertently made as if the party had been heard.'
Rectification of an order thus stems from the fundamental principle that
justice is above all. It is exercised to remove the error and not for
disturbing finality. When the Constitution was framed the substantive power
to rectify or recall the order passed by this Court was specifically provided
by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_4">Article 137</a> of the Constitution. Our Constitution-makers who had the
practical wisdom to visualise the efficacy of such provision expressly
conferred the substantive power to review any judgment or order by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_5">Article
137</a> of the Constitution. And clause (c) of <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_6">Article 145</a> permitted this Court
to frame rules as to the conditions subject to which any judgment or order
may be reviewed. In exercise of this power Order XL had been framed
empowering this Court to review an order in civil proceedings on grounds
analogous to Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code. The expression,
for any other sufficient reason in the clause has been given an expanded
meaning and a decree or order passed under misapprehension of true state of
circumstances has been held to be sufficient ground to exercise the power.
Apart from Order XL Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules this Court has the
inherent power to make such orders as may be necessary in the interest of
justice or to prevent the abuse of process of Court. The Court is thus not
precluded from recalling or reviewing its own order if it is satisfied that
it is necessary to do so for sake of justice."
</p><p id="p_180">The mere fact that two views on the same subject are possible is no ground to
review the earlier judgment passed by a Bench of the same strength.
</p><p id="p_181">                53. This Court in M/s.Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. Vs.
Lt.Governor of Delhi [AIR 1980 SC 674] considered the powers of this Court
under <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_7">Article 137</a> of the Constitution read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC and Order
40 Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules and held:
</p><p id="p_182">                "It is well settled that a party is not entitled to seek a review
of a judgment delivered by this Court merely for the purpose of a rehearing
and a fresh decision of the case. The normal principle is that a judgment
pronounced by the Court is final, and departure from that principle is
justified only when circumstances of a substantial and compelling character
make it necessary to do so. <a href="/doc/1308308/" id="a_8">Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a>, (1965) 1 SCR
933 at p.948. For instance, if the attention of the Court is not drawn to a
material statutory provision during the original hearing. <a href="/doc/64654035/" id="a_9">G.L. Gupta v. D.N.
Mehta</a>, (1971) 3 SCR 748 at p.760. The Court may also reopen its judgment if a
manifest wrong has been done and it is necessary to pass an order to do full
and effective justice. O.N.Mohindroo v. Dist. Judge, Delhi, (1971) 2 SCR 11
at p.27. Power to review its judgments has been conferred on the Supreme
Court by <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_10">Art.137</a> of the Constitution, and that power is subject to the
provisions of any law made by Parliament or the rules made under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_11">Art.145.</a> In
a civil proceeding, an application for review is entertained only on a ground
mentioned in O. XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and in a
criminal proceeding on the ground of an error apparent on the face of the
record. (Order XL, R.1, Supreme Court Rules, 1966). But whatever the nature
of the proceeding, it is beyond dispute that a review proceeding cannot be
equated with the original hearing of the case, and the finality of the
judgment delivered by the Court will not be reconsidered except where a
glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier
by judicial fallibility. <a href="/doc/1626241/" id="a_12">Chandra Kanta v. Sheikh Habib</a> (1975) 3 SCR 935."
</p><p id="p_183">                54.     <a href="/doc/249731/" id="a_13">Article 137</a> empowers this Court to review its judgments
subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or any rules made
under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_14">Article 145</a> of the Constitution. The Supreme Court Rules made in
exercise of the powers under <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_15">Article 145</a> of the Constitution prescribe that
in civil cases, review lies on any of the ground specified in Order 47 Rule 1
of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides:
</p><p id="p_184">                "Application for review of judgment -(1) Any person considering
himself aggrieved -
</p><p id="p_185">                (a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but
from which, no appeal has been preferred.
</p><p id="p_186">                (b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or
</p><p id="p_187">                (c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes,
and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which,
after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could
not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, 
or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or
for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree
passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the
Court which passed the decree or made the order."
Under Order 40 Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules no review lies except on the
ground of error apparent on the face of the record in criminal cases.?
</p><p id="p_188">                (ii)<a href="/doc/622454/" id="a_16">In Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aibam Pishak Sharma</a> , reported
in AIR 1979 SC 1047, the Supreme Court has held that, 
        "there is nothing in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_17">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to preclude a High
Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of
plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave
and palpable errors committed by it. But, there are definitive limits to the
exercise of the power of review. The power of review may be exercised on the
discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise
of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the
review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made;
it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the
record is found; it may also be exercised on any analogous ground. But, it
may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.
That would be the province of a court of appeal. A power of review is not to
be confused with appellate powers which may enable an appellate court to
correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court."

<p id="p_189">                (iii)In yet another decision in RAJINDERSINGH Vs. Lt. GOVERNOR,   
reported in 2005 (13) SCC 289, at paragraph Nos.15 and 16, the Hon'ble
Supreme Court held that law is well settled that the power of judicial review
of its own order by the High Court inheres in every Court of plenary
jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice.  Power of judicial review
extends to correct all errors to prevent miscarriage of justice.   It was
further held that Courts should not hesitate to review their own earlier
order, when there exists an error on the face of record and the interest of
justice so demands in appropriate cases.
</p>        
<p id="p_190">                (iv)<a href="/doc/1316559/" id="a_18">In Union of India v. Kamal Sengupta</a> reported in 2008 (8) SCC
612, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, at Paragraphs 14 and 15, has held that, 
        "14. At this stage it is apposite to observe that where a review is
sought on the ground of discovery of new matter or evidence, such matter or
evidence must be relevant and must be of such a character that if the same
had been produced, it might have altered the judgment. In other words, mere
discovery of new or important matter or evidence is not sufficient ground for
review ex debito justiciae. Not only this, the party seeking review has also
to show that such additional matter or evidence was not within its knowledge
and even after the exercise of due diligence, the same could not be produced
before the Court earlier.
</p><p id="p_191">        15. The term `mistake or error apparent' by its very connotation
signifies an error which is evident per se from the record of the case and
does not require detailed examination, scrutiny and elucidation either of the
facts or the legal position. If an error is not self-evident and detection
thereof requires long debate and process of reasoning, it cannot be treated
as an error apparent on the face of the record for the purpose of Order 47
Rule 1 CPC or Section 22(3)(f) of the Act. To put it differently an order or
decision or judgment cannot be corrected merely because it is erroneous in
law or on the ground that a different view could have been taken by the
Court/Tribunal on a point of fact or law. In any case, while exercising the
power of review, the concerned Court/Tribunal cannot sit in appeal over its
judgment/decision."
</p><p id="p_192">                31.Reverting back to the case on hand,  the review
petitioners/appellants have not raised any ground falling within Section 114
read with Rule 1 of CPC for reviewing the order.  Since the grounds in the
review applications are similar to the grounds raised  in the  writ appeals
and as we have rejected those grounds, the present review applications are
also dismissed.  No order as to costs.  Connected miscellaneous petitions are
also dismissed.
