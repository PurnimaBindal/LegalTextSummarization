           no. 1, Sona Autocomp Holding Private Limited, Sona BLW
           Präzisionsschmiede GMBH and Mr. Sunjay Kapur, the plaintiff no. 1
           has been assigned various trademark rights owned by Sona BLW
           Präzisionsschmiede GMBH, a German based Company, including the
           rights in the word mark &quot;SONA BLW&quot;, duly registered in India on
           18.07.2014 under Class 12 vide Certificate No. 1178789.
           10.     The plaintiffs assert that „SONA&#x27; is a prominent feature of all
           plaintiff no. 1‟s trademarks.
           11.     It is the case of the plaintiffs that the plaintiff no.1 only just
           before the filing of the Suit discovered that the defendants have
           adopted the corporate name and trade mark „SONA‟ as part of its own
           corporate name/ trade name. It is further asserted that the defendant
           no.1 was doing business since the year 2011 under the name „Mandira
           Marketing Private Limited‟ and changed it to „Sona Mandhira Pvt.
           Ltd.‟ only on 22.06.2020. The plaintiffs assert that the defendants are
           also engaged in a similar trade as that of the plaintiff no.1, which
           leaves little doubt that the defendants were infact aware of the plaintiff
           no.1‟s registration as well as the long and uninterrupted use of the
           trade mark/corporate name „SONA‟, and have deliberately and
           dishonestly adopted the mark „SONA&#x27; as part of its corporate name,
           so as to pass off its goods as that of the plaintiff no.1.
           12.     The plaintiffs state that though the defendant no.2 is the
           biological sister of the Chairman of the plaintiff no.1-Company and
           the Director of the plaintiff no.2-Company, the same would give no
           right to the defendant no. 1 to change its Corporate Name so as to
           adopt the mark „SONA&#x27;.
           CASE OF THE DEFENDANTS
           13.     On the other hand, it is the case of the defendant nos.1, 2 and 4

           mark &quot;SONA&quot;, the same having been disclaimed by them while
           seeking registration of their mark. They further submit that there is no
           visual similarity between the marks used by the plaintiffs and those
           used by the defendants. The markets and the products in which the
           parties deal in are also distinct and different. The customers of the
           products are also different, and there is no possibility of any confusion
           being caused. The defendants submit that there is, therefore, no case
           of infringement or of passing off made out by the plaintiffs against the
           defendants.
           14.     The defendants further submit that the word &quot;SONA&quot; is a
           generic and common word in trade and has attained the status of
           publici juris. It is not an invented word, but a generic word. They
           submit that various Companies have been registered in the Office of
           the Registrar of Companies using the word &quot;SONA&quot; as part of their
           corporate name. They submit that no person can claim exclusive
           proprietary rights over the word &quot;SONA&quot;.
           15.     The specific case of the defendants is that the present suit is
           primarily a family dispute between the Chairman of the plaintiff no.1
           and the defendant no.2, them being brother-sister. It is submitted that
           Mr.Surinder Kapur, the father of the Chairman of the plaintiff no.2,
           was also the Director of the defendant no.1-company in the year 2011.
           He had not only allowed the defendants to use the word „SONA‟ but,
           in fact, urged the defendants to use the said mark.
           16.     It is further contended by the defendant that the present Suit is
           liable to be dismissed on account of delay and laches as also
           acquiescence of the plaintiffs in the use of the mark „SONA‟ by the
           defendants. It is contended that the defendant no. 1 for the last ten
           years not only traded in the products of the plaintiffs, but also carried
           out job works for the plaintiffs. 45% of the sales turnover of the

           defendant no.1 is through manufacturing, wherein the defendant no.1
           was independently using the „SONA&#x27; logo for its packaging. The
           goods purchased from the plaintiffs were also packaged by the
           defendants and were sold using the impugned mark.
           17.     The defendants further claim that the present suit is liable to be
           dismissed on account of concealment and misstatement.


           SUBMISSIONS OF THE LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR
           THE PLAINTIFFS
           18.     The learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the
           plaintiff no.1 is the registered user/owner of various trademarks of
           which the word „SONA‟ forms a dominant part and, hence, is entitled
           to protection of the same as a trade mark. He submits that the plaintiff
           no.1 has been using the mark „SONA‟ as part of its corporate name
           from as early as the year 1984 with the launch of „SONA Group‟, and
           not only the plaintiff no.1-company, but also all the subsidiaries of the
           plaintiff no. 1 have always carried the name „SONA‟ as part of their
           corporate name. He submits that, therefore, the use of the trade mark
           „SONA‟ by the defendant no.1, even as its corporate name, results in
           infringement of the registered mark of the plaintiff no.1. He places
           reliance on Section 29(5) of the Act.
           19.     He further submits that the mala fide adoption of the word
           &#x27;SONA&#x27; by the defendants as part of their corporate name amounts to
           the tortious wrong of passing off, as also unfair competition. He
           submits that the defendant no. 1 is not a part of the „SONA‟ group and
           it is not explained as to why it chose to change its corporate name long
           after its incorporation and that too in the peak of Covid-19 lockdown.
           He submits that this itself shows the mala fides of the defendants.

           20.     He further submits that the assertion of the defendants that the
           corporate name has been changed with the knowledge and consent of
           Mrs. Rani Kapur, who is the Managing Director of the plaintiff no. 2,
           cannot also act as a shield to the unauthorised adoption of the
           impugned mark by the defendants, inasmuch as Mrs. Rani Kapur had
           no authority or legal right to permit the defendants to use and/or adopt
           the plaintiffs‟ trade mark as all rights of the plaintiff no. 2 with respect
           to the trade marks already stood assigned to the plaintiff no. 1 vide
           Assignment Deed dated 28.03.2019, executed inter alia under the
           signatures of Mrs. Rani Kapur.
           21.     The learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs further submits that
           the assertion of the defendants that various other companies are also
           registered with the word „SONA‟, is of no consequence, as the mere
           registration of a company name by a third party in the absence of
           evidence of substantial use in respect of the relevant class of products
           prior in point of time to the adoption and use by the plaintiffs and their
           predecessors, cannot defeat the claim of the plaintiffs to the mark
           „SONA‟. In this regard he places reliance on <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_1">Century Traders v.

           22.     The learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs further asserts that
           the plea of the defendants that they are dealing in different products
           and the channel of trade is different, is also ill-founded inasmuch as
           the plaintiffs sell their automobile parts to companies like Maruti,
           Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, Tata etc. These are the same companies in
           respect of whose vehicles the defendant no.1 sells spare parts. The

           defendants have further admitted that they have sold plaintiffs‟
           products in the aftermarket, though in a minuscule quantity. As such,
           both the plaintiffs and the defendants are trading in automobile parts,
           which are same/allied and cognate. In this regard he places reliance on
           the judgment in CS (COMM) 383/2022 titled <a href="/doc/87361078/" id="a_5">Sona BLW Precision
           Forgings Ltd. v. Sonae EV Private Limited</a>.
           23.     The learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs submits that earlier
           the defendants were using the word „SONA&#x27; in terms of the Sales
           Agreement. The use of the trademark, therefore, cannot lead to any
           independent right enuring to the benefit of the defendants. The said
           use and any goodwill generated thereby would enure to the benefit of
           the plaintiffs alone. In support he places reliance on the <a href="/doc/112995556/" id="a_6">Eaton
           Corporation &amp; Anr. v. BCH Electric Limited</a>, 2013 SCC OnLine Del
           2333. He submits that being an earlier sales agent of the plaintiff
           group of companies, the likelihood of deception being caused due to
           change of corporate name by the defendant no. 1 is even higher.
           24.     He submits that the plaintiffs cannot also be accused of having
           acquiesced to the use of the mark by the defendants. For acquiescence,
           there has to be a positive act by the plaintiffs‟ tantamounting to the
           grant of a license in favour of the defendants to use the mark
           independently, which is clearly missing in the present case. In support
           he places reliance on <a href="/doc/32134128/" id="a_7">Make My Trip (India) Private Limited v. Make

           senior counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the suit was filed in the
           middle of Covid-19 pandemic and the Registration Certificate which
           disclosed the disclaimer was part of the documents filed with the suit.
           The failure to mention the disclaimer in the main body of the plaint
           was an oversight. This was even submitted as such in the order dated
           28.07.2020 of this Court. In any case, no interim order was passed in
           the matter and no benefit was, therefore, derived by the plaintiffs by
           this mistake. He submits that the oversight of the plaintiffs is further
           borne by the failure of the plaintiffs to plead and annex the
           Registration Certificate for the word mark &quot;SONA BLW&quot;, the
           registration of which has been granted without any disclaimer. It is
           only by way of an amendment that the said registration was pleaded
           by the plaintiffs.
           26.     He submits that even otherwise, the disclaimer is immaterial to
           the claim of a passing off action and even in respect of an
           infringement action, inasmuch as such the disclaimer does not travel
           to the market. In support, he places reliance on Charan Dass and
           Veer Industries (India) v. Bombay Crockery House, 1984 PTC 102;

           defendants that even in the amended plaint, the plaintiffs have falsely
           depicted their device mark registrations as word mark registrations,
           the learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs asserts that this is only a
           typographical/clerical error. Paragraph 14 of the original Plaint was
           not sought to be amended at all. Therefore, the change in paragraph 14

           28.     He further submits that the communication with the Trade Mark
           Registry at the time of consideration of the application for registration
           of the mark of the plaintiffs is also irrelevant. The said correspondence
           does not establish that at any point the plaintiffs admitted or accepted
           that the word &quot;SONA&quot; is incapable of distinguishing the goods of the
           plaintiffs. He submits that, in any case, there can be no estoppel
           claimed against the plaintiffs on the basis of the reply filed before the
           Trade Mark Registry. In support he places reliance on <a href="/doc/178024454/" id="a_12">Telecare

           SUBMISSIONS OF THE LEARNED SENIOR COUNSELS FOR
           THE DEFENDANTS
           29.     The learned senior counsels for the defendants, while reiterating
           the defence set out in the Written Statement, further submit that the
           present suit, as also the application seeking interim relief, are liable to
           be dismissed on account of suppression of material facts in the Plaint.
           They submit that the plaintiffs have intentionally suppressed the
           disclaimer on the Registration Certificate which shows that the device
           mark registration in favour of the plaintiff no.2 was conditional and
           did not allow the plaintiffs to claim any exclusive right in the word
           „SONA‟. They submit that the concealment of this material fact itself
           is sufficient to disentitle the plaintiffs to any relief. In support they
           place reliance on <a href="/doc/154308711/" id="a_14">Benara Bearings &amp; Pistons Ltd. v. Mahle Engine

           30.     They submit that the purpose of a disclaimer is to minimise the
           possibility of extravagant and unauthorised claims being made on the
           basis of the registration of the trade marks. In the present case, the
           plaintiffs having obtained the registration with the disclaimer of
           having no exclusive right conferred in the word „SONA‟ due to such
           registration, cannot now claim exclusivity to the use of the said word.

           no.2, while seeking registration of its device mark had stated that
           &quot;Driving Tomorrow&quot; with &quot;S&quot; symbol (curved road) are the
           differentiating features. Therefore, no exclusive right over the word
           „SONA‟ was claimed by the plaintiffs. They submit that this
           correspondence has been intentionally concealed from this Court,
           thereby disentitling the plaintiffs to any relief.

           32.     The learned senior counsels for the defendants have further
           asserted that the change in the corporate name by the defendant no.1
           was done with the consent of Mrs.Rani Kapur, the original owner and
           Managing Director of the plaintiff no.2. They submit that a notice
           dated 22.05.2020 was sent to all the shareholders of the defendant
           no.1 proposing to call an Extraordinary General Meeting for according
           consent to the change of the name of the defendant no.1. On
           04.06.2020, Mrs.Rani Kapur consented to convening the meeting at a
           shorter notice. The meeting was accordingly held on 06.06.2020, in
           which Mrs.Rani Kapur was also present, and the proposal to change
           the name of defendant no.1 was approved. They submit that these
           documents have also been intentionally withheld by the plaintiffs from
           this Court, thereby making the „Statement of Truth‟ filed with the
           Plaint as false.
           33.     The learned senior counsels for the defendants, placing reliance
           on the judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/99657971/" id="a_24">Vardhaman Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. v.

           the device marks, cannot claim any exclusive right over the word
           „SONA‟.
           34.      They further submit that reliance on the registration of the
           word mark &quot;SONA BLW&quot; by the plaintiffs cannot also be accepted,
           inasmuch as the registration of the same has not been transferred in
           the favour of the plaintiff no. 1 as yet.
           35.     They submit that as far as the mark „SONA DRIVING
           TOMORROW‟ is concerned, the claim of the plaintiffs is also hit by

           working together. After 2021, the defendants have not used the said
           logo.
           36.     As far as the claim of passing off is concerned, the learned
           senior counsels for the defendants submit that no case of passing off is
           made out inasmuch as the products of the plaintiffs and the defendants
           cater to different segments of the market; and the purchaser of the
           goods and the entire supply chain is different. While the plaintiff no.1
           supplies only to Original Equipment Manufacturers to those who work
           under bulk long term contracts, the defendant no.1 has its market post
           the sale of a vehicle. The device/logo of the plaintiffs and the
           defendants is also different. They submit that there is no visual
           similarity between the marks. The trade dress of the two marks, the
           colour combination, and the tag lines are also not the same. The same
           are reproduced herein below:

           ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
           38.     I have considered the submissions made by the learned senior
           counsels for the parties.

           Suppression and Misstatements
           39.     I shall first consider the plea of suppression and misstatement
           alleged by the defendants against the plaintiffs.
           40.     In Columbia Sportswear Company (supra), the learned Single
           Judge of this Court held that the conduct of the parties who are
           seeking discretionary relief from the Court weighs largely in the mind
           of the Court while dealing with a prayer seeking discretionary relief.
           Where a party is guilty of suppression of material facts, he may not be
           entitled to such a relief. I, in fact, need not multiply decisions on this
           well settled proposition of law.
           41.     As noted hereinabove, the defendants have alleged that the
           present suit as also the application seeking interim relief filed by the
           plaintiffs deserves to be dismissed on account of the suppression and
           intentional mis-representation of the following material facts:
                         a) Suppression of the disclaimer on the use of the word
                            &quot;SONA&quot; in the Trade Mark Application No.1707890;

                                   Neutral Citation Number: 2023/DHC/001223

                         b) Suppression of proceedings before the Trade Marks
                            Registry with respect to the above application.
           42.     As far as the suppression of disclaimer is concerned, I am in
           agreement with the submission made by the learned senior counsel for
           the defendants that the disclaimer attached to the registration granted
           in favour of the plaintiffs under Application No.1707890 was a vital
           and material fact to be disclosed upfront by the plaintiffs in the Plaint,
           especially where they are claiming exclusive rights in the word
           &quot;SONA&quot;.
           43.     The learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs has explained that
           the non-disclosure of the disclaimer was unintentional as the present
           suit was filed when the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown was at its peak.
           He has submitted that the Registration Certificate which disclosed the
           disclaimer was part of the documents filed along with the suit and that
           the failure to mention the disclaimer in the Plaint was an oversight.
           He submits that no interim relief was granted in the suit and, therefore,
           the plaintiffs derived no benefit through non-disclosure of the
           disclaimer. He submits that, in fact, the plaintiffs also failed to plead
           and annex the Registration Certificate for the word mark &quot;SONA
           BLW&quot;, which would otherwise have been supportive of the plaintiff‟s
           case at the time of filing of the suit and which registration is without
           any disclaimer.
           44.     I am not impressed with the above submissions. As noted herein
           above, the disclaimer of the exclusive right in the word &quot;SONA&quot; was
           a vital fact to be disclosed by the plaintiffs in the Plaint. It may or
           may not eventually influence the outcome of the Suit/application
           seeking interim injunction one way or the other, however, has to be
           disclosed. The Court has to be informed of all relevant facts for it to
           take a decision.

           45.      The Court is also not expected to scan through voluminous
           documents filed by the plaintiffs with the Plaint in order to find for
           itself such an important and vital fact. In fact, the plea that the
           disclosure could not be made as the Plaint was filed during Covid-19
           lockdown, is defeated by the fact that the plaintiffs had this document
           in their custody and filed the same with the Plaint, however, did not
           mention its effect in the Plaint. The non-disclosure, therefore, has
           nothing to do with Covid-19 lockdown. However, to a limited extent
           that the suit was filed in urgency and during the Covid-19 pandemic,
           the same can act as a mitigating circumstance.
           46.     Equally, only because the plaintiffs were unable to obtain an ex-
           parte ad interim order because of the presence of the defendants, who
           pointed out the above concealment on the first date of hearing, cannot
           absolve the plaintiffs from the repercussions of such concealment.
           Concealment remains unpardonable even where the plaintiff does not
           succeed in misleading the Court thereby, or where the defendant
           appears and is able to highlight such concealment on the first date of
           hearing, thereby preventing an adverse order being passed against it.
           However, having suffered the consequence of non-disclosure, the
           plaintiff cannot be condemned indefinitely.
           47.     The fact that the plaintiffs also failed to plead another
           registration which may be supportive of its case in the Suit, also
           cannot absolve the plaintiffs of their misconduct, but may act as a
           mitigating circumstance.
           48.     Having said the above, however, in my view, the concealment
           made by the plaintiffs in every case would not result in an automatic
           dismissal of the Plaint and/or of the applications filed by the plaintiffs
           seeking interim relief. In law, an injunction against infringement and
           passing off is granted not only to protect the proprietary rights of the

           plaintiffs but also to protect an ordinary unwary consumer who may
           be deceived due to adoption of a similar mark for similar goods by the
           defendant. There is, therefore, an element of public interest also to be
           protected. Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of each case would, therefore, have to be considered
           to determine the effect of concealment/misstatement therein.
</p><p id="p_2">           49.     In the present case, as is being explained hereinbelow, the
           change of the corporate name by the defendant no. 1 is bordering on
           malafide. There is no reason given by the defendant no. 1 for the
           sudden change of its corporate Name so as to adopt the word „SONA‟
           therein. This coupled with the fact that earlier the defendant no. 1 was,
           in fact, also working for the plaintiffs, which relationship has been
           terminated by the plaintiffs, makes such adoption of the mark further
           deceptive. Prima facie, therefore, the draw of equity is against the
           defendants and in favour of the plaintiffs.
</p><p id="p_3">           50.     In my view, in the facts of the present case, therefore, for the
           above acts of concealment, the plaintiffs can be visited with
           exemplary costs rather than dismissing its suit and/or application
           seeking interim relief on account of their acts of concealment and
           misstatement.
</p><p id="p_4">           51.     Before proceeding on merit, and as noted above, the defendants
           have also alleged suppression on part of the plaintiffs in not disclosing
           the correspondence exchanged between the plaintiffs and the Trade
           Marks Registry for its Application No.1707890. In this regard, my
           attention has been drawn to the Examination Report dated 24.10.2008
           raising objection to the application of the plaintiff no. 2 on the ground
           that the mark applied for is devoid of any distinctive character and
           because the same/similar marks are already on the Register for the
           same or similar goods/services. In response dated 21.11.2008, the

<p id="p_6">           52.      The learned senior counsels for the defendants submit that the
           above response of the plaintiff no. 2 would show that the plaintiff no.
           2 was claiming &quot;Driving Tomorrow&quot; and the &quot;S&quot; symbol as the
           distinguishing and prominent feature of its mark and not the word
           „SONA‟.
</p><p id="p_7">           53.     They further refer to TM-16 filed by the plaintiff no. 2 on
           05.11.2009 to submit that the plaintiff no. 2 applied for amending its
           application by seeking deletion of &quot;Driving Tomorrow&quot; from its
           mark. This application was withdrawn by the plaintiff no. 2 on
           09.05.2014. The learned senior counsels for the defendants submit
           that, therefore, the plaintiffs cannot also claim any exclusive right to
           the use of the words &quot;Driving Tomorrow&quot;. They submit that, in any
           case, the plaintiffs were under a legal obligation to have disclosed the
           above exchange of correspondence with the Trademark Registry and,
           having not done so, are not entitled to any discretionary relief.

           rigors/standard of disclosure as is being applied to the disclaimer of
           the word &quot;SONA&quot; for the mark registered in favour of the plaintiffs,
           does not apply to the exchange of correspondence between the
           plaintiff no. 2 and the Trade Mark Registry before the grant of
           registration. As held by this Court in H&amp;M Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB

           correspondence may be very material to the facts of the case and
           would need to be disclosed upfront by the parties, in the present case,
           nothing much turns on the above correspondence. As noted
           hereinabove, the plaintiff proceeded for registration with the
           disclaimer of the word &quot;SONA&quot;, and at the same time with the words
           &quot;Driving Tomorrow&quot; in the mark. In fact, the defendants admit to
           having stopped the use of words &quot;Driving Tomorrow&quot; with effect
           from 2021. Therefore, what remains to be seen is the effect of the
           mark as has been registered with its disclaimer.
</p><p id="p_9">           55.     The learned senior counsels for the defendants have also urged
           that the plaintiffs are guilty of misleading this Court by giving
           incorrect details of registration of the Trade Marks standing in their
           name in the amended Plaint. He submits that an attempt has been
           made by the plaintiffs in their amended plaint to show as if the
           registrations/applications standing in their name are in the word mark
           &quot;SONA&quot;, while the registrations/applications are in the device marks.
           On the other hand, the learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs, in my
           opinion, rightly so, urges that the chart appearing in paragraph 14 of
           the amended Plaint is a mere clerical error, wherein, instead of
           reproducing the marks as registered/applied for the words of the marks
           in question have been reproduced. The learned senior counsel for the
           plaintiffs has also submitted that, in fact, in the written statement filed
           to the amended Plaint, the defendants did not even point out this
           discrepancy in the amended Plaint or sought to take advantage thereof;
           the said submission has come about only in the course of oral

           assignee (pending registration) of the trade marks and trade names of
           which &quot;SONA&quot; forms a predominant part, but also various group
           companies of the plaintiffs have been incorporated with the said name.

           the plaintiffs under Registration No.1707890, the plaintiffs cannot
           claim any exclusivity over the said word. It is further contended that
           the registrations being in device marks, even otherwise, no separate
           claim can be had to the word „SONA&#x27;.

                                   that there is a tendency on the part of some

                                   marks expanded beyond their legitimate
                                   bounds. An illustration of an attempt of this
                                   kind is to be found in In re Smokeless Powder

                                   proprietors to make an exaggerated claim to
                                   the exclusive use of parts or matters contained
                                   in their trade marks in spite of the fact that
                                   they had expressly disclaimed the exclusive
                                   use of those parts or matters. Reference may

                                          R.P.C. 191 lines 30 to 38, a disclaimer
                                          does not affect the significance which a
                                          mark conveys to others when used in the
                                          course of trade. Disclaimers do not go
                                          into the market place, and the public
                                          generally has no notice of them. In my
                                          opinion matter which is disclaimed is
                                          not necessarily disregarded when
                                          question of possible confusion or
                                          deception of the public, as distinct from
                                          the extent of a proprietors exclusive
                                          rights, are to be determined. In making
                                          the comparison under section 12(1)
                                          therefore I consider that I must have
                                          regard to the whole of the opponents

                                          and must assume use of it in a normal
                                          and fair manner for, inter alia, the
                                          applicants goods. The applicants are
                                          very well known as manufacturers of
                                          motor cars. The opponents are

                                   disclaimed word ought to be ignored there
                                   would be nothing left to compare. Let me carry
                                   this illustration further with the modification
                                   that the embellishments in the two marks are
                                   different. If the disclaimed word is to be
                                   ignored all that would be left is the
                                   embellishments. This is not how a person in
                                   the market would view the marks while
                                   purchasing a product. There would remain an
                                   equal degree of possibility of deception and
                                   confusion as the public, being oblivious to the
                                   disclaimer would not analyze the marks as
                                   suggested by Dr. Shivade. In the
                                   circumstances, the disclaimer in the present
                                   case does not affect the Plaintiffs right to

           defeat the right of the plaintiff/proprietor to claim injunction on the
           basis of passing off. For the test of passing off, the marks are to be
           tested on the standard of a person of average intelligence with
           imperfect recollection. It is the overall impression of the mark created
           on the consumer that would be the governing factor to determine
           likelihood of confusion or deception. In such determination, therefore,
           the Court may also identify elements or features of the mark that are
           more or less important for purpose of making the comparison between
           the competing marks.

           that are dominant or significant because they attract attention and

                                   permissible to accord more or less importance

                                   Similarities
                                          [1] The Anti-Dissection Rule
                                          [a] Compare composites as a Whole:
                                   Conflicting composite marks are to be
                                   compared by looking at them as a whole,
                                   rather than breaking the marks up into their
                                   component parts for comparison. This is the
                                   &quot;anti dissection&quot; rule. The rationale for the
                                   rule is that the commercial impression of a
                                   composite trademark on an ordinary
                                   prospective buyer is created by the mark as a
                                   whole, not by its component parts. However, it
                                   is not a violation of the anti-dissection rule to
                                   view the component parts of conflicting
                                   composite marks as a preliminary step on the
                                   way to an ultimate determination of probable
                                   customer reaction to the conflicting
                                   composites as a whole. Thus, conflicting marks
                                   must be compared in their entireties. A mark
                                   should not be dissected or split up into its
                                   component parts and each part then compared
                                   with corresponding parts of the conflicting
                                   mark to determine the likelihood of confusion.
                                   It is the impression that the mark as a whole
                                   creates on the average reasonably prudent
                                   buyer and not the parts thereof, that is
                                   important. As the Supreme Court observed:
                                   &quot;The commercial impression of a trademark is
                                   derived from it as a whole, not from its
                                   elements separated and considered in detail.</blockquote>
<p id="p_31">                                   For this reason it should be considered in its
                                   entirety.&quot; The anti- dissection rule is based
                                   upon a common sense observation of customer
                                   behavior: the typical shopper does not retain
                                   all of the individual details of a composite
                                   mark in his or her mind, but retains only an
                                   overall, general impression created by the
                                   composite as a whole. It is the overall
                                   impression created by the mark from the
                                   ordinary shopper‟s cursory observation in the
                                   marketplace that will or will not lead to a
                                   likelihood of confusion, not the impression
                                   created from a meticulous comparison as
                                   expressed in carefully weighed analysis in

                                   emphasize the differences. The point is that the
                                   two marks should not be examined with a
                                   microscope to find the differences, for this is
                                   not the way the average purchaser views the
                                   marks. To the average buyer, the points of
                                   similarity are more important that minor
                                   points of difference. A court should not engage
                                   in &quot;technical gymnastics&quot; in an attempt to find
                                   some minor differences between conflicting
                                   marks.
</p><p id="p_32">                                          However, where there are both
                                   similarities and differences in the marks, there
                                   must be weighed against one another to see
                                   which predominate.
</p><p id="p_33">                                          The rationale of the anti-dissection rule
                                   is based upon this assumption: &quot;An average
                                   purchaser does not retain all the details of a
                                   mark, but rather the mental impression of the
                                   mark creates in its totality. It has been held to
                                   be a violation of the anti-dissection rule to
                                   focus upon the &quot;prominent&quot; feature of a mark
                                   and decide likely confusion solely upon that
                                   feature, ignoring all other elements of the
                                   mark. Similarly, it is improper to find that one
                                   portion of a composite mark has no trademark
                                   significance, leading to a direct comparison
                                   between only that which remains.&quot;[Emphasis

                                   scintillatingly clear, beyond pale of doubt, that
                                   the principle of &#x27;anti dissection&#x27; does not
                                   impose an absolute embargo upon the
                                   consideration of the constituent elements of a
                                   composite mark. The said elements may be
                                   viewed as a preliminary step on the way to an
                                   ultimate determination of probable customer
                                   reaction to the conflicting composites as a
                                   whole. Thus, the principle of „anti- dissection‟
                                   and identification of &#x27;dominant mark&#x27; are not
                                   antithetical to one another and if viewed in a
                                   holistic perspective, the said principles rather
                                   compliment each other.

                                   they attract attention and consumers are more
                                   likely to remember and rely on them for
                                   purposes of identification of the product.
                                   Usually, the dominant portion of a mark is that
                                   which has the greater strength or carries more
                                   weight. Descriptive or generic components,
                                   having little or no source identifying
                                   significance, are generally less significant in
                                   the analysis. However, words that are
                                   arbitrary and distinct possess greater strength

           relationship, the defendant no. 1 had not claimed any independent
           right to use the word &quot;SONA&quot; as part of its corporate name till its

           some use of the trade mark of the plaintiffs for the own goods of the

           by Mrs.Rani Kapur as a shareholder of defendant no.1 and in her
           individual capacity. The registrations of the trade marks stand in the
           name of the plaintiff no.2, which is a corporate entity. They already
           stand assigned in favour of the plaintiff no. 1. Mrs.Rani Kapur in her
           individual capacity, therefore, cannot claim any right over the said
           mark, which can be assigned or licensed by her to a third party in her
           individual capacity.
</p><p id="p_49">           77.     That apart, the learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs has also

           for recording such assignment, however, even while such application
           is pending with the Trade Marks Registry and during the interregnum,

           coming to know of the change of the corporate name approached this
           Court by way of the present suit thereby clearly evidencing their intent
           not to allow the defendant no.1 to use the mark &quot;SONA&quot;.

<p id="p_51">           Acquiescence
</p><p id="p_52">           79.     The plea of the learned senior counsel for the defendants that
           the mark &quot;SONA&quot; was being used by the defendants even earlier to
           the change of the corporate name, and, therefore, the plaintiffs have
           acquiesced to such use, in my opinion, also deserves to be rejected.
           Admittedly, the defendant no.2 was acting as a sales agent for the
           products manufactured by the plaintiffs‟ group of companies. There
           was an association between the companies, that is, the plaintiffs and
           the defendant no.1. In such circumstances, even if the defendant no.1
           individually and for its own goods used the mark of the plaintiffs, the
           same would only enure to the benefit of the plaintiffs and not the
           defendants. This was a case of permissive use rather than a use
           wherein the defendant sets up an independent title to the trade mark.
           By such usage, the defendant no.2 cannot claim any independent
           rights over the said mark.

                                   of a trademark nor he is permitted by law to

           Claim of passing off

           by use of a different logo along with the Corporate Name, the
           defendants can escape the allegation of passing off, cannot also be
           accepted. In the present case, the incorporation of the word „SONA‟
           as part of its Corporate Name by the defendant no. 1 prima facie
           appears malafide. The same is intended to show a relationship
           between the plaintiffs and the defendant, while now there is no such
           relationship. The Corporate Name itself, therefore, can lead to

           the plaintiffs, its extensive use by the plaintiffs, and the likelihood of
           deception and confusion being caused in the mind of an unwary
           consumer of continued association between the plaintiffs and the
           defendant no. 1 due to adoption of the word „SONA‟ as part of the
           Corporate Name of the defendant no. 1, in my opinion, the plaintiffs
           have been able to make out a good prima facie case for grant of an
           interim injunction in their favour. The balance of convenience is also
           in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants. The plaintiffs are
           likely to suffer grave irreparable harm if the defendants are not
           restrained from using the word „SONA‟ as part of the Corporate
