                                JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">V.G.ARUN, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      The petitioners in these original petitions are the Union

of India and its officials who were the respondents before the

Central Administrative Tribunal.              The challenge in these

original     petitions     is    against     the   common      order   in

O.A.Nos.956/2017,          148/2018         and    164/2018.   O.P.(CAT)

173/2018 is filed against the order in O.A.No.956/2017, O.P.

(CAT) No.176/2018 against the order in O.A.No.148/2018 and

O.P.(CAT) No.190/2018 against the order in O.A.No.164/2018.

</p><p id="p_3">      2.     In O.A No.956/2017, the respondents, who were

Inspectors of Central Tax and Central Excise at the Cochin

Commissionerate, had submitted applications for Inter-

Commissionerate Transfer (ICT) and were awaiting the
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                       11</span>



outcome of their applications. In the meanwhile, the 4 th

petitioner sought to fill up the vacancies to which the

respondents        had    sought       transfer,   by   effecting   direct

recruitment.       Therefore, the original application was filed

seeking to quash the notifications issued for the purpose of

filling up the available vacancies by way of direct recruitment

and to direct the Chief Commissioner, Patna to consider their

request for ICT.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.     In O.P.(CAT) Nos.176 and 190 of 2018, the request

for ICT of the respondents and some other Inspectors had

been sanctioned as per Annexure A1 order dated 19.1.2018.

Immediately thereafter, Annexure A2 order was issued,

cancelling Annexure A1 order. Thereupon, the original

applications were filed seeking to quash Annexure A2 and to

declare that the respondents are entitled to get Annexure A1
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       12</span>



implemented, since they were found entitled for transfer by

the committee constituted for ICT.          By the impugned order,

the Tribunal issued a direction to immediately accommodate

the 8 applicants whose names had been forwarded, in

accordance with the guidelines for ICT issued by the Customs

and Central Excise Board. In O.A.Nos.148 and 164 of 2018,

the Tribunal set aside Annexure A2 order, to the extent it

cancelled the transfer of the respondents herein as per

Annexure A1 and declared that the respondents herein are

entitled to get Annexure A1 implemented since they were

found eligible by the Committee constituted for considering

the proposals for ICT, in terms of the relevant orders. It was

further directed that those respondents, who are yet to be

relieved from their current job for transfer to the

Lucknow/Meerut Zones, will be relieved within 15 days and
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        13</span>



duly accommodated in the post in the transferee Zone, as

already ordered.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.     Arguments were advanced by Additional Solicitor

General Sri. Natarajan, Senior Counsel O.V. Radhakrishnan,

Shafik     M.    Adbulkhadir           and   Ravi.   K.   Pariyarath.   For

convenience, the Exhibits in O.P.(CAT) No.176/2018 are being

referred to herein.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      5.     The learned Additional Solicitor General, who

appeared on behalf of the petitioners in the original

petitions/respondents in the original applications, assailed

the findings in the impugned orders primarily on the ground

that there was no provision in the Recruitment Rules which

provided for ICT of Inspectors from one Zone to another. It

was pointed out that the Central Excise and Land Customs

Department Inspector (Group 'C' Post) Recruitment Rules,
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       14</span>



2002 (Annexure R3) dated 29.11.2002, was the earlier Rule

which regulated the method of recruitment to Group 'C' post

of Inspector in the Central Excise and Land Customs

Department till the introduction of the Central Excise and

Customs       Commissionerates              Inspector   (Central        Excise,

Preventive Officer and Examiner), Group 'B' Posts Recruitment

Rules, 2016. The relevant portion of the Central Excise and

Land Customs Department Inspector (Group 'C' Post)

Recruitment Rules, 2002 reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "4. Special Provision - (i) Each Commissionerate shall
       have its own separate cadre unless otherwise directed by the
       Central Board of Excise and Customs.</blockquote><p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">              (ii) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub rule
       (I), the jurisdictional Chief Commissioner of the Central
       Excise may, if he considers it to be necessary or expedient in
       the public interest so to do and subject to such conditions as
       he may determine, having regard to the circumstances of the
       case and for reasons to be recorded in writing, order any
       post in the Commissionerate of Central Excise to be filled by
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                        15</span>



       absorption of persons holding the same or comparable
       posts,   but    belonging       to    the   cadre   of   another
       Commissionerate of Directorate under the Central Board of
       Excise and Customs."
</p><p id="p_9">      6.     It was submitted that the Recruitment Rules, 2002

was superseded and substituted by Annexure R4, the Central

Excise and Customs Commissionerates Inspector (Central

Excise, Preventive Officer and Examiner), Group 'B' Posts

Recruitment Rules, 2016. It is contended that the Recruitment

Rules of 2016 does not contain a provision akin to Rule 4 of

the 2002 Rules. On the other hand, Rule 5, which is the Special

Provision under the Recruitment Rules of 2016, reads as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">            "5. Special Provision - Each Cadre Controlling Authority
     (CCA) shall have its own separate cadre, unless otherwise
     directed by the Central Board of Excise and Customs."</blockquote><p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">      7.     Relying on the above provision, it was contended

that the practice of ICT ceased to exist after introduction of the
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       16</span>



2016 Rules. It is submitted that the practice of ICT has been

completely taken away with the intention of maintaining each

Commissionerate as a separate unit with a separate cadre.

This, it is submitted, is with the intention of correctly

maintaining the seniority, reservation etc. within the cadre

and that any interference with the cadre would result in

upsetting the apple cart. The learned ASG contended that

inasmuch as Annexure A1 order granting ICT to the

respondents was issued without authority, Annexure A2 order

cancelling Annexure A1 was fully justified and the impugned

order by which the Tribunal set aside Annexure A2 would

result in resurrecting an illegal order. It is further contended

that Annexure R4, the Recruitment Rules of 2016, is issued in

exercise of the power conferred by the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_1">Article 309</a>

of the Constitution of India and therefore, Annexure R4 cannot
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                       17</span>



be varied or diluted by executive orders. It is submitted that,

at best, an executive order can only supplement a statutory

rule and cannot supplant the rule. Reliance was placed on the

decisions in <a href="/doc/147563/" id="a_2">Ajaya Kumar Das v. State of Orissa and others</a>

[(2011) 11 SCC 136] and <a href="/doc/785114/" id="a_3">State of Orissa and others v.

Prasanna Kumar Sahoo</a> [(2007) 15 SCC 129], to drive home

the above contention.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      8.     In Ajaya Kumar's case, the question that arose for

consideration was, whether the Government of Orissa could,

by its circulars modify Rule 74(b) of the Orissa Service Code,

which was a statutory rule formulated under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_4">Article 309</a> of

the Constitution of India. Answering the issue, the Honourable

Supreme Court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "10. Neither the Circular dated June 18, 1982 nor the
      subsequent Circular dated March 19, 1983 modifying the
      earlier Circular dated June 18, 1982 can override the
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                        18</span>



      statutory provision contained in R.74(b) of the Code if it
      results in reduction of pay of the employee on promotion.
      That Orissa Service Code has been framed under Art 309 of
      the Constitution of India is not in dispute. It is well settled
      that    Statutory    Rules       framed   under      <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_5">Art.309</a>   of
      the Constitution can be amended only by a Rule or
      Notification duly made under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_6">Art. 309</a> and not otherwise.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      Whatever       be    the     efficacy     of   the      Executive
      Orders or Circulars or Instructions, Statutory Rules cannot be
      altered or amended by such Executive Orders or Circulars or
      Instructions nor can they replace the Statutory Rules. The
      Rules made under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_7">Art.309</a> of the Constitution cannot be
      tinkered by the administrative Instructions of Circulars."</blockquote><p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">      9.     In Prasanna Kumar Sahoo's case, the issue was

whether, the State Government could take a policy decision in

exercise of its power under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_8">Article 162</a> of the Constitution,

contrary to the statutory rules framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_9">Article 309</a> of the

Constitution. The Apex Court answered the issue by holding

that even a policy decision taken by the State in exercise of its

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_10">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of India
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                       19</span>



would be subservient to the Recruitment Rules framed by the

State either in terms of a legislative act or the proviso

appended to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_11">Article 309</a> of the Constitution of India. It was

held that a purported policy decision issued by way of an

executive instruction cannot override the statute or statutory

rules, far less the constitutional provisions.

</p><p id="p_15">      10. The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted

that some Commissionerate's had issued orders effecting ICT,

disregarding the 2016 Recruitment Rules and this had caused

the Government of India to issue             Circular No.F.No.A-

22015/117/2016-Ad.IIIA dated 20.9.2018 [Exhibit R1(o)],

informing all Commissionerates that the practice of ICT has

been stopped in the light of the new Recruitment Rules of

2016.       After taking into consideration Rule 4 of the

Recruitment Rules, 2002 and Rule 5 of the Recruitment Rules,
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                       20</span>



2016, the Government observed in Ext.R1(o) that the

Recruitment Rules of 2016 does not have a provision for

recruitment by absorption and accordingly no ICT application

can be considered after coming into force of the Recruitment

Rules, 2016. The only exemption provided under the Circular

is consideration of individual cases on extreme compassionate

grounds. Even in such cases, the transfer would be allowed

only on loan basis, with a maximum tenure of three years

which can be extended with the specific approval of the

Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs for a further

period of two years depending upon the administrative

requirement. Further, such transfers would be on condition

that the officials transferred on loan basis shall not be

considered for promotion unless they re-join their parent

cadre. In the circular, it is clarified as under:
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       21</span>



              "Now, therefore, it is hereby clarified that an office
       order for Inter Commissionerate Transfer in the Grade of
       Inspectors issued on or after 26.12.2016 (i.e. from the date of
       enactment of RR, 2016) will be non-est and accordingly any
       officer who has joined another Zone in pursuance of such
       order shall be treated as a deemed case on loan basis w.e.f.
       26.12.2016. These officers shall be on deemed loan till
       31.03.2019,       on      which      date     the      officers
       shall stand relieved and be reverted to their parent Zones.
</p><p id="p_16">              All CCA are directed to take necessary steps in this
       regard immediately."
</p><p id="p_17">      11. It was contended that in the absence of power, the

respective Chief Commissioners could not have issued orders

granting ICT to the party respondents.                In support of this

proposition, the learned ASG relies on the decisions in Prem

Parveen v. Union of India and others [1973 SCC OnLine

Delhi 194] and <a href="/doc/309345/" id="a_12">Bhagawati Prasad Gordhandas Bhatt v. The

State of Gujarat and others</a> [1976 SCC OnLine Gujarat 51].

In Prem Parveen's case, the petitioner had challenged an order
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                       22</span>



by which he was transferred from the Directorate of

Extension, Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi to the office of

the Regional Station on Forage Production, Surat. The

question considered by the High Court was as to whether the

Government had the right to transfer a confirmed permanent

Government servant against the latter's will outside his cadre.

Answering the question, it was held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            "It is true that once the Government is shown to have
     the authority to transfer a Government servant the courts
     would be most reluctant and disinclined to interfere, with the
     exercise administrative discretion by the Government on the
     obviously possible plea that the administration is the best
     judge and in the know of all relevant circumstances to
     determine as to the desirability or the propriety of any
     particular posting of a Government servant. It was held, even
     in the face of such constraints, it is the bounden duty of the
     courts to interfere in a case where it is shown that there is no
     legal authority in the Government to transfer a Government
     servant. That, the executive can only act in pursuance of the
     powers given to it by law and it can claim immunity from
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                       23</span>



     challenge only on the condition that it can support the legality
     of its action before a court of justice. Based on the said
     reasoning, it is held by the High Court that in the absence of
     authority to transfer the petitioner therein outside his cadre,
     the impugned order of transfer is bad, since the same is

     unauthorised and without any support of law."</blockquote><p id="p_18">

</p><p id="p_19">      12. In Bhagwati Prasad's case, the challenge was

against an order of deputation by which the petitioner therein

was proposed to be sent on deputation to a post outside his

cadre. After an elaborate consideration of precedents, it was

held by the High Court that on principle and authority, it was

clear that a person belonging to a cadre cannot be deputed or

transferred outside the parent department and outside the

cadre. The contention is that the power vested with the Chief

Commissioners to effect ICT in exceptional cases having been

taken away by the introduction of the Recruitment Rules of

2016, the inter-commissionerate transfer granted under
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                       24</span>



Annexure A1 is ex-facie illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      13. The next contention urged by the learned

Additional Solicitor General was that issuance of transfer

guidelines by the Government, by itself, would not confer

upon the employees any legally enforceable right.        It was

contended that an order of transfer cannot be interfered with

by the court unless the order is issued with mala fide intention

or is made in violation of statutory provisions. That the

jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal being akin

to that of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a>, the constraints

and norms which the High Court observes while exercising its

jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> would apply with equal force to

the Central Administrative Tribunal also. This position, it was

pointed out, was clearly laid down by the Honourable

Supreme Court in Union of India and others v. S.L.Abbas
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                        25</span>



[(1993) 4 SCC 357], wherein it was held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">              "7. Who should be transferred where, is a matter for the
       appropriate authority to decide. Unless the order of transfer
       is vitiated by mala fides or is made in violation of any
       statutory    provisions,    the       Court        cannot   interfere
       with it. While ordering the transfer, there is no doubt, the
       authority must keep in mind the guidelines issued by the
       Government on the subject. Similarly, if a person makes any
       representation      with        respect       to      his   transfer,
       the appropriate authority must consider the same having
       regard to the exigencies of administration. The guidelines say
       that as far as possible, husband and wife must be posted at
       the same place. The said guideline however does not confer
       upon the Government employee a legally enforceable right.</blockquote><p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">              8. The jurisdiction of the Central Administrative
       Tribunal is akin to the jurisdiction of the High Court under
       <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_15">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution of India in service matters. This is
       evident     from   a    perusal       of   <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_16">Art.      323A</a>   of   the
       Constitution. The constraints and norms which the High Court
       observes while exercising the said jurisdiction apply equally
       to the Tribunal created under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_17">Art. 323A.</a> (We find it all the
       more surprising that the learned single Member who passed
       the impugned order is a former Judge of the High Court and is
       thus aware of the norms and constraints of the writ
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018

       jurisdiction). The Administrative Tribunal is not an Appellate
       Authority sitting in judgment over the orders of transfer. It
       cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the authority
       competent       to     transfer.     In    this     case     the
       Tribunal has clearly exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering
       with the order of transfer. The order of the Tribunal reads as if
       it were sitting in appeal over the order of transfer made by
       the Senior Administrative Officer (competent authority)."
</p><p id="p_23">      14. In conclusion, the learned Additional Solicitor

General contended that the Tribunal had exceeded its

jurisdiction in directing to effect transfer of the respondents,

who were only eight among the 122 officers proposed to be

transferred under Annexure A1. It was submitted that by

issuing such a direction, the Tribunal had virtually stepped

into the shoes of the administration. It was pointed out that if

the direction of the Tribunal is given effect, that would result

in total chaos at the Commissionerate to which the

respondents are to be transferred. It was hence contended

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                       27</span>



that the order of the Tribunal was per se illegal and hence

unsustainable.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      15. The counter arguments for the respondents was led

by Senior Counsel Sri. O. V. Radhakrishnan, ably supported by

Advocates Shafik M. Adbulkhadir and Ravi. K. Pariyarath.     It

was contended that the impugned order was well founded and

fully justified and therefore did not warrant interference. Our

attention was drawn to Annexure A1 transfer order, wherein it

is stated that the transfer to CGST and CX, Lucknow

Zone/Meerut Zone on ICT basis was being ordered on the

recommendation of the committee constituted for considering

the ICT and in terms of Board's letter F No.A.22015/23/2011-

Ad.IIIA dated 27.10.2011 (Annexure A3).         It was hence

contended that even after Annexure R4 Rules of 2016 had

come into effect, the Board was ordering ICT based on
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                       28</span>



recommendation of the committee constituted for that

purpose. The learned Senior Counsel relied on Annexure A14

minutes of the meeting of the committee constituted for

considering the representations for ICT. The agenda in the

meeting held on 2.1.2018 was to consider and select the

officers in the grade of Inspector entitled for transfer on inter

Commissionerate grounds, for the vacancies available as on

31.12.2017. It was submitted that the fact that vacancies as

on 31.12.2017 was considered for ICT and orders issued

would indicate that in spite of Annexure R4 Rules having come

into effect on 26.12.2016, the practice of ICT continued.      It

was contended that way back from 12.2.1958 onwards, ICT

was being granted based on executive orders issued from time

to time. To support this contention, reliance was placed on

Annexures R1 (f) to R1(l). It was submitted that even prior to
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                       29</span>



switching over of the selection and appointment to the post of

Inspector of Central Excise to all India level from 13.11.2003,

the Central Board of Revenue had issued Annexure R1(f)

dated 12.2.1958 with regard to the transfers of Non-Gazetted

staff from one charge to another within the same Department.

Later,    Annexure       R1(g)     order      was   issued   prescribing

conditions for inter-collectorate transfers of Group-C Officers

on compassionate grounds.                   By Annexure R1(h) dated

19.2.2004, decision was taken that henceforth no Inter-

commissionerate transfer shall be allowed for any Group B, C

or D employee and instead, in exceptional circumstances,

depending upon the merits of each case, such transfers shall

be allowed on deputation basis for a period of three years,

subject to the approval of the transferor and transferee Cadre

Controlling Authorities.          Even such transfer on deputation
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018

basis, would be allowed only on extreme compassionate

grounds.      Immediately thereafter, Ext.R1(i) clarification was

issued stating that Inter-commissionerate transfers amongst

the Commissionerates having common cadre, may be allowed

to continue as hitherto, without loss of seniority. The ban on

ICT brought about by Ext.R1(h) was further relaxed under

Ext.R1(j) by permitting ICT of Group B, C and D Officers

beyond the Commissionerates having common cadre, without

any loss of seniority, subject to the twin condition that (i) the

transfer shall be permissible only in cases where the spouse is

employed with either the Central Government or a State

Government or a Public Sector Undertaking of the Central

Government/State Government and (ii) that the option for

change of cadre must be exercised within six months of the

initial appointment of the officer, if the officer is married at the
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                       31</span>



time of appointment and in cases where marriage takes place

subsequent to the appointment, the option should be

exercised within six months of the marriage. Ext.R1(k) is yet

another decision pertaining to ICT whereunder permission for

ICT of Group B, C and D Officers, without loss of seniority was

made possible, in the case of officers appointed against the

5% compassionate vacancies quota.                    Thereafter, under

Ext.R1(l), the benefit of ICT was extended to physically

handicapped employees also.                 Reliance was also placed on

Annexure A3 dated 27.10.2011, which, according to the

learned Counsel, was issued by the Central Board of Excise

and Customs, taking into consideration the relaxation brought

about to ICT through various orders. Under Annexure A3,

decision was taken by the Board to lift the ban on ICT with

immediate effect on the following conditions
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018

</p><p id="p_30">      16. It was contended that the power to order ICT

emanate from Annexure A3, independent of Annexure R4.

That, Annexure R4 being the Recruitment Rules, it does not

take in transfers, since transfer is not a condition of service

and is rather an incidence of service. The following judgments

were cited in support of this contention:

</p>
<p id="p_32">      17. It was submitted that even going by the information

provided by the Government, the provision for ICT, which was

available in the Recruitment Rules of 2002 was deleted from

the Recruitment Rules of 2016, since such provision is

generally not made in the Recruitment Rules.        For this

purpose, reliance was placed on Annexure R1 (p) &amp; R1(q),

which are information provided under the Right to

<a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_24">Information Act</a> and contains the proposal for amendment to

the Recruitment Rules and its notes, which ultimately

It was therefore contended that non-inclusion of the provision

for ICT in the Recruitment Rules of 2016 does not in any

manner effect the right of the respondents for ICT, since their

right is based on Annexure A3.
</p>
<p id="p_33">       18. The learned Counsel further contended that on an

earlier occasion, while dealing with the issue of ICT, the

Central Administrative Tribunal had observed that though the

Government servant had no vested right to ICT, the issue must

be approached by observing the principles of equity and good

conscience. It was further held by the CAT that as a part of

good     governance,        the        authorities   should   keep   the

promise/assurance given to the employees and in such

circumstances, some of the features of the legal principles of

promissory estoppel would also come into play. That the said

order of the Tribunal rendered in O.A.No.959 of 2014 was
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                       36</span>



challenged before this Court in O.P.(CAT) No.77 of 2015 and by

Annexure A4 judgment, the original petition filed by the Union

of India and others, was dismissed. It was submitted that

since the problem faced by the employees, with respect to the

ICT did not get resolved even after Annexure A4 judgment,

some of the employees had yet again approached the CAT by

filing O.A.No.333 of 2016 and the Tribunal had disposed the

matter directing the Chief Commissioner and Commissioner of

Central Excise Customs and Service Tax, Cochin to frame

guidelines to deal with ICT requests. It was submitted that

Annexure A6 is the guidelines framed in accordance with the

direction contained in Annexure A5 order of the Tribunal. It

was contended that having framed guidelines and having

issued transfer orders in accordance with the guidelines as

also the decision of the Committee constituted for considering
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                       37</span>



the proposal for ICT, the respondents are estopped from

cancelling Annexure A1 order.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      19. The point that arise for consideration from the

pleadings and the arguments advanced is whether, the

absence of provision for ICT in the Recruitment Rules of 2016

would curtail the right of the respondents for ICT and whether

the executive orders leading up to Annexure A3 can exist

independently and govern the field of ICT, de hors Annexure

R4 Rules of 2016.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      20. As far as the contention with respect to estoppel

based on Annexures A4 to A6 is concerned, we immediately

note that Annexures A4 judgment of this Court and Annexure

A5 order of the Tribunal were passed at a time when

Annexure R3 Recruitment Rules of 2002 was in force. Since

Rule 4 (ii) of Annexure R3 provided for ICT, the Tribunal was
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                       38</span>



justified in issuing the directions. For the same reason, this

Court was right in upholding the findings of the Tribunal, as

per Annexure A4 judgment.                   Even though, Annexure A6

guidelines was issued after Annexure R4 Recruitment Rules of

2016 had come into force, the guidelines were issued in

compliance of Annexure A5 order of the Tribunal, which was

prior to the coming into force of the Recruitment Rules of

2016 and as such the guidelines do not have any persuasive

effect, as was attempted to be canvassed by the respondents.

Even otherwise, merely because guidelines pertaining to ICT

had been issued, that would not have any binding effect on the

respondents in view of Annexure R4 Rules. Hence, Annexure

A2 order cannot be interfered with on the strength of

Annexure A6 guidelines. Moreover, it has to be noted that

Annexure A6 pertains to the Cochin Commissionerate alone.
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018

</p><p id="p_36">      21. The contention that transfer is not a condition of

service and that the Recruitment Rules of 2016 does not

govern the ICT of the respondents and on the other hand, the

ICT is based on Annexure A3 order and Annexure A6

guidelines, has to be answered after considering the

precedents cited by the learned Counsel. After careful study of

the decisions rendered in Lily Kurien v. Sr. Lewina and

others [AIR 1979 SC 52], <a href="/doc/600280/" id="a_25">General Officer Commanding and

another v. Dr.Subhash Chandra Yadav</a> [(1988) 2 SCC 351],

Reddy's case (supra), the appellant had joined the Andhra

University as Senior Lecturer and in course of time, he was

promoted as Professor.             The conditions of service under

which the appellant was appointed in the promoted post of

Professor contained a clause that the appellant shall enter into

a written contract with the University.           Accordingly, the

appellant entered into an agreement as required by the

conditions of service and Section 24 of Chapter V of the

Administration Manual of the University. Later, the Syndicate

passed a resolution determining the agreement with the

appellant and thereby terminating his service. The appellant

thereupon filed a suit which was later withdrawn, and a writ

petition filed before the High Court. The Division Bench of the

High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the

impugned action had neither been taken as a measure of
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                       41</span>



punishment for any misconduct on the part of the appellant

nor did it involve the breach of any mandatory statutory

obligation or any principle of natural justice and that since the

impugned        resolution,      by    which   the   agreement   was

determined, was based upon Section 24 of Chapter V of the

Administration Manual and Clause 10 of the agreement, the

appellant could not have any legal grievance and that no writ

lay to quash the order terminating the contract of service.

Aggrieved, the appellant approached the Supreme Court and

by the decision cited supra, the Apex Court dismissed the

appeal finding that the terms and conditions of service

specified in the contract of employment entered between the

appellant and the University contained an express provision

for termination of his services by six months' notice on either

side.    Our attention was drawn to paragraph 13 of the
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018

judgment, wherein, relying on the explanation in <a href="/doc/1543800/" id="a_29">State of

Madhya Pradesh v. Shardul Singh</a> [1970 (3) SCR 302], the

Apex Court held that the expression 'conditions of service'

means all those conditions which regulate the holding of a

post by a person right from the time of his appointment till his

retirement and even beyond it. We are of the opinion that the

decision does not in any manner support the contention of the

respondents and on the other hand lays down the position

that the expression 'conditions of service' takes in all those

conditions which regulate the holding of post by a person,

from the time of his appointment till his retirement and even

beyond it. The respondents cannot therefore rely on Subba

Reddy's case to contend that transfer does not fall within the

expression 'conditions of service'. <a href="/doc/1850124/" id="a_30">In Varadha Rao v. State of

that arose for consideration was whether an order of transfer

of a Government servant made by an authority other than the

Government itself, is appealable before the Government under

Rule 19 of the Karnataka Civil Services (Classification, Control

and Appeal) Rules, 1957. While dilating on this point, the Apex

Court explained the decision in <a href="/doc/1327287/" id="a_31">E. P. Royappa v. State of

Tamil Nadu</a> [AIR 1974 SCC 555] wherein, it was observed as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "It is an accepted principle that in public service transfer
      is an incident of service. It is also an implied condition of
      service and appointing authority has a wide discretion in the
      matter. The Government is the best judge to decide how to
      distribute and utilise the services of its employees. However
      this power must be exercised honestly, bona. fide and
      reasonably. It should be exercised in public, interest. If the
      exercise of power is based on extraneous considerations or for
      achieving an alien purpose or an oblique motive it would
      amount to mala fide and colourable exercise of power. Frequent
      transfers, without sufficient reasons to justify such transfers,
      cannot but be held as in fide. A transfer is mala fide when it is
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018

      made not for professed purpose, such as in normal course or in
      public or administrative interest or in the exigencies of service
      but for other purpose than is to accommodate another person
      for undisclosed reasons. It is the basic principle of rule of law
      and good administration, that even administrative actions
      should be just and fair. The observation that transfer is also an
      implied condition of service is just an observation in passing. It
      certainly cannot be relied upon in support of the contention
      that an order of transfer ipso facto varies to the disadvantage of
      a Government servant, any of his conditions of service making
      the impugned order appealable under R. 19(1)(a) of the Rules."
</blockquote><p id="p_37">The Apex Court explained the observation in Royappa's case

that transfer is also an implied condition of service, by stating

that it is just an observation in passing and cannot be relied

upon in support of the contention that an order of transfer

ipso facto varies, to the disadvantage of a Government servant,

any of his conditions of service. The explanation in Varadha

Rao's case cannot therefore be relied on in support of the

proposition that transfer is not a condition of service. In fact,

a Division Bench of this Court in Sreenarayana Trust and

others v. State of Kerala [ILR 2007 (2) Ker. 478], while

considering the extent of power of the Kerala University to

issue first statutes regarding transfer of teachers of colleges

under corporate managements affiliated to the university,

considered the question as to whether transfer is a condition

of service. Argument had been advanced before the Division

Bench, based on the decision in Varadha Rao's case (supra),

that transfer is not a condition of service and is only an

incident of service. The Division Bench held that in Varadha

Rao's case, the Supreme Court had only held that transfer is an

incident of service of an employee and therefore, transfer of

an employee does not result in any change in the conditions of

service, to the disadvantage of the employee.    The Division

Bench placed reliance on the decision of the Apex Court in

     contend that once appointed or posted in a particular place or
     position, he should continue in such place or position as long as

     inherent in the terms of appointment but also implicit as an
     essential condition of service in the absence of any specific

     a mala fide exercise of power or violative of any statutory
     provision (an Act or Rule) or passed by an authority not
     competent to do so, an order of transfer cannot lightly be
     interfered with as a matter of course or routine for any or every
     type of grievance sought to be made. Even administrative
     guidelines for regulating transfers or containing transfer policies
     at best may afford an opportunity to the officer or servant
     concerned to approach their higher authorities for redress but
     cannot have the consequence of depriving or denying the
     competent authority to transfer a particular officer/servant to
     any place in public interest and as is found necessitated by
     exigencies of service as long as the official status is not affected
     adversely and there is no infraction of any career prospects such
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018

     as seniority, scale of pay and secured emoluments. This Court has
     often reiterated that the order of transfer made even in
     transgression of administrative guidelines cannot also be
     interfered with, as they do not confer any legally enforceable
     rights, unless, as noticed supra, shown to be vitiated by mala
     fides or is made in violation of any statutory provision."</blockquote><p id="p_38">
</p><p id="p_39">     (Emphasis Supplied)
Based on the aforementioned observation, the Division Bench

went on to hold that transfer is an incident of service and it is

a condition of service. In the light of the decision of the Apex

Court in Gobardhan Lal's case, followed by the Division Bench

of this Court in Sreenarayana Trust, we have no hesitation to

hold that transfer is a condition of service and is also an

incidence of service and that transfer of an employee does not

in any manner alter his conditions of service.

and others</a> [(1998) 3 SCC 495], the Karnataka Government

1971, which contained a provision for promotion to the post

of leading firemen from the post of Firemen/Firemen Drivers.

An examination was conducted in accordance with the Rules

and a select list prepared for promotion to the post of leading

firemen. Pending the select list, the Government of Karnataka

took a policy decision that promotions to various posts,

including that of leading firemen, shall be made on the basis

of seniority-cum-merit and not by selection. The Karnataka

Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977 was

amended accordingly and the appellants promoted to the post

of leading firemen based on seniority. Their promotions were

challenged on the ground that the Karnataka Civil Services

(General Recruitment) Rules, 1977 was not applicable and

that promotion to the post of leading firemen shall continue to

be governed by the Mysore Fire Force (Cadre Recruitment)

Rules, 1971 made by the State Government under Section 39

of the Fire Force Act, 1954. Answering the issue involved, the

Apex Court held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           "It is no doubt true that the Rule-making authority under
    <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_34">Article 309</a> of the Constitution and Section 39 of the Act is the same,
    namely, the Government (to be precise, Governor, under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_35">Article 309</a>
    and Govt. under Section 39), but the two jurisdictions are different.
    As has been seen above, power under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_36">Article 309</a> cannot be
    exercised by the Governor, if the legislature has already made a law
    and the field is occupied. In that situation, Rules can be made under
    the Law so made by the legislature and not under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_37">Article 309.</a> It has
    also to be noticed that Rules made in exercise of the rule-making
    power given under an Act constitute Delegated or Subordinate
    legislation, but the Rules under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_38">Article 309</a> cannot be treated to fall
    in that category and, therefore, on the principle of "occupied field",
    the Rules under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_39">Article 309</a> cannot supersede the Rules made by the
    legislature."</blockquote><p id="p_41">
</p><p id="p_42">      23. The contention urged, based on the principle laid

down in the afore-mentioned decision is that, insofar as the

Recruitment Rules of 2016 do not contain any provision
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                       50</span>



regarding transfer, it is not an occupied field and therefore,

Annexure A3, which is an Executive Order governing the issue

of ICT is a valid order. The said contention regarding the

absence of provision prohibiting ICT in the Recruitment Rules

of 2016 and the validity of Annexure A3 order cannot be

countenanced for the following reasons; it is not in dispute

that Annexure R3 Recruitment Rules of 2002 contained a

provision enabling ICT. It is an admitted fact that no such

provision is included in the Recruitment Rules of 2016 and on

the other hand, Rule 5 of Annexure R4 specifically stipulate

that each Cadre Controlling Authority (CCA) shall have its own

separate cadre, unless otherwise directed by the Central

Board of Excise and Customs.                Any inter-commissionerate

transfer would violate the unique identity of each cadre

envisaged under Rule 5 of Annexure R4, the Recruitment
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                       51</span>



Rules of 2016. In that view of the matter, ICT orders issued on

the strength of Annexure A3 would definitely be a

transgression into the field occupied by Annexure R4 Rules

issued in exercise of the power under the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_40">Article

309</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_43">      24. For the reasons mentioned above, we find

considerable force in the contention urged by the learned

Additional Solicitor General that Annexure A1 having been

issued without authority and in violation of the Recruitment

Rules of 2016, was invalid and hence the cancellation of

Annexure A1 by issuing Annexure A2 was perfectly in order.

The decisions in Prem Parveen v. Union of India and others

[1973 SCC OnLine Delhi 194] and <a href="/doc/309345/" id="a_41">Bhagawati Prasad

Gordhandas Bhatt v. The State of Gujarat and others</a> [1976

SCC OnLine Gujarat 51], lend credence to the contention.
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                       52</span>



Moreover, the question as to whether Annexure A3 or

Annexure R4 would govern the ICT of the respondents is no

longer doubtful in view of Ext.R1 (o) Circular dated 20.9.2018

wherein, the Government of India has made it absolutely clear

that the Recruitment Rules, 2016 do not have any provision

for recruitment by absorption and accordingly, no ICT

application can be considered after coming into force of the

Recruitment Rules, 2016. In the light of Ext.R1(o), no reliance

can be placed on Exts.R1(p) and R1(q) which are only office

notes and related correspondences.
</p>
<p id="p_44">      25. Having held that transfer is a condition of service,

we also hold that it is well within the power of the employer to

take a policy decision either to grant or not to grant ICT to its

employees. There cannot be a judicial review and interference

on such policy decisions. In the absence of a provision for ICT
 O.P.(CAT) Nos.173, 176 &amp; 190 of 2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                       53</span>



in Annexure R4 Recruitment Rules of 2016, the Tribunal could

not have found fault with the authorities in having issued

Annexure A2 order cancelling Annexure A1 by which ICT was

granted to the respondents and others.
</p>
<p id="p_45">       In such circumstances, we find it impossible to sustain

the findings in the impugned orders of the Tribunal.

Consequently, the original petitions are allowed, setting aside

the impugned orders of the Central Administrative Tribunal in

O.A.Nos.956/2017, 148/2018 and 164/2018.
