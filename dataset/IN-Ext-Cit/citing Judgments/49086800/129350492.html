                         -----

BY THE COURT:</pre>

<p id="p_1">       This appeal under <a href="/doc/1629483/" id="a_1">Section 384</a> of the Indian

Succession Act, 1925 ('the Act') is directed against the

order dated 25.7.2012 passed by the Additional District

Judge, Sojat, District Pali, whereby application filed by

Baya Bai and others, under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_2">Section 372</a> of the Act has

been    rejected.    However,       the   objections    filed   by

Narayan Dutt have been accepted and he has been

declared    heir    of   late   Mathura     Bai   and     further

succession certificate has been ordered to be issued in

his name.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       The litigation has got a checkered history, the

dispute pertains to succession to one Mathura Bai. The

application under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_3">Section 372</a> of the Act was filed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            4</span>

Baya Bai, Makniya Bai and Gulab Chand before the

District Judge, Pali on 11.10.1982 seeking succession

certificate with respect to the amount lying with the

State Bank of Bikaner &amp; Jaipur, Sojat City branch in

fixed deposits and in saving bank account.

    Another application under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_4">Section 372</a> of the Act

was filed by respondent No.2 - Narayan Dutt claiming

himself to be a adopted son of Late Smt. Mathura Bai,

for issuance of succession certificate on 10.7.1984

before the District Judge, Pali. Both the applications

were consolidated and it was directed that respondent

No.2 - Narayan Dutt shall be addressed as objector

No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_3">    On 15.1.1992, the matter was transferred to the

Court of Additional District Judge, Sojat. The matter

was initially decided by the trial court by judgment

dated 15.10.1998, whereby the objections filed by

Shyam Lal and Narayan Dutt were rejected and the

application filed by Baya Bai, Makniya Bai   and Gulab

Chand was accepted and it was ordered to grant

succession certificate to the legal representatives of

said three applicants as all the three applicants had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   5</span>

died during the pendency of the proceedings. The

judgment     dated      15.10.1998           was      challenged   by

Narayan    Dutt    by    filing       S.B.    Civil    Misc.   Appeal

No.687/1998, which appeal was allowed by judgment

dated 27.1.2012 by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court

and the judgment dated 15.10.1998 was set-aside and

the matter was remanded back to the trial court to

rehear and decide the matter again.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     The case of Baya Bai and others was that Smt.

Mathura Bai wife of Late Shri Radhavallabh died on

28.2.1979 in Sojat; Radhavallabh was son of Rewa

Shankar; Rewa Shankar had two daughters Mumal Bai

and Fati Bai besides the son Radhavallabh; Fati Bai was

married to Nathmal and had died 22 years ago; Baya

Bai was daughter of Fati Bai and was married to

Ramchandra, R/o Jalore; Mumal Bai was married to

Bhav Dutt and had daughter Makaniya Bai and son

Gulab Chand; Mathura Bai died intestate her husband

Radhavallabh, had died before her and both of them

had not adopted any one during their life time.

</p><p id="p_5">     Based    on     the    said        averments,        succession

certificate pertaining to the deposits with the Bank was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                   6</span>

sought. It was indicated in the application that initially

Ramchandra S/o Purshottam Das claiming himself to

be   heir   of   Mathura    Bai       applied   for   issuance   of

succession certificate being Civil Misc. Case No.17/79,

wherein the fact about the applicants being heirs of the

deceased Mathura Bai was suppressed and when this

fact was brought to the notice of the court by the non-

applicant Mangi Lal therein, Ramchandra withdrew the

application.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     During the pendency of the proceedings before

the trial court, Gulab Chand expired and in his place,

Shrimali Brahamin Mahalaxmi Trust, Sojat was ordered

to be impleaded as legal representative, whereafter

during the pendency of the appeal at earlier stage both

Baya Bai and Makniya Bai also died and the said Trust

was impleaded as their legal representative.

</p><p id="p_7">     Shyam Lal - respondent No.1 filed objection on

28.5.1983        alleging   that       the      applicants   have

deliberately not indicated the name of other relatives,

the family tree of Mathura Bai was produced as

Schedule-A and it was indicated that wife and children

of deceased Ram Ratan were alive and they have not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  7</span>

been impleaded as party, deceased Mathura Bai had

adopted Narayan Dutt S/o Shyam Lal during her life

time and after death of Mathura Bai, religious and

social obsequies were performed by Narayan Dutt.

Important        facts     pertaining        to     relationship    of

Ramchandra, Shyam Lal and                    Mangilal have been

suppressed;        escheat     proceedings           regarding     the

property of Mathura Bai was pending before the District

Collector, Pali.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     Respondent No.3 - Durga Dan filed his objection

on 31.7.1989 alleging that Mathura Bai died on

28.2.1979; had no legal representative / heir and the

property    is    in     possession     of    the    State   through

Collector, the applicants are not heirs of Mathura Bai;

Collector, Pali and State are necessary parties.

</p><p id="p_9">     Respondent No. 2 - Narayan Dutt filed objections

on 21.11.1987 claiming himself to be the first class

heir of Mathura Bai being her adopted son, it was

claimed that Mathura Bai had adopted him during her

life time; the application was filed by Ramchandra

seeking succession certificate; as Ramchandra was

residing mostly at Karnataka, he was not aware of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                 8</span>

adoption and after coming to know of the same, the

application was withdrawn; during the pendency of the

escheat    proceedings      before        the   Collector,   Pali,

applicants cannot claim succession certificate; Mathura

Bai adopted him on 13.12.1978 at Sojat and was given

in adoption by his father Shyam Lal, the adoption took

place in the presence of relatives by adopting due

procedure and therefore, he was entitled to get the

succession certificate.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     The trial court framed four issues, which reads as

under:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">     "1:- आय     पर    सखय 01    स 03     मतक
     मरर ब ई   क उतर ध क र नह ह? 'अप र गण'

     3:- आय मतक        मरर ब ई अपन  ज.वनक '
     म% उजद र शय म' ' क पत न र यणदत क$ ग$द
     ल'य     'अप र गण'
     4:- अनत$ष "

     On    behalf   of    the   applicants,     four    witnesses

</pre><p id="p_11">Makniya Bai, Som Lal, Ashok Kumar and Narsingh Rao

were produced.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     On behalf of the objectors, seven witnesses

Narayan Dutt, Shyam Lal, Tiku Lal, Kanhaiyalal, Kailash

Chandra,    Nand     Kumar          and   Mahesh       Dan   were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 9</span>

examined, several documents were also produced.

</p><p id="p_13">     The trial court, after the remand made by the

High Court, by the impugned judgment, first dealt with

issue No.3, which pertained to the adoption of Narayan

Dutt by Mathura Bai and came to the conclusion that

even as per applicant - Makniya Bai, Narayan dutt

looked after Mathura Bai during her last time and

conducted funeral, which fact is sufficient to prove that

the old lady, pleased with the service of Narayan Dutt

and being part of the family must has adopted him;

documents Ex.-A/1 to A/7 cannot negate the evidence

produced by Narayan Dutt and as the documents

pertained    to   the    proceedings   related    to   escheat

proceedings in which Narayan Dutt was not a party, he

did not get any opportunity to contradict the same and

if Shyam Lal has shown Narayan Dutt, as his son in the

said document, the same might have happened on

account of the fact that he was natural born son of

Shyam Lal and consequently, came to the conclusion

that from the evidence it cannot be said that Narayan

Dutt was not an adopted son of Mathura Bai.

</p><p id="p_14">     Issue   No.1       which   pertained   to   the   right   of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                       10</span>

applicants Baya Bai and others was negated based on

the finding on issue No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_15">     While deciding Issue No.2, it was held that their

were several children of Ram Ratan, brother of the

applicants      and       even    if,       the      applicants    proved

themselves to be heirs of Mathura Bai, as the said

persons have not been impleaded as party, succession

certificate cannot be issued, however, as they were not

heirs of deceased Mathura Bai, the issue has lost its

significance and ultimately passed the order as noticed

herein-before.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     It   is    submitted        by        learned    counsel     for   the

appellants that the trial court committed grave error in

coming to the conclusion that Narayan Dutt was

adopted        son   of    deceased          Mathura      Bai.    It    was

submitted that the alleged adoption took place on

13.12.1978 and Mathura Bai expired on 28.2.1979, i.e.

within 2½ months of the alleged adoption, which by

itself makes the entire story about adoption doubtful,

the requirements of provisions of <a href="/doc/497207/" id="a_5">Sections 6</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/754978/" id="a_6">9</a> of the

Hindu Adoptions and <a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_7">Maintenance Act</a>, 1956 ('Adoption

Act') have been violated; though the issue framed by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                             11</span>

the trial court was as to whether Narayan Dutt was

adopted by Mathura Bai during her life time, the finding

recorded by the trial court is that a conclusion cannot

be drawn that Narayan Dutt was not adopted son            of

Mathura Bai, which finding itself is against the issue

wherein the burden of proving the issue was on the

respondents, however, the same has been decided as if

the   burden   to   prove   the   negative   was   on    the

appellants, which has vitiated the finding. Mankiya Bai,

who appeared as AW-1 in the witness box was not

cross-examined on the issue of adoption and even the

case of the respondents was not put in the cross-

examination    and therefore,     the   respondents     have

miserably failed to prove the issue of adoption. With

reference to the documents Ex.-A/1 to A/5, which

pertained to escheat proceedings and were all filed by

Shyam Lal, father of Narayan Dutt, who claims to have

given Narayan Dutt in adoption to Mathura Bai, claimed

himself and Ramchandra as successors and did not

even refer to the adoption, which clearly proves the

story of adoption as false, despite being confronted

with the documents, the same were not explained. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                            12</span>

requirement of a valid adoption like giving and taking

having taken place cannot be believed; none from the

plaintiff's side, close relatives, were present and no

documentary proof have been produced to show that

Narayan Dutt was adopted by Mathura Bai and that he

has shown himself to be the son of Mathura Bai.

</p><p id="p_17">     It was submitted that as the appellants, who were

the only successors in terms of provisions of the <a href="/doc/685111/" id="a_8">Hindu

Succession Act</a>, 1956 ('HS Act'), who were sought to be

displaced by alleging an adoption, the burden was

heavy on the respondents, which they have failed to

discharge and therefore, the finding of the trial court

deserves to be quashed and set-aside.

</p><p id="p_18">     It was submitted that the finding on issue No.2 is

also incorrect, inasmuch as, besides the fact that there

was no evidence on record regarding the existence of

children of Ram Ratan, even if they were in existence,

they were not heirs of deceased Mathura Bai and

therefore, finding in this regard also deserves to be

set-aside.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     Reliance was placed on judgment of Hon'ble

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/151619456/" id="a_9">Madhusudan Das v. Smt. Narayani

Bai &amp; Ors</a>. : AIR 1983 SC 114.
</p>
<p id="p_20">     Learned counsel for the respondents vehemently

opposed the submissions made by learned counsel for

the appellant, it was submitted that the adoption of

Narayan Dutt was proved on record from the oral

evidence, wherein as many as seven witnesses were

produced and all the witnesses in one voice have said

that the adoption had taken place and the required

ceremonies were also undertaken and therefore, the

finding of the trial court does not call for any

interference.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     It was further submitted that the application was

filed by three persons namely Makniya Bai, Baya Bai

and Gulab Chand. However, except from Makniya Bai,

none of the applicants appeared in the witness-box,

though Gulab Chand died on 2.1.1997 before which,

the evidence of applicants had already been concluded.

</p><p id="p_22">     With regard to the documents Ex.-A/1 to A/7, it

was submitted that in none of the documents and

proceedings Narayan Dutt       was a party and as the

person claiming adoption was not a party to the said

documents, the same cannot be used against him; as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                             14</span>

the escheat proceedings in which the documents Ex.-

A/1 to A/7 were produced, were summary in nature,

the same cannot be used in the present proceedings. It

was submitted that from the statement of Makniya Bai

AW-1 itself, it is admitted that it was only and only

Narayan Dutt, who used to look after Mathura Bai,

funeral obsequies were performed by him, proves

beyond any doubt that he was adopted by Mathura Bai

and therefore, the findings recorded by the trial court

does not call for any interference.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     Reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/334788/" id="a_10">Sita Ram Bhau Patil v.

Ramchandra Nago Patil</a> : AIR 1977 SC 1712; <a href="/doc/1130047/" id="a_11">Kanu

</p>
<p id="p_24">     I have considered the submissions made by

learned counsel for the parties and have perused the

material available on record alongwith the record of the

trial court.
</p>
<p id="p_25">     At the outset, it may be noticed that applicants

Baya Bai, Makniya Bai and Gulab Chand, filed an

application claiming themselves to be the only heirs of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                             15</span>

deceased Mathura Bai, it was indicated that Mathura

Bai was married to Ramvallabh, who was son of Rewa

Shankar; Ramvallabh had two sisters - Mumal Bai and

Fati Bai, while Baya Bai was daughter of Fati Bai,

Mankiya Bai and Gulab Chand were children of Mumal

Bai.
</p>
<p id="p_26">       HS Act under <a href="/doc/686634/" id="a_13">Section 15</a> provides for general rules

of succession of female Hindu and under <a href="/doc/1100213/" id="a_14">Section 16</a>

provides    for order of succession     and manner of

distribution among heirs of a female Hindu, wherein

firstly, the property of a female Hindu dying intestate

devolves upon the son and daughter (including the

children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) &amp; the

husband and secondly, upon the heirs of the husband.

</p><p id="p_27">       In the present case, as admittedly Mathura Bai

had no son, daughter, children of any pre-deceased

son or daughter or husband at the time of her death,

the property would devolve upon heirs of her husband.

</p><p id="p_28">       The succession in case of Hindu male is governed

by Section 8 of the HS Act, wherein the property

devolves on the relatives specified in Class-I of the

schedule and if there is no heir in Class-I, then upon
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                             16</span>

the heirs specified in Class-II of the schedule. The

Schedule with the Act gives out the heirs in Class-I and

Class-II.
</p>
<p id="p_29">     Admittedly, in Class-I of the said schedule none of

the relatives of Radhavallabh, husband of Mathura Bai

are available and therefore, the property would divolve

on Class-II heirs and Class-II heirs indicates sister's

son and sister's daughter in entry IV at item No.(2) &amp;

(4) respectively. In view thereof, the applicants - Baya

Bai, Makniya Bai and Gulab Chand being sister's       son

and sister's daughter, are the heirs of deceased

Mathura Bai.
</p>
<p id="p_30">     In so far as the existence of legal representatives

of Ram Ratan being the legal heirs of deceased

Mathura Bai is concerned, the said Ram Ratan, even as

per the case of the respondents had died prior to death

of Mathura Bai and the Schedule in so far as Class-II

heirs are concerned does not provide for devaluation of

property on the pre-deceased relatives         in contra

distinction to what is indicated in Class-I heirs. In view

thereof, even if any children of Ram Ratan were

available, they would not fall within the heirship of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                17</span>

Smt. Mathura Bai.
</p>
<p id="p_31">     This is besides the fact that no material is

available on record to indicate the existence of any

legal representatives of deceased Ram Ratan except for

indication given by the respondents in the family tree

filed alongwith their reply.
</p>
<p id="p_32">     In view thereof, the applicants - Baya Bai,

Makniya Bai and Gulab Chand were only Class-II heir of

Mathura Bai and the finding recorded by the trial court

on issue No.2 besides being wholly cursory, is contrary

to the provisions of law as well as material available on

record and is therefore, liable to be set-aside.

</p><p id="p_33">     However, in case, the respondent No.2 Narayan

Dutt succeeds in his contention that he was adopted by

Mathura Bai before her death on 13.12.1978 in

accordance with the provisions of the Adoption Act,

then in that case Narayan Dutt would be the only heir

of Smt. Mathura Bai in terms of provisions of Section

15(1)(a) of the HS Act and the applicants would have

no right in the property.
</p>
<p id="p_34">     It is interesting to note that after the application

was filed by three applicants, Shyam Lal was the first
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                             18</span>

person to file objections and inter-alia came out with

the case that deceased Mathura Bai had adopted his

son Narayan Dutt and prayed that the application be

dismissed. Whereafter, one Durga Dan filed objections

based on the pendency of escheat proceedings             and

lastly, Narayan Dutt filed his objections on 21.11.1987

claiming himself to be the only heir of deceased

Mathura Bai based on the adoption. For the purpose of

proving adoption, Narayan Dutt himself entered the

witness-box as NAW-1 and produced NAW-2 Shyam

Lal, his father; NAW-3 Tiku Lal, a retired Gram Sewak;

Kanhaiyalal, father-in-law of Narayan Dutt as NAW-4;

Kailash Chandra Vyas, co-brother of Narayan Dutt as

NAW-5; Nand Kumar and Mahesh Dan as NAW-6 &amp; 7

respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_35">     The principle regarding the level of proof in a case

where a natural successor is sought to be displaced by

an adopted person has been laid down by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the case of Madhusudan Das (supra),

wherein it has been inter-alia laid down as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "19. It is well settled that a person who seeks
     to displace the natural succession to property by
     alleging an adoption must discharge the burden
     that lies upon him by proof of the factum of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                         19</span>

adoption and its validity. A. Raghavamma v. A.
</blockquote><p id="p_36">Chenchamma, AIR 1964 SC 136. It is also true
that the evidence in proof of the adoption should
be free from all suspicion of fraud       and so
consistent and probable as to give no occasion
for doubting its truth. <a href="/doc/1359532/" id="a_15">Kishori Lal v. Chaltibai</a>,
(1959) Supp 1 SCR 698 : (AIR 1959 SC 504).
Nonetheless the fact of adoption must be proved
in the same way as any other fact.

<p id="p_37">20. For a valid adoption, the physical act of
giving and taking is an essential requisite, a
ceremony imperative in all adoptions, whatever
the caste. And this requisite is satisfied in its
essence only by the actual delivery and
acceptance of the boy, even though there exists
an expression of consent or an executed deed of
adoption. Shoshinath v. Krishnasunder, (1880) 7
Ind App 250. <a href="/doc/1008889/" id="a_16">In Lakshman Singh v. Smt.
Rupkanwar</a>, (1962) 1 SCR 477, 490 : (AIR 1961
SC 1378 at p. 1381), this Court briefly stated the
law thus :
</p><p id="p_38">      "Under the Hindu Law, whether among the
regenerate caste or among Sudras, there cannot
be a valid adoption unless the adoptive boy is
transferred from one family to another and that
can be done only by the ceremony of giving and
taking. The object of the corporeal giving and
receiving in adoption is obviously to secure due
publicity. To achieve this object it is essential to
have a formal ceremony. No particular form is
prescribed for the ceremony, but the law requires
that the natural parent shall hand over the
adoptive boy and the adoptive parent shall
receive him. The nature of the ceremony may
very depending upon the circumstances of each
case. But a ceremony there shall be, and giving
and taking shall be part of it."
</p><p id="p_39">In some cases, to complete the adoption a "data
human" has been considered necessary, but in
the case of the twice-born classes no such
ceremony is needed if the adopted boy belongs
to the same gotra as the adoptive father. <a href="/doc/265118/" id="a_17">Bal
Gangadhar Tilak v. Shrinivas Pandit</a>, (1915) 42
Ind App 135 : (AIR 1915 PC 7). In the present
case, the appellant has pleaded the custom of his
community that the act of giving and taking
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                             20</span>

     suffices to effect a valid adoption, and nothing
     has been shown to us to indicate that the further
     ceremony of "data homam" was necessary."

     The requirements of valid adoption under the

Adoption Act, inter-alia provides for requisites of a

valid adoption under <a href="/doc/497207/" id="a_18">Section 6</a>, qualifications of a

persons giving in adoption under <a href="/doc/754978/" id="a_19">Section 9</a>, persons

who may be adopted under <a href="/doc/1737382/" id="a_20">Section 10</a> and other

conditions for a valid adoption under <a href="/doc/1340229/" id="a_21">Section 11</a>. The

witnesses Tiku Lal, Kanhaiyalal, Kailash Chandra Vyas,

Nand   Kumar     and   Mahesh    Dan,   either      have   no

connection with the family as such or like Kanhaiyalal

and Kailash Chandra Vyas are father-in-law and co-

brother   of   Narayan   Dutt.   None    of   the    witness

pertaining to very large family of either Jethmal, Rewa

Shankar or any other person, was produced though it

was claimed that ceremony was attended by several

persons and Kanhaiyalal, father-in-law and Kailash

Chandra Vyas, co-brother travelled from Pali and were

informed about the adoption seven days in advance,

which fact clearly proves that there was sufficient time

available for informing and / or calling other relatives

as well, however, none of the relatives has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                            21</span>

produced to support the contention regarding the

adoption.
</p>
<p id="p_40">     In those circumstances, the conduct of Shyam Lal,

father of Narayan Dutt, who being the natural father is

a necessary constituent of the entire process of

adoption becomes very relevant and significant.

</p><p id="p_41">     The documents, which were produced by the

applicants as Ex.-A/1 to A/7, which pertained to

escheat proceedings initiated after death of Smt.

Mathura Bai, are clearly reflective of the conduct of

Shyam Lal wherein Ex.-A/1 is the site report pertaining

to the property of Smt. Mathura Bai dated 16.6.1979,

which is signed by Narayan Dutt himself. Ex.-A/3 is the

reply dated 21.6.1979, wherein Shyam Lal informed

that Smt. Mathura Bai accepted Shyam Lal and Ram

Chandra, his brother as the close relatives. It was also

indicated that regarding the estate of Smt. Mathura

Bai, he alongwith Ram Chandra and Gulab Chand and

Baya Bai had right and no case of escheat is made out.

He also claimed that he was the close relative of Smt.

Mathura Bai and has done the funeral obsequies and

the house was in his possession.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                            22</span><p id="p_42">

</p><p id="p_43">     Another application dated 24.11.1980 Ex.-A/6 was

filed by Shyam Lal praying that he alongwith his

brother Ram Chandra have filed an application for

succession before the District Court, Pali and therefore,

the proceedings be dropped.
</p>
<p id="p_44">     In another objection, filed by Shyam Lal as agent

of Ram Chandra, his brother Ex.-A/4, the family tree

was given wherein it was not indicated that the

deceased Smt. Mathura Bai was succeeded by Narayan

Dutt as her heir on account of adoption and Ram

Chandra claimed that during life time of Smt. Mathura

Bai, he used to lookafter her and the property was in

his possession through Shyam Lal. As noticed herein-

before, the said application on behalf of Ram Chandra

was filed and signed by Shyam Lal himself.

</p><p id="p_45">     Another application dated 19.7.1982 Ex.A/7 was

filed by Shyam Lal, wherein it was inter-alia claimed as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">    "प र ह उपर$क ककशद म ' एव मक न क एक-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">    म त म ल'क ह0 जजस प प करन क क न;न. हकद र भ. प र
    ह ह।"</blockquote><p id="p_46">

</p><p id="p_47">     The said conduct of Shyam Lal, which started on

16.6.1979 vide Ex.-A/1 and continued till 19.7.1982
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                            23</span>

vide Ex.-A/7, clearly indicates that at no stage, Shyam

Lal took the plea that Narayan Dutt was the adopted

son of Smt. Mathura Bai and repeatedly claimed

himself alongwith Ram Chandra, even as agent of Ram

Chandra, as entitled to succeed to the properties of

deceased Smt. Mathura Bai. The first document Ex.-

A/1, is duly signed by Narayan Dutt himself and

therefore,   the   plea   of    Narayan   Dutt   claiming

unawareness regarding the escheat proceedings is

baseless. As to what prevented him to set up his claim

in the escheat proceedings is wholly unknown as he

has not indicated any reason for not setting up his

claim based on the adoption.
</p>
<p id="p_48">     It is also interesting to note that the alleged

adoption had taken place on 13.12.1978, Smt. Mathura

Bai died on 28.2.1979 and immediately thereafter the

escheat proceedings were initiated and therefore, there

was no reason for Shyam Lal to have forgotten and /

or not remembering the fact of adoption of Shyam Lal

having been adopted son of Smt. Mathura Bai and / or

being the only heir of deceased Smt. Mathura Bai.

When Shyam Lal appeared in the witness-box, and was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                            24</span>

confronted with the documents Ex-A/1 to A/7, he

avoided to answer any of the questions and / or gave

totally evasive / vague answers, inasmuch as, he

initially accepted having filed Ex.-A/3, and then denied

whether the signatures were put by him or not,

admitted that he conducted proceedings on behalf of

Ram Chandra and his signatures on Ex.-A/4 and when

confronted with the contents of Ex.-A/4 denied that he

indicated that Ram Chandra was the closest relative

and claimed that the lawyer might have written so,

admitted that he did not make any mention of adoption

of Narayan Dutt by Smt. Mathura Bai and gave reason

that as nobody asked him regarding adoption, he did

not disclose the fact about adoption of Narayan Dutt.

</p><p id="p_49">     The explanation of Shyam Lal for not disclosing

the alleged adoption is on its face baseless and false,

inasmuch as, as soon as it was required of Shyam Lal

to make any mention of legal representatives / heir of

deceased Smt. Mathura Bai, if the adoption had taken

place on 13.7.1978, then within a period of 03 months

of alleged adoption, when the requirement arose

regarding the succession of Smt. Mathura Bai, in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                               25</span>

first instance, Shyam Lal should have taken stand that

Narayan    Dutt    was    the      only   heir     and    legal

representative    of   Smt.   Mathura     Bai    having   been

adopted by her.
</p>
<p id="p_50">     As noticed already herein-above, Narayan Dutt

despite being aware of escheat proceedings chose not

to contest the same and permitted his father to claim

himself to be the heir and entitled to the properties of

Smt. Mathura Bai, also is indicative of the fact that in

fact, the adoption did not happen on 13.12.1978 or

any other date.
</p>
<p id="p_51">     So far as judgments cited by learned counsel for

the respondents pertaining to <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_22">Section 145</a> of the

Evidence Act are concerned, the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of Sita Ram Bhau Patil (supra) held

that even if the admission is proved in accordance with

the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_23">Evidence Act</a> and if it is to be

used against the party, who has made it, it is sound

that if a witness is under cross-examination on oath,

he should be given an opportunity, if the documents

are to be used against him, to tender his explanation

and to clear up the point of ambiguity or dispute. In
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                           26</span>

the present case, the said requirement of <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_24">Section 145</a>

of the Evidence Act as laid by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has been followed to the hilt, inasmuch as,

Shyam Lal was given full opportunity to explain the

documents Ex.-A/1 to Ex.-A/7, to which he gave a very

lame answer that as he was not asked about the

adoption, he did not disclose the fact of adoption and

continued to claim himself to be the heir of deceased

Smt.Mathura Bai, which explanation on its face is

baseless.
</p>
<p id="p_52">    Similarly, in the case of Kanu Ambu Vish (supra),

it was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that even

where witness is confronted by his previous statement

in terms of <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_25">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act and given

an opportunity to explain that part of the statement,

the same does not constitute substantive evidence.

The fact that Shyam Lal claimed himself to be the sole

heir alongwith Ram Chandra as legal heir, which

statement in the documents, has been proved in terms

of <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_26">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act, the same is not

being used as substantive evidence in the present case

rather the same clearly discloses the conduct of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                             27</span>

person, who claims to have given his son in adoption

and within 03 months of the said adoption, over a

period of two years continued to claim himself to be

the legal representatives and does not disclose the fact

of adoption at any stage during that period, clearly

shows that his testimony regarding having given his

son in adoption cannot be believed and therefore, the

said judgment, does not came to the aid of the

respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_53">     The judgment in the case of Major Som Nath

(supra) cited by the respondent himself clearly brings

out the said aspect, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme

Court has inter-alia held as under :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">    "It is true that when a witness has admitted
    having signed his previous statements that is
    enough to prove that some statement of his was
    recorded and he had appended his signature
    thereto. The only question is, what use can be
    made of such statements even where the
    witness admits having signed the statements
    made before the Military Authorities. They can at
    best be used to contradict in the cross-
    examination of such a witness when he gives
    evidence at the Trial Court of the accused in the
    manner provided under <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_27">Section 145</a> of the
    Evidence Act. If it is intended to contradict the
    witness by the writing, the attention of the
    witness should be called before the writing can
    be proved to those parts of it which are to be
    used for the purpose of contradicting him. If this
    is not done, the evidence of the witnesses
    cannot be assailed in respect of those
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                             28</span>

    statements by their previous proving that the
    witness had signed the document. When the
    witnesses are contradicted by their previous
    statements in the manner aforesaid then that
    part of the statements which has been put to the
    witness will be considered along with the
    evidence to assess the worth of the witness in
    determining his veracity. The whole of the
    previous statement however cannot treated as
    substantive evidence."</blockquote><p id="p_54">

</p><p id="p_55">     In view of the above, it is apparent that though

Narayan dutt has tried to make out a case by way of

oral evidence of his father-in-law, co-brother and few

other persons, the very fact that the statement of

Shyam Lal, the person who claims to have given

Narayan Dutt in adoption to Smt. Mathura Bai cannot

be believed in view of documentary evidence in the

form of Ex.-A/1 to Ex.-A/7 as extensively discussed

herein-before, the fundamental requirement of the

provisions of Adoption Act of giving in adoption by the

parent of adopted child itself is not proved on account

of the conduct of Shyam Lal as evidenced herein-

before, the fact of adoption of Narayan Dutt to Smt.

Mathura Bai, cannot be believed and therefore, the

respondents have failed to discharge the burden,

pertaining to issue No.3.
</p>
<p id="p_56">     The trial court committed error of law and fact in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                     29</span>

       not taking into consideration the material documentary

       evidence,   conduct     of   Shyam   Lal,   a   necessary

       constituent for giving son in adoption, and assuming

       negative burden regarding the fact of adoption on the

       applicants, and therefore, the finding on issue No.3

       cannot be sustained and deserves to be set-aside.

</p><p id="p_57">            In view of the above discussion, the appeal is

       allowed. The order dated 25.7.2012 passed by the trial

       court is quashed and set- aside. The appellants, as

       represented by    Shrimali Brahamin Mahalaxmi Trust,

       Sojat would be entitled to get succession certificate
