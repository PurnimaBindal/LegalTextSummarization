                          Beecham Corporation (later renamed &quot;GlaxoSmithKline LLC&quot;) on
                          27th March, 2009. Novartis claims that the suit patent was first
                          assigned by GlaxoSmithKline LLC to the Glaxo Group Ltd on 5th
                          October, 2015, on which date, by a back-to-back assignment deed, the
                          suit patent was assigned by the Glaxo Group Ltd to Novartis Pharma
                          AG, who, by another assignment deed of the same date, i.e. 5th
                          October, 2015, assigned the suit patent to Plaintiff 1. Plaintiff 2 is the
                          Indian subsidiary of Plaintiff 1, which imports and markets the
                          patented product in India. The defendant does not dispute these
                          assertions, at least at this stage.

                          is used for the treatment of thrombocytopenia, denoting insufficiency

                          the market. This, alleges the plaintiff, infringes Claim 1 of the suit
                          patent (which is still alive) as the defendants have obtained no license
                          from the plaintiffs. Ergo, the plaintiff seeks an injunction against the
                          defendants from infringing the suit patent, and the present application

<p id="p_20">                          8.        The title of IN 176 was &quot;A compound and a pharmaceutical

                          International Filing Date of IN 176 was 24th May, 2001; ergo, the
                          patent expired on 24th May, 2021. EO was, according to the defendant,
                          the &quot;subject matter covered by&quot; IN 176; hence, it was not entitled to
                          any protection after 24th May, 2021, by virtue of <a href="/doc/153434503/" id="a_8">Section 53(4)</a><a href="/doc/679815/" id="a_9">5</a> of the
                          Patents Act. According to the defendant, Claim 1 of IN 161 was
                          covered by Claims 1 to 4 and 6 of IN 176, Claim 2 of IN 161 was
                          covered by Claim 8 of IN 176 and Claim 3 of IN 161 was covered by
                          Claim 9 of IN 176.

                          IN 161, seek to &quot;evergreen&quot; IN 176 beyond the life of the latter patent.
                          As, according to him, IN 161 is invalid on the various grounds urged
                          by him, manufacture and marketing of EO, by his client, cannot be
                          alleged to amount to infringement. I may observe, here, that the
                          plaintiffs do not dispute the priority dates of IN 176 or IN 161, as

                          the advantages of EO over Eltrombopag per se, were that EO had
                          better       solubility          and       bioavailability             and,       therefore,          better

                          to Eltrombopag. Novartis9, he submits, had clearly held that enhanced
                          bioavailability was insufficient to indicate enhanced therapeutic

                          context, to the First Examination Report dated 24th September, 2007,
                          in response to the application for registration of the suit patent. The
                          IPO required the plaintiff to submit copies of such examination
                          reports in at least the USA, EP and Japan.                                       The defendant takes
                          exception to the plaintiff, in its response filed on 28th July, 2008, filing
                          the Examination Reports from USA, Europe, China and Columbia and
                          suppressing, in the process, the office action issued in respect of the
                          Canadian patent CA 697, and the response of Novartis to the
                          Canadian IPO in which the formation of some salts during the
                          reaction process was admitted. The same infirmity, the defendant
                          contends, attaches to the response of the plaintiff to the Second
                          Examination Report dated 1st September, 2008 and the Third
                          Examination Report dated 22 September 2008. As a result, contends
                          the defendant, the Controller of Patents in the IPO was denied
                          awareness of the response of Novartis in the patent proceedings in
                          Canada.

                           9.8        Clearing the way - A contention, advanced by the plaintiffs,
                          that the defendant had not &quot;cleared the way&quot;, before proceeding to
                          illegally exploit the suit patent IN 161, was sought to be met by
                          submitting that, having waited for the expiry of IN 176 before
                          launching its EO product, no further clearing of the way was required
                          on the part of the defendant. This, the written submission asserts, was
                          &quot;sufficient clearing of the way&quot;. In this context, the defendant has also
                          sought to distinguish the judgement of the Division Bench of this
                          Court         in    <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_38">Merck         Sharp   &amp;   Dohme   Corpn   v.     Glenmark
                          Pharmaceuticals16 (&quot;Merck</a> v. Glenmark&quot;, hereinafter). Among other
                          things, the fact that, in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_39">Merck v. Glenmark16</a>, the specie patent was
                          not asserted, and the assertions were restricted to the genus patent, has
                          been emphasised as a point of distinction. If the genus and the specie
                          patent were to be simultaneously asserted, contends the defendant, the
                          specie patent would become vulnerable to revocation under <a href="/doc/965111/" id="a_40">Section
                          13(1)(b)</a> read with <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_41">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act. That apart, it is also
                          contended that <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_42">Merck v. Glenmark16</a> is per incuriam, as it is contrary

                          interest also justifies the refusal of the plaintiff&#x27;s prayer for

                          Singh, learned Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that EO was a novel
                          and inventive compound. EO, he submits, was a salt which did not
                          form part of any approved drug prior to the suit patent IN 161. It was
                          a technical advancement over Eltrombopag per se, which was claimed
                          and disclosed in prior art. EO, was, therefore, a new and inventive

                          thereof. No particular salt was, however, disclosed in IN 176, and no
                          drug, including Eltrombopag, was taught by IN 176. EO, the subject
                          matter of Claim 1 of the suit patent IN 161, was the outcome of
                          protracted research and development undertaken on Eltrombopag. EO
                          was a breakthrough drug used for treatment of chronic idiopathic
                          thrombocytopenia, and had been marketed, in India, since 2011 under
                          the brand name &quot;REVOLADE&quot;. EO itself had been granted patent
                          protection in over 60 jurisdictions. The therapeutic efficacy of EO
                          stood recognised in over 90 countries, in which patent protection had
                          been granted to it. EO was, therefore, a novel, inventive and technical
                          advancement over IN 176. The subject matter of the invention
                          claimed in Claim 1 of the suit patent IN 161 was, therefore, distinct
                          and different from the entity claimed in Claim 6 of IN 176. Mr.
                          Hemant Singh submits that there could be no question of any claim, or
                          disclosure, of EO in IN 176, as EO was not known a pharmaceutically
                          acceptable salt of Eltrombopag prior to the priority date of IN 161.

                          invention, he submits, does not amount to anticipation by prior
                          claiming. In this context, Mr. Hemant Singh seeks to draw a

                           EO, Mr. Hemant Singh submits that, as EO is a pharmaceutically
                          acceptable salt of Eltrombopag, it would fall, generally speaking,
                          within the coverage of claim 6 of IN 176. Illustrating this position
                          with respect to EO, Mr. Hemant Singh submits that EO is only one of
                          several pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Eltrombopag, which was
                          unknown at the time of grant of IN 176. As all pharmaceutically
                          acceptable salts of Eltrombopag are covered by Claim 6 of IN 176,
                          EO was also covered by the said description. The coverage of a
                          subsequent novel and inventive product in the broad description of an
                          earlier patent would not, according to Mr. Hemant Singh, result in
                          anticipation by prior claiming, so as to invalidate the latter patent. He
                          points out that EO was never claimed in IN 176.

                          efficacy. Potentially infringing patents can also, therefore, according
                          to Mr. Hemant Singh be granted, as infringement would depend on

                          an entity which has not been earlier claimed is eligible, even if it falls
                          within the coverage of a patent which has earlier been claimed and
                          granted. For this reason, though EO falls within the coverage of IN

                          the suit patent IN 816 claimed Sitagliptin and its pharmaceutically

                          Sitagliptin, was not claimed in IN 816, as it was not disclosed in the

                          is disclosed. Resultantly, the complete specifications, read with the

                          be identical to the invention claimed in prior art. Only then, he
                          submits, can it be said that the invention claimed in the suit patent was
                          claimed and anticipated in the genus patent/prior art. The onus, to
                          establish such prior claiming, is on the defendant. The defendant is
                          required to show, positively, that the invention claimed in the suit
                          patent was earlier claimed in its entirety by individualised description,
                          exemplification or illustration, in prior art. Tested on this high

                          EO was claimed or disclosed in IN 176. He cites, in this context,

<p id="p_102">                          10.9 Mr. Hemant Singh, thereafter, addressed the issue of
                          obviousness, vis-à-vis US 976. He submits that US 976 did not even
                          pertain to pharmaceutical products, but related to an ethanolamine salt
                          of N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine (NPHA), which was used in the
                          acrylic industry to provide a solution to prevent polymerisation over
                          the ammonium salt of NPHA. As such, he submits, US 976 is not
                          even relevant prior art, for the purpose of obviousness. The chemical
                          structure of NPHA, too, he submits, is not compatible with EO.
                          Further, the stoichiometric ratio of the 2 entities are different, with US
                          976 having a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1, whereas the suit patent has a
                          stoichiometric ratio of 1:2. For the same reason, none of the other US
                          patents, on the basis of which Mr. Sai Deepak based his challenge to
                          the suit patent as obvious, he submits, can be regarded as relevant.
                          US 185 dealt with concentrates for veterinary use, and could never,
                          therefore, be obvious to a person skilled in the art as a source from
                          which to derive EO. US 831 advised against the use of olamine salts.
                          US 666 referred to monoethanolamine as an excipient in its laundry
                          list. It did not teach any method for increasing bioavailability of the
                          compounds such as Eltrombopag. It dealt with the olamine salt of
                          piroxicam. Relying on the judgement of the Division Bench of this

                          obviousness. All these patents, he submits, were invoked only on
                          hindsight analysis. He reiterates that, prior to IN 161, there was no
                          pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Eltrombopag, with the olamine
                          radical, known to the industry.

                          Act. This provision, he submits, was ex facie inapplicable, as no drug
                          came out of IN 176 and no drug, containing Eltrombopag, was ever
                          approved prior to IN 161.         The subject matter of IN 161, i.e.
                          Eltrombopag Olamine, he submits, was not a &quot;known substance&quot;

                          he submits, claimed the free acid Eltrombopag, which had no known

                          Pharmaceuticals International Pvt Ltd28 to contend that the very fact
                          that the marketable drug had first emerged from the suit patent IN 161

<p id="p_106">                          As EO had higher yield of Eltrombopag, as well as enhanced

                          Hemant Singh submits that the therapeutic efficacy of EO was greater
                          than Eltrombopag in the free acid form. He also submits that the
                          maximum plasma concentration of EO was thrice the plasma
                          concentration of Eltrombopag in free acid form, in half the time,

                          submits, had led to drug development and, consequently, enhanced

                           fact, the reluctance of the Supreme Court to hold, in Novartis9, that
                          the subject matter of the patent in controversy before it (i.e. the β-
                          crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate) had increased therapeutic
                          efficacy was because no material, in that regard, had been produced
                          before the Supreme Court. Besides, he submits, the Supreme Court
                          was examining a situation in which Imatinib Mesylate, in salt form,
                          was already known and marketed, and increased therapeutic efficacy
                          was being claimed in respect of the β-crystalline form thereof. Unlike
                          the situation that obtained there, Mr. Hemant Singh submits that, in
                          the present case, EO was an unknown substance prior to IN 161. He
                          also relies on the observation, in paras 191 and 192 of the report in
                          Novartis9, that <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_74">Section 3(d)</a> did not bar &quot;incremental inventions of
                          chemical and pharmaceutical substances&quot; and that a new product was
                          not necessarily required to be non-existent, before the suit patent. The
                          Supreme Court, he submits, had observed that the new product could
                          &quot;mean something different or better than the recent previous or same
                          kind subject to test of enhanced efficacy.&quot;

                          hereinafter) to the US and European equivalents of IN 176, Mr.
                          Hemant Singh submits that the criterion for eligibility for grant of
                          PTE or SPC was coverage, not claiming. Under US law, Mr. Hemant
                          Singh submits that the patentee was entitled to file more than one
                          application for grant of PTE, for more than one patent, but that,
                          ultimately, PTE would be granted only to one patent. EO, he asserts,
                          was claimed and disclosed for the first time in US 719, which was
                          equivalent to IN 161, though it was covered under both US 870 and
                          US 719. For the same reason, Mr. Hemant Singh submits that the
                          Orange Book included patents which covered and encompassed the
                          invention, as well as those patents which claimed the invention. The
                          reliance, placed by Mr. Sai Deepak on the entries in the Orange Book
                          is also, therefore, according to him, misplaced.

                          patent IN 161 of Novartis. The submission of Mr. Sai Deepak, in this
                          regard, that the defendant had cleared the way by waiting for the
                          expiry of the patent term of IN 176 before taking steps towards the
                          manufacture and marketing of EO, he submits, is completely

                           11.2 Apart from the judgement of the Supreme Court in Novartis9,
                          there are authoritative pronouncements, by Division Benches of this
                          Court, which set, at rest, many of the issues in controversy in the
                          present case.            These are, chronologically, <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_81">Merck v. Glenmark16</a>,
                          <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_82">Roche v. Cipla-II23 and Astrazaneneca</a> v Intas20. I may note, here,
                          that there are also interlocutory orders, passed by various single
                          benches of this Court, in similar fact circumstances, and learned
                          Counsel for both sides have placed reliance on these decisions. To my
                          mind, where the law stands enunciated by the Division Benches, no
                          occasion arises for the Court to refer to any interlocutory order by a
                          Single Bench. It is trite that interlocutory orders, which are merely
                          prima facie opinions, and are always subject to revision at any later
                          stage of the proceedings, have no precedential value whatsoever.30
                          They do, however, have a limited role to play, as harbingers of
                          consistency, as Courts are expected to maintain consistency in interim
                          orders, where the facts are similar, and warrant a similar approach.31
                          Beyond this, however, interlocutory orders cannot aspire.

<p id="p_117">                          11.3 Interestingly, in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_83">Merck v. Glenmark16</a>, the Division Bench of
                          this Court clearly deferred from the view expressed by an earlier
                          Division Bench in <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_84">Roche v. Cipla-I17</a>, observing that the latter
                          decision was merely a judgement rendered on an appeal against an
                          interim order of a Single Judge. If a final judgement on an appeal
                          preferred against an interim order of a Single Judge is not binding,
                          and another Division Bench can differ from the said decision without

                          property and, especially, in patent matters. Patent law is,
                          unquestionably, still in an adolescent, even if not infantile, stage, and
                          much of the territory remains, even as on date, unexplored. It remains,
                          nonetheless, an area of law governed by statute, and, therefore, in my
                          view, one has, in the first instance, to be guided by decisions of Indian
                          courts, rendered in the light of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_85">Patents Act</a> applicable to this
                          country, before seeking sustenance from decisions rendered abroad.
                          Of course, this would apply only where the field is occupied by
                          decisions of Indian courts, and not where the court finds itself in
                          virgin territory. Where there are binding precedents of Indian courts,
                          therefore, I confess my reluctance to resort, extensively, to foreign
                          decisions, especially when they are cited with no attempt at
                          comparing and contrasting the statutory interdicts, applicable in the
                          country to which the decision pertains, with those that apply here. A
                          Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court cautioned, over half a
                          century ago in <a href="/doc/197048/" id="a_86">State of West Bengal v. B.K. Mondal32</a>, thus, albeit in

                                 statutory provisions contained in English law. As Lord Sinha
                                has observed in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council
                                in <a href="/doc/1331984/" id="a_89">Ramanandi Kuer v. Kalawati Kuer</a> [55 IA 118 : (1928)
                                ILR 7 Pat 221] &quot;it has often been pointed out by this Board
                                that where there is a positive enactment of the Indian
                                Legislature the proper course is to examine the language of
                                that statute and to ascertain its proper meaning uninfluenced
                                by any consideration derived from the previous state of the
                                law or of the English law upon which it may be founded&quot;. If
                                the words used in the Indian statute are obscure or
                                ambiguous perhaps it may be permissible in interpreting them
                                to examine the background of the law or to derive assistance
                                from English decisions bearing on the point; but where the
                                words are clear and unambiguous it would be unreasonable
                                to interpret them in the light of the alleged background of the
                                statute and to attempt to see that their interpretation
                                conforms to the said background. That is why, in dealing with
                                the point raised before us we must primarily look to the law
                                as embodied in <a href="/doc/628437/" id="a_90">Section 70</a> and see to put upon if a fair and

                          Unfortunately, when citing authorities, rendered abroad in intellectual
                          property matters, no attempt is made to compare, far less parallelize,
                          the statutory provisions applicable in India with those applying in the
                          jurisdiction where the decision has been rendered. Observations in
                          foreign decisions are cited as authoritative propositions, without
                          drawing the attention of the Court to the applicable statutory position
                          in that jurisdiction. This, in my view, should be avoided. At least at
                          the prima facie stage, the Court, if it is to rely on a decision rendered
                          abroad, has to be satisfied that, even in the arena of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_91">Patents Act</a> in
                          India, the decision would apply, and has also to assess the extent of
                          such applicability. This is an involved exercise and, therefore, at the
                          stage of interlocutory injunction, the extent to which the Court can
                          rely on foreign authorities has, in my view, necessarily to be limited.

                           11.5 Having said that, it is always a healthy practice to support the
                          view taken on the basis of the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_92">Indian Patents Act</a>, and the law as it has
                          developed in this country, from decisions rendered in foreign climes,
                          where the decisions provide such support. To that extent, the
                          international and trans-border ramifications of patents, and of patent
                          law, have, undoubtedly, to be borne in mind, but no more.
</p>

<p id="p_120">                          11.6 For analogous reasons, I find it a trifle unjustified for the Court,
                          at a prima facie Order XXXIX stage, to rely on declarations provided
                          to patent authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Reliance on such
                          declarations, or responses provided in reply to queries by patent
                          offices located abroad, would require the Court to be sensitized as to
                          the procedural laws that apply in the concerned jurisdiction, the
                          requirements as to declaration and disclosure that apply there (which
                          vary, often, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction) and the circumstances in
                          which the declaration, or response, was tendered. Arriving, even at a
                          prima facie view, on these issues would, in my opinion, be hazardous.
                          They involve detailed examination, which ought, appropriately, to be
                          consigned to the stage of trial. The Court should, therefore, in my
                          considered opinion, be circumspect in basing its decision to grant, or
                          refuse, interlocutory relief, in patent matters, on such representations
                          made before foreign patent authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_121">                          11.7 The understanding of the law has, therefore, to be guided by the
                          judgement of the Supreme Court as well as authoritative
                          pronouncements of Division Benches of this Court.

                          analysis of the issues in controversy.
</p>

<p id="p_124">                          Novartis

</p><p id="p_125">                          13.   Facts:
</p>

<p id="p_126">                          13.1 Novartis9 did not deal with infringement. Imatinib was one of
                          the derivatives of N-phenyl-2-pyrimidine-amine, which was invented
                          by Jürg Zimmermann, and which could inhibit certain protein kinases,
                          for treatment of tumours. US patent 5521184 (US 184) was granted to
                          Zimmerman, by the US Patent Office, for these derivatives. Novartis9
                          refers to this patent as the &quot;Zimmerman patent&quot;. Novartis applied to
                          the Chennai Patent Office for grant of patent for the β-crystalline form
                          of Imatinib Mesylate, which was a salt of Imatinib. Novartis claimed
                          to have invented Imatinib Mesylate from the free base Imatinib and to
                          have synthesised the β-crystalline form therefrom. Novartis claimed
                          18th July, 1997 as the priority date of its patent, being the date on
                          which it had applied for grant of patent for the β-crystalline form of
                          Imatinib Mesylate in Switzerland.
</p>

<p id="p_127">                          13.2 It is important to note that the patent application of Novartis did
                          not claim any pharmacological superiority of the β-crystalline form of
                          Imatinib Mesylate, over the Imatinib free base. Rather, it was
                          admitted, in the patent application, that &quot;all the indicated inhibitory
                          and pharmacological effects&quot; of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib
                          Mesylate were &quot;also found with the free base&quot;. Thereafter, Novartis
                          filed, before the Patent Office, affidavits of experts in which it was

                           claimed that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate had &quot;much
                          higher bioavailability&quot;, as compared to the free base Imatinib. This, in
                          my view, is a very important factor, for reasons which will become
                          apparent presently.
</p>

<p id="p_128">                          13.3 The application of Novartis, for grant of patent for the β-
                          crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, was rejected by the Patent
                          Office vide order dated 25th January, 2006, on four grounds. These
                          were that (i) the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was
                          anticipated by prior publication by the Zimmerman Patent, (ii) the β-
                          crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was obvious to a person skilled
                          in the art, in view of the disclosure contained in the complete
                          specifications in the Zimmerman Patent, (iii) <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_93">Section 3(d)</a> of the
                          Patents Act rendered the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate non-
                          patentable and (iv) Novartis had wrongly claimed the priority date of
                          filing of the patent application in Switzerland as the priority date for
                          the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. The appeals, preferred
                          by Novartis against the decision of the Patent Office were dismissed
                          by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) by judgement
                          dated 26th June, 2009, solely invoking, for the purpose, <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_94">Section 3</a> (d).
                          It was held, in Novartis&#x27; favour, by the IPAB, that Novartis was
                          entitled to claim 18th July, 1997 as the priority date for its application
                          and that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate satisfied the test
                          of novelty and non-obviousness; however, falling foul of <a href="/doc/1852967/" id="a_95">Section 3(b)</a>
                          and <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_96">Section 3(d)</a> of the Act, no product patent of β-crystalline form of
                          Imatinib Mesylate could be allowed. This order of the IPAB was
                          assailed, by Novartis, directly before the Supreme Court.

                                      Zimmerman Patent and methanesulphonic acid had to be

                                      required to be defined. Novartis pointed out that the
                                      Zimmerman Patent made no reference to polymorphism
                                      or to any crystalline structure. The crystalline form of
                                      Imatinib Mesylate was, therefore, it was contended, a
                                      distinct, and further, invention, beyond Imatinib Mesylate
                                      itself. While thus synthesising the β-crystalline form of
                                      Imatinib Mesylate, suitability of administration to human
                                      beings was also required to be ensured. Comparing the
                                      characteristics of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib
                                      Mesylate with the free base Imatinib, Novartis submitted
                                      that the Zimmerman Patent described (i) how to prepare
                                      the free base Imatinib and (ii) the anti-tumour properties
                                      of the free base Imatinib. Both the steps involved in
                                      proceeding from the free base Imatinib to the β-
                                      crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, therefore, it was

                          or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof&quot;. The Supreme Court
                          went on to note that the application, of Novartis, for a patent extension
                          for the Zimmerman Patent, &quot;leaves no room for doubt that Imatinib
                          Mesylate, marketed under the name Gleevec, was submitted for grant
                          approval as covered by the Zimmerman Patent&quot;. Application for a

                          Board of Patent Appeals, while affirming that the Zimmerman Patent
                          did teach a person skilled in the art how to use Imatinib, or its

                           noted, by the Supreme Court, that, since the grant of the Zimmerman
                          Patent, Novartis had always been maintaining that Gleevec (the brand
                          name under which Imatinib Mesylate was marketed) was part of the
                          Zimmerman Patent. Grant of approval had been obtained for Gleevec
                          on that basis. Extension of the term of the Zimmerman Patent was
                          also sought, by Novartis, on the ground that the regulatory review for
                          Gleevec was pending. Novartis had, moreover, stopped NATCO
                          Pharma from marketing its drug in the UK on the basis of the
                          Zimmerman Patent. The Board of Patent Appeals, too, had held that
                          the Zimmerman Patent contained the requisite teaching for conversion
                          of Imatinib to Imatinib Mesylate, and also taught the use of Imatinib
                          in a pharmacological composition for treating tumours. These findings
                          were binding on Novartis. In view thereof, the Supreme Court held
                          that it was inconceivable as to how Imatinib Mesylate could be
                          regarded as a &quot;new product&quot;, vis-à-vis the Imatinib free base. As held
                          by the Supreme Court:
</p><p id="p_143">                                   &quot;Imatinib Mesylate is all there in the Zimmerman Patent. It is

                          Novartis, as they attested to enhanced efficacy of the β-crystalline
                          form of Imatinib Mesylate, vis-à-vis the Imatinib free base. The
                          Supreme Court observed that the immediately preceding known
                          substance being the non-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate,
                          Novartis, in order to escape <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_109">Section 3(d)</a>, would have to produce
                          evidence to establish that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate
                          had enhanced efficacy over the non-crystalline form of Imatinib
                          Mesylate. No material, in this regard, it was noted, was produced by
                          Novartis.

                          Imatinib Mesylate itself, as salts were known to be more soluble than
                          compounds in the free base form. Once enhanced solubility was
                          ignored, the Supreme Court noted that the additional properties

                          Novartis, were more beneficial flow properties, better thermodynamic

                          the contention of Novartis that the enhanced solubility of Imatinib
                          Mesylate added to its therapeutic efficacy, as the free base Imatinib
                          was incapable of administration to a human being owing to its non-
                          soluble nature, which would result in the substance, if administered,
                          passing out of the body with no therapeutic action whatsoever. The
                          submissions prompted the Supreme Court to deal, in some detail, with
                          the concept of &quot;efficacy&quot;, in the context of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_110">Section 3(d)</a>, thus (in paras
                          157 and 158 of the report):

                                Dictionary of English, Edn. 1998.]. Hence, the test of efficacy
                                in the context of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_111">Section 3(d)</a> would be different, depending
                                upon the result the product under consideration is desired or
                                intended to produce. In other words, the test of efficacy
                                would depend upon the function, utility or the purpose of the
                                product under consideration. Therefore, in the case of a
                                medicine that claims to cure a disease, the test of efficacy can
                                only be &quot;therapeutic efficacy&quot;. The question then arises, what
                                would be the parameter of therapeutic efficacy and what are
                                the advantages and benefits that may be taken into account

                                must be judged strictly and narrowly. Our inference that the

                                   kept in mind that each of the different forms mentioned in the
                                   Explanation have some properties inherent to that form e.g.
                                   solubility to a salt and hygroscopicity to a polymorph. These

                          of <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_115">Section 3</a> (d), is required to be enhanced therapeutic efficacy. The
                          Supreme Court clearly held that Novartis, in order to succeed in its
                          contention that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate possessed
                          enhanced therapeutic efficacy, was required to establish, definitively,
                          that the therapeutic properties of the β-crystalline form were superior
                          to those of the free base Imatinib Mesylate or its non-crystalline form.

                           14.2.5      Though I would again be adverting to this issue, I deem it
                          appropriate to venture, even at this stage, my opinion that, in
                          understanding the observations of the Supreme Court regarding
                          enhanced bioavailability as a basis to claim enhanced therapeutic
                          efficacy, the fact that the Imatinib free base, as well as Imatinib
                          Mesylate, whether in its non-crystalline or β-crystalline form, acted
                          by inhibiting certain protein kinases, and the admissions by Novartis
                          in that regard, cannot be overlooked or ignored. The therapeutic
                          activity of Imatinib Mesylate, or of the Imatinib free base was,
                          avowedly, by inhibiting protein kinases. Once Novartis had, in its
                          application for grant of patent for the β-crystalline form of Imatinib
                          Mesylate, acknowledged, in so many words, that the inhibitory effect
                          of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate also existed in the free
                          base, the submission, of Novartis, that the β-crystalline form
                          possessed enhanced therapeutic efficacy had already lost much of its
                          steam.
</p>
<p id="p_153">                          14.2.6      Even so, the Supreme Court went on to examine the
                          contention, advanced by Novartis before it, that the enhanced
                          bioavailability and solubility of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib
                          Mesylate, enhanced its suitability to act as a drug. No research data,
                          to this effect, having been placed on record by Novartis, the Supreme
                          Court rejected the contention that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib
                          Mesylate had enhanced therapeutic efficacy over either the free base
                          Imatinib Mesylate or its non-crystalline form.

                          as a basis for claiming enhanced therapeutic efficacy over the known
                          prior art. As an absolute proposition, I am unable to agree with this
                          contention.   To my mind, Novartis9 does not lay down any such
                          absolute proposition of law. At the cost of reiteration, there are two
                          important factors, which are required to be borne in mind while
                          examining the principle laid down in Novartis9 on this point,
                          specifically in the context of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_116">Section 3(d)</a> of the Patents Act. The first
                          is that the Supreme Court itself noted that enhanced therapeutic
                          efficacy was required to be established, by Novartis, before it, of the
                          β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, not vis-à-vis the Imatinib
                          Mesylate free base, but vis-à-vis the non-crystalline form of Imatinib
                          Mesylate, as that was the known immediate prior art. The second is
                          that there was an admission, in the application filed by Novartis for
                          grant of patent in respect of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib
                          Mesylate, that all pharmacological and inhibitory properties of the β-
                          crystalline form were present in the Imatinib free base. Once all
                          inhibitory properties of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate
                          were admitted, in the application for the patent, as being present in
                          the Imatinib free base, the onus was heavily on Novartis to establish,
                          with positive data, that the enhanced bioavailability or solubility,
                          possessed by the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate added to its
                          therapeutic efficacy, as an inhibitor of protein kinases.        Absent
                          sufficient research data in this regard, the Supreme Court refused to
                          accept Novartis&#x27; contention that the therapeutic efficacy of Imatinib
                          Mesylate, vis-à-vis Imatinib free base, was enhanced by its additional
                          solubility or bioavailability.   It would be folly, in my view, to

                                   bioavailability as compared to Imatinib in free base form. If

                                   on the issue, however, the question is, can a bald assertion

                                         and extent of absorption. If a drug product is not

                                that emerges is that just increased bioavailability alone
                                may not necessarily lead to an enhancement of
                                therapeutic efficacy. Whether or not an increase in
                                bioavailability leads to an enhancement of therapeutic
                                efficacy in any given case must be specifically claimed and

                                absolutely nothing on this score apart from the adroit
                                submissions of the counsel. No material has been offered to
                                indicate that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate will
                                produce an enhanced or superior efficacy (therapeutic) on
                                molecular basis than what could be achieved with Imatinib

                          the person challenging the validity of the patent to demonstrate, with
                          positive evidence, that the patented form, or formulation, does not
                          possess additional efficacy. It is such a form, or formulation, which is
                          referred to, often, as an &quot;incremental innovation&quot;.

<p id="p_158">                          14.2.12      Interestingly, in para 25.5.7 of the written submissions
                          tendered by Mr Harish Salve, appearing for Cipla, before the Supreme
                          Court in Novartis9, it was contended, with italicised emphasis, that
                          &quot;greater bioavailability, solubility, hygroscopicity therefore, are not
                          part of efficacy&quot;. The Supreme Court did not, however, accept this
                          submission, as propounded before it.         Rather, the decision in
                          Novartis9 clarifies that the onus would be on the patent
                          applicant/holder, who asserts increased bioavailability of his invention
                          to be enhancing its therapeutic efficacy, to so establish. I find it
                          strange that the absolute proposition that bioavailability could never
                          be part of therapeutic efficacy, advanced before the Supreme Court
                          and not accepted, is again being advanced before this Court, exhorting
                          its acceptance.

                          of the ingredient, as a remedy for the illness being sought to be
                          addressed may, however, be enhanced by making the ingredient more
                          available to the body, in a modified formulation. If this happens, the
                          modified formulation becomes patentable under <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_120">Section 3(d)</a>.           In
                          Novartis9, it was admitted, even in the application for patent for the β-
                          crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, that the inhibitory properties
                          contained in the β-crystalline form were also present in the free base
                          Imatinib Mesylate. It was in this background that the Supreme Court
                          held that, once such an admission existed on record, it was for
                          Novartis to produce research data to substantiate its contention
                          regarding enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the β-crystalline form of
                          Imatinib Mesylate, over the free base or the non-crystalline form of
                          Imatinib Mesylate.     Whether such research data was, or was not,
                          produced, is always a question of fact. There can be no precedent on
                          the point, which could bind under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_121">Article 141</a> of the Constitution of
                          India. On facts, the Supreme Court found, in Novartis9, that no such
                          additional research data, which could indicate enhanced therapeutic
                          efficacy of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, over and
                          above the therapeutic efficacy possessed by the free base Imatinib
                          Mesylate, as an inhibitor of protein kinases, was produced. Ergo, held
                          the Supreme Court, the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate had
                          failed the <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_122">Section 3(d)</a> test.

                          had to be &quot;enabling&quot; in character, as would enable a person skilled in
                          the art to synthesise Imatinib Mesylate from Imatinib.               The
                          Zimmerman Patent, while covering and claiming the Imatinib free
                          base, it was contended, did not refer to any salt of a compound, much
                          less Imatinib Mesylate. Nor did it disclose the manner in which
                          Imatinib Mesylate could be synthesised from the Imatinib free base.
                          The conversion of the Imatinib free base to Imatinib Mesylate was,
                          therefore, inventive in nature.     The Supreme Court rejected this
                          contention, observing that it did not approve of a wide gap between
                          coverage and disclosure, using which an artful draftsman could so
                          draft the claim as to escape the coverage of the original patent. In
                          sum, it held that Imatinib Mesylate did not qualify the test of
                          &quot;invention&quot; as defined in <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_124">Section 2(1)(j)</a>, read with <a href="/doc/372733/" id="a_125">Section 2(1)</a> (ja).

                          the Supreme Court, was that, though Imatinib Mesylate, as a
                          pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib, was &quot;covered&quot; by the
                          Zimmerman patent, it was not disclosed in it. Novartis contended that

                           may be entitled to larger coverage than what was specifically
                          disclosed in it&quot;. The teaching in the patent, contended Novartis, lay
                          &quot;in the disclosure/specification that supports the claim&quot;, which
                          &quot;describe the invention&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_164">                          14.3.3       Disapproving of this line of reasoning, the Supreme
                          Court (in para 119 of the report) held that &quot;the dichotomy... sought to
                          be drawn between coverage of claim on the one hand and disclosure
                          or enablement of teaching in a patent on the other hand, (seemed) to
                          strike at the very root of the rationale of the law of patents&quot;. I have
                          observed, in F.M.C. Corporation29, that this proposition, as
                          expounded by the Supreme Court in Novartis9, laid down the law in
                          absolute terms, and could not be restricted to the patents forming
                          subject matter of consideration in that case.
</p>
<p id="p_165">                          14.3.4       Even so, the Supreme Court did not equate &quot;coverage&quot;
                          with &quot;disclosure&quot;. It held that there was no &quot;dichotomy&quot; between
                          &quot;coverage&quot; and &quot;disclosure&quot;, but did not hold that there was no
                          distinction between these two expressions. What was impermissible,
                          according to the Supreme Court, was a wide gap between &quot;coverage&quot;
                          and &quot;disclosure&quot;. The observation that a gap should not be wide,
                          plainly, presumes the possibility of existence of a gap. If coverage
                          and disclosure were to be treated as synonymous, there would be no
                          gap, which would render this finding of the Supreme Court
                          meaningless and superfluous. It is axiomatic that words used by the
                          Supreme Court are, especially in view of their constitutionally binding
                          nature under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_126">Article 141</a> on all authorities in the country, to be

                           14.3.5         Apropos the facts before it, the Supreme Court held thus,
                          in para 135 of the report:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">                                   &quot;In light of the discussions made above, we firmly reject the
                                   appellant&#x27;s case that Imatinib Mesylate is a new product and
                                   the outcome of an invention beyond the Zimmermann Patent.
                                   We hold and find that Imatinib Mesylate is a known
                                   substance from the Zimmermann Patent itself. Not only is
                                   Imatinib Mesylate known as a substance in the Zimmermann
                                   Patent, but its pharmacological properties are also known in
                                   the Zimmermann Patent and in the article published in
                                   the Cancer Research journal referred to above. The
                                   consequential finding, therefore, is that Imatinib Mesylate
                                   does not qualify the test of &quot;invention&quot; as laid down in
                                   <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_127">Section 2(1)(j)</a> and <a href="/doc/372733/" id="a_128">Section 2(1)(ja)</a> of the Patents Act, 1970.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_167">                          Once, therefore, Imatinib, in free base form was disclosed by the
                          Zimmerman Patent, which also claimed the pharmaceutically
                          acceptable salts thereof, the Supreme Court held that it was
                          impermissible for Novartis to contend that Imatinib Mesylate was not
                          disclosed in the Zimmerman Patent, merely because there was no
                          specific reference by way of exemplification, or otherwise, of
                          Imatinib Mesylate therein. Stock was taken, by the Supreme Court,
                          while holding thus, of the fact that the Mesylate salt was one of the
                          pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Imatinib.

<p id="p_168">                          14.4 Based on the above premise, the Supreme Court rejected

                           its patent IN 209816 (IN 816), which claimed Sitagliptin. Glenmark
                          was importing and selling, after local packaging, Sitagliptin Phosphate
                          Monohydrate (SPM) under its brand name &quot;Zita&quot; in India. Merck
                          alleged that this activity infringed IN 816. Accordingly, an injunction
                          was sought against Glenmark.
</p>

<p id="p_171">                          16.   Rival Contentions:
</p>
<p id="p_172">                          16.1 Merck submitted that (i) Sitagliptin was covered in 13 claims of
                          IN 816, (ii) Sitagliptin and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts were
                          specifically claimed in Claim 19 of IN 816, (iii) Claim 1 of IN 816
                          claimed the Sitagliptin molecule with all its salts, (iv) SPM, the
                          product of Glenmark, was, therefore, covered in Claim 19 and in 13
                          claims of IN 816, (v) SPM could not be prepared without
                          manufacturing the active ingredient, which was the Sitagliptin
                          molecule/Sitagliptin free base (SFB) and (vi) use of Sitagliptin by
                          Glenmark to prepare SPM, therefore, infringed IN 816.
</p>

<p id="p_173">                          16.2 Glenmark contended, per contra, that Merck had suppressed
                          the fact that it had itself applied for a separate patent for Sitagliptin
                          Phosphate, which was, thereafter abandoned. The fact that Merck had
                          applied for a separate patent for Sitagliptin Phosphate, contended
                          Glenmark, itself indicated that Sitagliptin Phosphate was not claimed
                          in the suit patent IN 816, as in its application for a separate patent for
                          Sitagliptin Phosphate, Merck claimed Sitagliptin Phosphate to be a
                          novel compound and a new discovery. The title of the application
                          filed by Merck, pointed Glenmark, was &quot;Phosphoric Acid Salt of

                          Sitagliptin Phosphate, it was contended that Merck could not assert
                          that SPM infringed the suit patent IN 816.

<p id="p_174">                          17.   Judgement of the learned Single Judge: The learned Single
                          Judge held, against Merck, that Merck had not pleaded that the
                          addition of phosphate to Sitagliptin did not embody any inventive
                          advancement. Additionally, observed the learned Single Judge, Merck
                          had not shown that Sitagliptin Phosphate was merely a new form of
                          Sitagliptin, medically equivalent to Sitagliptin.

<p id="p_175">                          18.   Further contentions of Glenmark:
</p>

<p id="p_176">                          18.1 Glenmark further contended that IN 816 was vulnerable to
                          invalidity as Merck had not supplied details of foreign patent
                          applications in respect of the same or similar products, as was
                          required by <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_130">Section 8</a> of the Patents Act. It was further contended, by
                          Glenmark, that IN 816 did not disclose the process by which the SFB
                          could be isolated from Sitagliptin. The only salt claimed with an
                          enabling disclosure in IN 816, it was contended, was Sitagliptin
                          Hydrochloride. No other salt was exemplified in the suit patent. As
                          such, Glenmark contended that no salt other than Sitagliptin
                          Hydrochloride was claimed or covered by the suit patent IN 816. The
                          suit patent IN 816, contended Glenmark, did not disclose the SFB.

<p id="p_178">                          18.3 Glenmark further contended that the SFB was not disclosed in
                          the application for suit patent either as raw material or as an
                          intermediate product. This, contended, Glenmark was because Merck
                          was well aware that the SFB, being unstable and lacking industrial
                          application, was non-patentable.

</p>
<p id="p_188">                          19.3 In this context, the Division Bench noted the contention of
                          Glenmark that, even if IN 816 were to be treated as valid but only
                          disclosing the SFB rather than SPM, no case of infringement of IN
                          816 could be said to exist, as Glenmark neither used the SFB nor the
                          lone salt disclosed in the suit patent, namely, Sitagliptin hydrochloride
                          as its raw material and neither the SFB nor Sitagliptin hydrochloride
                          was generated as an intermediate in the manufacturing process.
                          Additionally,     Glenmark     contended     that   SPM   had   enhanced
                          pharmaceutical properties, over those possessed by the SFB. As such,
                          Glenmark contended that the manufacture of SPM, by it, did not
                          infringe the patent, even if it were to be assumed to cover the SFB.

                          validity as held by the Supreme Court in Bishwanath Prasad

                          without any precise enabling disclosure leading one to SPM. In other
                          words, the court was required to consider how elastic the claims in the

<p id="p_192">                          19.5.2       The SFB, it was found, was disclosed in Formula-1 in the
                          &quot;Detailed Description of the Invention&quot; in IN 816 and was also
                          claimed in Claim 1 of its complete specifications. The complete
                          specifications further described the method of isolation of the R-
                          enantiomer of the SFB, which was the enantiomer ultimately used by
                          Glenmark in &#x27;Zita&#x27;. Thus, the method of isolation of the SFB was
                          clearly set out in IN 816.

<p id="p_193">                          19.5.3       Further,   IN   816   identified   the   &quot;pharmaceutically
                          acceptable salts&quot; of the SFB as including salts prepared from, inter
                          alia, phosphoric acid. Phosphates of Sitagliptin stood, thereby,
                          claimed in IN 816. Further, the complete specifications went on to
                          explain that the salts &quot;may also be in form of hydrates&quot;. Thus, the
                          monohydrate form of salts of Sitagliptin also stood claimed. Thus, this
                          Court found, in para 39 of its report, that, while the SFB was clearly
                          disclosed in IN 816, there was a possible disclosure of SPM as well.

<p id="p_195">                          19.5.5               The court went on to clarify, at this point, that a mere
                          claim, without an enabling disclosure, meaning a disclosure as would
                          enable a person ordinarily skilled in the art to work the invention,
                          could not be sustained under the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_132">Patents Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_196">                          19.5.6               This, therefore, gave rise to the question of whether the
                          SFB and SPM were sufficiently disclosed in the suit patent IN 816.
                          The first question, noted the Division Bench, had already been
                          answered by it in the affirmative.
</p>
<p id="p_197">                          19.5.7               Claim construction: The Division Bench thereafter went
                          on to examine and explain how claims in patents were to be construed.
                          It was explained, in this context, that a claim in a patent was required
                          to be construed in the light of the accompanying complete
                          specifications. The complete specifications were, therefore, to be read
                          as a whole, in the light of the state of knowledge of a person ordinarily
                          skilled in the art; not R.K. Laxman&#x27;s immortal &quot;Common Man&quot;, but
                          one who was acquainted with the technology in question. Explained
                          otherwise, the disclosure had to be such as would enable the person
                          ordinarily skilled in the art to make the claimed invention, so as to
                          make it available to the public by the expiry of the patent term. The
                          court also went on to endorse criteria determinative of the sufficiency
                          of the disclosure/disablement, termed the Wands test33. These criteria
                          were (i) the quantity of experimentation necessary, (ii) the amount of
                          directions/guidance contained in the patent, (iii) the presence/absence

<p id="p_198">                          19.5.8       In the case of SPM, or for that matter any other
                          pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Sitagliptin, it was observed that
                          the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was the SFB. The attached
                          salt was only an inert carrier, which wore away once the drug was in
                          the system. The activity of the SFB was not affected by the attached
                          carrier radical, even if the efficacy of the administration of the
                          Sitagliptin free base was influenced thereby. The SFB, previously
                          unknown as a compound which could affect the DPP enzyme was a
                          new and, arguably, a novel invention.
</p>
<p id="p_199">                          19.5.9       The Division Bench went on to hold that, to constitute
                          &quot;prior disclosure&quot;, the prior art was required to disclose the subject
                          matter which, if performed, would infringe the suit patent. This may
                          be taken as a definitive test of &quot;disclosure in prior art&quot; which, if
                          established, would lead to a case of anticipation by prior claiming.

<p id="p_200">                          19.5.10      The question of whether SPM was disclosed in the suit
                          patent, noted the Division Bench, was a vexed question. SPM was
                          neither claimed nor disclosed in any of the examples or schemes
                          contained in the complete specifications of IN 816. The only reference
                          to SPM, in IN 816, was to be found in the mention of a phosphate salt
                          as a possible pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Sitagliptin. The

                          did not amount to a disclosure of SPM; Merck contended, per contra,
                          that such a generic reference was also sufficient disclosure for the
                          carrier salts. Glenmark contended that SPM was physically and
                          chemically different from the SFB, whereas Merck denied this
                          contention. Glenmark contended that the conversion of the SFB to
                          SPM was not obvious to a person ordinarily skilled in the art from IN
                          816, as there were several phosphate salts derivable from the SFB. As
                          against this, Merck contended that SPM was known in the industry.
                          These disputes, observed the Division Bench, were technical in nature
                          and could not be decided at the Order XXXIX stage. In order to
                          determine these disputes, a detailed examination of the issue by an
                          expert would be required.

                          noted the Division Bench, could not be decided at the interlocutory

                          and thus, covered by the suit patent.
</p>
<p id="p_203">                          19.5.13      Glenmark contended that the suit patent IN 816 was bad
                          as it was overbroad and created a false monopoly for undisclosed
                          compounds. It was, therefore, alleged to be invalid on the ground of
                          insufficiency of disclosure. On this aspect, the Division Bench
                          observed that a claim in a patent, conceivably, could encompass
                          embodiments which would be provided/invented in future and had no
                          particularly advantageous properties, provided they employed in a
                          technical contribution made by the invention.
</p>
<p id="p_204">                          19.5.14      Having said this, the Division Bench left open the
                          question of whether IN 816 disclosed SPM for detailed examination
                          during and after trial. Nonetheless, it held that IN 816 did sufficiently
                          disclose the SFB, which was the active ingredient in SPM. The SFB,
                          observed the Division Bench, passed the triple test of patentability, i.e.
                          novelty, inventive step and industrial application. As such, IN 816
                          was held to be a valid Markush patent.

<p id="p_206">                          19.6.1       Glenmark further contended that the SFB had no

                          recognized the fact that the SFB may have required combination with
                          other compounds for effective delivery. Industrial applicability, noted
                          the Division Bench, was to be decided on the active ingredient, i.e. the
                          SFB instead of any particular salt. The suit patent contemplated that
                          the active ingredient, i.e. the SFB, which imparted therapeutic effect,
                          would be combined with a carrier in some form. The essential focus of
                          IN 816 was, therefore, industrial application of the main therapeutic
                          ingredient, namely, the SFB. It was admitted, in the complete
                          specifications of IN 816, that the SFB would be combined with some
                          carrier, which had no therapeutic value.

                          Sitagliptin undoubtedly had therapeutic effect. Even so, Glenmark
                          contended that Sitagliptin simplicitor could not be administered and
                          did not, therefore, have any industrial application on its own.

                          some industrial carrier for administration. This carrier, however, was

                          knowledge, (iii) speculative use was insufficient and (iv) the complete
                          specifications of the patent, coupled with common general knowledge,
                          were required to be sufficient to enable a person skilled in art to
                          reproduce/exploit the invention without undue burden and without
                          having to carry out a research program.

<p id="p_211">                          19.6.5       In as much as Sitagliptin had definite therapeutic effect
                          on humans, the Division Bench held that it had practical industrial
                          application. However, to administer Sitagliptin, a carrier was
                          necessary. The carrier was, therefore, only required for commercial
                          exploitation of Sitagliptin, and was, otherwise, an inert entity, with no
                          separate therapeutic value or effect. The necessity of coupling with the
                          carrier, in order to commercially exploit the SFB (which was the
                          entity having therapeutic value) was, therefore, irrelevant to the
                          patentability of the SFB, unless it was sought to be contended that the
                          SFB was incapable of being coupled with any carrier. That, however,
                          was not Glenmark&#x27;s contention.

                           19.6.6       Generally, in pharmaceutical compounds, held the
                          Division Bench, industrial applicability would exist if (i) the function
                          of the entity was disclosed and (ii) the function disclosed that the
                          entity was useful in the medical industry.
</p>
<p id="p_213">                          19.6.7       Viewed thus, the Court held that the claim in IN 816 was
                          not in the mere nature of a pre-emptive claim but that it had definite
                          therapeutic value and was a novel invention unknown prior thereto as
                          a mode for inhibiting the DPP-IV enzyme. The contention of
                          Glenmark that Sitagliptin/the SFB did not possess industrial
                          application was, therefore, rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_214">                          19.7 Prior disclosure: The Court thereafter proceeded to the aspect
                          of whether Sitagliptin was disclosed in the prior art EP 622. This
                          aspect, however, it was found, did not arise for consideration as EP
                          622 was not a prior art for the suit patent IN 816, as it was published
                          after the priority date of IN 816, even though the priority date of EP
                          622 was prior to the priority date of IN 816.

<p id="p_216">                          19.8.1       Lastly, the Division Bench examined the challenge led by
                          Glenmark on the ground of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_140">Section 8</a>. Glenmark argued that, as Merck

                          same entity, it had violated <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_141">Section 8</a> and that, therefore, IN 816 was
                          vulnerable to invalidity under <a href="/doc/605275/" id="a_142">Section 64(1)(m)</a>.

                          mandatory dispensation and violation of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_144">Section 8</a> rendered a patent

                          foreign patents. Noting the fact that this was contrary to the view
                          expressed by an earlier Division Bench in <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_148">Roche v. Cipla-I17</a>, the
                          Division Bench in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_149">Merck v. Glenmark16</a> differed with the view
                          expressed in <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_150">Roche v. Cipla-I17</a>. However, it observed, the order in
                          <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_151">Roche v. Cipla-I17</a> was merely on an appeal against an interlocutory
                          order refusing injunction. The matter had been remanded to the
                          learned Single Judge, who thereafter passed a final order in which
                          <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_152">Section 8</a> was correctly interpreted by him as applying only to foreign
                          patents.
</p>

<p id="p_219">                          19.8.4       It was further observed that the use of the word &quot;may&quot; in
                          <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_153">Section 64</a> indicated that violation of <a href="/doc/605275/" id="a_154">Section 64(1)(m)</a> did not
                          automatically result in revocation of the patent, but that the power to
                          revoke the patent, conferred by <a href="/doc/605275/" id="a_155">Section 64(1)(m)</a>, was discretionary in
                          nature.
</p>
<p id="p_220">                          19.8.5       In view of this position, the Division Bench opined that,
                          at the interlocutory stage, it was normally not advisable to reject a

                           Bench held that no case for sustaining, at the interlocutory stage, the
                          objection of Glenmark, predicated on <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_157">Section 8</a> read with <a href="/doc/605275/" id="a_158">Section
                          64(1)(m)</a>, was made out.
</p>

<p id="p_221">                          19.9          Glenmark further sought to contend that its process of
                          manufacture was different. This argument was held by the Court to be
                          unconvincing. The Court observed that production of Sitagliptin
                          Phosphate would necessarily precede production of SPM and that,
                          therefore, production of SPM would itself amount to infringement of
                          the suit patent.
</p>

<p id="p_222">                          19.10         The Court also held that the denial to Merck of its patent
                          application for Sitagliptin Phosphate by the Indian Patent Office was
                          irrelevant and that this fact could not be a basis for denying the
                          inventive steps inherent in the SFB, on the basis of which the suit
                          patent had been granted to Sitagliptin.
</p>
<p id="p_223">                          19.11         Following these findings, the Court observed that as
                          Glenmark was using the SFB as the active component in its chemical
                          formulation SPM, prima facie, a case of infringement was made out.

                          had revealed that polymorph B was more thermodynamic and,

                          laid down the threshold test for patent eligibility. It postulated that,

                          by applying <a href="/doc/1348840/" id="a_171">Section 2(1)(j)</a> and (ja). It was not as though, therefore,
                          by escaping <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_172">Section 3(d)</a>, the product became, ipso facto, entitled to a

                               will insist on the filing of a divisional application.

                               certain ambiguous terms used in the claims. Although this is
                               not technically done in India but functionally most Judges
                               will resort to a similar exercise in trying to understand the

<p id="p_248">                               (xv) The parts of the claim include its preamble, transition

                               which means that if the claim contains three elements &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;
                               and &#x27;C&#x27; it would still be an infringement for someone to add a
                               fourth element &#x27;D&#x27;.
</p>
<p id="p_250">                               Further some terms are close ended such as &#x27;consisting of&#x27;,
                               i.e. in a claim of three elements, &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; a defendant
                               would infringe if he has all three elements. In case the
                               defendant adds a fourth element &#x27;D&#x27; he would escape

                               dates. This only means that if a patent application with certain
                               priority date and claims was followed by another application
                               with different claims and different priority dates, then if they
                               were consolidated or cognate with another application, each
                               claim would retain the original priority date [<a href="/doc/1200013/" id="a_180">Section 11(1)</a>].&quot;

<p id="p_253">                          23.7 Examination of any infringement action would, it was held
                          relying on Herbert Markman v. Westview37, require the Court, in the
                          first instance, to determine the meaning and scope of the claims in the
                          suit patent, applying the above principles of claim construction and, in
                          the second, to compare the claim, thus deconstructed, with the
                          allegedly infringing product or device. The Division Bench was at
                          pains to observe that examination of an infringement claim involved a
                          comparison of the product of the defendant with the claim of the
                          plaintiff.         What was required, therefore, was a product-to-patent
                          comparison, and not a product-to-product comparison. In fact, the
                          Division Bench held that one of the errors in the judgement of the
                          learned Single Judge was that it proceeded on a product-to-product
                          comparison, instead of a product-to-patent comparison.

                          polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride itself indicated that
                          polymorph B was a separate invention, not disclosed, enabled or
                          claimed in IN 774. Roche was not, therefore, it was urged, entitled to
                          contend that the manufacture and marketing, by Cipla, of polymorph
                          B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride infringed the suit patent IN 774.

                           23.9 The Division Bench rejected this contention. Rather, it was
                          held that the rejection, by the Patent Office, of the application, of
                          Roche, for grant of patent in respect of polymorph B of Erlotinib
                          Hydrochloride was based on <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_182">Section 3(d)</a>, which itself indicated that
                          polymorph B was merely a new form of Erlotinib Hydrochloride,
                          without sufficient matter to identify it as a &quot;new product&quot;, i.e. without
                          any substantial added efficacy. Any manufacture, by a third party, of
                          polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride would, therefore, it was held,

<p id="p_256">                          23.10 Cipla further sought to contest the validity of the suit patent IN
                          774 as being bereft of commercial utility. Cipla contended that it was
                          the polymorph B of the entity patented by IN 774 (which Cipla was
                          marketing) which, alone, was capable of commercial exploitation and,
                          consequently, deserving of a patent. This argument was found, by the
                          Division Bench, to essentially ignore the concept of breakthrough
                          inventions. The Division Bench held that breakthrough inventions,
                          though not commercially viable at the time of their conceptualisation
                          or invention, were nonetheless useful and industrially applicable.
                          Such breakthrough inventions, it was observed, provided the stepping
                          stone for further improvement. The Division Bench emphasised the
                          distinction between commercial utility and patentable utility.
                          Commercial utility, it was held, relying on <a href="/doc/198896019/" id="a_183">American Cynamid Co. v.

                          establish that the later commercially successful invention owed
                          nothing to the original patent. The mere fact that the original patented
                          invention had to be subjected to subsequent improvements, which
                          might have even rendered obsolete, did not, in any manner, detract
                          from the patentability of the original invention. &quot;Non-utility&quot;, it was
                          held, implied that, even if the original invention was worked as
                          suggested by its specifications, it would not yield the result that it
                          promised. If it did, its utility was established. Even misstatements
                          as to the purposes for which the results obtained by working the patent
                          could be employed, it was held, would not invalidate the original
                          patent.

<p id="p_257">                          23.11 Cipla also disputed the allegation of infringement by
                          contending that the product relatable to IN 774 was marketed as a
                          combination of polymorphs A and B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride,
                          whereas    Cipla&#x27;s   product    was    polymorph     B   of    Erlotinib
                          Hydrochloride. Rejecting this contention, the Division Bench agreed
                          with the submission, of learned Counsel for Roche, that infringement
                          was being claimed of Erlotinib Hydrochloride per se, which was
                          patented in IN 774, and not of any polymorph of Erlotinib
                          Hydrochloride. The Division Bench observed that polymorph B of
                          Erlotinib Hydrochloride could not be made without, in the first
                          instance, synthesising Erlotinib Hydrochloride.      The fact that the

                           defendant was marketing polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride,
                          therefore, it was held, indicated that the defendant was manufacturing
                          Erlotinib Hydrochloride in the first instance. This clearly infringed
                          the suit patent IN 774.
</p>
<p id="p_258">                          23.12 That apart, as Roche was asserting IN 774, which claimed
                          Erlotinib Hydrochloride, and Cipla&#x27;s product was the polymorphic
                          form of Erlotinib Hydrochloride which, even as per the Explanation to
                          <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_184">Section 3(d)</a>, was to be treated as the same substance, the Division
                          Bench found Cipla to have infringed the suit patent IN 774.
</p>
<p id="p_259">                          23.13 The Division Bench, thereafter, went on to comment on the
                          usefulness of X-ray diffraction in examining patent infringement
                          claims. In product patent infringement cases, it was held that X-ray
                          diffraction was of little utility, as what was required was to compare
                          the defendant&#x27;s product with the plaintiff&#x27;s patent, and the coverage of
                          the latter.   Had the suit patent claimed the polymorphic form of
                          Erlotinib Hydrochloride, X-ray diffraction, it was observed, might
                          have been of some use in estimating whether the polymorphic form
                          which was marketed by Cipla was infringing the polymorphic form of
                          Erlotinib Hydrochloride, in respect of which Roche held the patent, by
                          comparing the defendant&#x27;s product which the product disclosed in the
                          suit patent. Where, however, the suit patent disclosed and claimed
                          Erlotinib Hydrochloride per se, and infringement was alleged thereof,
                          X-ray-diffraction, it was found, was of little utility. By concentrating
                          on X-ray diffraction results, the Division Bench found that the learned
                          Single Judge had erred in failing to apply the correct test, which was

                          whether it would encompass the product of the defendant.
</p>

<p id="p_260">                          23.14 As Cipla&#x27;s product was a polymorphic form of Erlotinib
                          Hydrochloride, which was claimed in the suit patent IN 774, the
                          Division Bench held that Cipla had infringed the suit patent.
</p>
<p id="p_261">                          23.15 Thereafter, as already noted, the Division Bench went on to
                          examine the vulnerability of the suit patent IN 774 to revocation, on
                          the grounds urged by Cipla.
</p>
<p id="p_262">                          23.16 Cipla urged that the suit patent was invalid, as Roche had
                          violated <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_185">Section 8</a> of the Patents Act, by failing to disclose, in its
                          application (which resulted in the grant of IN 774) the fact that it had
                          applied for grant of patent in respect of polymorph B of Erlotinib
                          Hydrochloride, resulting in the grant of US 221.
</p>
<p id="p_263">                          23.17 Observing, in the first instance, that there was no specific
                          allegation, in this regard, in the pleadings of Cipla, the Division Bench
                          went on, nonetheless, to examine the challenge on merits. It was held
                          that the failure, of Roche, to disclose, in its application for grant of
                          patent for Erlotinib Hydrochloride, the fact that it had earlier applied
                          and been granted patent for polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride,
                          was not fatal, as, on that day, both Roche and Cipla were of the
                          opinion that polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride was a separate
                          invention, distinct from Erlotinib Hydrochloride per se. Being based

</p>
<p id="p_264">                          23.18 Cipla also pleaded that the suit patent IN 774 was invalid on the
                          ground of obviousness, under <a href="/doc/1987904/" id="a_186">Section 64(1)(f)</a> of the Patents Act, for
                          which purpose it relied on European Patent (EP) 226.                  Cipla
                          contended that Example 51 of EP 226 was the closest prior art cited in
                          the suit patent IN 774, and that any person skilled in the art would be
                          motivated to use the said example as a starting point. The Division
                          Bench found that there were differences in the molecular chemical
                          structure of Example 51 of EP 226 which, seen in the light of the
                          evidence that emerged during trial, defeated Cipla&#x27;s claim of
                          invalidity on the ground of obviousness. While the conclusion of the
                          Division Bench, on this point, is not of particular significance, as it is
                          specific to the facts of that case, certain observations of the Division
                          Bench, in arriving at that conclusion, are relevant.       The Division
                          Bench held that &quot;obviousness&quot; and the &quot;lack of inventiveness&quot;, as a
                          ground to plead invalidity under <a href="/doc/1987904/" id="a_187">Section 64(1)(f)</a>, had to be seen vis-à-
                          vis the facts which were publicly known or publicly used in India, or
                          published in India or elsewhere before the priority date of the suit
                          patent. The following passage, from the well-known decision of the

                                      was deemed to create a presumption of unpatentability
                                      however the Courts expressing dissatisfaction with the Rule
                                      opined that the properties were also material to show
                                      unpatentability of new chemical and must be considered.
                                      Thus prior art disclosure should not merely be structurally
                                      similar compound but also at least to some degree
                                      demonstrate the same desired property which is relied on for
                                      the patentability of the new compound. In other words &#x27;idea
                                      of new compounds is not separable from the properties that

                          and IN 625 were different, according to Astrazeneca, with IN 147
                          claiming a class of compounds of the Markush structure, whereas IN
                          625 had only one specific claim for the DAPA molecule. DAPA was,

</p><p id="p_283">                          147. As IN 147 was published, under <a href="/doc/77399428/" id="a_191">Section 11A</a> of the Patents Act
                          only on 18th March, 2005, after the priority date of IN 625, it was
                          pleaded that there was no question of a person ordinarily skilled in the
                          art arriving at DAPA from a reading of IN 147.            DAPA, it was
                          submitted, was not obvious from IN 147, as IN 147 was a Markush
                          structure covering a million possibilities. Any successful attempt at
                          reaching DAPA from IN 147, submitted Astrazeneca, could only be
                          by recourse to hindsight. There was no indicator or teaching in IN
                          147, which could enable a person skilled in the art to arrive at DAPA.
                          It was also pleaded that IN 625 was an old and established patent, in
                          the 18th year of its life and, therefore, was presumed to be valid.

<p id="p_284">                          25.   As against this, the respondents relied on the pleading, by
                          Astrazeneca, that DAPA infringed IN 147 as well as IN 625, to
                          contend that Astrazeneca had, thereby, admitted complete coverage of
                          DAPA by IN 147. IN 147 having expired on 2nd October, 2020, it was
                          submitted that there could be no interlocutory injunction against
                          exploitation of DAPA. This, even by itself, it was submitted,
                          constituted a credible challenge to the validity of IN 625. Reliance

                           Form 27 in relation to IN 147, which furnished the working of DAPA;
                          this, too, it was submitted by the respondents, amounted to an
                          acknowledgement, by Astrazeneca, that DAPA was part of IN 147.
                          The respondents further submitted that IN 625 was vulnerable to
                          challenge on the ground of anticipation by prior publication, as IN 147
                          was published on 19th April, 2001, prior to the priority date of IN 625,
                          which was 20th May, 2002. The complete specifications filed by
                          Astrazeneca, before IN 147 was obtained, it was submitted, claimed
                          and particularly described DAPA. Reliance was placed on the
                          decision in Novartis9 to contend that there was no distinction between
                          coverage or disclosure; ergo, once Astrazeneca had admitted coverage
                          of DAPA by IN 147, and also alleged infringement, by the defendants,
                          of IN 147, DAPA was obviously known from IN 147, which rendered
                          IN 625 vulnerable to challenge. Further, it was submitted, the subject
                          matter of IN 625 did not contain any inventive step, vis-à-vis what
                          was published and publicly known from IN 147.             No technical
                          advancement or economic significance of IN 625, over IN 147, was
                          demonstrated. DAPA, therefore, it was submitted, was obvious to a
                          person skilled in the art from the disclosure in IN 147. Once it was
                          accepted that DAPA was one of the compounds covered by the
                          Markush claim in IN 147, it was submitted that Astrazeneca could not
                          plead protection of DAPA on the ground that it was particularly or
                          specifically claimed in IN 625. A selection of one or more, from
                          several compounds in a Markush structure, it was submitted, did not
                          constitute any inventive step. The susceptibility of IN 625 to
                          invalidation was also pleaded on the ground that Astrazeneca had not
                          informed the Indian Patent Office about the status of all its

</p>

<p id="p_285">                          26.   The Division Bench held that Astrazeneca had, by contending
                          that the defendants&#x27; patents infringed both IN 147 and IN 625, ipso
                          facto rendered itself ineligible for any interim injunction. It was
                          opined, by the Division Bench, that, by alleging the impugned patents
                          infringed IN 147, Astrazeneca impliedly acknowledged that DAPA
                          was subject matter of IN 147. This, even by itself, rendered IN 625
                          invalid, prima facie. Observing that one invention could be covered
                          by only one patent, the Division Bench held that the very allegation,
                          by Astrazeneca, that the defendants&#x27; patents infringed both IN 147
                          and IN 625, struck at the very root of its plea for interim relief.
                          Allowing repeated inventions for the same patent, observed the
                          Division Bench, would lead to evergreening of the prior art beyond its
                          expiry, rendering it inaccessible to the public; a consequence to be
                          sedulously avoided.
</p>
<p id="p_286">                          27.   Having so observed, the Division Bench went on, nonetheless,
                          to compare the fields of invention as claimed in IN 147 and IN 625,
                          and noted that they were identical, word for word. IN 625, therefore,
                          did not claim to have any technical advancement, or economic
                          significance, over that possessed by IN 147. Noting the fact that the
                          inventor of IN 147 and IN 625 was the same, the Division Bench held
                          that, by failing to cite any technological advancement or economic
                          significance of IN 625 over IN 147 in the plaint specification, the
                          inventor had himself rendered the validity of IN 625 open to trial. On
                          this aspect, the Division Bench forged new jurisprudence, by holding

                           that the test of obviousness of the infringed patent from the suit
                          patent, where the inventor was the same, would have to be on the
                          basis of the &quot;person in the know&quot;, rather than the &quot;person ordinarily
                          skilled in the art&quot;. This aspect of the decision, however, is not
                          particularly relevant to the case at hand, as the inventors of IN 176
                          and IN 161 are different.
</p>
<p id="p_287">                          28.       Even while holding that one invention was entitled only to one
                          patent, the Division Bench relied on Section 10(5) of the Patents Act47
                          to observe that one patent could cover many inventions, provided they
                          involved a single inventive step. In such a case, the holder of the
                          patent could sue anyone for infringement, who, by making a slight
                          change in the inventive step, claimed his product to be different. It
                          was clarified, however, that a patent could not be granted for a stage
                          in the inventive process which did not result in a product capable of
                          industrial application.

<p id="p_288">                          29.       Having claimed infringement of both IN 147 and IN 625, the
                          Division Bench held that Astrazeneca could not, at least at the prima
                          facie stage, be granted interlocutory injunction.

                          33.1 Mr. Sai Deepak has questioned the patentability of EO on the
                          ground that the entire therapeutic efficacy of EO is contained in the
                          Eltrombopag free acid, in respect of which IN 176 already stands
                          granted. EO is, according to Mr. Sai Deepak, merely a &quot;new form of a
                          known substance&quot; and is not patentable, by virtue of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_231">Section 3(d)</a>, for
                          want of any enhanced therapeutic efficacy of EO over the
                          Eltrombopag free acid. Mr. Hemant Singh has, on the other hand,
                          contended that, by conjunction with the olamine radical, the
                          bioavailability of Eltrombopag to the body is increased manifold. In
                          this context, Mr. Hemant Singh has relied on the tabular statements
                          already extracted in para 9.11 (supra).
</p>

<p id="p_356">                          33.2 That increased bioavailability can be an indicator of increased
                          therapeutic efficacy stands acknowledged even in Novartis9, the only
                          requirement being that it would be for the holder of the patent, seeking
                          to assert its validity, to establish that the increased bioavailability
                          results in increased therapeutic efficacy. In Novartis9, the Supreme
                          Court held that no research data in that regard was forthcoming. It
                          cannot be forgotten that these observations in Novartis9 were in the
                          context of a challenge to the rejection, by the patent office, by
                          Novartis9 for registration of the patent for its product. In the present
                          case, EO stands already patented vide IN 161. Merck v. Glenmark16

                           recognizes that a patent is granted only after a thorough study of the
                          patentability of the product concerned and that, therefore, the Courts
                          must be slow, at the interim stage, in holding patents to be invalid.
                          The onus would be heavily on the defendant to, therefore, establish
                          vulnerability of the suit patent to revocation on the ground of
                          invalidity.

<p id="p_357">                          33.3 The challenge in this regard must be credible. Credibility
                          indicates that, on the face of the challenge, it must merit favourable
                          consideration. A credible challenge occupies a higher pedestal than a
                          challenge, which is merely worthy of consideration.
</p>

<p id="p_358">                          33.4 The tabular and other data provided by Mr. Hemant Singh,
                          extracted in para 10.11 supra and which forms part of the record,
                          indicates that, when combined with olamine, there is a much higher
                          yield of Eltrombopag, insofar as bioavailability is concerned.       In
                          support of the plea of enhanced therapeutic efficacy, Mr Hemant
                          Singh has, further, pointed out that the maximum plasma
                          concentration of EO was thrice the plasma concentration of the
                          Eltrombopag free acid, which, too, enhanced the therapeutic efficacy
                          of EO vis-a-vis the Eltrombopag free acid. These facts are not denied
                          by the defendant. This, therefore, is not a case, like Novartis9, in
                          which the plaintiff has not provided any research data in support of its
                          case. Besides, the Supreme Court, in Novartis9, was examining the
                          applicability of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_232">Section 3(d)</a> from the standpoint of a challenge to
                          rejection of an application for grant of a patent, whereas, here, the
                          issue is one of vulnerability of a granted patent to revocation, and the

<p id="p_359">                          33.5 In the present case, there is no admission, by Novartis, of the
                          therapeutic inhibitory properties of EO being present in the
                          Eltrombopag free base. In view thereof, the contention, of Novartis,
                          that the product patented in IN 161, by reason of its enhanced
                          solubility and bioavailability, possessed enhanced therapeutic efficacy
                          over the product already patented in IN 176 cannot, in my view, be
                          rejected based on Novartis9, on the premise that, in that decision, the
                          Supreme Court has held, in so many words, that enhanced solubility
                          and bioavailability can never be, by themselves, evidence of enhanced
                          therapeutic efficacy. In my view, they can, but the onus to so establish
                          would be on the person who so asserts.

<p id="p_360">                          33.6   I am not, therefore, inclined to hold, at a prima facie stage, that
                          a credible challenge to the validity of a suit patent IN 161 has been
                          made out on the ground of want of therapeutic efficacy, either by itself
                          or vis-a-vis the Eltrombopag free acid, so as to disentitle the plaintiff
                          to interim injunction.

                           to whom an application for grant of patent is marked. How this
                          provision can ever be of relevance while examining the vulnerability
                          of a patent to revocation, frankly, completely escapes me. <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_247">Section 13</a>,
                          on its face, neither deals with the requirements of a valid patents,

                          revoked. Where the considerations in <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_248">Section 13</a> are relevant for the
                          purpose of <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_249">Section 64</a>, the statute specifically so states, as in the case

<p id="p_365">                          34.4 I do not propose, therefore, to advert to <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_251">Section 13</a> at all, as, in
                          my view, it is irrelevant when examining the merits of a challenge to

                          are, in my view, of paramount significance. By using the expression
                          &quot;so far as&quot;, the Legislature has made it clear that <a href="/doc/175991/" id="a_255">Section 64(1)(a)</a>
                          would apply only where the extent to which an innovation is claimed
                          in the complete specification of the patent under challenge is the same
                          as the extent to which it is claimed in the prior art, on which the
                          challenger places reliance. The claim, whose validity is being
                          challenged, as it appears in the patent, must be identical to the claim in
                          the prior art, or of co-equal extent and amplitude.

                          anticipation by prior claiming, the claim in the suit patent must be

<p id="p_377">                          34.13 This throws up the issue of &quot;coverage versus disclosure&quot;, on
                          which I have already expressed my opinion, in detail, in the foregoing
                          paragraphs of this judgment. As I have observed, there is a difference
                          between the broad coverage of a claim, based on its wording, and the
                          coverage of the claim as would entitle it to patent protection under
                          <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_257">Section 48</a>. Patent protection under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_258">Section 48</a> would be available
                          only to the coverage of the claim, as it emerges from the claim
                          construction read with the enabling disclosure accompanying the
                          claim in the complete specifications. Viewed thus, though the broad
                          coverage of Claim 6 in IN 176 would also embrace EO, as a
                          pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Eltrombopag, it cannot be said that
                          EO is claimed in Claim 6 of IN 176, as the wording of the claim read
                          with the enabling disclosure contained in the complete specifications,
                          does not lead one to EO.

                           applications filed by the plaintiff or its predecessor, in respect of US
                          870 and EP 378, as well as the entry in the Orange Book, cannot, in
                          my view, constitute the basis for a credible challenge, as would render
                          the suit patent IN 161 vulnerable to revocation under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_260">Section 64</a> of the
                          Patents Act. CA 697 merely states that, in the reaction which proceeds
                          towards the final step to reach Examples 64 and 65 in that patent, &quot;a
                          salt of some form&quot; is inevitably formed. This is a completely vague
                          statement. In fact, the very same specification goes on to state, clearly,
                          that none of the final compounds in the PTE application
                          corresponding to US 870 specifically discloses a salt form. In so far as
                          the applications of Novartis, or its predecessor, for grant of PTE or
                          SPC, are concerned, Mr. Hemant Singh has pointed that the reference,
                          in the applications, to US 870 as &quot;reading on&quot; the approved drug
                          product would, at best, indicate that it covered the drug product, and
                          not that it disclosed or claimed it. In this context, he has also pointed
                          out that, in the US, a patentee could file PTE applications for more
                          than one patent covering the same drug product.
</p>

<p id="p_380">                          34.16 Given the difference between &quot;coverage&quot; and &quot;disclosure&quot;, and
                          the claim being dependent on enabling disclosure rather than
                          coverage, I am, prima facie, unable to hold that, merely because
                          Novartis, or its predecessor, while applying for PTE for US 870 or
                          SPC for EP 378, may have stated that the said patents &quot;read on&quot; to the
                          approved drug product, EO stood claimed or disclosed either in US
                          870 or in EP 378. At best, these are matters which would require
                          detailed examination during trial. They cannot be treated as evincing a
                          credible challenge regarding vulnerability of the suit patent IN 161.

                          the US Orange Book as well as the communication from the USFDA
                          to the USPTO.

                          circumstances, such applications and communications, relating to
                          patents for the drug in question, applied for or granted in foreign
                          jurisdictions, can be relevant for assessing the vulnerability of a patent
                          granted in India only to a limited extent, and no more. Else, the
                          challenger relying on such material would have to make a prima facie
                          case of synonymity, or at least considerable similarity, between patent
                          law as it obtains in this country and patent law as it obtains in the
                          concerned foreign jurisdictions. Absent such analogy, following the
                          principles enunciated in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_261">Merck v. Glenmark16</a>, it would be hazardous
                          for the court to refuse a prayer for interim injunction, even where
                          infringement is otherwise established, by relying on such material,
                          pertaining to applications for grant of PTE or SPC made in foreign
                          jurisdictions, or on communications between entities located in such

                          contain details of any product. As against this, the Form 27s filed
                          even in respect of IN 176 after IN 161 had been patented, reflected IN
                          176 as &quot;worked&quot; and contain the details of EO, which were identical
                          to the details provided in the corresponding yearly Form 27s filed in
                          respect of IN 161. Mr. Sai Deepak&#x27;s attempt is to convince the Court
                          that the identity of the declarations in the Form 27s filed by Novartis
                          after IN 161 had been patented indicates that EO was the patented
                          invention both for IN 176 and IN 161. This, according to him,
                          indicates that EO was claimed in IN 176 and that, therefore, IN 161 is
                          liable to revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming.

                          discussion hereinabove, this argument, prima facie, does not
                          commend acceptance. <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_263">Merck v. Glenmark16</a> has made it absolutely
                          clear that claim construction is to be based on the wording of the
                          claim read with its enabling disclosures as contained in the complete
                          specifications. Whether or not, a subsequent patent is vulnerable to
                          revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming would,
                          therefore, have to be examined by comparing the claims, construing
                          them by applying these principles. <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_264">In Merck v. Glenmark16</a>, however,
                          it is clarified that, in construing the claim in a patent, one is not to
                          refer to any declaration or representation made prior to the grant of
                          the patent or subsequent thereto. The representations made in the
                          yearly Form 27s, filed after the patent was granted, cannot, therefore,
                          be of significant value in construing the claim or examining the issues

                          claimed in the prior art. The fact that, in the Form 27s which may have
                          been filed in respect of the prior art, after the suit patent was granted,
                          the product emerging from the suit patent was cited, cannot lead to a

                          anticipation by prior claiming, there is no direct authority of either of
                          the Supreme Court or of any Division Bench of this Court. Learned
                          Single Judges of this Court have differed on the point, with one view94
                          being that the declarations in the Form 27s would not make a
                          difference, where the identity in the Form 27s for the prior art and the
                          suit patent was only after the suit patent had been granted, and
                          another95 being that the identity in the Form 27s indicated, prima
                          facie, that the product claimed in the prior art and in the suit patent
                          were the same. Both are prima facie opinions and are not, therefore,
                          binding. For myself, I am inclined to the former view.

                          dispute about the fact that EO is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of
                          Eltrombopag and is, to that extent, covered by Claim 6 of IN 176. If,
                          therefore, after IN 161 had been granted, and EO, which was covered
                          (though not disclosed) in Claim 6 in IN 176 was specifically patented,
                          Novartis reflected this position in the Form 27s filed by it in respect of
                          IN 176, that, in my view, cannot prima facie lead to a conclusion that
                          EO stood claimed in Claim 6 of IN 176. The declarations in Form 27
                          filed by Novartis in respect of IN 176, cannot, therefore, substantiate
                          the claim of anticipation by prior claiming, as raised by Mr. Hemant

<p id="p_387">                          34.24 <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_266">In Astrazeneca v. Intas20</a>, there is a finding, by the Division
                          Bench, that the assertion, of Astrazeneca, that the product of the
                          respondents in the appeals infringed both the genus (IN 147) as well
                          as the specie (IN 625) patents itself disentitled Astrazeneca to interim
                          injunction. Mr. Sai Deepak has sought to contend that, in the present
                          case, too, Novartis had alleged, in the plaint, that the defendants&#x27;
                          product had infringed both IN 176 as well as IN 161 and was,
                          therefore, ipso facto disentitled to interlocutory relief.     I am not
                          inclined to agree. While it is true that this observation does find place
                          in <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_267">Astrazeneca v. Intas20</a>, the Division Bench did not dismiss
                          Astrazeneca&#x27;s appeal on that sole ground.         Rather, it queried, of
                          Astrazeneca, as to whether it was continuing to assert both IN 147 and
                          IN 165. Para 43 of the report, in fact, expresses surprise at
                          Astrazeneca, despite this query, continuing to assert both the patents,
                          and goes to the extent of opining that the Bench expected Astrazeneca
                          to have given up the plea of infringement of the genus patent IN 147.

                           Astrazeneca having, however, not chosen to do so, the Division Bench
                          held that it had disentitled itself from any right to interlocutory relief.
                          The corollary, obviously, is that, had Astrazeneca agreed not to press
                          the genus patent, the Bench would have viewed the issue otherwise.
                          In the present case, though there is an averment, in para 11 of the
                          plaint, that the defendant had infringed both IN 176 as well as IN 161,
                          Mr. Hemant Singh has, during arguments, confined himself to
                          asserting IN 161. The written submissions filed by Mr. Hemant Singh
                          are also to the same effect. The lone reference in para 11 of the plaint
                          cannot, therefore, in my view, be treated as a basis for refusing interim
                          injunction to the plaintiff.     Significantly, the Division Bench in
                          <a href="/doc/5685001/" id="a_268">Astrazeneca v. Intas20</a>, too, did not content itself with proceeding on
                          the basis of the &quot;dual assertion&quot; by Astrazeneca, but went on to
                          examine, on merits, the aspect of infringement, as well as the plea of
                          vulnerability of IN 625 to invalidity.

                          patent IN 161, it is clear that the exercise undertaken by Mr. Sai
                          Deepak is one of hindsight analysis. The submission of Mr. Sai
                          Deepak does not indicate why, out of the several substitutions
                          suggested for each of the radicals in Claims 1 to 4 in IN 176, he picks
                          and chooses the substitutions which would lead him to Claim 1 in IN
</p><p id="p_390">                          161. Nor does Mr. Sai Deepak make out a case that the requisite
                          teaching, to select the said substitutions, is to be found in the prior art

                          the appropriate site, so as to achieve the purpose that the suit patent
                          achieves, are both required to be shown to exist in the prior art itself,
                          in order for a prima facie case of obviousness to be made out. The
                          submissions of Mr. Sai Deepak stop short of showing that any such
                          motivation exists. Nor, on a reading of the complete specifications of
                          the prior art, IN 176, is the court able to discern any such teaching as
                          would render it obvious, to a person skilled in the art and in
                          possession of the complete specifications of IN 176, that he is required
                          to effect the substitutions that Mr. Sai Deepak has sought to effect.

                          IN 176, from Claims 1 to 5 of IN 161, is, therefore, clearly one of

                           35.3 Claim 6 in IN 176, on the other hand, does actually claim
                          Eltrombopag and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Mr. Sai
                          Deepak&#x27;s pointed submission was that, as EO, is a pharmaceutically
                          acceptable salt of Eltrombopag, Claim 6 in IN 176 claims and
                          discloses EO. Mr. Hemant Singh contends, per contra, that there are
                          several pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Eltrombopag, and that
                          every pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Eltrombopag cannot be
                          treated as having been disclosed in Claim 6 in IN 176. He contends
                          that, in fact, EO as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Eltrombopag,
                          was unknown prior to the priority date of IN 161, and that, therefore,
                          it was a novel invention, at which the plaintiff arrived after
                          undertaking considerable research.

<p id="p_393">                          35.4 The inventors of IN 176 and IN 161 are different. The Court
                          does not, therefore, have the benefit of the view of the inventor as was
                          available to the Division Bench in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_271">Merck v. Glenmark16</a>.

                          who seeks to allege that EO was obvious from Claim 6 in IN 176, to
                          establish that the complete specifications in IN 176 contained the
                          requisite teaching as would enable a person skilled in the art to select
                          the olamine radical as the pharmaceutically acceptable radical to be
                          combined with Eltrombopag, to enable him to arrive at an effective
                          treatment for chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia, having the
                          advantages possessed by EO.

<p id="p_396">                          35.7 At a prima facie stage, I am hesitant to hold that such a case is
                          made out. Simply put, it does not appear to me, prima facie, that every
                          pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Eltrombopag, even if known prior
                          to the priority date of the suit patent, IN 161, is obvious from the
                          teachings in IN 176. This, in my view, would amount to stretching the
                          principle of obviousness beyond all known acceptable limits.
</p>

<p id="p_397">                          35.8 I am unable, therefore, to hold, prima facie, that the claim in the
                          suit patent, IN 161 is vulnerable to revocation on the ground of
                          obviousness, vis-à-vis Claim 6 in IN 176. In this context, the decision
                          in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_273">Merck v. Glenmark16</a>, provides guidance, as, in that case, too,
                          though, SPM was, admittedly, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of
                          the SFB, the Division Bench was hesitant to hold, at the prima facie
                          stage, that SPM was obvious from the teachings in the prior art. This,
                          even after having, in paras 38 to 39 of the report, held that, prima

                          from the SFB to SPM was actually contained in the prior art (IN 816).
                          The Division Bench noted the fact that, in IN 816, the SFB was

                          not choose to return a prima facie finding that the route, to arrive at
                          SPM, was actually charted out in IN 816, stating that this was

<p id="p_398">                          35.9 The same principle, in my view, would have to apply in the

                          Claim 1 in the suit patent, IN 161 was obvious from the teachings in
                          Claim 6 of IN 176. Unlike the position which obtained in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_275">Merck v.

                          reference to &quot;pharmaceutically acceptable salts&quot;, as would indicate, to
                          a person skilled in the art, that he would have to choose the olamine

                          animals. The product covered by the patent is, therefore, essentially
                          veterinary in nature. US 831, it is pointed out, advices against use of
                          the olamine salts in conjunction with the piroxicam radical, which
                          was subject matter of that patent, as piroxicam ethanolamine

<p id="p_403">                          35.14 The reliance by Mr. Sai Deepak, on these patents is, in my
                          view, fundamentally misplaced, as they do not deal with the olamine
                          radical in conjunction with Eltrombopag. Mr. Hemant Singh has
                          categorically asserted that EO, as a salt, was unknown prior to the
                          priority date of the suit patent IN 161. This assertion cannot be sought
                          to be traversed by merely pointing out that Olamine, as a base radical,
                          in conjunction with other free acid radicals was known to the industry,
                          especially where the salts do not even deal with pharmaceuticals, let
                          alone with treatment of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia. No case
                          of vulnerability of the suit patent IN 161 to revocation on the ground
                          of obviousness, by reference to these patents can, therefore, be said,
                          prima facie, to have been made out.

                          application filed by the plaintiff. The response notes that the reaction

                          and 85 of CA 697 involved reaction with trifluoroacetic acid. Mr. Sai

                          38.1 Before closing the discussion, I wish to enter a final
                          observation. There appears, prima facie, to me, to be a fundamental
                          misconception relating the concepts of a &quot;credible challenge&quot; and of
                          &quot;vulnerability&quot;. The submissions advanced by the defendant seem to
                          have been predicated on the premise that the slightest shadow of
                          doubt, which could be cast on the suit patent, was sufficient to
                          constitute a credible challenge, exposing its vulnerability to
                          revocation.     This proposition, according to me, is completely
                          misconceived.     Para    28 of the report in Bishwanath Prasad
                          Radheyshyam19 recognises the fact that, prior to grant of a patent,
                          especially for a pharmaceutical product, a thorough study is normally
                          undertaken by the Patent Office, regarding the validity of the patent as
                          sought. When an infringer seeks to defend infringement on the ground
                          that the patent that he infringes is invalid, the onus, to prove such
                          invalidity heavily lies on him. This standard has to be met, when
                          applying the principle of &quot;credibility&quot;. Repeated attempts were made
                          to convince me that any and every ground that the defendant sought to
                          raise, and for which a cast iron response from the plaintiff was not
                          immediately forthcoming, was sufficient to establish vulnerability of
                          the suit patent to revocation. Revocation is a drastic act, and a patent,
                          once granted, cannot be treated as easily vulnerable to revocation.
                          Even if, prima facie, a ground for revocation is made out, as is noted
                          in <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_295">Merck v. Glenmark16</a>, revocation is not automatic, but remains a
                          matter of discretion, for the patent authority. The grant of such
                          discretion is itself a pointer to the legislative intent that, before

                           revoking a patent, the authority is required to satisfy itself, that, all
                          considerations having been mould in mind, revocation is absolutely
                          necessary. Vulnerability to revocation has also to be judged on the
                          same standard. It is only when, judged on that standard, a credible
                          challenge to the validity of the patent as vulnerable to revocation is
                          made out, that an infringer can escape the consequences of
                          infringement. The standard is, therefore, high, rather than low.
</p>

<p id="p_417">                          38.2 This would especially be so in a situation, as in the present case,
                          the infringer never choose to challenge the suit patent either at pre-
                          grant or at post-grant stage, by filing oppositions. The defendants have
                          not, therefore, &quot;cleared the way&quot;, before exploiting the suit patent. Mr.
                          Sai Deepak sought to contend that, by deferring the release of their
                          Eltrombopag Olamine, till the expiry of the term of IN 176, the
                          defendants had sufficiently cleared the way. Mr. Hemant Singh has
                          disputed this contention, and I confess that I agree with him. IN 161
                          was granted as far back as on 27th March, 2009. It has remained in
                          force for 12 years. The defendants have neither chosen to launch any
                          pre-grant or post-grant, opposition to IN 161. Nor have they filed any
                          proceedings before the patent office or the IPAB, to cancel or suspend
                          the registration granted to IN 161. Rather, even while IN 161
                          continues to remain valid, the defendants have, without blinking an
                          eyelid, sought to exploit the subject matter of the said patent, i.e. EO.
                          That they have done so with the full awareness that EO is specifically
                          claimed in IN 161, is not disputed. Clearly, therefore, the defendants

                           exploiting the suit patent, IN 161, exposed themselves to an
                          interlocutory injunction.

<p id="p_418">                          38.3 It is only when they have been &quot;caught in the act&quot;, as it were,
                          that the infringer defendants, unable to dispute the charge of
                          infringement on facts, seek to question the validity of the suit patent.
                          While <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_296">Section 64</a>, undoubtedly, allow them to do so, the challenge has
                          to be credible, not incredible. The defendants, in the present case,
                          neither launched any pre-grant nor any post-grant, opposition to IN

                          from the register of patents. In such circumstances, the holder of the
                          suit patent would ordinarily be entitled to an injunction against
                          continued infringement. Absent any prima facie case of vulnerability
                          of the suit patent to revocation on the ground of invalidity, therefore,
                          injunction cannot be refused, once infringement is established.

                          IN 161 to revocation exists, on any of the grounds envisaged by
