<p id="p_11">2.     Plaintiffs‟ Case

2.1 Plaintiff No.1 is a Company incorporated under the laws of

the State of Ontario, Canada, and plaintiff No.2 is the wholly

owned subsidiary of plaintiff No.1.
</p>
<p id="p_12">2.2 Plaintiff No.1 is the owner of the patent bearing No.IN

240893 titled as "Asymmetrical Beams for Spectrum Efficiency",

which is subject matter of both these suits.       Plaintiff No.1 is

manufacturer of "Bi-Sector Array Antenna".

2.3 On 17th March, 2006, plaintiff No.1 filed an application for

grant of patent with the Canadian Patent Office.

2.4 On 19th March, 2007, plaintiff No.1 filed the PCT (Patent

Cooperation Treaty) application with the International Bureau of

World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

2.5 On 5th August, 2008, the plaintiffs submitted an application

for grant of patent before the Indian Patent Office.

2.6 On 9th June, 2010, the Indian Patent Office granted the

patent bearing No.IN 240893 to plaintiff No.1 for the invention

titled "Asymmetrical Beams for Spectrum Efficiency".

2.7 On 24th September, 2010, the plaintiffs instituted CS(OS)

No.1989/2010 and CS(OS) No.1993/2010 before this Court.

2.8 The plaintiffs‟ invention relates to wireless communication


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                        Page 4 of 78</span>
 systems, in particular, it relates to the improved use of available

spectrum using an antenna which enhances subscriber‟s capacity

by accepting all sites.            The plaintiffs have explained their

innovation in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the plaint, which are

reproduced hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "THE PATENTED INVENTION

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       9.    It is respectfully submitted that the invention
       protected by the patent of the Plaintiff No.1 does away
       with a significant number of limitations and
       disadvantages associated with all the above
       technologies. It is further submitted that the invention
       protected by the patent of the Plaintiff No.1 is its
       flagship product marketed under the name "Bi-Sector
       Array Antenna" and is technically referred to as a
       "split-sector antenna". The distinguishing feature of
       the Bi-Sector Array Antenna is that it emits an
       optimized asymmetric beam pattern, as opposed to
       the conventional symmetric beam pattern of the
       antennae in the prior art. The asymmetric beam
       pattern of the invention radically alters the
       conventional model of symmetric sectorization.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       xxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       10. Specifically, it is submitted that the inventive
       step of the Plaintiff No.1 is a technology by which a
       single sector, which was earlier covered by a single
       directional antenna emitting a single symmetric beam,
       is now split into a number of equivalent sub-sectors by
       an equal number of beams being emitted by a single
       "split-sector antenna", with atleast one of the sub-
       sectors so created being an asymmetric sector
       created by atleast one asymmetric beam emitted by
       the split-sector antenna. Therefore, the area covered
       by the beams emitted by the split-sector antenna is
       equivalent to the area formerly covered by the single
       symmetric beam emitted by the conventional
       directional antenna.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       xxx
       It is pertinent to submit here that although the beams
       in prior art were referred to as "symmetric beams",
       there was a negligible degree of asymmetry owing to
       manufacturing tolerances.        This asymmetry was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                           Page 5 of 78</span>
        viewed as a defect in the prior art. Further, there was
       no means of using the symmetric beam in the prior art
       in a controlled fashion to cater to a localized demand.
       However, on the contrary, the invention of the Plaintiff
       No.1 uses the very same asymmetry to its advantage.
       Critically, it is to be noted that the technology of the
       Plaintiff No.1 uses the very same asymmetry to its
       advantage.       Critically, it is to be noted that the
       technology of the plaintiff No.1 deliberately introduces
       a significant degree of asymmetry. The capability of
       the invention of the Plaintiff No.1 to control and
       modulate the degree of asymmetry sets it apart from
       the prior art. Therefore, all the above conclusively
       establish the novelty and non-obviousness of the
       invention of the Plaintiff No.1 thereby satisfying the
       cardinal prerequisites of patentability under the Act."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">2.9 There are two types of applications for grant of patent,

namely, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications and Non-

PCT applications.           In respect of PCT applications, the applicant

approaches the WIPO which conducts the search and gives an

opinion regarding novelty and inventive step by the applicant

whereas in Non-PCT applications, the applicant directly files the

application before the             Patent office.        In respect of PCT

applications,        the    Patent   office   is   not   required    to     do     a

search/investigation under <a href="/doc/638928/" id="a_2">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_3">13</a> of the Act and

they rely upon the results of the PCT examination as has been

done in the present case.             The plaintiffs have referred to the

clauses 5.10.4 and 5.10.6 of the Draft Manual of Patent Practice

and Procedure of Indian Patent Office, 2008.

2.10 The Patent Office examined the PCT application and raised

an objection that plaintiffs‟ application was not in conformity with

the PCT application whereupon the plaintiffs amended the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                                    Page 6 of 78</span>
 specifications to make it in conformity with the PCT application on

30th April, 2010.          The plaintiffs had originally made 28 claims

before the Patent Office but later on amended their application

and restricted them to 25 claims as made in PCT application.

2.11 PCT International Search and Preliminary Examination

Guidelines of World Intellectual Property Organization, Geneva

(Clause 3.03) are used in the member countries although the

same are not binding on the member states.
</p>
<p id="p_14">2.12 <a href="/doc/1259449/" id="a_4">Section 13(3)</a> of the Act provides that the amended

specification shall be examined and investigated in a like manner

as the original specification. However, the amended specification

need not be re-published in view of <a href="/doc/1261656/" id="a_5">Section 57(3)</a> which provides

for the publication of the amendment after the grant of patent.

2.13 The Plaintiffs‟ patent is prima facie valid - <a href="/doc/1558643/" id="a_6">Section 13(4)</a> of

the Act expressly denies presumptive validity to the grant of a

patent on account of search or examination undertaken by the

Examiner under <a href="/doc/638928/" id="a_7">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_8">13</a> of the Act. In other words,

the Act does not impute conclusiveness to the search or

examination undertaken by the Patent Office, and the results

thereof. <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_9">The Act</a> vests the Court with original powers to probe and

verify for itself, the validity of a patent on the anvils of novelty,

existence of an inventive step, and industrial applicability which

is limited to the grounds that can be invoked under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_10">Section 64</a>.

However, in forming an opinion on the establishment of a prima

facie case of validity, the Court‟s enquiry, in exercise of its


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                            Page 7 of 78</span>
 original powers, is limited to grounds which can be invoked to

assail the validity of the patent under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_11">Section 64</a> of the Act. The

plaintiffs‟ patent is prima facie valid in terms of the findings of

the International Searching Authority, International Preliminary

Report on Patentability and Written Opinion.

2.14 The Plaintiffs‟ patent is prima facie novel - Neither in the

Written Opinion (WO) nor in the International Preliminary Report

on Patentability (IPRP), has the International Searching Authority

(ISA) expressed any negative opinion on the novelty of the

patent. International Searching Authority (ISA) has not found any

document relevant to the Plaintiffs‟ patent from the point of view

of novelty.
</p>
<p id="p_15">2.15      Defendant         No.1   has   cited   6   patent   documents        -

WO/2006/004463, US 6127972, US 5907816, US 6480524, US

5686926, US 6608591, US 6094165 and 1 journal publication

(Osserian and Logothetis) to assail novelty. None of these

documents were considered as relevant prior art by the ISA.

2.16 The Plaintiffs‟ patent has a prima facie inventive step - The

inventive step of Plaintiff No.1‟s invention lies in its ability to split

a single sector/coverage area, which was earlier covered by a

single directional antenna emitting a single symmetric beam, into

a number of equivalent sub-sectors/sub-coverage areas using an

equal number of beams which are emitted by a single "split-

sector antenna", with at least one of the sub-sectors/sub-

coverage area so created being an asymmetric sector created by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                                Page 8 of 78</span>
 at least one asymmetric beam emitted by the split-sector

antenna. Critically, the inventive step of the invention lies in the

feature that the area covered by the beams emitted by Plaintiffs‟

"split-sector antenna" is equivalent to the area formerly covered

by the single symmetric beam emitted by the conventional

directional antenna.
</p>
<p id="p_16">2.17      Defendant        No.     1   has   relied   upon   WO/2006/004463

("Hagerman et al"), US 566655 ("Ishikawa et al"), US 6081233

and US 7038621, to allege lack of inventive step in the patent.

US 6081233 and US 7038261 have not been considered as

relevant prior art in the IPRP. However, both Hagerman and

Ishikawa have already been considered by the ISA in the WO and

IPRP as "D1" and "D2" respectively.
</p>
<p id="p_17">2.18 The patented invention was specifically held to overcome

Hagerman, which is reflected in the following finding in the IPRP:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">       "However, D1 fails to teach or suggest the further
       limitation of the total critical coverage area of the
       plurality of sub-sector coverage areas being
       equivalent to the critical coverage area of the atleast
       one sector antenna"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">2.19 Ishikawa was disregarded as relevant prior art in the IPRP.

Consequently, the patented invention was held to be inventive

with regard to the prior art in the IPRP as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "However, D1 fails to teach or suggest the further
       limitation of the total critical coverage area of the

 3.4.1          The plaintiffs acknowledge that asymmetric beams
               were previously known, but allege that novelty and
               inventiveness of the invention resides in the feature

               sector antennae is substantially equivalent to the
               coverage area of a sector antenna being replaced.

               of sub-sector coverage areas, wherein the total
               coverage area of the sub-sectors is substantially
               equivalent to the coverage area of the original sector.
               For a person of skill in the domain of wireless
               telecommunication technology seeking to replace a
               sector antenna with sub-sector              antennae having
               asymmetric beams, it would therefore have been an
               obvious and natural consequence to ensure that the
               total coverage area of the sub-sectors is substantially
               equivalent to the coverage area of the original sector.
3.4.8          The feature that total coverage area of the sub-sectors
               is substantially the same as coverage area of the
               original      sector,   is   not   merely   obvious,   but        is
               necessarily the only solution that the person of skill in
               the wireless telecommunication domain could have
               selected.
</p><p id="p_41">3.4.9          The entire objective of the invention claimed by the

               at replacing existing wireless antenna within a cellular
               network. In the case of antenna replacement, if the
               replacement sub-sector antenna has a smaller total
               coverage area than the original antenna, this would
               lead to gaps or holes in the coverage area, and a
               consequent loss of signal for users. Similarly, if the
               replacement sub-sector antenna provides a total
               coverage area that is larger than the original antenna,
               such larger coverage area would overlap adjoining
               sectors or cells, leading to increased interference
               between adjoining coverage areas and deterioration of

               minimize            network     interference     through     antenna
               replacement,              the   replacement       antenna       would

               asymmetric beam antennae have been known since
               1975. The plaintiffs have not demonstrated any
               novelty, let alone inventiveness in the asymmetric
               beam antenna. In other words, the plaintiffs have
               nothing more to add to the asymmetric beam antenna
               than was already known at the priority date of IN
               240893        i.e.     March     17,    2006.    This   conclusively
               establishes that the plaintiffs have done no more than
               pick up a conventional asymmetric beam antenna and
               thereafter used it in a fashion that an asymmetric
               beam antenna, by its very nature, is designed to be

               one or more asymmetric beam antenna, each antenna
               doing exactly as it is designed to do i.e. to throw an
               asymmetric            beam.    Each       antenna    throws             an
               asymmetric beam individually (independently) and

               varieties       with     an    asymmetric        antenna,       which
               presupposes           existence     and    continuance        of    an
               otherwise well-known network. The only contribution
               to the network is therefore providing asymmetric
               beam antennae. The plaintiffs in effect claim nothing

               previously unknown for the reason that asymmetry
               was viewed as a defect, as the very first search result
               on the Google Search Engine (www.google.com) for
               the     term        "asymmetric    beam   antenna"   links        to
               Thornton‟s          article   of 2004, which discusses       the
               desirability and advantages of asymmetric beam
               antenna. The obvious errors and lacunae in the expert
               testimony establish a complete lack of reliability. It is
               submitted that the expert testimony supplied by the
               plaintiffs may be disregarded entirely.
</p><p id="p_55">3.8.2          The expert has focussed his entire enquiry on whether
               defendant No.1‟s antennae emit asymmetric beams in
               a split-beam pattern, which in view of the prior art
               references identified hereinabove, was well known in
               the art prior to the plaintiffs‟ invention. The expert‟s
               inquiry is therefore misdirected and per se unreliable.
3.9 The plaintiffs are guilty of fraud, willful misrepresentation

and deliberate suppression of material facts in the plaint and

applications under Order XXXIX Rules 1 &amp; 2 in as much that they

have deliberately misled the Court into believing that novelty and

inventive step reside in asymmetry of their antennae.

4.1. There is no presumption of validity of a patent in a suit for

infringement and the plaintiffs are required to establish prima

facie validity of patent (<a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_29">Section 13</a> and <a href="/doc/691258/" id="a_30">107</a> of the Patents Act).

4.2 Defendant No.1 has raised a "credible challenge" to the

validity of the patent and, therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled

to an interim injunction. "Credible challenge" means that there is

a serious question to be tried in the suit with respect to the

validity of the patent. There are many serious questions to be

tried as to the validity of the plaintiffs‟ patent but ex facie the

following reflect the vulnerability of the patent in suit:-

               (hereinafter „Ishikawa 655‟) and opined that the
               alleged invention suffered from lack of inventive step.

               („USPTO‟) has also rejected the Plaintiffs‟ patent
               application for the same invention on grounds of lack

               conventional directional antenna."
               Alleged inventive concept apart from being obvious is
               also anticipated by each of the cited prior art including
               Osserian and Logothetis US 6,608,591, US 6,480,524,

               asymmetrical beams and would "therefore" have the

               symmetric beam thereby satisfying the last limitation
               of the independent claims. In case of dual asymmetric
               beams, all of the above prior art show that the

       During the course of hearing on 2nd February, 2011,

Patent Office has granted the patent to plaintiff No.1 without

following the mandatory procedure under <a href="/doc/638928/" id="a_58">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_59">13</a> of

the Patents Act, 1970, whereupon this Court requisitioned the

original record of the patent office, which was received on 17th

February, 2011. The original record has been retained in this

Court. The brief summary of the record of the Indian Patent Office

is as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_78">5.1 On 5th August, 2008, the plaintiffs submitted an application

for grant of patent before the Indian Patent office. The plaintiffs

made 28 claims in the application.             Along with the application,

the plaintiffs submitted the International Search Report issued by

World      Intellectual       Property   Organization   under   the   Patent

Corporation Treaty on 27th September, 2007. The plaintiffs also

attached the copy of the PCT application in which the plaintiffs

had made 25 claims. The plaintiffs also submitted Form 13 for

amending the claims.
</p>
<p id="p_79">5.2 On 10th September, 2008, the plaintiffs submitted an

application for expeditious examination of the application which

was allowed on 22nd September, 2008 and it was directed as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_80">               "May be considered for publication and

 5.3 On 26th September, 2008, the publication was carried out in

the Patent Office Journal. However, there was some mistake in

the said publication and, therefore, the plaintiffs submitted an

application dated 1st October, 2008 for re-publication on the

ground that figure „1‟ had been published instead of figure „2‟

whereas figure „1‟ was a „prior art‟ figure.                The plaintiffs

requested for re-publication of the whole abstract along with

figure „2‟.       This application was received in the office of the

Controller of Patents on 6th November, 2008. However, no order

appears to have been passed on this application.

5.4 On 21st November, 2008, the Examiner submitted the First

Examination Report to the Controller of Patents. On the basis of

this report, the Controller of Patents issued the First Examination

Report to the plaintiffs on 3rd December, 2008 in which the

following objections were raised:-

       1970 and other relevant provisions of law

6.1 The procedure for grant of patent in respect of an invention

is given in the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_67">Patents Act</a>, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as „the

Act‟) and the Patents Rules, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as „the

</p>
<p id="p_88">6.2 The object of Patent Law is to encourage scientific research,

new technology and industrial progress. The grant of exclusive

privilege to own, use or sell the method or the product patented

for a limited period, stimulates new inventions of commercial

utility. The price of the grant of the monopoly is the disclosure of

the invention at the Patent Office, which, after the expiry of the

fixed period of the monopoly passes into the public domain.

6.3 The fundamental principle of Patent Law is that a patent is

granted only for an invention which is new and useful. That is to

say, it must have novelty and utility. It is essential for the validity

of a patent that it must be the inventor‟s own discovery as

opposed to mere verification of what was already known before

the date of the patent.

<blockquote id="blockquote_55">       "From the authorities which have been cited to us, and
       from my own personal inquiries from sources
       competent to give me information, there is in patent
       cases a well recognised rule of practice in the courts
       which deal with patent cases as to interlocutory
       injunctions, and it is this : That where the patent
       which you are seeking to enforce is a recent
       patent, an interlocutory injunction is not
       granted where there is a genuine case to be
       decided. Parker, J. put it very shortly in Trautoer v.
       Patmore (1912) 29 RPC 60 : 'I cannot grant an
       interim injunction. It is very unusual if the
       patent has not been established.' It is put at
       greater length by the Court is the case of Jackson vs.
       Needle, which was decided just after the Patents,
       Designs and <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_113">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1883 where both
       Baggallay, L. J. and Cotton, L. J. state that, where it is
       a new patent, or a recent patent, the court is
       not in the habit of granting these injunctions
       until the title has been established. I take the
       principle that underlies that to be this, that the
       court leans against monopolies. Where you find
       a respectable and old established monopoly
       which has been in existence for years and not
       challenged, there is no reason for the court to
       lean too hardly against it, but when you find a
       recent monopoly which there has not yet been
       time to challenge sought to be enforced, the
       Court is inclined to take the view as a general
       rule, unless there are special circumstances to
       overcome it, that the title to the monopoly must
       be     established     before       it   interferes    by
       interlocutory injunction. It is not a universal rule
       : there may easily be facts which will lead the
       court in a particular case to depart from it, but
       as a general rule that is the practice of the
       court".

       adopted in respect of a person claiming an
       interlocutory injunction restraining the infringement of
       a patent is that the plaintiff has always to establish at
       any rate a prima facie case of having a right which has
       been infringed by the defendant, and according to our
       patent law, which in this respect I think differs from

        that of some other countries. The mere fact of the
       granting of a patent is not in self an indication
       that the plaintiff has established to the
       satisfaction of any authority that he has the
       right to the monopoly which he claims. In the
       case of a patent, Therefore, the mere fact that a
       patent has been granted does not show that
       those conditions have been performed which
       alone entitle a plaintiff to a conclusive right, and
       Therefore the courts, when they are approached by a
       plaintiff who says : 'I am the owner of a patent and the
       defendant has infringed if, say where the patent is of
       recent date : 'Your right is not established sufficiently
       by the mere fact that a patent has been granted to
       you'; and unless there is some kind of substantial case
       evidenced before the court that there is in fact a valid
       patent, then the court refuses to a grant an injunction.
       I think the same thing must apply in the case of a
       person who claims under a registered design."

       England that an interlocutory injunction will not

       adequate remedy should the claim succeed.
       Furthermore, I have always understood the rule to be
       that the court will not grant an interlocutory injunction
       unless satisfied that there is a real probability of the
       plaintiff succeeding on the trial of the suit. Where the
       design is of a recent date, as in this case, no
       injunction should be granted. More so, when
       there is a serious question as to the validity of
       the design to be tried in the suit and an
       application for cancellation has been made.
       Where a person is entered as a proprietor of a

       proof that the plaintiff is the proprietor of the design,
       but only a prima facie evidence that he is the

       case it appears to me that to grant an injunction
       will be to cut off for good the road to
       commercial success of a business competitor. In
       the event of the plaintiffs success damages will
       be an adequate remedy. And the defendants'
       financial position to pay damages has not been
       questioned before us. They are prepared to give an
       undertaking. The balance of convenience lies in favor
       of refusing the interlocutory relief that is sought. The
       granting or withholding of interlocutory relief would
       depend upon the ability of either party adequately to
       be compensated in monetary terms and ultimately on

<blockquote id="blockquote_63">       21. The principles are clear. The difficulty lies in their
       application. On the recent design in this case the
       plaintiffs cannot be granted an injunction when
       there is a serious question to be tried in the
       suit. If there is any real dispute on the questions
       as to infringement or validity of the registered
       design the court will, as a general rule, refuse
       an interim injunction. Damages will afford a
       sufficient remedy. The defendants are prepared to
       give an undertaking as to damages.

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">       22. I cannot accept the argument that the plaintiffs on
       the strength of the registration certificate have
       absolute right, a right which is good even against
       independent designers. "The Court is not in the
       habit of granting injunctions until the title has
       been established". "The Court leans against
       monopolies". The certificate does not establish
       a conclusive right. It has to be tried and tested
       in the laboratory of courts. We must not forget
       that the registered design of the plaintiffs is of
       a very recent date. In case of a recent monopoly
       which is seriously disputed on various grounds
       such as prior publication, lack of originality
       trade variation etc. it will not be proper to grant
       an injunction. There is a serious question to be
       argued as to whether the design is valid or not,
       and on the facts l am not satisfied that the
       balance of convenience requires an interim
       injunction,    particularly    in   view     of     the
       undertaking which the defendants are prepared

       person who happens to have got registered and that
       that person has an absolute statutory right until the
       registration is set aside. I do not agree. The reason is
       that it really does not matter much in this case
       whether the defendants' defenses are considered in
       the infringement suit or in the cancellation application.
       The defense and the cancellation application are both
       before the court now. Whether in one form or the
       other there is a serious dispute as to whether the

(40) PTC 125 (Del), the Division Bench of this Court was

considering an appeal filed by the plaintiff against the refusal of

injunction by the learned Single Judge. It was the case of the

plaintiff that it held a valid patent for the drug Tarceva, the

generic form of which was being manufactured and sold by the

Defendant Cipla. It was urged by the plaintiff that the holder of a

patent was entitled prima facie to the grant of an injunction since

such patent would have been granted after examination at

several levels including the oppositions thereto at the pre-grant

and post-grant stage. It was further urged that unless the

Defendant was able to discharge the heavy burden of showing

that it had a stronger prima facie case than the plaintiff, it should

not be permitted to defeat the right of the plaintiff to an

injunction against infringement by casually raising a challenge to

the validity of such patent. While negativing this plea it was

observed by S. Muralidhar, J. for the Division Bench as under:

       plaintiff has been able to show that it has a prima

       Since the plaintiffs hold a valid patent in respect of
       Erlotinib Hydrochloride (polymorphs A&amp;B), which was
       not shown by the defendant to have been obtained by
       fraud, the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of
       infringement and an injunction should automatically
       follow. It is submitted that that the patent granted to
       the plaintiffs in the instant case has undergone
       multiple level scrutiny and examination in terms of the
       procedures outlined under the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_121">Patents Act</a>, 1970 as

       It is submitted that the grant of a patent after

       first determining whether the plaintiff had a prima

       that there is no precedent indicated by the learned
       Single Judge for adopting this course. The judgment is
       criticized for using a multitude of phrases in deciding
       this issue. At one place the impugned judgment holds
       that the case of the defendant "is not implausible", at
       another place it is stated that defendant has "a
       credible or arguable challenge to the plaintiff's patent"
       and at another place that the defendant has not made
       "a palpably unfounded claim".

<blockquote id="blockquote_71">       51. It is contended on behalf of the defendant that
       under the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_131">Patents Act</a>, 1970, as contrasted with the
       Trade Marks 1999, there is no presumption of validity
       of a patent. This is evident from reading of <a href="/doc/1558643/" id="a_132">Section

       possible to raise multiple challenges to validity of
       patent at various stages. It could be at the pre-grant
       and post-grant stages before the Controller of Patents.
       Thereafter before the Appellate Board or in a suit for
       infringement the defendant could question the validity
       of a patent on the grounds set out in <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_135">Section 64</a>. The
       patent in the instant case was, therefore, vulnerable to
       challenge notwithstanding it surviving the challenge at
       the pre-grant stage. The object behind this was to
       ensure that known inventions are not granted patents
       and that the patent is used for the public benefit.

<blockquote id="blockquote_72">       52. The above submissions have been considered. It
       must be clarified that this Court has held already that
       the Plaintiffs have failed to make out a prima facie
       case. The above submissions of the plaintiffs are
       therefore being dealt with assuming, as the learned
       Single Judge did, that the Plaintiffs have made out a
       prima facie case. Given the scheme of <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_136">Patents Act</a> it
       appears to this Court that it does contemplate multiple
       challenges to the validity of a patent. Unlike <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_137">Section
       31</a> of the Trade Marks Act which raises a prima

        said product or using the patented process for
       using or offering for sell the product obtained
       directly by such process. It is also made subject
       to the other provisions of the Act. This is very
       different from the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_141">Trade Marks Act</a> as
       contained in <a href="/doc/554118/" id="a_142">Section 28</a> thereof. <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_143">Section 3(d)</a> itself
       raises several barriers to the grant of a patent
       particularly in the context of pharmaceutical products.
       It proceeds on the footing inventions are essentially
       for public benefit and that non-inventions should not
       pass off as inventions. The purpose of the legal
       regime in the area is to ensure that the
       inventions should benefit the public at large.
       The mere registration of the patent does not
       guarantee        its  resistance    to    subsequent
       challenges. The challenge can be in the form of
       a counter claim in a suit on the grounds set out
       in <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_144">Section 64</a>. Under <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_145">Sections 92</a> and <a href="/doc/1393639/" id="a_146">92</a> A the
       Central Government can step at any time by invoking
       the provision for compulsory licencing by way of
       notification. Therefore, the fact that there is a
       mechanism to control the monopoly of a patent holder
       (<a href="/doc/799603/" id="a_147">Section 84</a> and <a href="/doc/986301/" id="a_148">Section 92</a>) and to control prices (by
       means of the drug price control order) will not protect
       an invalid grant of patent.

       Vulnerability is the issue at the preliminary
       injunction stage, while validity is the issue at
       trial. The showing of a substantial question as

<blockquote id="blockquote_75">       55. The question before this Court is when can it be
       said that the defendant has raised a credible
       challenge to the validity of a patent held by the
       plaintiff in an infringement action? During the course
       of the argument it was suggested by counsel that the
       challenge had to be both strong and credible. Also,
       the defendant resisting the grant of injunction
       by challenging the validity of the patent is at
       this stage required to show that the patent is
       "vulnerable" and that the challenge raises a
       "serious substantial question" and a triable
       issue. Without indulging in an exercise in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                       Page 49 of 78</span>
        semantics, the Court when faced with a prayer
       for grant of injunction and a corresponding plea
       of the defendant challenging the validity of the
       patent itself, must enquire whether the
       defendant has raised a credible challenge. In
       other words, that would in the context of
       pharmaceutical products, invite scrutiny of the order
       granting patent in the light of <a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_155">Section 3(d)</a> and the
       grounds set out in <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_156">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act 1970.
       At this stage of course the Court is not expected
       to examine the challenge in any great detail and
       arrive at a definite finding on the question of
       validity. That will have to await the trial. At the
       present stage of considering the grant of an
       interim injunction, the defendant has to show
       that the patent that has been granted is
       vulnerable to challenge. Consequently, this Court
       rejects the contentions of the plaintiffs on this issue
       and affirms the impugned judgment of the learned
       Single Judge."

<blockquote id="blockquote_76">       Defendants challenge to validity of patent

       "65. In the view of this Court, a bare perusal of the
       order of the Patent Controller would indicate that
       neither of the above arguments has been considered,
       and in any event not in the detailed manner in which
       they have been advanced before this Court. It is
       perfectly possible that the Controller had no occasion
       to consider such argument as it was not raised before
       him. That is perhaps the very purpose of the
       legislature permitting a challenge by a defendant to
       the validity of a patent in answer to an infringement
       suit, even if such defendant had not earlier raised an
       opposition either at pre-grant or the post-grant stages.
       Therefore a patent which survives the pre-grant and
       post-grant challenges can still be made vulnerable on
       grounds different from the ones raised at those
       stages. The fact that the challenge is on grounds not
       urged at those stages, would lend credibility to the
       challenge. If the challenge is on the same grounds
       considered and rejected by the Controller of Patents,
       then of course, the burden on the defendant to
       demonstrate credibility of the challenge would be
       considerably higher degree."

       pouches for packaging purposes of the nature of the
       one used by the plaintiff and in respect of which
       patent has been granted was widely prevalent. The
       same is also an admitted position when the plaintiff
       has stated that the storage of liquid products other
       than liquid in a pouch does not constitute a novel idea.
       Some of the defendants have filed applications for
       revocation of the patent granted in favor of the
       plaintiff under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_168">section 64</a> of the Patents Act. There
       are cases where it is held that when an
       application is filed seeking for revocation of the
       patent and questioning the validity of the
       patent the court should not grant an injunction.
       It is settled law that in an action for
       infringement of a patent an injunction would not
       be granted where the validity of the patent
       itself has been questioned and a revocation
       petition has been filed. In this connection
       reference may be made to a decision of the
       Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/1302906/" id="a_169">V. Manicka Thevar v. M/s.
       Star Plough Works</a>, AIR 1965 Mad 327 at p.328,
       wherein it was held that if from the objections
       raised by the defendant it is clear that a serious
       controversy exists as to whether or not the
       invention involves any new inventive skill
       having regard to what was known or used prior
       to the date of the patent; courts would not
       grant an injunction restraining the defendant

        from pursuing his normal business activity. It
       was also held that an interim injunction would
       not be granted if the defendant disputes the
       validity of the grant. In M/s. Niky Tasha India
       Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M/s. Faridabad Gas Gadgets Pvt.
       Ltd. AIR 1985 Delhi 136 at p.140 (supra) it was
       observed by this court that no injunction should
       be granted when there is a serious question of
       the validity of the design to be tried in the suit
       and an application for cancellation has been
       made."

419 (Del.), the plaintiff sought an interim injunction for

restraining the defendant in respect of metallized packaging film

patent of the plaintiff. An ex-parte injunction was passed against

the defendant who filed an application for vacating the same.

The ex-parte stay order was vacated on the ground that no prima

facie case was made out. The patent was held to be a recent one

and post grant objections to the same were pending. S.K. Kaul, J.

held that it was not sufficient for the grant of an injunction that a

revocation application had to be looked into.          The relevant

restraining       the     defendants   from   dealing   with   safety     I.V.

catheters/cannulae on the ground that it infringed the plaintiffs‟

registered patent.           B.D. Ahmed, J. held that prima facie, there

was a serious challenge to the validity of a recent patent and,

therefore, the plaintiffs were not entitled to ad-interim injunction.

The relevant findings of this Court have been reproduced

hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_90">       "41. Having examined the arguments advanced by the
       counsel for the parties and the case law submitted by
       them, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are not
       entitled to an ad interim injunction as prayed for
       by them. It is clear that the registration of the
       patent per se does not entitle the plaintiffs to
       an injunction. The defendants' case is also to be
       examined and it is only after the entire case as a
       whole is considered that the Court can come to a
       decision as to whether the plaintiffs are entitled to an
       injunction or not. In the present case the patent is
       a recent one and, prima facie, there is a serious
       challenge to the validity of the patent. This has
       been amply demonstrated by the learned Counsel for
       the defendants in the course of his arguments noted

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                               Page 54 of 78</span>
        above. I have also noted that the revocation of a
       patent can be sought under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_172">Section 64</a> of the
       Patents Act, 1970 by a defendant in an
       infringement suit by way of a counter-claim. The
       defendants have already preferred such a counter-
       claim. Apart from this, under <a href="/doc/691258/" id="a_173">Section 107</a> of the said
       Act all the pleas available for revocation of a patent
       are also available as a defence in a suit for
       infringement. The question of validity of the
       plaintiffs' Patent No. 210062 is not free from
       doubt at this prima facie stage. There are more
       reasons than one for entertaining such doubts. One of
       the most important reasons is the existence of
       prior Article By way of illustration, I have already
       referred to U.S Patent No. 5,135,504. In fact, there are
       other such patents which were placed before this
       Court and find place in the documents filed by the
       defendants. Prima facie, the defendants have been
       able to show that, first of all, the field of I.V. catheters
       is a crowded one. Secondly, needle guards, in one
       form or the other, have been used for decades by
       several companies. Thirdly, the defendants' safety I.V.
       catheter/cannula is somewhat different from the
       plaintiffs' Patent No. 210062."

ground of prior art and a substantial, tenable and credible

that at the interlocutory stage, the Courts shall refrain from

       German Federal court rejected the claims
       closest to those of the Indian patent on the
       grounds of lack of novelty and inventive step.
       Incidentally, the German court while rejecting the
       claims of the patent of the present plaintiff relied upon
       the same prior arts which have been relied upon by
       the defendants in the present proceeding. Thus, as a
       matter of proprietary and also international comity
       which warrants that the judicial decision of the foreign
       tribunal/court may be respected in the same manner
       as that of the national court, this Court is not inclined

<blockquote id="blockquote_124"> 7.10 The well settled principles for grant of interim injunction in

patent matters laid down by the Courts in the aforesaid

judgments are summarized as under:-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_114">7.10.1         The registration of a patent per se does not entitle the

plaintiffs to an injunction. The certificate does not establish a

conclusive right.
</p>
<p id="p_115">7.10.2         There is no presumption of validity of a patent, which

is evident from the reading of <a href="/doc/1558643/" id="a_189">Section 13(4)</a> as well as <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_190">Sections

64</a> and <a href="/doc/691258/" id="a_191">107</a> of the Patents Act.
</p>
<p id="p_116">7.10.3         The claimed invention has to be tested and tried in the

laboratory of Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_117">7.10.4         The Courts lean against monopolies. The purpose of

the legal regime in the area is to ensure that the inventions

should benefit the public at large.
</p>
<p id="p_118">7.10.5         The plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction if the

defendant raises a credible challenge to the patent.            Credible

challenge means a serious question to be tried. The defendant

need not make out a case of actual invalidity. Vulnerability is the

issue at the preliminary injunction stage whereas the validity is

the issue at trial.         The showing of a substantial question as to

invalidity thus requires less proof than the clear and convincing

showing necessary to establish invalidity itself.

7.10.6         At this stage, the Court is not expected to examine the

challenge in detail and arrive at a definite finding on the question

of validity of the patent. That will have to await at the time of

 trial. However, the Court has to be satisfied that a substantial,

tenable and credible challenge has been made.

7.10.7         The plaintiff is not entitled to an injunction, if the

patent is recent, its validity has not been established and there is

a serious controversy about the validity of the patent.

</p><p id="p_119">8.     Findings

8.1 Applying the aforesaid principles to the facts of the present

case, this Court is of the prima facie opinion that the defendants

have raised a credible challenge to the validity of the patent.

The defendants have raised the following serious questions to be

tried in this suit:-
</p>
<p id="p_120">8.1.1        Whether the claimed invention is not patentable under
<a href="/doc/1845556/" id="a_192">Section 3(d)</a> of the Patents Act as it is a mere use of a known
process. The claimed invention does not teach any process by
which the beam patterns are obtained and therefore, the patent
is liable to be revoked under <a href="/doc/1719148/" id="a_193">Section 64(1)(d)</a> of the Act?

8.1.2      Whether the claimed invention is not patentable under
<a href="/doc/1077219/" id="a_194">Section 3(f)</a> of the Act because the claimed invention is a mere
arrangement of known devices and therefore, the patent is liable
to be revoked under <a href="/doc/1719148/" id="a_195">Section 64(1)(d)</a> of the Act?

8.1.3       Whether the plaintiffs‟ invention lacks novelty in view
of US 6,094,165 (Smith) and WO 2006004463 (Hagerman) and
therefore, the patent is liable to be revoked under <a href="/doc/518982/" id="a_196">Section
64(1)(e)</a> of the Act?
</p>
<p id="p_121">8.1.4      Whether the claimed invention lacks inventiveness in
view of the prior arts of US.6,094,165 and US.5,581,260 and
therefore, the patent is liable to be revoked under <a href="/doc/1719148/" id="a_197">Section
64(1)(d)</a>&amp;(f) of the Act?
</p>
<p id="p_122">8.1.5      Whether the plaintiffs‟ invention is obvious and of
natural consequence to a person of skill in the domain of wireless
telecommunication technology and therefore, the patent is liable
to be revoked under <a href="/doc/1987904/" id="a_198">Section 64(1)(f)</a> of the Act?

<p id="p_124">8.1.8        The International Search Report and the Written
Opinion of Anne Marie Scott have opined that the invention of the
plaintiffs suffer lack of inventive step due to disclosure of two
prior arts i.e. Hagerman and Ishikawa.

<p id="p_125">8.1.9      The United States Patent and Trademark Office have
issued a final rejection in respect of the plaintiffs‟ invention on
the ground of lack of novelty and inventive step with respect to
Hagerman and Ishikawa.

<p id="p_126">8.1.10      The European Patent Office have issued a non-final
rejection in respect of the plaintiffs‟ invention on the ground of
lack of novelty, inventive step, insufficient disclosure and
vagueness of claims with respect to prior arts, namely, Gilhousen
Klein S [US] et al and Nawal El-Fishawy et al.

8.2 Since the defendants have raised credible challenge to the

validity of the patent, the plaintiffs are not entitled to the interim

injunction in terms of the principles laid down in M/s Niky Tasha

India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), F. Hoffmann - LA Roche Limited


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                          Page 64 of 78</span>

examined the challenge in detail to arrive at a definite finding on

the question of validity of the patent which shall be examined at

the time of trial.            However, this Court is satisfied that the

challenge made by the defendants is substantial, tenable and

credible.
</p>
<p id="p_127">8.3 Vide order dated 2nd February, 2011, the original record of

the Patent Office was requisitioned by this Court.            The brief

summary of the said record is recorded in para 5 above. There is

a serious doubt about the validity of the patent which has to be

tested in the laboratory of this Court.               The prima facie

observations of this Court with respect to the record of the patent

office are as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_128">8.3.1          The original record of the Patent Office does not reveal

any investigation under <a href="/doc/638928/" id="a_200">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_201">13</a> of the Act to

ascertain the novelty and inventiveness of the claimed invention.

8.3.2          The Patent Office did not examine whether the

invention falls under any of the categories of non-patentable

inventions under <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_202">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/891560/" id="a_203">4</a> of the Act.

8.3.3          This Court is not impressed with the plaintiffs‟

contention that the Patent Office has conducted the investigation

but the report of the examiner has not been sent to this Court in

view of <a href="/doc/821592/" id="a_204">Section 144</a> of the Act. The result of the invention, if any,

 has neither been discussed in the original order sheet nor the

findings of the Patent Office are based on any such investigation.

8.3.4          There      is       no   valid   publication   of   the     plaintiffs‟

application under <a href="/doc/77399428/" id="a_205">Section 11A</a> of the Act as there was an error in

the first publication on 26th September, 2008 whereupon the

plaintiffs submitted an application dated 1st October, 2008 for

fresh publication but no order was passed on the said application

and no fresh publication was carried out.
</p>
<p id="p_129">8.3.5          The plaintiffs amended the application for patent on

4th May, 2010 which was allowed on 9th June, 2010. The amended

application was neither published under <a href="/doc/77399428/" id="a_206">Section 11A</a> of the Act

nor the mandatory examination and investigation was carried out

<p id="p_130">8.3.6          The patent was granted on 9th June, 2010 itself by a

non-speaking order. No finding has been recorded in the order

dated 9th June, 2010 (reproduced in para 5.12 above) to the effect

that the claimed invention is novel and innovative; had not been

anticipated by any previous publication or prior claim and that it

does not fall in the category of non-patentable inventions under

<a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_209">Section 3</a> and <a href="/doc/891560/" id="a_210">4</a> of the Act.

 8.3.8          The Patent Office has granted the patent to the

plaintiffs in undue haste without following the due process of law.

8.3.9          The plaintiffs‟ patent is a recent one. The patent was

granted on 9th June, 2010 and the suits were instituted on 22nd

September, 2010, i.e., within four months.

8.3.10         The plaintiffs‟ contention that the Patent Office is not

required to carry out the mandatory investigation and search

under <a href="/doc/638928/" id="a_213">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1985492/" id="a_214">13</a> of the Act in respect of the PCT

</blockquote>
<p id="p_134">8.3.12         The findings of the ISR and IPRP are not binding on the

Indian Patent Office, and cannot override the provisions of the Act

especially on issues of novelty and inventiveness. Reference to

<a href="/doc/882041/" id="a_221">Sections 13(1)</a> and (2) of the Act indicate that the duties set out

therein for the concerned Examiner are mandatory, in view of use

of the term "shall" in both provisions. It is therefore inconceivable

that the statutory duties of the concerned Examiner to conduct a

prior art search can be set aside or circumvented by reliance on

the findings of the ISR and IPRP. The Draft Manual of the Patent

Practice and Procedure of Indian Patent Office cannot and is not

intended to override statutory provisions.      The Preface to the

Draft Manual of the Patent Practice and Procedure of Indian

Patent Office is as under:

       hence do not have the force and effect of law.
       Statements made in the Manual are not in themselves
       an authority for any action by an officer of the Patent
       Office. While the Manual may be regarded as a
       handbook, it does not impose any particular line of
       action and may not be quoted to that end."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_135">8.3.13         The challenge to the patent made by the defendants is

not unfounded and rather it raises a serious credible challenge to

the patent and the same is discernible from the non-final

rejection of the European Patent Office and the final rejection of

the United States Patent and Trademark Office of the claims

findings of the Apex Court are reproduced hereunder:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_138">       "39. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that many
       unscrupulous parties take advantage of the fact that
       either the costs are not awarded or nominal costs are
       awarded on the unsuccessful party. Unfortunately, it
       has become a practice to direct parties to bear their
       own costs. In large number of cases, such an order is
       passed despite Section 35(2) of the Code. Such a
       practice also encourages filing of frivolous suits. It also
       leads to taking up of frivolous defences. Further
       wherever costs are awarded, ordinarily the same are
       not realistic and are nominal. When <a href="/doc/1683193/" id="a_224">Section 35(2)</a>
       provides for cost to follow the event, it is implicit that
       the costs have to be those which are reasonably
       incurred by a successful party except in those cases
       where the Court in its discretion may direct otherwise
       by recording reasons thereof. The costs have to be
       actual reasonable costs including the cost of the
       time spent by the successful party, the
       transportation and lodging, if any, or any other

        incidental cost besides the payment of the court
       fee, lawyer's fee, typing and other cost in
       relation to the litigation.   It is for the High

       necessary make requisite rules, regulations or

            difficult to control frivolous and uncalled for
            litigations. In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous
            litigation, the courts have to ensure that there is no
            incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation. It is a
            matter of common experience that court's otherwise

            courts, litigants and the advocates to follow the
            aforesaid steps, but once it is observed across the

            Respondents    had    to   actually  incur   in
            contesting the litigation before different

            the lawyers and other miscellaneous expenses
            which have to be incurred towards drafting and

            compelled to contest and defend the litigation
            in various courts. The Appellants in the instant

            four decades in a totally frivolous and dishonest

Court must adopt a pragmatic approach and in appropriate cases,

realistic    costs and compensation       be ordered in order to

discourage dishonest litigation. The relevant paragraphs of this

judgment are reproduced hereunder:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_157">            "191. In consonance with the principle of equity,
            justice and good conscience judges should ensure
            that the legal process is not abused by the litigants in
            any manner. The court should never permit a litigant
            to perpetuate illegality by abusing the legal process.
            It is the bounden duty of the court to ensure
            that dishonesty and any attempt to abuse the
            legal process must be effectively curbed and
            the court must ensure that there is no
            wrongful, unauthorized or unjust gain for
            anyone by the abuse of the process of the
            court. One way to curb this tendency is to
            impose realistic costs, which the Respondent
            or the Defendant has in fact incurred in order
            to defend himself in the legal proceedings. The
            courts would be fully justified even imposing punitive
            costs where legal process has been abused. No one

10.5 In the recent judgment dated 12th October, 2011 in

<a href="/doc/169578605/" id="a_227">Sanjeev Kumar Jain v. Raghubir Saran Charitable Trust,

Civil Appeal No</a>.8610/2011, the Supreme Court held that the

costs should be awarded to the successful party according to the

High Court Rules. The Supreme Court further held that the costs

must be realistic but realistic costs do not extend to actual or

luxurious costs. The Court suggested the amendment of High

Court Rules to provide for realistic costs. The relevant paragraphs

of this judgment are reproduced hereunder:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_160">            "9. Chapter 11 Part C of the Delhi High Court Rules
            („Rules‟ for short) deals with award of costs in civil
            suits. Chapter XXIII of the said Rules deals with
            taxation of costs. Rule 1 relates to appointment of
            Taxing Officer. Rule 6 provides that advocate's fee
            should be taxed on the basis of a certificate filed
            under Rule 2 Chapter 5 but not exceeding the scale
            prescribed in the schedule to Chapter XXIII.
            Therefore, the Court could not have awarded costs
            exceeding the scale that was prescribed in the
            schedule to the Rules. Doing so would be contrary to
            the Rules. If it was contrary to the Rules, it was also
            contrary to <a href="/doc/864236/" id="a_228">Section 35</a> also which makes it subject to
            the conditions and limitations as may be prescribed
            and the provisions of law for the time being in force.
            Therefore, we are of the view that merely by seeking
            a consent of the parties to award litigation expenses
            as costs, the High Court could not have adopted the
            procedure of awarding what it assumed to be the
            „actual costs‟ nor could it proceed to award a sum of
            Rs.45,28,000/- as costs in an appeal relating to an
            interim order in a civil suit. While we would like to
            encourage award of realistic costs, that should be in
            accordance with law. If the law does not permit
            award of actual costs, obviously courts cannot award


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">CS(OS) Nos.1989/2010 &amp; 1993/2010                           Page 75 of 78</span>
             actual costs. When this Court observed that it is in
            favour of award of actual realistic costs, it means
            that the relevant Rules should be amended to
            provide for actual realistic costs. As the law presently
            stands, there is no provision for award of „actual
            costs‟ and the award of costs will have to be within
            the limitation prescribed by <a href="/doc/864236/" id="a_229">section 35</a>."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_161">            "21. A serious fallout of not levying actual realistic
            costs should be noted. A litigant, who starts the
            litigation, after sometime, being unable to bear the
            delay and mounting costs, gives up and surrenders
            to the other side or agrees to settlement which is
            something akin to creditor who is not able to recover
            the debt, writing off the debt. This happens when the
            costs keep mounting and he realizes that even if he
            succeeds he will not get the actual costs. If this
            happens frequently, the citizens will lose confidence
            in the civil justice system. When a civil litigant is
            denied effective relief in Courts, he tries to take his
            grievances to „extra judicial‟ enforcers (that is goons,
            musclemen,        underworld)    for   enforcing     his
            claims/right thereby criminalising the civil society.
            This has serious repercussions on the institution of
            democracy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_162">            22. We therefore, suggest that the Rules be
            amended to provide for „actual realistic costs‟.
            The object is to streamline the award of costs
            and simplify the process of assessment, while
            making the cost „actual and realistic‟. While
            ascertainment of actuals in necessary in regard
            to expenditure incurred (as for example travel
            expenses of witnesses, cost of obtaining
            certified copies etc.) in so far as advocates‟ fee
            is concerned, the emphasis should be on
            „realistic‟ rather than „actual‟. The courts are
            not concerned with the number of lawyers
            engaged or the high rate of day fee paid to
            them. For the present, the Advocate fee should
            be a realistic normal single fee."

 10.6 Considering the nature of this case and more particularly

that the interim injunction has been declined to the plaintiffs

because the defendants have raised credible challenge to the

patent and this Court has not examined in detail the question of

validity of the patent which shall be examined at the stage of

trial, the order for payment of cost is deferred and, therefore,

further analysis of the aforesaid judgments is not necessary at

this stage. The unsuccessful party, at the end of the trial, shall

be liable to pay the cost to the successful party and the cost

incurred by the parties till now shall be considered at the stage of

final arguments. Considering the high cost of litigation incurred

by both the parties, this Court is concerned about the future cost

of litigation.      Both the parties are, therefore, directed to submit

their estimate of future cost before the commencement of trial so

that the parties shall have notice of actual cost that the other

side estimate would be incurring in the course of litigation and

the parties have an opportunity to take appropriate decision as to

manner in which to conduct the litigation. Greater transparency

about cost will promote access to justice. This process shall also

keep the cost in check and potentially eliminate the need for a

detailed assessment at the end as well as dispute as to the

amount of the actual cost. The parties shall maintain a record of

the Court time consumed by them and shall place the same on

record at the time of final arguments. The Court Master shall also
