<p id="p_1">        Appellant has filed this appeal against the judgment dated 8 th

August, 1996 delivered by the then 2nd Addl. Sessions Judge,

Jabalpur in Sessions Trial No. 636/95, convicting the appellant under

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_1">Section 304</a> Part-II IPC and sentencing him to undergo four years'

R.I.
</p>
<p id="p_2">2.      It is undisputed that appellant Pappu @ Satyendra was tried

with co-accused Ramesh and Shakuntala. Ramesh and Shakuntala

were tried for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_2">Section 201</a> IPC whereas

appellant was tried for offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">Section 302</a> IPC.

Co-accused Ramesh and Shakuntala were acquitted by the trial Court.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                    -2-</span>




Though appellant was acquitted under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a> IPC, but he was

convicted and sentenced under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_5">Section 304</a> Part-II of IPC for

committing homicidal death not amounting to murder of Lalji. It is

also an admitted fact that deceased Lalji was father of appellant.

</p><p id="p_3">3.       In brief, the prosecution case is that on 4.5.95 at 00.35 AM in

the night, M.L.Choudhary,Compounder of Victoria Hospital, Jabalpur

informed PS-Omti, Jabalpur that at 12 midnight, Lalji Yadav was

admitted in an injured condition and he succumbed to the injuries

within 30 minutes. On this Marg 12/95 was registered. At the time of

admission of injured in the Victoria Hospital it was informed that

Lalji got injuries by fall on stones as he was in heavy drunken

condition. Marg was inquired and inquest of dead body was done by

the police and postmortem was performed.          It was revealed that

appellant caused injuries by Katar (a knife) in the night between 9-10

PM on 3.5.95. Incised wounds were found in the postmortem

examination. Appellant was arrested along with other co-accused.

Appellant gave memorandum statement under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_6">Section 27</a> of Evidence

Act and got seizure of Katar (knife) from the house of his friend

Bablu at the instance of appellant. Dr. D.K.Sakalle (PW.6) was asked

vide letter (P.11) that whether injuries to deceased could have been

caused by such Katar and the doctor gave affirmative answer in

query.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.       After usual investigation, charge sheet was filed. The then

Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jabalpur registered Criminal Case

No.2415/95 and committed the case for trial on 5.10.95 to the Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  -3-</span>




of Sessions. Appellant was tried in the Sessions Court and ST No.

636/95 was registered. On 15.11.95, the then 2 nd Addl.Sessions Judge,

Jabalpur framed the charge under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> of IPC against appellant

Pappu @ Satyendra Yadav for causing murder of Lalji Yadav.

</p><p id="p_5">5.    Appellant abjured the guilt and contended that he has been

falsely implicated.
</p>
<p id="p_6">6.    To substantiate its case, prosecution examined Munnalal Yadav

(PW.1), Bablu @ Kamrudzama (PW.2), Noorjahan (PW.3), Ramu

Mourya (PW.4), Ishwardeo (PW.5), Dr.D.K.Sakalle (PW.6), Rajesh

Kumar (PW.7), Rameshdatt Choubey (PW.8), Dr.A.K.Sinha (PW.9),

Sohanlal Yadav (PW.10), H.L.Guru the then Station House Officer,

Omti (PW.11), Gopalsingh Parihar, Sub-Inspector of Police (PW.12)

and Rajendra Shukla Head Constable (PW.13).
</p>
<p id="p_7">7.    Learned trial Judge, after appreciating the evidence on record,

convicted and sentenced the appellant under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_8">Section 304</a> Part-II of

IPC instead of <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">Section 302</a> IPC for committing homicidal death not

amounting to murder of Lalji.
</p>
<p id="p_8">8.    This appeal has been filed on the ground that trial Court erred

in convicting the appellant under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_10">Section 304</a> Part-II IPC. The case

was based only on circumstantial evidence and appellant has been

convicted only on the uncertain evidence of memorandum under

<a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_11">Section 27</a> of Evidence Act and on recovery of Katar and on the

statement of Investigating Officer without due corroboration and

support from independent witnesses and scientific tests.

</p><p id="p_9">9.    As far as death is concerned, Gopal Singh Parihar (PW.12)

stated that on 4.5.95 at about 00.35 AM when he was posted as Sub-

Inspector of Police at PS-Omti, Jabalpur, Compunder of Victoria

Hospital, Jabalpur, namely, M.L.Choudhary telephonically informed

him that Lalji who was brought in injured condition in the hospital at

about 12 midnight, died at about 12.30 AM. So, the witness recorded

Marg 15/95 under <a href="/doc/411677/" id="a_12">Section 174</a> of Cr.P.C. vide Ex.P/25.

</p><p id="p_10">      H.L.Guru (PW.11), the then Station House Officer of PS-Omti,

Jabalpur stated that as Lalji Yadav S/o Rambharose Yadav, aged 50

years, R/o Chhoti Omti was informed to be dead, so he went to

Victoria Hospital and gave notice for inquest vide Ex.P/1 to the

witnesses and then he found that there was injury in his stomach. He

made the inquest and sent the dead body for postmortem.

</p><p id="p_11">      Dr.A.K.Sinha (PW.9) stated that when he was posted as

Assistant Surgeon at Victoria Hospital, Jabalpur, Lalji Yadav was

brought in injured condition. He found incised wound measuring 1

Inch x 1/4 Inch on his cavity depth in stomach, blood was oozing out.

He found condition of the injured very poor, blood pressure and heart

beat was not recordable. The injured died at 12.30 AM though the

witness tried his best to save life of injured.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Dr.D.K.Sakalle (PW.6) stated that on 4.5.95 when he was

posted as Lecturer in Medical College, Jabalpur, then a Constable

from PS-Omti, Jabalpur brought the dead body of Lalji Yadav for

postmortem. The witness found that there was stab wound slightly

oblique away from mid stomach measuring 2 cm. x 2.5 cm. in length
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                  -5-</span>




and 1 cm. in width. The injury was having clear cut margin and

intestine was visible. These injuries went inside through and through

and there was also cut on the vest of deceased Lalji. The injury was

ante mortam and it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to

cause death. Dr.D.K. Sakalle (PW.6) gave postmortem report vide

Ex.P/10-A.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      Ishwardeo (PW.5) , Constable, stated that he took the dead

body of Lalji to Medical College and he was given duty certificate

(Ex.P/10).
</p>
<p id="p_14">10.   As per above evidence, death of Lalji was found to be

homicidal and appellant has also not challenged the death of his

father. His defence was that deceased got injury by fall on stones as

he was in drunken condition and this has been informed at the

Victoria Hospital.
</p>
<p id="p_15">11.   Learned counsel for State, on the other hand, contended that

appellant has not proved that death was accidental. Looking to the

nature of injuries, it could not be said that death was due to accident

and deceased fell on stones due to heavy drink. Incised wound with

clear cut margin could not be found by falling on stones. Counsel

supported the judgment delivered by the trial Court.

</p><p id="p_16">12.   Munnalal Yadav (PW.1) examined by the prosecution was a

witness relating to inquest of dead body, that was formal. Bablu

(PW.2), Noorjahan (PW.3), Ramu Mourya (PW.4), Rajesh Kumar

(PW.7), Rameshdatt Choubey (PW.8) and Sohanlal Yadav (PW.10)

did not support the prosecution case.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                  -6-</span><p id="p_17">




</p><p id="p_18">13.   The only circumstance of memorandum and seizure of Katar

were considered to be proved by the trial Court.

</p><p id="p_19">14.   H.L.Guru (PW.11) Investigating Officer stated that on 9.5.95 he

took appellant Pappu @ Satyendra in his custody before the witnesses

and made enquiry from him and he informed before the witnesses that

he handed over the Katar to his friend Bablu for keeping it and he

revealed to discover it, on which memorandum (Ex.P/6) was prepared.

On the information given by appellant, Katar was recovered from

Bablu at House No.711 which was kept in a wooden box on which

some blood stained were visible. So, it was seized vide Ex.P/2 before

the witnesses. There were some spots of blood on the sleeves of shirt

of accused which was seized vide Ex.P/8. Appellant was arrested. The

witness sent Katar, clothes and vest of deceased to FSL, Sagar vide

Memo Ex.P/24.
</p>
<p id="p_20">15.   Bablu (PW.2) denied that accused Pappu handed over him

Katar and it was seized from his house. Noorjahan (PW.3) also

denied this fact of recovery of Katar from Bablu. Ramu Mourya

(PW.4) did not support the arrest vide Ex.P/5, memorandum (P/6) and

seizure of clothes from appellant Pappu. He only stated that he put his

signatures on the above documents under threat of police as his betel

shop was there in front of police station and he could not run his shop

against the will of police. Rajesh Kumar (PW.7) stated that he did not

know any of the accused. He only stated that from appellant one knife

(Katar) was seized vide Ex.P/7 on which he put his signatures. He

was declared hostile. Then he stated in his cross-examination by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                  -7-</span>




prosecution that appellant did not give any memorandum of statement

vide Ex.P/6, but he stated that one Katar was seized from the house of

Bablu at the instance of appellant. In cross-examination by the

defence, he took a somersault and stated that no seizure was ever

made before him. It      seems   that   learned   trial   Court   sought

corroboration of Investigating Officer by this witness who was

himself not reliable at all.
</p>
<p id="p_21">16.    Learned counsel for appellant submits that there is no clinching

evidence against the appellant. Dr.D.K.Sakalle (PW.6) stated that

there was no blood on the Katar and the scientific report of the

articles which were sent for scientific examination was never

produced by the prosecution, the accused was convicted on a very

feeble and shaky evidence. There is no direct evidence and the

prosecution case is wholly based on circumstantial evidence. It is

well settled in <a href="/doc/1210867/" id="a_13">Subhash Chand vs. State of Rajasthan</a> (2002) 1

SCC 702, <a href="/doc/1351933/" id="a_14">Dhananjoy Chatterjee vs. State of W.B</a>. (1994) 2 SCC

220 and <a href="/doc/1505859/" id="a_15">Sharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra</a>

(1984) 4 SCC 116 that in a case based on circumstantial evidence, the

circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn have

not only to be fully established, but also that all the circumstances so

established should be of a conclusive nature and consistent only with

the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Those circumstances should

not be capable of being explained by any other hypothesis except the

guilt of the accused and the chain of evidence must be so complete as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   -8-</span>




not to leave any reasonable ground for the belief consistent with the

innocence of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_22">17.   In the case in hands, there is no motive for the appellant to kill

his own father. The evidence of memorandum and seizure is very

much shaky and not corroborated by independent witnesses and

scientific report. There are so many lapses in the prosecution case.

</p><p id="p_23">18.   In view of aforesaid discussion, I find that learned trial Court

has wrongly held the appellant Pappu @ Satyendra guilty under

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_16">Section 304</a> Part-II of IPC. The appeal is allowed. The impugned

judgment of conviction and sentence referred to above is hereby set

aside. Appellant is acquitted of the charges. He be set at liberty, if

not required in any other case.
