<p id="p_1">1.     These two appeals have been preferred against the order/

judgment dated 08/12/09 passed by the Ld. Single Judge of this

court in I.A. No. 12825/09 and I.A. No. 13030/09 in CS (OS) No.

1876/2009 whereby the ad-interim ex-parte injunction, which was

earlier granted in the favour of Appellant, has been vacated.



</p><p id="p_2">2.     To narrate the genesis of the instant dispute, the facts are

succinctly reproduced as under:

<p id="p_3">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO (OS) 635/2009 &amp; FAO (OS) 636/2009                             Page 2 of 44</span>
</p><p id="p_4">      The appellant Pine Labs Pvt. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as

the "Pine Labs") is a software development company and also

provides related services of management of certain programmes.

The respondent no.1, Gemalto Terminals India Pvt. Ltd (hereinafter

referred to as the "Gemalto") (formerly Axalto Terminals India Pvt.

Ltd. and prior to that known as Schlumberger Measurement and

Systems India Ltd), is engaged in providing computer hardware

terminals for retail establishment.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.     Since the Gemalto does not do any software development

business, it has engaged the Pine Labs from time to time to

develop      certain     software       applications   and   backend    host

applications to service its various clients. In the year 2003

Gemalto was approached by the IOCL to develop a customized

fleet card system and in pursuance to this Gemalto issued a work

order dated 17.11.2003 to the Pine Labs. Under this work order

the appellant was required to develop software application for

IOCL fleet card system and provide complete gamut of services

related to operationalisation and maintenance this system. This

Work Order provided that 50% of the charges would be for host

license as agreed upon. After designing fundamental system

architecture and writing of various components of the software,

the initial trial version 1.00 was ready for trial by June 2004.

 Meanwhile, keeping in view the growth of business and deepening

relationship, a "Master Agreement for Development Services"

(MSA) dated 24.06.2004 was entered into between the Pine Labs

and the Gemalto containing certain terms, on which the Pine Labs

was to provide certain services to the Gemalto. Further terms were

to be set out in the Subsidiary Agreements which were to be

agreed between the parties from time to time for each new

project.

</p><p id="p_8">4.     After the execution of the MSA, the first complete version of

the software i.e. Version 1.03, which could be put to commercial

use, was provided to the Gemalto on 16th August 2004 along with

a written manual which set out the full system specifications and

details regarding the same. The Pine Labs continued further to

develop and write aforesaid software and accordingly updated

</blockquote><p id="p_10">5.     The relations between the Pine Labs and the Gemalto were

invigorating until the Gemalto made a bid for a card program of

HPCL invited by ICICI Ltd.(herein Respondent No.2). Vide e-mail

dated 26.06.2009, the Gemalto informed the Pine Labs that it has

been awarded the contract for HPCL Fleet Card Program and that

this program would be customizing and interacting with the

existing IOCL system, for which the software was developed by the

Pine Labs.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">6.     The Pine Labs vide e-mail dated 29th June, 2009 expressed its

willingness to the Gemalto to work on this project also. Though the

discussions in this regard were held however, no consensus could

ever be reached between them. Thereafter, the Pine Labs

discovered      that    the    Gemalto   had   sub-contracted   aforesaid

contract to the Respondent No.3 M/S QCI Technologies Pvt. Ltd. to

create and develop software for the HPCL-ICICI card program.

Since this program system was to be interacting with the existing

IOCL system, the Pine Labs apprehended that the source code of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO (OS) 635/2009 &amp; FAO (OS) 636/2009                           Page 5 of 44</span>
 the IOCL program would be handed over by the Gemalto to the

M/S QCI Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">7.     The prospect of distribution of the source code of the

software developed by it to the third party was sufficient to raise

an alarming bell in the ears of the Pine Labs and immediately it

claimed ownership of the software developed for IOCL Card Fleet

Program. The genesis of this claim was founded upon the reason

that due to operation of section 19 (5) and (6) of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_1">Copyright Act</a>

the assignment of copyright in respect of Original Version 1.03 was

only for 5 years and that too within the territorial limits of India as

the terms regarding time period and territorial limit of the

assignment were nowhere provided in any of the agreements,

which deal with the subject matter in question, entered into

between the parties. These provisions of the copyright statute are

as under:

</p><p id="p_17">       As far as later versions are concerned, as per the Pine Labs,

they are mere primarily adaptations of Original Version 1.03

wherein either a few new features were added or performance

aspects of the original version were improved and this was

achieved by way of creating additional software code and

incorporating the same into the source code of the original

version. The assignment in respect of the later versions was

strictly restricted to the newly created additional source code and

it cannot be construed as re-assignment of copyright in the

original version 1.03.
</p>
<p id="p_18">


8      In an attempt to get a stamp of Judicial approval on its claim,

the Pine Labs filed a suit bearing No. 1867/2009 along with I.A. No.

12885/09 on the original side of this Court inter alia seeking reliefs

of declaration relating to expiry of the assignment under <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_2">section

19</a>; injunctions seeking restraint against infringement of its

copyright and mandatory injunction relating to enforcement of its

moral right under <a href="/doc/1710491/" id="a_3">section 57</a>. On the first date of hearing on

07.10.09, an ad-interim ex-parte injunction was granted to the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">FAO (OS) 635/2009 &amp; FAO (OS) 636/2009                          Page 7 of 44</span>
 appellant. However, subsequently, after hearing both the parties,

the learned Single Judge vide order dated 8.12.2009 has vacated

the aforesaid injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

9      The    Ld. Single       Judge analyzed the       matter   from two

perspectives. Firstly, from the point of view that, what is the

ownership status of the Pine Labs and secondly tha,t what is the

nature of assignment. On the first issue, the Ld. Judge came to the

conclusion that it is an admitted fact that the Pine Labs has taken

the   status of       independent       contractor   and this makes the

agreement to develop the software in question a contract for

service. <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_4">Section 17</a> of the Copyright Act provides that in the case

of contract for employment, the ownership vests with the

employee unless there is an agreement or intention to contrary.

The Pine Labs had contended before the Learned Single Judge that

this intention is to be deduced from MSA which is an assignment

agreement. It was further contended that only the MSA should be

seen for inferring the real intention of the parties and not the prior

correspondences and agreements including the email dated 20th

February, 2004 wherein the Pine Labs has stated that "the work

has been created for a valuable consideration for and on behalf of

the Gemalto and the Pine Labs has been paid in full and the

copyright and other rights vest with the Gemalto and the Pine Labs


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">FAO (OS) 635/2009 &amp; FAO (OS) 636/2009                            Page 8 of 44</span>
 does not claim any right in the same". While referring to the

decision of Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/313353/" id="a_5">Zee Entertainment Enterprises

Ltd v. Mr. Gajendra Singh and Ors</a>, 2008(36) PTC53 (Bom), the Ld.

Single Judge observed that the documents and their relation, by

whatever       names      or    howsoever   these   are   stated   in   the

agreements, would not preclude the court from examining the real

intention of the parties for measuring the ownership of the work by

applying the intention test. The Ld. judge, for the purpose of

interim applications, has taken a prima facie view that doubt can

be expressed over the ownership of copyright as claimed by the

Pine Labs especially when an intention to contrary can be inferred

from the email dated 20th Feb 2004 and the admission of the Pine

Labs that the MSA is an assignment and that it has assigned the

rights including the copyright to the Gemalto by virtue of the MSA.



10     The second limb of the approach, which the Ld. Judge took,

was to analyze the nature of assignment. After referring to various

authorities on Copyright, a prima facie conclusion is arrived that

MSA is, in fact, an "agreement to assign" or "assignment in

equity". It has been observed that "the equitable assignment

exists in cases involving the agreement to assign future work and

equitable assignment generally flows from contractual relations

where work is commissioned. Applying the said principles to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO (OS) 635/2009 &amp; FAO (OS) 636/2009                          Page 9 of 44</span>
 present case, it can be said that a bare reading of clause 7 of the

agreement demarcates the two interests, the beneficial interest

and the equitable interest." Ld. Single Judge came to the

conclusion that the intention of the parties, under MSA was to

create influence of equitable title in favour of Gemalto. Relevant

para is as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">               "72. The usage of the expression "beneficial
               owner" in context of the plaintiff makes the
               intention of the parties to enter into
               agreement       clear    and      unequivocal,
               demarcating the two interests. The intention
               further is clarified once the agreement
               provides for future obligations of the parties.
               It is a matter of fact that MSA was entered
               into in June, 2004 and future software was
               developed between June-August, 2004 and
               subsequently, at the time of agreement, the
               software was yet to be created. The intention
               is again reflected when the right to enforce is
               accorded to the defendant. It is also not
               disputed that the plaintiff was paid for the
               creation of the work. Rather, the plaintiff
               himself in his email acknowledged that the
               plaintiff has been paid with respect to the
               creation    of   the   work.    Under    these
               circumstances, one can say with the
               certainty that the present agreement or MSA
               is an agreement wherein intention of the
               parties, whether express or implied, is such
               so as to create inference of equitable title in
               favour of defendant no1."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO (OS) 635/2009 &amp; FAO (OS) 636/2009                        Page 10 of 44</span>
<p id="p_20"> 11      All this made the Ld. Judge came to the prima facie finding

that the MSA is an agreement to assign and that it creates an

equitable title in favour of the Gemalto. In order to decide the fate

of interim applications pertaining to the matter in hand, the Ld.

Judge relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/49480/" id="a_6">Dalpat

Kumar vs. Prahlad Singh</a>, AIR 1993 SC 276 which provides for a

threefold approach to be adopted by courts while dealing with

such cases. These are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        Whether the Plaintiff is able to prove a Prima Facie
         case in its favour?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">        In whose favour Balance of Convenience lies?
        Whether the denial of relief would result in
         Irreparable Injury to the plaintiff?
</blockquote>

<p id="p_21">12.    In view of the aforesaid judicial reasoning, the learned Single

Judge has taken the view that not only doubt can be expressed on

the claim of ownership by the Pine Labs even on prima facie front,

though the issue involved needs to be examined at trial, the MSA

appears to be an assignment in equity or an agreement to assign

rather than actual assignment agreement and this goes against

the Pine Labs. As far as balance of convenience is concerned, the

Ld. Single Judge found it to be tilted in favour of the Gemalto as

Ld. Single Judge is of the view that if interim protection is allowed

to continue at this stage, it would cause more inconvenience and

irreparable loss to the Gemalto rather than the Pine Labs. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO (OS) 635/2009 &amp; FAO (OS) 636/2009                      Page 11 of 44</span>
 Court also found support from that fact that the Pine Labs has

itself calculated the loss at Rs. 20,00,000/- which fades the

element of irreparability as far as losses to it is concerned.


</p><p id="p_22">13.    Consequently, the learned Single Judge vacated the interim

order on the condition that the Gemalto shall deposit a sum of Rs.

20,00,000/- with the registry of this court within two weeks.

Challenging this order, these two appears are preferred by the

Pine Labs.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
</p><p id="p_24">14.    When these appeals came up for hearing on 17th December,

2009, counsel for Gemalto as well as           the respondent no.2

appeared on caveat. After hearing the counsel for the parties, the

appeal was admitted and in the stay application filed by the Pine

Labs seeking stay of the operation of the orders of the learned

Single Judge, notice was issued for 24th February, 2010 and

operation of the impugned order dated 8th December, 2009 was

stayed on certain specific terms as contained in the said order.

Since this order passed in the said application broadly reflects the

arguments/ stand taken by parties, we deem it proper to

              assigns in presenti, software to be developed, in

              or territory of assignment is admittedly nowhere

              its variants in the IOCL program. The Pine Labs
              grievance was and is that the Gemalto have
              modified the version 1.03 for use in the HPCL
              programme which is a clear infringement of
              copyright and this infringement continues. If
              injunction were to be vacated now, Gemalto
              may adapt/modify this software for other
              programs or enter into arrangements which

<p id="p_35"> 21.      The submission of Mr. Tiku was that the language, i.e. the

use of the present tense in the word "assigns" clearly, and without

doubt conveys the meaning that assignment is                in presenti. No

further reference to anything else is required as the meaning is

clear on a plain reading of the clause. He referred to the decision

in the case of St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc. Vs.

held:-

</p><p id="p_39">        His submission was that in the present case, the MSA uses

language more akin to the language used in Speedplay and Filmtec

word "PineLabs as beneficial owner assigns...." Is used, which is a

clear assignment in the present. In any case, no further act of the

parties is needed to complete the assignment and neither has

Gemalto      pleaded       that    the   assignment   was   not   complete

automatically by operation of law on the day the works                  were

"...or the prospective owner of the copyright in a future work may

assign to any person the copyright".          Proviso to <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_16">Section 18</a> states

that assignment in respect of future works comes into effect when

the other hand, was to demonstrate that Clause 7 was not to be

read in the manner attempted by Mr. Tiku.             It was argued that on

the contrary, that clause 7.1              on which the Pine Labs          were

harping was to be read alongwith Clause 1 and 7.2 of the MSA. It

was submitted that as per Clause 1 of the MSA, "Project Materials"

means any and all works of authorship, products and materials

developed, written or prepared by Pine Labs in relation to the

Projects (whether alone or jointly with Axalto or any other

independent contractor of Axalto and on whatever media)

including, without         limitation, any and all computer programs,

data,    diagrams,      charts,     reports,   specifications,   studies   and

inventions and all drafts hereof and working papers in relation

 thereto.      It is thus submitted that      a complete reading of the

Clause 7 reaffirms that Clause 7.1 of MSA was an :Agreement to

Assign" and not an "Assignment Deed".            In   fact, the plain and

literal meaning of Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 clearly establishes that Pine

Labs had agreed to assign               to Gemalto    all copyright and

intellectual property rights in the works that Pine Labs was hired to

develop and no actual assignment thereof can be assumed from

the said clauses.        It was envisaged that Pine Labs shall entitle

Gemalto by doing all such things and sign all such documents or

instruments reasonably necessary to enable Gemalto to obtain,

defend and enforce its rights in the Project Materials, which means

that, while actual assignment was yet to take place, equitable

ownership was created by Pine Labs in favour of Gemalto under

the MSA.

</p><p id="p_46">25.    Mr. Sanjay Jain also pointed out that in paragraph 14 of the

Plaint filed in CS (OS) 1876/2009 (page nos. 102-123 of the appeal

paper book filed by the Pine Labs), Pine Labs admitted that under

Clause 7.1, the Pine Labs plaintiff had agreed to assign the

copyright in the software development developed by it              to the

Gemalto to Gemalto. Mr. Jain also argued that the statements of

the Pine Labs based on the judgment in St Clair Intellectual (supra)

was clearly misconceived and on reading of the relevant portion

 of the said judgment in entirety, it would be clear that the said

judgment goes in favour of the Gemalto.              To buttress this

submission, Mr. Jain drew our attention to the following paragraphs

of the said judgment:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">              "...I must next determine whether praragraph 6
              contains the required present language of
              assignment to achieve what would have been
              an automatic assignment of the Roberts
              Patents to Mirage. The question of whether a
              contract creates a         present   assignment
              governed by federal law... To determine if a
              contract creates a valid present assignment,
              the contractual language governs:-
              [W]hether an assignment of patent rights in an
              agreement.. is automatic, or merely a promise
              to assign, depends on the contractual
              language.     If the contract expressly grants
              rights in future inventions, "no further act (is)
              required once an invention (comes) into being,"
              and "the transfer of title (occurs) by operation
              of law." Contracts that merely obligate the
              inventor to grant rights in the future, by
              contrast, "may vest the promise with equitable
              right in those inventions once made, " but do
              not by themselves "vest legal title to patents
              on the inventions in the promise."
              ...Prargraph 6 provides that "all such
              inventions...shall be the sole and exclusive

              steps are required to effectuate an assignment
              even after an invention comes into being.
              .......Thereafter, the employee must "assist
              Mirage...to obtain.... Patents, copyrights, and
              other      statutory     or     common       law
              protections...together with any assignments
              thereof to Mirage or to persons designated by
              Mirage." These additional steps emphasize that
              the assignment contemplated in paragraph 6

              operation of law..."

<p id="p_47">26.    Mr. Jain also made an endeavour to distinguish the cases of

Speedplay and Filmtech (supra) by arguing that these very cases

were distinguished in          the case of St. Clear Intellectual (supra),

since the agreement in question in such cases did not contain an

analogous Clause 7.2 requiring further acts/steps for transfer of

legal title. On the other hand, argued the learned Senior Counsel,

in St Clear Intellectual (supra) wherein agreement in issue

contained a provision akin to Clause 7.2 of the MSA, the Court

held that the language used in the MSA did not constitute                 a

present assignment, inasmuch as, further steps were required to

be effectuate an assignment under the agreement.

              assigned and the duration and territorial or the
              subject matter, inasmuch as per the own

<p id="p_50"> 28.    We are of the opinion that it is not necessary to go into the

niceties of the arguments developed by either parties. The answer

rests on the plain meaning that has to be assigned to the language

used in Clause 7. It clearly suggests that agreement is in presenti

whereby Pine Labs assigned the copyright and other intellectual

right in the project material with the use of the words "assigns"

and it makes clear that the Gemalto "shall be entitled" to all such

rights which Pine Labs again "assigns".       Clause 7.2 on which

reliance has been placed by the counsel for the respondent, to

buttress their submissions, would be of no avail to them.        This

Clause enables the Gemalto to obtain, defend and enforce its right

in the project material assigned by the Pine Labs and only

mandates that for proper defence enforcement of its right in the

project material, if Pine Labs is required to do certain things or

assigns certain documents or instruments, that shall be done by

Pine Labs for which expenses shall be borne by Gemalto. Thus, it

only secures the Gemalto by mandating the Pine Labs to take

certain further steps or assign certain documents if they are

required by Gemalto in any proceedings or otherwise to defend

and enforce its rights. The only purpose of this Clause is that in

case in future for the aforesaid purposes cooperation of the Pine

Labs is needed that would be extended by Pine Labs to Gemalto.

 That has no bearing            to Clause 7.1 which is to be construed

singularly to ascertain as to meaning which is to be assigned and

to decide as to whether the agreement is in present            or it is in

agreement to "assign" only.             As stated above, the language of

Clause 7.1 clearly suggests that it was an agreement in presenti



</p><p id="p_51">29.    That apart, there is another significant aspect of the matter

which needs to be highlighted at this stage.            It is a matter of

common knowledge that before assigning the MSA, two projects

were developed by the Pine Labs for Gemalto on the basis of work

orders. These softwares developed for Gemalto were meant for

BPCL Programme and City-Maruti Program.               They relate to the

period prior to the signing of the MSA. Even when work order for

IOCL Fleet Program was issued (with which we are concerned),

there was no MSA. The MSA was entered into on 24 th June, 2004.

However, IOCL Fleet Program in the first workable version 1.03

was handed over to the Gemalto by the Pine Labs on 16th August,

2004 i.e. within a couple of months after the execution of the MSA

on 24th June, 2004.         In such circumstance, when the work order

was placed prior to the execution of the MSA, a question could

have arisen as to whether IOCL Fleet Program is covered by the

MSA or not. This poser need not detain us for long for the simple

reason that both the parties proceed on the basis that IOCL Fleet

 Program developed in the form of version 1.03. All thereafter are

covered by the MSA.

</p><p id="p_53">30.    At this stage, we would like to comment upon the findings of

the Learned Single Judge to the effect that relationship between

the parties was that of Principal and agent and which means that

Pine Labs undertook the exercise for and on behalf of Gemalto.

This finding, prima facie, appears to be contrary to clause 18 and

20 of the agreement. Clause 18 defines "the relationship between

the parties" and categorically makes it clear that the agreement is

not to be taken to create any joint venture, partnership or other

similar    agreement.       On     the   contrary,   both   the   parties    are

specifically leveled as "independent contractors" with further

specific clarification that "neither party is or may hold itself out to

any third party as being the agent of the other". Even otherwise,

it seems to us that this discussion in the impugned order of the

learned Single Judge is superfluous inasmuch as it was no where

the case of the Gemalto that from very beginning copyright in the

project developed by the Pine Labs belonged to Gemalto. On the

contrary, even Gemalto has relied upon and proceeded on the

premises that as per the MSA, the copyright in the version 1.03

was to be "assign" to Gemalto. Thus, even Gemalto proceeds on

the basis that copyright belonged to the Pine Labs, the original

 creator and it has come in the Labs of the Gemalto by way of

assignment.

consideration the legal consequences that are provided under the

<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_27">Copyright Act</a>.        Since IOCL Fleet Program is developed by Pine

Labs, which is the creator of the said Program as per <a href="/doc/1404402/" id="a_28">Section 17</a> of

the Copyright Act, Pine Labs would be the first owner of the

copyright in this work. <a href="/doc/1703533/" id="a_29">Section 18</a> of the Act, however, permits the

copyright owner to assign the copyright either wholly or partially

and either generally          or subject to limitation and either for the

whole term of the copyright or any part thereof.              <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_30">Section 19</a> of

the Act stipulates the mode of assignment.                  Sub Section (1)

thereof provides that in no uncertain term that assignment has to

be in writing signed by the assignor or by his authorized agent.

As per sub Section (2) of <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_31">Section 19</a> of the Act, the assignment of

the copyright, any such work is to identify              such work and also

specify      the rights      assigned and the "duration           and territorial

extent of such assignment". Thus by agreement the assignment

can be for a limited duration and limited territory. What happens if

the agreement is silent on the duration and territorial extent of the

assignment?        Answer is provided by sub Section (5) and sub

Section (6) of <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_32">Section 19</a> of the Act which reads as under:-

<p id="p_56">32.    In the present case, after analyzing         the documents in

deed, provisions of <a href="/doc/262036/" id="a_33">Section 19</a> (5) (6)         of Copyright would be

attracted. In fact, as would be demonstrated hereinafter, this

would be the situation even if we accept the contention of the

respondent that Clause 7 of the MSA was an agreement to

"assign" and not the "assignment" itself.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">33.     Let us examine the issue on the presumption that clause 7

of the MSA is an actual assignment agreement. Now since the

prior communications and agreements cannot be referred to in the

light of the language of clause 20 as the IOCL Fleet Card Program

is now a subject matter of the MSA, <a href="/doc/160406682/" id="a_34">Section 19(5)</a> and (6) are

bound to be attracted. Here plaintiff seems to win over the

argument.       Learned Single Bench has observed that to find the

 real intentions, the court has power to go beyond the language of

clause 20 and has referred to prior communications to cast a

shadow of doubt over the original ownership of the original author

i.e. plaintiff. Here the learned Single Bench is not talking about

intention as to the assignment but the intention as to the original

ownership. But ownership from the inception is not even the case

of the defendant. The Main thrust of the defendant is that the MSA

is an agreement to assign. It is not the case of the defendant that

a contrary intention, which could nullify the effect of natural

vesting of copyright with the original author in case of a contract

for services, can be found. The issue as to the original ownership

hardly seems to be in defendant's mind. Had it been the case, it

would have raised the issue during the time when the MSA was

being formalized. There is nothing on record to suggest that. The

process of formalization of MSA seems to be a smooth one the

same was a result of growing mutual business and deepening

relationship between the parties, as per the defendant's version of

story itself. Even Clause 7 of the MSA talks about the plaintiff as a

"beneficial owner". Thus, bypassing of the language of clause 20,

in order to infer the real intention, can be done,(that too, if it is

legally correct) only for the drawing some inference regarding

assignment and not for the ownership.

</p><p id="p_60"> 34.    Now, let's presume that the MSA is an agreement to assign

as argued by the Gemalto. In this case, since MSA is just an

agreement to assign, there must have been a subsequent

execution of actual assignment agreement in writing as per the

requirement of <a href="/doc/509070/" id="a_35">section 19(1)</a> of the Copyright Act. The question is

when did it happen?            There is nothing on record to suggest a

subsequent execution of assignment agreement in writing.             It is

not even pleaded. It this case, two things are possible. Either we

can presume that there was no valid assignment of copyright in

the software developed for IOCL Fleet Program in the favour of the

defendant; or, the work order is the assignment agreement within

the requirement of <a href="/doc/509070/" id="a_36">section 19(1)</a>. If former is the case then the

defendant hardly have any chance to succeed and if later is

correct then <a href="/doc/160406682/" id="a_37">section 19(5)</a> and (6) would automatically be

attracted as the work order is silent on the time and territorial

limits of assignment as we cannot beyond the work order, in the

light of clause 20 of the MSA to deduce the intentions. This shakes

the foundation of the defendant's position.

<p id="p_61">

MSA, the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/160406682/" id="a_38">section 19(5)</a> and (6) would

inevitably be triggered.

stage, seems crumbling as its main defence that the MSA is an

"agreement to assign" may not have any bearing at all upon the

instant dispute. It tilts the scales in favour of the Pine Labs which

has fair chance to succeed in the suit. We, therefore, hold that it

 by the plaintiff for IOCL Fleet Card Program. As for as the IOCL

Fleet Card Program is concerned, it would be pertinent to note that

order dated 09/10/09 has been passed in IA No. 13030/09

regarding continuation of IOCL card system on the concession of

Pine Labs itself.         Therefore, no question of hardship to the

defendant would arise regarding IOCL Fleet Card Program.

Fleet Card Program is concerned, we can look into the matter from

two perspectives- firstly from the defendant's and then plaintiff's.

From the defendant's perspective it can be said that since the

software for HPCL Drive Track Plus Program is already out there in

the market and is being used by the defendant therefore any

adverse order will eventually stop the oprationalization of this

program. At the same time, technically, a de novo development

of new software of HPCL Drive Track Plus Programme which is not

born out of the source codes of IOCL Fleet Card Program is always

possible.     Once it is found that the plaintiff has a strong prima

facie case and the defendant has no right to use any subsequently

developed       version     except      version   1.03,   in   balancing   the

convenience, the inconvenience to the plaintiff would be much

more.

</p><p id="p_83"> 44.      As far as irreparable loss to the plaintiff is concerned, it

appears that since the plaintiff itself has calculated damages till

that point of time at ` 20,00,000/- the learned Single Judge formed

an opinion that the loss to the plaintiff cannot be termed as

irreparable and in the eventuality of plaintiff succeeding at the

stage of trial any loss which could have occurred to the plaintiff

can be calculated in monetary terms and the same can be

awarded to then plaintiff as compensation. This according to us is

not a correct appreciation of pleadings. If one reads the prayer

carefully, the plaintiff has prayed for passing, a decree for

rendition of accounts for damages tentatively assessed at `20

lacs".     Thus, not only the damages at ` 20 lacs are assessed

tentatively, the plaintiff has sought specifically and separately also

made a prayer seeking a decree for rendition of accounts. It is

obvious expectation that the actual damages may be much more.

Moreover, once it is found that there is no assignment of the

impugned version of the programme by the plaintiff to the

defendant and the use of this programme by the defendant

amounts to violation of           the plaintiff's copyright, the irreparable

loss/injuries would be suffered by the plaintiff if the defendant is

not prevented from using this programme.

counsel for the appellant need not even been addressed to as the

present appeal warrants to be allowed on the aforesaid reasons.

Accordingly, we set aside the impugned order passed by the

learned Single Judge and direct that the injunction order dated 17th

December, 2009 passed in this appeal shall operate during the

pendency of the suit.
