<p id="p_8">3.      Before coming to these applications, it will be appropriate to have an

        insight into the pleadings of the parties to understand as to why these

        applications have been filed.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.      Defendant no.1 Ruby Tuesday, Inc. is a company incorporated and

        established in the year 1996 in the United State of America (USA) and

        is claimed to be a world renowned proprietor of Restaurant and Bar

        Services. Defendant no.1 devised and adopted the distinctive trade

        and service mark „Ruby Tuesday‟ in respect of Restaurant and Bar

        Services in USA in 1972 and the company was incorporated in USA

        in the year 1996.           Defendant no.2 RTBD, Inc. is its subsidiary

        established and incorporated in USA in the year 2002.

</p><p id="p_10">5.      The Plaintiff (formerly known as Round-The Clock Stores Limited) is

        a company incorporated in India. The Plaintiff claims to be one of

        India‟s most leading restaurant companies which has developed and is

        operating more than thirty restaurants in various parts of India

        including some leading international restaurant brands such as Sbarro

        and HaagenDazs and numerous homegrown restaurant concepts such

        as Mandarin Trail, The Cosmopolitan, Mandarin Express, Indian
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012         Page 3 of 19</span>
         Express, Indus Grill and Mircheez etc.

</p><p id="p_11">6.      It is stated that over a period of last ten years, the Plaintiff has

        acquired unmatchable reputation and huge goodwill associated to its

        services.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.      The Plaintiff and Defendant no.1 entered into an „International

        Development Agreement‟ on 31.08.1999 and several subsequent

        „International Operating Agreements‟ including an Agreement dated

        15.09.1999. In terms of the earlier said agreements, the Plaintiff ran

        several restaurants with the name of „RUBY TUESDAY‟.                The

        relationship between the Plaintiff and Defendant no.1 came to an end

        (after a period of over ten years for which the agreement was initially

        envisaged), by a Mutual Separation Agreement, which was entered

        into between the parties on 27.04.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.      According to the Plaintiff by virtue of Separation Agreement „Post-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        Term Obligations‟ as detailed under Section XVII of the International

        Operating Agreement were waived off with full awareness and mutual

        consent of both Plaintiff and Defendant no.1. The terms „De-Brand‟ in

        the Separation Agreement are as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                " "Debrand" shall mean the removal of all Ruby
                Tuesday signage and logos from the restaurants and
                cessation of use of all Ruby Tuesday menus, uniforms
                and marketing materials as well. Both parties agree to
                waive off all Post-Term Obligations covered under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012       Page 4 of 19</span>
                 Section XVII in the International Operating Agreements
                and under Section IX in the International Development
                Agreement, with the only Post-Termination ongoing
                covenant being the covenant between the parties not to
                disparage each other."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">9.      According to the Plaintiff in terms of Separation Agreement, the Post-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        Term Obligation were limited to non-use of any signage and logos of

        Defendant no.1‟s mark „Ruby Tuesday‟. The Plaintiff was therefore,

        free to use the word „RUBY‟ which is otherwise a generic word. The

        Plaintiff, therefore, started a restaurant in the name and style of

        „RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL‟ in August, 2011 and its outlets are spread

        across NCR region, Chandigarh and Bangalore.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">10.     The Plaintiff also applied for registration of the trade mark „RUBY‟s

        BAR &amp; GRILL‟ in classes 29,30,31, 32, 33, 34 and 42 in India as per

        the details mentioned in para 18 of the plaint.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_14">11.     It is the case of the Plaintiff that the trade marks RUBY, RUBY RED

        Family Restro (with device), RUBY SEMIYA (device), RUBY TEA

        (device), RED RUBY, etc. have been got registered by various

        persons from time to time in India and abroad. Thus, there was

        nothing unusual for the Plaintiff to have applied for registration of its

        trade mark „RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL‟ in different shapes, designs for

        various goods and services as earlier stated.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.     According to the Plaintiff on 15.12.2011, the Plaintiff received a letter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012        Page 5 of 19</span>
         from Defendant no.2 purporting to be the lawful user and proprietor of

        the trade mark „RUBY TUESDAY‟ for providing restaurant and bar

        services in several countries including India.               Defendant no.2

        cautioned the Plaintiff against its use of name „RUBY‟s BAR &amp;

        GRILL‟ for its restaurant claiming to have proprietary rights in the

        word „RUBY‟ and threatening the Plaintiff with legal consequences

        unless it desist from using the mark „RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL‟.

</p><p id="p_16">13.     It is the case of the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff‟s use of its mark

        „RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL‟ does not amount to trade mark

        infringement or passing off since Separation Agreement dated

        27.04.2011 has categorically removed any restriction on the Plaintiff‟s

        use of mark RUBY per se or in combination with any other word and

        required only the removal of all Ruby Tuesday signage and logos from

        the restaurants and cessation of use of all Ruby Tuesday menus,

        uniforms and marketing material.
</p>
<p id="p_17">14.     The Defendants have filed a counter claim-cum-written statement to

        the suit of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15.     The sum and substance of the defence and the counter claim set up by

        the Defendants is that the Plaintiff claims to fame emanates from the

        International       Development         Agreement   dated   31.08.1999     and

        International Operating Agreement dated 15.09.1999 between the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012              Page 6 of 19</span>
         parties as the Plaintiff claims to have acquired the reputation only

        during the last ten years whereas Agreement with the Defendants was

        entered into as far back as in 1999, that is more than ten years before

        the filing of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_19">16.     The Defendants have averred that if clause A, B and D of Section 17

        of the Operating Agreement dated 15.09.1999 are read together, it

        will clearly constitute a complete embargo against the Plaintiff from

        using the trade and service mark „RUBY TUESDAY‟ or any

        reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colourable imitation, including the

        word/trade mark RUBY.
</p>
<p id="p_20">17.     The Defendants have admitted that the parties had agreed to „waive

        off‟ all Post-Term Obligations etc. with the only post-termination

        ongoing covenant being that the parties would not „disparage one

        another.‟ According to the Defendants that however, did not mean that

        the Defendants had given up its proprietary rights in the trade mark

        „RUBY TUESDAY‟ or any part therein.                   According to the

        Defendants, the intention of the parties from the Separation

        Agreement was clear to the effect that the Plaintiff was obligated to

        altogether divest its rights of use of the trade mark RUBY or RUBY

        TUESDAY or any deceptively similar word/trade mark within a time

        bound frame in relation to its restaurant business.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012         Page 7 of 19</span>
</p><p id="p_21"> 18.     According to the Defendants, Defendant no.1 have devised and

        adopted distinctive trade and service mark comprising the word

        „RUBY TUESDAY‟ in respect of restaurant and bar services in USA

        in 1972. Since then, it has licensee rights for operation of „RUBY

        TUESDAY‟ restaurant in over 25 countries under this trade name. In

        India, the Defendants commenced use of this trade and service mark in

        the year 2000.
</p>
<p id="p_22">19.     According to the Defendants, Defendant no.1 was desirous of

        launching restaurant and bar services in India in the trade and service

        mark „RUBY TUESDAY‟ and therefore entered into various

        agreements with the Plaintiff in the year 1999. Defendant no.2 got

        registration of the mark „RUBY TUESDAY‟ in class 42, 29, 32, 16,

        25, 30 and 33 since the year 1997 as detailed in para 47 of the counter

        claim-cum-written statement.
</p>
<p id="p_23">20.     It is the case of the Defendants that the Plaintiff‟s act of filing

        application for registration of trade mark RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL in

        relation to food and drink, alcoholic beverages vide applications as

        mentioned in para 18 of the plaint is dishonest and mala fide as the

        Plaintiff was well aware that it had no rights in the RUBY‟s in

        congestion with the words BAR &amp; GRILL.              According to the

        Defendants, the Plaintiff appears to have filed applications for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012       Page 8 of 19</span>
         registration of the impugned mark after receiving Defendant no.2‟s

        seize and desist notice.
</p>
<p id="p_24">21.     The Defendants have given the generation of annual revenue and

        expenses in paras 52 and 53 of the counter claim wherein it was

        averred that the Defendants revenue in the year 2006-07

        $1,410,227,000 rose to $1,265,162,000 in the year 2010-11 and

        advertisement expenditure in the year 2006-07 $49,104,000 rose to

        total $173,454,000 in the year 2010-11. It is averred that the Plaintiff

        is operating at least five restaurants under the impugned mark at the

        same location where they formerly operated restaurant as an

        infringement of RUBY TUESDAY details whereof were mentioned in

        para 60 of the counter claim. The Defendants, therefore, have sought

        injunction which have been earlier extracted in para 2 of this order.

</p><p id="p_25">22.     The crux of the Plaintiff‟s case is that RUBY is a generic word in

        respect of which the Defendants cannot have any proprietary rights; in

        terms of the Separation Agreement the post-time obligation were

        limited to non-use of any signage and logos of the Defendants‟ mark

        RUBY TUESDAY and that the Plaintiff is not using the mark RUBY

        TUESDAY but RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL and that the Plaintiff has not

        infringed the Defendants‟ trademark by using the mark RUBY‟s BAR

        &amp; GRILL in different shapes in respect of which various applications
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012        Page 9 of 19</span>
         have also been filed by the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_26">23.     On the other hand, Mr. H.L. Tikku, learned Senior Counsel for the

        Defendants have urged that the mark RUBY is not generic in relation

        to restaurant; adoption of the mark RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL by the

        Plaintiff is dishonest and mere addition of the word BAR &amp; GRILL

        will not allow the Plaintiff to infringe the Defendants mark

        particularly in relation to the hospitality/restaurant services and more

        particularly when the business is being carried out by the Plaintiff

        from the same premises as was being carried out by it(the Plaintiff) as

        a licensee of the Defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_27">24.     As per the averments made in the plaint, the Plaintiff claims to have

        acquired the unmatched reputation and usage goodwill associated to

        the restaurant services during the last ten years. It is important to note

        that several International Operating Agreements including the

        agreement dated 15.09.1999 were entered into between the Plaintiff

        and Defendant no.1. Thus, it is not in dispute that the Plaintiff earned

        the reputation and goodwill when the Operating Agreements were

        entered into between the parties and the Plaintiff started running

        restaurant as a licensee with the name of RUBY TUESDAY.

</p><p id="p_28">25.     As per the averments made in the plaint (para 19), the Plaintiff applied

        for registration of the trade mark RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL sometime
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012         Page 10 of 19</span>
         in August, 2011 mostly in relation to food beverages and restaurant

        services. At this juncture, it will be appropriate to notice some of the

        judgments of this Court relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for

        the Defendants wherein it was laid down that if a party itself applies

        for registration of a mark, it is not permissible for the said party to

        raise a plea that the mark is generic and is incapable of being

        registered or owned by a particular person. <a href="/doc/176801297/" id="a_1">In Anchor Health and

        I.A.11461/2013 in CS(OS)1431/2013, a plea raised by the Defendant

        that the mark "ALL-AROUND PROTECTION" was a generic word

        was rejected as Defendant itself had applied for registration of the

        mark "ALL-ROUNDER". The learned Senior Counsel referred to

                namely, that the mark of the plaintiff is descriptive. Reliance

                indicate the kind and quality or other characteristics of the
                goods. It has been urged that the plaintiff has procured the

                 alleged trademark. The defendants have not denied that they
                have moved an application for registration of their mark
                "ALLROUNDER". They have also not denied that they have

                urged that the term "ALLROUNDER" is a product neutral
                expression. Further regarding registration of the mark in
                United States it is urged that the said registration in United
                States is inconsequential to the present proceedings as the
                <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_5">Trade Marks Act</a> applies only to the jurisdiction of India. It
                is further urged that a descriptive word will not change its
                character merely by an act of the defendant.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                12. What is the effect of these background facts i.e. that the
                defendants have themselves applied for registration of the
                mark "ALLROUNDER" and have also obtained registration
                of the mark "ALL-AROUND PROTECTION" in USA. In my
                view it is not permissible for the defendant to approbate and
                reprobate. Reference in this context may be had to the
                judgment of the Full Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1904054/" id="a_6">Rajneesh Kumar
                Singhal vs. The State (National Capital Territory of Delhi</a>),
                89 (2001) DLT 511. In paragraph 6 the Court held as
                follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                    6. The submission of the learned senior counsel
                    overlooks the fact that a party cannot normally be
                    allowed to approbate and reprobate. If a party has taken
                    up a specific stand at a particular stage of the court
                    proceedings it should not be open for him to take a
                    contrary position at a subsequent stage of litigation or in
                    different proceedings. The principle serves well as it does
                    not allow a litigant to blow hot and cold at successive
                    stages of the same litigation, or another litigation. The
                    doctrine is well illustrated in <a href="/doc/430967/" id="a_7">Dwijendra Narain v. Joges
                    Chandra</a> 39 C.L.J. 40 where it was held as follows:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                     "It is an elementary rule that a party litigant cannot be
                     permitted to assume inconsistent positions in Court, to
                     play fast and loose, to blow hot and cold, to approbate

                      and reprobate, to the detriment of his opponent. This
                     wholesome doctrine applies not only to the successive
                     stages of the same suit, but also to another suit than the
                     one in which the position was taken up, provided that
                     the second suit grows out of the judgment in the first."

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                13. Reference may also be had to the judgment of this Court
                in the case of <a href="/doc/1806604/" id="a_8">Automatic Electric vs. R.K.Dhawan</a>, (supra).
                That was a case which pertained to a suit for injunction
                filed by the plaintiff for its registered trademark
                DIMMERSTAT. The defendant in that case is said to have
                adopted the trademark DIMMER DOT. The defendants in
                that case took the stand in the said matter that the word
                DIMMER being a generic word is incapable of serving a
                trademark function. It was urged that the said word
                signifies an auto variable transformer and no trader could
                monopolize its use. The defendants in that case had got
                their trademark DIMMER DOT registered in Australia. In
                those facts this Court did not accept the contention of the
                defendant in that case that DIMMER is a generic
                expression. In paragraph 16 this Court held as follows:-
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                    "16. The defendants got their trade mark "DIMMER
                    DOT" registered in Australia. The fact that the
                    defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary
                    right and monopoly in "DIMMER DOT", it does not lie
                    in their mouth to say that the word "DIMMER" is a
                    generic expression."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                14. In view of the said legal position I do not wish to go into
                the submission of the defendant as to whether the word
                "ALLROUND" or "ALLROUND PROTECTION" is a
                generic word. It clearly does not lie for the defendant to
                raise the said submission in the given facts. Their
                submission about the mark being generic has to be
                rejected."

<p id="p_30">27.     The cases relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the

        Defendants apply on all fours to the facts of the present case.

        Moreover, it has to be borne in mind that the Plaintiff was permitted to

        use the mark RUBY TUESDAY and running same business in the

        same premises with similar and deceptively similar trade mark will

        have to be construed as dishonest and mala fide.

</p><p id="p_31">28.     Although, it cannot be lost sight of that RUBY TUESDAY became

        popular with the younger generation. The contention of the learned

        counsel for the Plaintiff that the most of the Plaintiff‟s clients middle

        class cannot be brushed aside. However, I am not in agreement with

        this contention of the learned counsel for the Plaintiff that simply

        because the projected consumers/customers were educated or

        belonged to middle class they would readily distinguish the Plaintiff‟s

        mark with the Defendants‟ mark. The general principles which have

        been repeatedly followed are that the Court has to approach the two

        marks from the point of view of a man of average intelligence and

        imperfect recollection. Even to the literate class the words/marks

        RUBY TUESDAY and RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL may be taken to be

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                ".....In an action for an alleged infringement of a
                registered trade mark, it has first to be seen whether the
                impugned mark of the defendant is identical with the
                registered mark of the plaintiff. It the mark is found to be
                identical, no further question arises, and it has to be held
                that there was infringement. If the mark of the defendant is
                not identical, it has to be seen whether the mark of the
                defendant is deceptively similar in sense that it is likely to
                deceive or cause confusion in relation to goods in respect
                of which the plaintiff got his mark registered. For that
                purpose, the two marks have to be compared, "not by
                placing them side by side, but by asking itself whether
                having due regard to relevant surrounding circumstances,
                the defendant‟s mark as used is similar to the plaintiff‟s
                mark as it would be remembered by persons possessed of
                an average memory with its usual imperfections", and it
                has then to be determined whether the defendant‟s mark is

                 average intelligence and imperfect memory would retain in
                his mind after seeking the marks, have to be noticed. It has

                is an overall similarity or resemblance, and whether the
                resemblance or similarity is such that there is a reasonable
                probability of deception or confusion. In doing so, the
                approach has to be from the point of view of purchaser of
                average intelligence and imperfect memory or
                recollection, and not an ignorant, thoughtless and

<p id="p_33">30.     Admittedly, the International Operating Agreement between the

        Plaintiff and the Defendant no.1 had come to an end vide a mutual

        193 (2012) DLT 238, the Respondent had obtained registration of the

        trademark "MORGARDSHAMMAR". The Appellant was using the

        trademark "MORGARDSHAMMAR" in terms of an agreement

        between the parties which had been validly terminated. It was held by

        a Division Bench of this Court that after termination agreement, the

</p><p id="p_35">32.     RUBY TUESDAY or for that matter the mark RUBY in relation to

        food and beverages cannot be said to be a generic mark. Rather, the

        same is an arbitrary and fanciful mark. Fanciful marks consist of

        coined words that have been invented and selected for the sole

        purpose of functioning as a trade mark. The Plaintiff in para 12 of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012         Page 16 of 19</span>
         plaint has averred that the mark RUBY is not the exclusive mark of

        Defendant no.1 as it has been registered in respect of various

        businesses all over the world including hospitality and various

        applications which have been registered or are pending registration in

        India and abroad. This plea will not help the Plaintiff at this stage

        because the Plaintiff itself used the mark RUBY TUESDAY in

        pursuance of an agreement between the Plaintiff and Defendant no.1.

        Thus, the Plaintiff was permitted to use the name in terms of the

        International Operating Agreement. The use of the mark RUBY‟s

        BAR &amp; GRILL in respect of the same goods and services at the same

        place which was where the Plaintiff was running RUBY TUESDAY

        will, prima facie, will not only be infringement but also dishonest,

        mala fide and in order to pass on the goods and services of the

        Plaintiff as those of the Defendants.

<p id="p_36">33.     The learned Senior Counsel for the Defendants has taken pains to refer

        to the menu card being used by the Plaintiff while running its

        restaurant in the name of RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL where food articles

        RUBY‟s Classic Chicken Burger, RUBY‟s Burger etc., etc. formed

        part of the Defendants‟ menu. This, by itself, may not be sufficient to

        show that the Plaintiff is infringing the Defendants trade mark but user

        of the mark RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL in respect of the same services at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">I.A.s No. 1047/2012 &amp; 7360/2012 in CS (OS) No.137/2012        Page 17 of 19</span>
         the same time and place coupled with some of the similar articles in

        the menu card speak volume of Plaintiff‟s dishonesty in using a

        deceptively similar trade mark to ride on the Defendants reputation

        and to pass on the Plaintiff‟s goods as that of the Defendants. In fact,

        filing of the instant suit with an application for interim injunction

        (IA.1047/2012) seeking restraint against the Defendants shows that

        the Plaintiff was aware of the infringement of the Defendants mark by

        it and came to this Court apprehending action by the Defendants.

</p><p id="p_37">34.     In my view, the Defendants have been prima facie able to establish

        that the adoption of the mark RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL by the Plaintiff,

        in the circumstances of the case, amounts to infringement of the

        Defendants mark RUBY TUESDAY. The Plaintiff was a licensee to

        use the trade mark RUBY TUESDAY under International Operating

        Agreement and the agreement having come to an end, the user of the

        mark RUBY‟s BAR &amp; GRILL by the Plaintiff will result in

        irreparable loss and injury not only in money but also in Defendants

        reputation. It will also amount to dilution of the Defendants mark

        RUBY TUESDAY by the Plaintiff who was a licensee to use the mark

        RUBY TUESDAY during currency of the International Agreement.

        Thus, the balance of convenience also tilts in favour of the

        Defendants.
