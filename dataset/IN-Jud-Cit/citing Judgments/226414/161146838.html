39 Rules 1&amp;2 of the CPC seeking an ex-parte ad-interim injunction in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant in taking out the
impugned advertisement or in any manner disparaging the goodwill and
reputation of the plaintiff and any of its products in ―hair removal
category‖, as well as for restraining the defendant and its agents from
publishing such advertisement having deleterious effect on the products
of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.       The plaintiff being one of the subsidiaries of Proctor and Gamble
Co. USA, which is engaged in manufacturing, selling, importing and
exporting men's and women's grooming category products, came out
with a razor, specially designed for women, under the brand name




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                    Page 3 of 31</span>
 VENUS in September 2015, which brand is stated to have become a
premier product in women's shaving category globally. Prior to the
launching of the aforesaid product, a disposable razor for women namely
SIMPLY VENUS was launched. VENUS was launched for the reason
that market surveys revealed complete non-availability of gender
sensitive and gender specific razors.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.       It is averred in the plaint that the defendant released an
advertisement on YouTube and other TV channels seeking to promote its
product, a hair removal cream under the name and style ―VEET‖ but with
the intention of maliciously denigrating the product of the plaintiff by
displaying a razor in the impugned advertisement, which is deceptively
similar to the razor of the plaintiff under the brand name VENUS or
SIMPLY VENUS. The assertion in the plaint, therefore, was that an
average consumer with imperfect recollection would always associate a
light blue coloured razor with that of the plaintiff's brand VENUS. The
advertisement maliciously targeted, according to the plaintiff, usage of
razors in general as well as specifically against the product of the plaintiff
by resorting to a falsehood viz. razors do not leave a smooth skin and in
comparison, the product of the defendant namely VEET hair removal
cream leaves ―two times smoother skin than razors‖. The aforesaid
assertion of the defendant in the advertisement is stated to be not only
completely false but without any scientific data. The advertisement also
depicted, in the estimation of the plaintiff, a comparative analysis of the
working of razors, which, though, was claimed to be an ordinary razor
but is strikingly and deceptively similar to the product of the plaintiff.
The advertisement also notoriously depicted that improper use of razors
without foam, soap, lather or cream has a bad effect on female skin and
leaves behind a ―stubble‖. It is stated that such a statement is not only



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                    Page 4 of 31</span>
 misleading but is not based on any scientific data and therefore the
advertisement disparages, generically, the goods of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.       The allegation, in sum and substance, is that the story line in the
impugned advertisement has the potency of messaging the public at large
to eschew razors for hair removal by depicting a deceptively similarly
coloured and styled razor with the razor marketed and sold under the
brand name of VENUS and SIMPLY VENUS. The advertisement was
also stated to be venturing beyond the permissible limits of comparative
advertising as it was with a clear intention to cause an adverse impact on
the product of the plaintiff, thereby causing damage to the reputation and
goodwill of the plaintiff. The relevant portion of the storyboard of the
impugned advertisement is reproduced below:
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                     Page 5 of 31</span>

 puffery, and formulated the following issues for deliberation for the
purposes of injunction:-
</p>
<p id="p_14">I. Whether the defendant was justified in using a blue razor in the
impugned advertisement, as it was identical to the colour of the razor of
the plaintiff sold under the trademark VENUS and SIMPLY VENUS?
</p>
<p id="p_15">II. Whether the impugned advertisement is misleading and false as it
showed the use of razor without the use of lather/foam which, according
to the advisory of the plaintiff, is required to be used while using the
razor for hair removal?
</p>
<p id="p_16">III. Whether the defendant could have contended through the
advertisement that using of a depilatory cream of the defendant would
cause two times smoothening of the skin as compared to removal of hair
by razors?
</p>
<p id="p_17">IV. Whether the plaintiff would be justified in claiming that the
advertisement showed difference in the colour of the skin namely dark
when a razor was used and fair when a depilatory cream was used,
thereby suggesting that removal of hair by a razor leads to dark and
uneven skin and removal of hair by depilatory cream leaves fairer and
softer skin; (which would, in any way, be a misrepresentation or a false
statement)?
</p>
<p id="p_18">V. Whether an injunction could be sought against the defendant in
depicting that the use of razors can leave a stubble on the skin?
</p>
<p id="p_19">9.       While answering the above posers, the learned single Judge held
that the identical blue colour of the razor shown in the advertisement is
relatable to the razors of the plaintiff, and, therefore the blue coloured
razor shown in the advertisement disparages the plaintiff's razors in
general thereby causing irreparable prejudice and harm to the reputation



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                    Page 8 of 31</span>
 of the product of the plaintiff. The defendant was therefore restrained
from depicting the razor in the advertisement in blue colour. The learned
Single Judge, in arriving at the aforesaid opinion, relied upon an earlier
judicial proceeding (CS (OS) No. 3190/2015) initiated by the defendant
wherein the plaintiff was restrained from using a spatula of the same
colour as that used by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_20">10.      The prayer of the plaintiff regarding injunction against the
defendant in showing the use of razor without lather or foam, as is the
advisory of the plaintiff, was declined on the concession of the parties
that the instructions given over the cover of the razor clearly states that
use of foam/lather would only be a better alternative and not essential and
therefore such issue could only be decided in the suit finally.
</p>
<p id="p_21">11.      The learned Single Judge restrained the defendant from claiming in
its impugned advertisement that hair removal by the depilatory cream of
the defendant is twice as good as compared to hair removal by a razor by
holding that the report of Global Depilatories R&amp;D Laboratories, Hull,
UK which was relied upon by the defendant in making such statement,
could not have been relied upon as such report was obtained at the
instance of the defendant and cannot be termed as a report submitted by a
neutral third party for the court to accept it at the interim stage.
</p>
<p id="p_22">12.      However, the claim of the plaintiff that the impugned
advertisement showed differences in the colour of skin with different
mode of hair removal, namely by a depilatory cream and a razor (dark
skin when hair is removed by razor and fair skin when hair is removed by
a depilatory cream), and therefore the advertisement contained a
misrepresentation and false statement, was rejected on the ground that the
same could not have been visible to the eye by the public at large while




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                       Page 9 of 31</span>
 viewing the impugned advertisement. Hence the aforesaid injunction was
refused.
</p>
<p id="p_23">13.      Since the plaintiff relied upon the report of M/s Nielson dated
24.12.2014, that use of razor of the plaintiff did not leave behind any
stubble, in order to adversely comment upon the impugned advertisement
as being disparaging, the learned single Judge refused to grant injunction
against the defendant in the impugned advertisement regarding leaving
behind stubble in case of hair removal by a razor on the same ground of
the report being commissioned by the plaintiff's company, therefore,
lacking in objectivity.
</p>
<p id="p_24">14.      The defendant, which also claims to be a reputed company dealing
in cosmetic depilatories, has challenged the aforesaid order on various
counts, but primarily on the ground that the advertisement sought to be
impugned does not disparage or denigrate the product of the plaintiff. The
defendant was not provided a full opportunity of being heard.              The
impugned order is further assailed as flawed because the very premise of
the order, being of ad interim nature was incorrect, specially seen in the
light of the impact of the order whereby an advertisement which was
being run uninterruptedly since 01.04.2016 was suddenly brought to a
grinding halt.
</p>
<p id="p_25">15.      On merits, it was argued that the razor used in the advertisement is
not of the colour and shape of the razor of the plaintiff. The colour of the
razors of the plaintiff are a shade of green and purple (SIMPLY VENUS)
and a combination of white and blue (VENUS) whereas the razor used in
the advertisement is of blue colour. Even the shape of the razor used in
the advertisement is absolutely different from the shape of both the
products of the respondent. A visual comparison would make it obvious




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 10 of 31</span>
 that neither the product of the plaintiff was shown nor identified in the
impugned advertisement.
</p>



<p id="p_26">16.      It was contended by the defendant that the impugned order did not
take into account the fact that a similar complaint was raised by the
plaintiff against an advertisement campaign ―don't shave it, just VEET it‖
before the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a self
regulatory body, objecting to the tag line in the advertisement ―#don't
shave‖ on the ground of the same being misleading and thereby putting
the product of the plaintiff and razors as a category in general to a lower
estimation by the viewer. The aforesaid complaint was dismissed by the
ASCI holding that such advertisement did not denigrate the razor as a
category of products which included the product of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_27">17.      Mr. C.M. Lall, learned Advocate for the defendant, submitted that
the injunction against the defendant in so far as the part of the
advertisement relating to a representation by the defendant that the use of
a razor leaves stubble whereas use of a depilatory cream (VEET) does not
and that the depilatory cream of the defendant leaves the skin upto two
times smoother than razors, was not justified as the plaintiff, on their own
website have represented the advantages of using a depilatory cream



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                    Page 11 of 31</span>
 which impacts the skin by dissolving the hair shaft, leaves behind a
rounded edge at the skin surface, thereby making the regrowth of hair
softer and of a longer duration than after shaving.
</p>
<p id="p_28">18.      That the learned Single Judge did not grant injunction against the
defendant regarding representation in the advertisement that use of the
razor leaves a stubble, is a vindication of the fact, it is argued, that the
depilatory cream of the defendant leaves the skin upto two times
smoother.
</p>
<p id="p_29">19.      An objection has been raised with regard to framing of the poser,
regarding leaving the skin ―up to two times smoother than razors‖. The
learned Single Judge, it has been urged, has, in an erroneous manner,
framed the issue as hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">         "The next issue is as to whether the defendant can
         contend as per the impugned advertisement that using of
         hair removal cream of the defendant causes two times
         smoothening of the skin as compared to hair removal by
         razors"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_30">20.      The depiction in the advertisement and the formulation by the
learned Single Judge is at complete variance and ―leaving the skin upto
two times smoother‖ is not the same as ―causing two times smoothening
of skin‖. The injunction on that count against the defendant thus was
unnecessary as no such claim has been made in the impugned
advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_31">21.      As a corollary to the aforesaid argument, it has been suggested that
if injunction was refused with respect to depicting in the advertisement
that removal of hair by razor causes a stubble then the depilatory cream
(Veet) of the defendant can definitely be canvassed as a better option for
hair removal. If removal of hair by a depilatory cream does not leave a



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 12 of 31</span>
 stubble, then perhaps it would not be a wrong representation that use of
the product of the defendant leaves behind a better/smoother skin. Thus
representing that use of VEET would leave the skin twice as smooth,
would fall in the category of puffery which is permissible.
</p>
<p id="p_32">22.      It has been submitted that the learned single Judge fell in error in
not accepting the report filed by an independent UK based laboratory
namely Global Depilatories R&amp;D Laboratory, Hull, UK on the ground of
the report being non-objective as it completely ignores the fact that the
report includes the finding on smoothness of the skin and not the duration
during which the skin remains smooth. The report of the aforesaid
laboratory was also trashed by the learned Single Judge on the issue of
the size and number of sampling, even when the report dealt with the tests
of different VEET products on different persons with different skin types
of approximately 200 persons.
</p>
<p id="p_33">23.      The plaintiff is also dissatisfied with the impugned order for only
partial relief was granted and the injunction regarding showing the use of
razor in the advertisement without its proper method of application using
soap, foam or lather; portraying that razors cause skin darkening by
showing comparison between product of the plaintiff and the defendant in
dark and light skin respectively in the impugned advertisement and
portrayal in the advertisement of the razors causing ―stubble trouble‖
were declined.
</p>
<p id="p_34">24.      Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
plaintiff, submitted that even though the learned Single Judge referred to
the judgments of <a href="/doc/134483884/" id="a_5">Colgate Palmolive Company &amp; Anr. vs. Hindustan
Unilever Ltd</a>.,2014 (57) PTC 47 (Del.) (DB)and Dabur India Ltd.(Supra)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 13 of 31</span>
 but did not correctly apply the ratio of the aforesaid judgments to the
facts of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_35">25.      It has been argued that the impugned advertisement was taken out
by the defendant and therefore it lay upon the defendant to demonstrate
that the assertions in the impugned advertisement were correct and not
false. The report of the Global Depilatories does not include any
statement as to whether, in case, a razor is used it will result in causing
stubble and that the use of depilatory cream would not. It was further
submitted that even if the tall claims in the advertisement were taken to
be correct, then also it would not be open for anybody, much less the
defendant, to malign the product of a competitor like the plaintiff. It was
thus stressed that even showing the use of razor without the proper
method of its application and depicting darkening of skin in comparison
when razor was used for hair removal as compared to the depilatory
cream of the defendant and hair removal by razors leaving "stubble
trouble" in the impugned advertisement be also injuncted.
</p>
<p id="p_36">26.      In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties and evaluate
the impugned order it would be necessary to refer to certain concepts
namely, disparagement, puffery, trade libel, comparative advertising and
damages vis-a-vis the right to freedom of Speech under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_6">article 19(1)(a)</a> of
the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_37">27.      The expression disparagement means to speak about something in
a light manner so as to undervalue or discredit it. It amounts to
denigration which, in other words, means putting the product at low
estimation or valuation.
</p>
<p id="p_38">28.      Black's law dictionary, Eighth Edition, defines disparagement as
―A derogatory comparison of one thing with another; the act or an




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                  Page 14 of 31</span>
 instance of castigating or detracting from the reputation of, esp. unfairly
or untruthfully; a false and injurious statement that discredits or detracts
from the reputation of another's property, product or business.‖

</p><p id="p_39">29.      For an act of disparagement, especially in an advertisement, the
contents of the advertisement must depict the malicious intent of the
advertisement; improper manner in which the advertisement has been
made to run; the storyline of the advertisement and the message sought to
be conveyed by it must have the potency of putting another product to
disrepute. By the manner of running the advertisement, it is meant that if
an advertisement intends to ridicule or condemn or denigrate a product of
a competitor, then it would amount to disparagement. However, if the
manner is only to show that one product is better or even the best would
not come in the category of disparagement if the other product of a
competitor is not denigrated.

         the action, a plaintiff must prove that; the defendant made
         the disparaging remark; the defendant intended to injure
         the business, knew that the statement was false, or
         recklessly disregarded whether it was true; and the
         statement resulted in special damages to the plaintiff, by

 impugned advertisement, a Single bench of this Court had held as
hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">         ―14.2 But every comparison does not necessarily amount
         to disparagement. Consequently, what is required to be
         answered is: whether there is denigration of plaintiffs'
         products. The answer to this question in my mind lies in
         what is the fundamental purpose for which the product is
         manufactured. Both the plaintiffs' and defendants'
         products are kitchen cleaners. Therefore, efficacy in
         cleaning tough kitchen stains with minimum effort would
         be the core object in manufacturing a product of such
         kind. The impugned advertisement undoubtedly shows
         that "CIF Cream" which is the defendants' product
         achieves this object quickly with least amount of effort in
         comparison to the products of its competitor. In my view
         in the facts of the instant case, the impugned
         advertisement prima facie does seem to denigrate the
         plaintiffs' product. It comes within the test of the
         defendants alluding to a "specific defect" or "demerit" in
         the plaintiffs' product.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_49">39.      Exaggerated claims but without any false statement which is also
called puffing has been accepted under the Indian law also as being legal.
The concept of puffing being within the realm of legally permissible
canvassing was recognized and appreciated in Hubbuck v Wilkinson,
[1899] 1 Q.B.86. In the aforesaid case, it was observed that a comparative
statement about the goods of a manufacturer claiming it to be better than
the goods of others was held to be non actionable. In the aforesaid case,
the defendant had published a circular which gave details of trials
comparing the zinc paints of the competing parties. The conclusion of the
trial which was published gave some ‗brownie' points to the defendant's
product. The product of the defendant was also cheaper than that of the
plaintiff. The plaintiff had alleged that the results published by the
defendant were not true. The reason behind acceptance of such a legal



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 17 of 31</span>
 proposition was that if puffing would not be permissible, then, perhaps no
person in the commercial world, trying to project its/his product, would
be saved/insulated from litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_50">40.      In White v Mellin, [1894] 3 Ch.276, the defendant had purchased
baby food from the plaintiff and sold it to the public. With the packaging
of the plaintiff's product, a label was attached, which disclosed that in the
category of baby food, the product of the defendant was more nutritious
and healthy than any other yet offered. The case against the defendant
failed at the House of Lords. Lord Herschell L.C. found that that the label
was directed against the plaintiff but any action against the defendant
would necessarily fail because the label was in the nature of a puff which
would not be taken by the public seriously or would not be taken to mean
that the goods of the plaintiff were not good or were lesser in quality than
anyone else's. The argument that the impugned label contained a factual
position and not merely an opinion was not accepted by the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_51">41.      From a conspectus of the decisions rendered by English Courts,
three underlying principles can safely be deduced:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">         (i) The impugned statement/representation must specifically
         denigrate the product of the claimant in order to be actionable;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">         (ii) The representation shall not be actionable unless it is likely to
         be taken seriously;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">         (iii) General praise of one's product/goods would not be actionable.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_52">42.      In De Beers Abrasive Products v. International General Electric
Co., [1975] F.S.R. 323, Walton, J expressed that Courts would take a
practical approach in reading the statements complained of, given the
general habit of hyperbolical statement regarding a product in an
advertisement regarding the celebrity of the product. Such hyperbolical




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                     Page 18 of 31</span>
 statements are bound to be taken with a pinch of salt. In Mc Donald's
Hamburgers vs. Burgerking, [1986] F.S.R.45 it was held that
"advertisements are not to be read as if they were some testamentary
provisions in a will or a clause in some agreement with every word being
carefully considered and the words as a whole being compared".
</p>
<p id="p_53">43.      However, what cannot be doubted as a settled legal principle is that
nobody would be protected if he intends to denigrate or defame the goods
of his competitor in the process of making any comparison. Comparative
advertising, though is permissible, but only within permissible limits.
Indian Courts have recognized such denigrating comparisons as
actionable wrongs (see: <a href="/doc/226414/" id="a_9">Hindustan Lever Ltd v. Colgate Palmolive (I)
Ltd and Anr</a>, 1998 (1) SCC 720; <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_10">Pepsi Co Inc. &amp; Ors. v. Hindustan

</p>
<p id="p_55">44.      It would only be apposite to recount the propositions formulated in
<a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_13">Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd v. M.P.Ramchandran &amp; Anr</a>, 1999 PTC
(19) 741 regarding comparative advertising.

         in the world, even though the declaration is untrue.
</p><p id="p_57">         (b) He can also say that his goods are better than his
         competitors', even though such statement is untrue.

         can even compare the advantages of his goods over the
         goods of others.
</p><p id="p_59">         (d) He however, cannot, while saying that his goods are
         better than his competitors', say that his competitors'
         goods are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                    Page 19 of 31</span>
          of his competitors. In other words, he defames his
         competitors and their goods, which is not permissible.
</p><p id="p_60">         (e) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the
         manufacturer of such goods no action lies, but if there is
         such defamation an action lies and if an action lies for
         recovery of damages for defamation, then the Court is also
         competent to grant an order of injunction restraining
         repetition of such defamation."
</p>
<p id="p_61">45.      Unlike in defamation cases, where there is a thumb rule that a
statement could be taken to be defamatory if it is capable of one meaning
only which is slanderous and not that the statement is capable of being
perceived or taken in a different sense, the aforesaid rule may not have
necessary application in a case of malicious falsehood as a tortious
liability. If a statement is capable of being construed in a different manner
which could lead to slanderous results, the same would be prohibited.
</p>
<p id="p_62">46.      To understand the concept better it would be necessary to see what
malice actually means. Unless the malice is akin to dishonesty or at least
improper motive, the same may not be actionable. For a malice in thought
to get reflected in a representation or advertisement, and specially in a
comparative advertising, must involve a subjective state of mind of the
wrongdoer, having necessary mental element of ill will or an intention to
injure. Similarly, if a person is seeking to defend his own lawful interest
but, while doing so, he is cognizant of the fact that it would cause damage
to the other side, he may not be accused of malice. The trader's desire to
promote his business at the expense of rivals is a proper exercise of
discretion. A genuine belief in the truth of the statement made negates
malice (Horrocks v Lowe [1975] A.C.135).
</p>
<p id="p_63">47.      In Tata Press Ltd. (Supra) the Supreme Court has held             that
commercial speech is a part of freedom of speech and expression




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 20 of 31</span>
 guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_14">article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. An
advertisement was taken to be a species of commercial speech. In
paragraph 23 of the judgment, in the aforesaid case, the Supreme Court
elucidated as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">         ―.....Advertising which is no more than a commercial
         transaction is nonetheless dissemination of information
         regarding the product advertised. Public at large is
         benefited by the information made available through the
         advertisement. In a democratic economy free flow of
         commercial information is indispensable. There cannot be
         honest and economical marketing by the public at large
         without being educated by the information disseminated
         through advertisements. The economic system in a
         democracy would be handicapped without there being
         freedom of ―commercial speech‖...‖

</blockquote><p id="p_64">48.      Nonetheless what is important is that such commercial speech
should not be false, misleading, unfair, deceptive and which proposes
illegal transactions. Explaining the aforesaid concept, the Supreme Court
in Colgate Palmolive Company &amp; Anr. (Supra) observed that
commendatory expressions may not be serious representations of fact and
some latitude is given in the field of advertising for gaining customers.
The difficulty in identifying the borderline of permissible assertion in
such advertisements which more often than not may not be discernible,
was also admitted.
</p>
<p id="p_65">49.      A Division bench of this Hon'ble Court in Dabur India Ltd.
(Supra) summarized the law and the guiding principles as hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">         ―i) An advertisement is commercial speech and is
         protected by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_15">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">         (ii) An advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair
         or deceptive.
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 21 of 31</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">          (iii) Of course, there would be some grey areas but these
         need not necessarily be taken as serious representations of
         fact but only as glorifying one's product.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_66">50.      To the above extent, such advertisements would have the
protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_16">article 19(1)(a);</a> but any venture outside the permissible
limits of puffery would surely be in the realm of false, misleading, unfair
and deceptive representation and may not be entitled to any constitutional
protection.
</p>
<p id="p_67">51.      A cumulative assessment of the case laws of the subject leads to
the only inescapable conclusion that puffery is permissible but
disparaging a rival product is not. One of the guidelines to be followed
has been provided in Pepsi Co. (Supra) wherein it was held as
hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">         ―(1) The intent of the advertisement--this can be
         understood from its story line and the message sought to
         be conveyed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_21">         (2) The overall effect of the advertisement--does it
         promote the advertiser's product or does it disparage or
         denigrate a rival product?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">         In this context it must be kept in mind that while
         promoting its product, the advertiser may, while
         comparing it with a rival or a competing product, make an
         unfavourable comparison but that might not necessarily
         affect the story line and message of the advertised product
         or have that as its overall effect.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">         (3) The manner of advertising--is the comparison by and
         large truthful or does it falsely denigrate or disparage a
         rival product? While truthful disparagement is
         permissible, untruthful disparagement is not permissible.‖


</blockquote><p id="p_68">52.      In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties in the present
case, it would also be necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Code




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 22 of 31</span>

</blockquote><p id="p_69">53.      Comparative advertising can be done if goods and services are
towards meeting the same needs or are intended for the same purpose.
But, for sure, competitors, while comparing, cannot mislead. If an
advertisement deceives or is likely to deceive a person to whom it is
addressed or who is attracted and which, by reason of its deceptive nature
is likely to affect his economic behaviour or which for those reasons
injures or is likely to injure a competitor, would be treated as a
misleading advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_70">54.      On a careful perusal of the impugned advertisement (text and
video, both), not from the view point of an intelligent consumer who is in
a position to identify hyperbole and rhetoric but from the view point of a
sensitive/gullible and unsuspecting customer, we are of the view that the
razor shown in the impugned advertisement has neither been identified
directly or indirectly as one of the products of the plaintiff. In the
impugned advertisement, a generic razor is shown which cannot be
correlated to a women's razor and specifically to the plaintiff's product
which is claimed to be disparaged. Even the shape and the design of the
razor used in the advertisement is dissimilar to the product of the
plaintiff. The identification of the product which is claimed to be
disparaged with the one shown in the advertisement is one of the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                  Page 24 of 31</span>
 prerequisites for an actionable wrong for denigration or disparagement. It
would be an overreach to claim monopoly over blue colour and therefore
we feel that the restraining order passed by the learned single Judge with
regard to the blue coloured razor was not warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_71">55.      <a href="/doc/62246857/" id="a_17">In Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. V. Hindustan Unilever
Limited</a>,151 (2008) DLT 650, the product claimed to be denigrated was
sought to be identified through the colour blue but the Court was of the
opinion that the product sought to be denigrated could not be identified
by the colour only. In the aforesaid case, the product was HARPIC, a
toilet cleaner, which is identifiable as ―blue and thick‖ whereas what was
represented in the advertisement was ―blue but thin‖. The designs of
VENUS and SIMPLY VENUS are different from the razor which has
been shown in the impugned advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_72">56.      The reliance of the learned single Judge on an earlier proceeding
initiated by the defendant (CS(OS) No. 3190/2015) is not apt for drawing
a comparison of the present case with the earlier proceeding initiated by
the defendant against the plaintiff wherein the plaintiff was prevented
from using the same colour of the spatula in the impugned advertisement
(of CS(OS) No. 3190/2015) which was of the same colour as the spatula
of the defendant. In the aforesaid case, the present plaintiff had admitted
on affidavit that they were showing the exact product i.e. the VEET
spatula. Therefore there was a direction for change of the colour of the
spatula at the interlocutory stage. In the present case, the shape of the
razor is absolutely different and the colour of the products of the plaintiff
are also different.
</p>
<p id="p_73">57.      We, therefore, set aside the ad interim injunction against the
defendant of using a blue-coloured razor in the advertisement.
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                   Page 25 of 31</span>
<p id="p_74"> 58.      However for fair play, the defendant is directed to increase the font
size by 2 points in the disclaimer which should be printed in bold letters.
It should also clearly indicate that the image shown in the advertisement
is a man's razor.
</p>
<p id="p_75">59.      We do not approve of the complete restraint over the defendant
from claiming, in the advertisement, that hair removal by using the
depilatory cream of the defendant (VEET) ―leaves the skin up to two
times smoother than razors‖ for the following reasons:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">      a. The plaintiff has admitted that men's razors are not appropriate for
         use by women [―refer to the message on the website of VENUS -
         When it comes to shaving, men may be from Mars, but for women,
         it's all Venus. Sure, men and women both want the kind of smooth
         skin they get with a perfect shave but Venus understands that
         women's shaving needs are different and call for a different kind of
         razor.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">         Then there's the way that men and women shave. Most men shave
         at the sink, in front of a mirror. Many women, though, find it easier
         to shave in the shower, where they can't see everything they're
         trying to reach (like the backs of knees).They have to depend on the
         feel of the razor to get the job done. Plus, women tend to move

         ankles and knees.

      b. In a previous advertisement of VEET, the tagline of the
         advertisement ―don't shave it...VEET it‖ was objected to by the
         plaintiff before the ASCI, which objection was overruled.
      c. The plaintiff, on its website has explained the advantages of
         depilatory cream over razor by stating ―depilatory creams work by
         dissolving the hair shaft, leaving a round edge at the skins surface -
         so regrowth appraise to be softer and take longer than after
         shaving. No risks of nicks and cuts.‖ (refer to pg. 310 of vol. 2 of
         FAO (OS) No. 185/2016)

</blockquote><p id="p_76">60.      However, the learned Single Judge is correct in observing that an
independent agency maybe appointed by a court for the purposes of
giving a report, before any definitive conclusion could be arrived at as to
whether the contention of the defendant of the hair removal by depilatory
cream Veet would leave the skin ―up to two times smoother‖ as compared
to the process of hair removal by a razor. The extent of the comparison
between the product of the plaintiff and the defendant with regard to the
degree to which the skin remains smoother borders on misrepresentation
as it is not based on any objective analysis.
</p>
<p id="p_77">61.      Hence, the order of the learned Single Judge is modified to the
extent that the defendant is restrained from claiming in the impugned
advertisement that the hair removal would leave the skin ―up to two
times‖ smoother than razors and is permitted to advertise only ―leaves the
skin smoother than razors‖.

<p id="p_78"> 62.         The argument on behalf of the plaintiff that the impugned
advertisement denigrates razors in general for causing "stubble trouble"
and comparisons showing razors being used without foam and on darker
skin to mislead the consumers to believe that razors cause skin darkening
was not accepted by the learned single Judge. The reasons have been
explained by him as hereunder:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">         ―10(i) That takes us to the issue as to whether the plaintiff
         is justified in claiming that in the advertisement by
         showing differences in the colour of the skin of dark when
         shown with the use of razor and fair when used with
         cream, hence it is to be implied that using of a razor leads
         to dark and uneven skin whereas use of hair removing
         cream leads to fairer skin and which is a misrepresentation
         and a false statement in the impugned advertisement.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">         (ii) This aspect pleaded by the plaintiff however in my
         opinion doesnot necessarily emerge on account of fleeting
         glimpses of a dark and a fair skin in the impugned
         advertisement with the fact that showing of hair removal
         by a razor on a dark skin does not necessarily and in all
         cases lead to a necessary conclusion that what is intended
         to be shown by the advertisement is that the use of a razor
         causes dark and uneven skin. This prayer for injunction by
         the plaintiff is therefore rejected.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">         11(i) The next issue is as to whether the plaintiff can claim
         an injunction against the defendant that defendant in the
         impugned advertisement is showing that use of a razor can
         leave stubble.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">         (ii) In this regard, counsel for the plaintiff places reliance
         upon the report of M/s Nielsen dated 24.12.2014 showing
         that use of the plaintiff's razor leads to smooth arms and
         legs i.e. no stubble is left. It is seen that this report of M/s
         Nielsen is the report of an agency commissioned at the
         instance of the plaintiff and therefore it cannot be said to
         be a report of a third party neutral agency. Reliance placed
         by the plaintiff on other reports does not help the plaintiff
         because those reports only state that use of the razor does
         not necessarily lead to faster or thicker hair growth after
         shaving. As also stated immediately hereinafter that there
         are various pros and cons of both the products of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">FAO (OS) Nos.185/2016 &amp; 206/2016                                        Page 28 of 31</span>
          parties and that use of the products may or may not leave
         stubble depending on various aspects and persons as
         detailed below. Plaintiff therefore cannot be granted
         injunction that defendant be restrained from claiming in
         its impugned advertisement that use of a razor leaves a
         stubble.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">         12. I may note that both the parties to the suit are rivals
         to each other. Products in question are different
         alternatives for hair removals. It goes without saying that
         unless there are exhaustive tests and reports of various
         neutral laboratories it cannot be confidently said today one
         way or the other as to whether or not the use of razor
         leaves stubble or not that a hair removal cream is twice as
         good as a razor. There are many ifs and buts and
         variations whether of use of a razor or a hair removing
         cream, in as much as, one method may be suited to one set
         of individuals/ladies whereas another method may be
         suited to another set of individuals/ladies. Also a lot
         depends upon how a razor or a hair removing cream is
         used including the type of skin of a particular lady, the
         type of hair of a lady i.e. hard or soft or the amount
         thereof or the positioning of the hair on the body and
         issues of any individual specific allergies etc. Possibly
         therefore both the parties to the present suit are saying
         something which may or may not turn up to be ultimately
         correct, or may or may not to be false, and the statements
         may or may not be only partially true/partially false i.e. a
         statement on any of the aforesaid issues which are called
         for decision may not be absolute but would be conditional
         on many factors and hence what are the exact conditions
         to be laid down for airing of an advertisement or non-
         airing of the same or in what manner the same is to be
         done whether it amounts to falsehood or disparagement
         are aspects which will be decided finally at the stage of
         hearing of the injunction application. For the present, the
         limited interim orders which are issued in favour of the
         plaintiff while declining other reliefs, and as an interim
         measure, will sufficiently protect the rights of the parties
         to the present suit inasmuch as there cannot be a perfect
         solution at this stage of the matter till completion of
         pleadings as also having reports of neutral and
         independent laboratories/agencies on various aspects of

          the matter qua the products of the plaintiff and the
         defendant‖
</blockquote><p id="p_79">63.      The learned Single Judge has taken into account the fact that an
advertisement is normally viewed in the perspective of the impression
obtained by an average person with imperfect recollection.
</p>
<p id="p_80">64.      We are in agreement with the opinion of the learned single Judge
that the above aspects of the advertisements do not disparage or denigrate
the product of the competitor plaintiff. By no stretch of imagination can it
be said that the aforesaid contents of the impugned advertisement has
rubbished the image of the plaintiff's product while the defendant
promoted its own product.
</p>
<p id="p_81">65.      Thus for the foregoing reasons we deem it appropriate to dispose of
both the appeals (FAO(OS) 185/2016 and FAO(OS) 206/2016) by
partially modifying the order of the learned single Judge in the following
terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">      a. Injunction against the defendant for using a blue coloured razor in
         the advertisement is set aside. However, the defendant is directed
         to increase the font size by two points in the disclaimer which shall
         be printed in bold letters in the advertisement, clearly indicating
         that the image shown in the advertisement is a man's razor.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      b. The injunction against the defendant of not using the phrase
         ―leaves skin up to two times smoother‖ is modified and the
         defendant is only restrained from claiming in the impugned
         advertisement that its product (depilatory cream) would leave the
         skin ―up to two times smoother‖ than razors. The words ―up to
         two times‖ is thus required to be removed from the impugned
         advertisement.

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">       c. The order of the Learned single judge refusing to grant injunction
         against the defendant regarding ―stubble trouble‖ and comparison
         showing razors being used without foam, on a darker skin which
         according to the plaintiff, has the tendency to mislead the
         consumers to believe that razors cause skin darkening, is hereby
