<p id="p_1">I.A. 13934/2018
</p><p id="p_2">1.    The plaintiffs have instituted this suit for permanent injunction for
restraining the defendants from manufacturing, selling, distributing,
exporting or offering for sale of any product that infringes the plaintiffs‟
patent No. 215528 including Lorcaserin or any of its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts including Lorcaserin Hydrochloride (hereinafter referred to
as „LH‟) and Lorcaserin Hydrochloride Hemihydrate (hereinafter referred to
as „LHH‟). The plaintiffs are also seeking damages, accounts and costs from
the defendants. In I.A. 13934/2018, the plaintiffs are seeking interim
injunction against the defendants.

<p id="p_3"> 2.    The defendants appeared before this Court on the very first date i.e.
08th October, 2018 to oppose the injunction. The relevant portion of the
order dated 08th October, 2018 is reproduced hereunder:

Plaintiffs' Case
</p><p id="p_5">4.    Plaintiff No.1, a Japanese Pharmaceutical Company, is an exclusive
licensee of Indian Patent No. 215528 whereas plaintiff No. 2 is the patentee
in respect of the aforesaid patent. Plaintiff No.2 claims to have invented a

 man-made molecule named Lorcaserin, not found in nature, around the year
2001. The plaintiff researched and conducted clinical trials and studies for
next eight years on over 8,000 patients. The Phase-III studies were
concluded in 2010. The cardio vascular trials were concluded in 2018 on
over 12,000 patients to establish the safety of Lorcaserin. Lorcaserin has
been studied on over 20,000 patients over the last 15 years. The plaintiffs
claim to have spent almost 18 years and a cost of approximately 1 billion
dollars to develop Lorcaserin molecule and in conducting clinical trials to
commercialize the same.
</p><p id="p_6">5.    Plaintiff no.2 obtained patents in over 65 jurisdictions and the said
patent has not been revoked in any country. In 2006, WHO recognized
Lorcaserin to be a new molecule. From 2010 to 2018, the plaintiff carried
out the mandatory requirements of US Food and Drug Administration
(USFDA). Marketing approvals have been granted in six countries namely
USA, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Brazil and Mexico.
</p><p id="p_7">6.    The plaintiff applied for patent in India on 23 rd September, 2004 in
pursuance to which patent No.215528 was granted on 27 th February, 2008
for the period of 20 years i.e. from 11th April, 2003 till 10th April, 2023.
There were no pre-grant oppositions, no post-grant oppositions, no
revocations and in pursuant suit, no counter-claim has been filed. The suit
patent has thus existed undisturbed on the register for more than 10 years.
The plaintiffs have applied for the marketing approval which is yet to be
granted. The plaintiffs have already completed the critical steps towards
regulatory approval for its drug product in India. The plaintiffs expect the
marketing approval to be granted by March, 2019.

<p id="p_8"> 7.      By virtue of grant of the suit patent no. IN215528, the plaintiffs have
the exclusive right to prevent any third party from the act of making, using,
offering for sale, exporting or importing the subject matter of the suit patent
and all its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates or hydrates,
including LHH, as claimed in the suit patent (in particular by Claims 38 and
</p><p id="p_9">39) up to 10th April, 2023.
</p><p id="p_10">8.      In late August, 2018, the plaintiffs found that the defendants were
planning to commercialize Lorcaserin in Indian market. Further online
search revealed that the defendants have filed a US patent application for LH
being US patent application No.14/141, 112. The plaintiffs further found
that the defendants approached the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) for
permission to manufacture and market LH in India. The defendants were
subsequently granted such permission in the SEC meeting of 28 th August,
2018. The plaintiffs promptly filed the present lawsuit on 5 th October, 2018.
</p><p id="p_11">9.      According to the plaintiffs, the defendant‟s product LHH infringes the
plaintiffs‟   patent   No.215528      which    covers    Lorcaserin   and        its
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including LHH, which are specifically
claimed in Claims 38 and 39. According to the plaintiffs, to obtain its
marketing approval in India, the defendants have piggy-backed on the data
generated by the plaintiffs who have spent millions of dollars by carrying
out more than 18 different studies. As opposed to this, the defendants have
carried out limited bioequivalence studies with reference to the plaintiffs‟
drug.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      (ii)    Claims 38 and 39 specifically claim Lorcaserin and all its

      obesity. It binds to receptors in the hypothalamus and activates them
      leading to feeling of satiety.

      possibility of salts being made of the compounds of the invention
      (including that of Lorcaserin) with various acids, including
      hydrochloric acid. Further formations of solvate forms of the
      compounds of the present invention are also disclosed.
</blockquote><p id="p_13">11.   There exists a prima facie case of infringement of the suit patent, in
favour of the plaintiff, especially in view of the following factors:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (i)     The defendants are infringing their patent as Lorcaserin forms
      the major portion of LH and LHH cannot be made without using
      Lorcaserin. The defendants cannot manufacture their product without
      infringing the patents in the first place. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_3">MERCK

              Monohydrate tablet by the defendant itself amounts to

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">             (iii)    The defendants had complete knowledge of the plaintiffs‟
      patent for Lorcaserin in 2014, when the defendants applied for its US
      patent application 2014/0187538A1. The defendants have clearly
      admitted in the said application that the PCT application
      corresponding to the suit patent i.e. WO2003/086306 discloses
      Lorcaserin. The defendants‟ aforesaid application further discloses
      Formula I, which is LH:

favour of the plaintiffs as the defendants has evidently not "cleared the way"

<p id="p_15"> before going ahead with obtaining a marketing approval for launch of the
infringing product. Though the defendants are attempting to take the defense
that the suit patent is invalid, it has till date, even though the suit patent has
been on the Patent Office record for more than 10 years, not taken any steps
to seek invalidation of the suit patent or seek a declaration of non-
infringement.
</p><p id="p_16">13.   The plaintiffs shall suffer irreparably if the injunction is not granted.
On the other hand, the defendants, as per their own admission, obtained
manufacturing approval on 22nd October, 2018 and had not commenced the
manufacturing of the drug at the time of filing of the present suit. An
injunction against the defendants would not cause them any harm or injury
as the infringing drug of the defendants are not yet in the market.
</p><p id="p_17">14.   Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_4">Merck v. Glenmark</a>; 2015 (63) PTC 257
[Del][DB] in which the Division Bench of this Court held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">             "However, if a defendant is aware that there may be a
             possible challenge to its product, but still chooses to release
             the drug without first invoking revocation proceedings or
             attempting to negotiate, that is surely a relevant factor. The
             defendant‟s legal right to challenge the patent at any point
             in time is intact, but that does not mean that this factor
             cannot determine the interim arrangement. This is more so
             where Glenmark today argues that MSD ought to have
             disclosed international patent applications for SPM and
             Sitagliptin plus Metformin since they were the "same or
             substantially the same" as the suit patent under Section 8.
             That is Glenmark‟s stated position. Such being the state of
             things, it is surely reasonable for Glenmark to detect the
             possibility to challenge, when a US patent application for
             SPM filed by it was opposed by MSD. Despite this,
             Glenmark released the drug without initiating revocation
             proceedings under the Act, which is also a right vested in

              Glenmark that would have obviated the need for the interim
             arrangement we are today considering. This does not mean
             that Glenmark‟s right to question the validity of the patent
             in an infringement is affected, but the manner of challenge
             is a relevant factor against it at the interim stage. As Justice
             Jacob noted in both Smithkline Beecham cases (supra):
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">                           "I remain of the same opinion that I was in the
                    Generics case. Where litigation is bound to ensue if
                    the defendant introduces his product he can avoid all
                    the problems of an interlocutory injunction if he
                    clears the way first. That is what the procedures for
                    revocation and declaration of non-infringement are
                    for."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">15.   Reliance is also placed on the following paragraph of Merck v.
</blockquote><p id="p_18">Glenmark (supra) to demonstrate that the non-grant of an injunction in a
strong case of infringement would lead to irreparable injury to the Plaintiff:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">             „This leads us to the second principle, which is whether the
             Court can overlook the public interest in maintaining the
             integrity of the patent system itself, so that a legitimate
             monopoly is not distorted. As this Court noted in Bayer
             Corporation and Ors. v. Cipla, Union of India (UOI) and
             Ors., 162 (2009) DLT 371 "[i]f, after a patentee, rewarded
             for his toil - in the form of protection against infringement -
             were to be informed that someone, not holding a patent,
             would be reaping the fruits of his efforts and investment,
             such a result would be destructive of the objectives
             underlying the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_5">Patents Act</a>. The Court must be mindful -
             especially in a case where a strong case of infringement is
             established, as here - there is an interest in enforcing the
             Act. It may be argued that despite this no injunction should
             be granted since all damages from loss of sales can be
             compensated monetarily ultimately if the patentee prevails.
             This argument though appealing, is to be rejected because a
             closer look at the market forces reveal that the damage can
             in some cases be irreparable.

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">                     This in turn leads to the third principle, which is
             where an infringer is allowed to operate in the interim
             during the trial, it may result in a reduction in price by that
             infringer since it has no research and development expenses
             to recoup - most revenue becomes profit. The patentee
             however can only do so at its peril. Importantly, prices may
             not recover after the patentee ultimately prevails, even if it
             is able to survive the financial setback (or "hit") during the
             interim, which may take some time. The victory for the
             patentee therefore should not be pyrrhic but real."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">16.   The defendants have taken three main defenses in the Written
Statement. The first contention of the defendants is that they are not
infringing the suit patent as the patent does not cover LHH, which is what
the defendants have obtained a marketing approval for. The defendants‟
primary argument is that the plaintiffs have made certain admissions in reply
to oppositions filed by a third party against the plaintiffs‟ subsequent patent
applications concerning LHH, which show that the plaintiffs‟ patent does not
disclose LHH.
</blockquote><p id="p_19">17.   According to the plaintiffs, the above contention is completely
fallacious as it ignores the well-established concepts of basic and
improvement patents. The plaintiffs rely on I. G. Farbenindustrie A.G.'s
Patents; (1930) 47 RPC 289 at page 321:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">             "It may be observed that chemicals patents in recent years
             have consisted of two sharply divided classes. The first class
             is that of patents based on what may be described as an
             originating invention, that is, the discovery of a new
             reaction or a new compound. Such patents may be called
             for brevity "originating patents". The second class
             comprises patents (the so-called selection patents) based on
             a selection of related compounds such as the homologues

              and substitution derivatives of the original compounds
             which presumably have been described in general terms and
             claimed in the originating patent."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">18.   The suit patent is in the nature of an originating/genus patent and the
various subsequent patent applications were for improvement/selection
inventions, which specifically discloses and claims a particular „species‟ of
the genus patent, i.e. the hydrochloride hemihydrate form. Merely because
the plaintiffs have applied for a patent separately for a specific species of the
genus disclosed in the suit patent, does not mean that the species patent
cannot be granted or that the species patent would not fall within the
coverage of the genus patent (i.e. the suit patent in the present case).
</p><p id="p_21">19.   Grant of a subsequent patent, which is an improvement invention,
does not take the said forms out of the first/basic patent, which in the present
case is the suit patent. If the subsequent patent is granted, the pharmaceutical
product in such a case gets covered by two patents and an infringer making
the pharmaceutical patent would infringe two patents. For this, reliance is
placed upon Extract from Pharmaceutical Patent Law by John R, Thomas.
</p><p id="p_22">20.   The plaintiffs further rely on the decision of the Court of Appeals for
England and Wales in Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (UK) Ltd. v Eli Lily, 2010
RPC 9. In this case, Dr.Reddy sought revocation of Eli Lily‟s patent from
Olanzapine drug, stating that the patent of Eli Lily was not novel on the
ground that it was disclosed in a previous patent which disclosed a general
formula. The Court while rejecting the revocation petition of Dr.Reddy held
the following:

              faintly, ridiculous to say that a particular leaf has been
             made available to you by telling you that it is in Sherwood
             Forest. Once identified, you can of course see it. But if not
             identified you know only the generality: that Sherwood

relief of interim injunction. The non-working of the suit patent disentitle the
plaintiffs from any interim relief. The plaintiffs‟ assertion that they will
launch in March, 2019 is misleading. The plaintiffs have admittedly applied
for approvals only in November, 2018 and December, 2018. As per statutory
timelines prescribed by Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_24">Cosmetics Act</a>, 1940, it takes around 12-
18 months from the time of application to obtain approvals for launching a

Parhate, Director (Regulatory Affairs) of defendants‟ company on timelines
for grant of regulatory approvals. Thus, as per the statutory timelines, the
plaintiffs would not be in a position to launch by March, 2019, which is just

defendant no.2 is not infringing the suit patent.

motivated, suggested, disclosed, enabled or covered by the patent. Patent
monopoly is granted to an individual in exchange of the invention being
made public so that at the end of the patent term, the invention may belong
to the people at large who may derive benefits from it. Mere claims, without
an enabling disclosure, cannot be sustained. The patent must - as a quid pro
quo for the grant of monopoly - enable a Person of Ordinary Skill in the Art
(POSA) to work the invention as claimed. What is covered by a patent can
only be limited to what is disclosed in the patent. Such disclosure has to be
such as to enable a POSA to make the invention. If such disclosure is
lacking, the invention will not be covered by the patent. Coverage cannot go
beyond disclosure. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_25">Novartis AG v. Union of India</a>
2013 (6) SCC 1, <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_26">Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corporation v.Glenmark

Claim 1 of the suit patent discloses a Markush structure which covers
thousands, if not millions, of compounds. Lorcaserin is one such compound.
Admittedly, Lorcaserin is oil, which, in the context of pharmaceuticals, is
difficult to process, handle and formulate. Claim 38 generally covers all
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and hydrates of Lorcaserin. As per
plaintiffs, at least 1620 salts of Lorcaserin can be made from the general

 disclosures made in the suit patent. However, pertinently neither LH/LHH
salt nor the process for making LH/LHH salt has been disclosed in the suit
patent. Since the defendants‟ product is LHH and not Lorcaserin, and since
the suit patent does not cover LH / LHH, the defendants‟ product does not
infringe the suit patent. The suit patent discloses 31 acids as general
examples of acids that may be used to make "pharmaceutically acceptable
salts" of Lorcaserin. Unlike the Merck's (supra) case where certain acids
were specifically disclosed as „preferred acids‟ thereby providing necessary
motivation to POSA to make the salt, the plaintiffs have specifically and
categorically admitted before the Patent Office that LH / LHH is not taught,
suggested or motivated from the suit patent. When the Indian Patent Office
raised an objection during the prosecution of the Plaintiffs‟ application for
LHH (2296/KOLNP/2007) on the ground that LHH is obvious from the suit
patent, the plaintiffs‟ itself admitted that there is nothing in the suit patent
that teaches, motivates or suggests to a POSA to specifically select or make
LH/LHH from the general examples of acids disclosed in the suit patent. On
the contrary, the plaintiffs‟ own position is that the Lorcaserin disclosed in
the suit patent is distinct from LH, which is a specific salt form of a specific
compound that has been claimed by plaintiffs in a separate subsequent
application 311/KOLNP/2009.
</p><p id="p_40">37.   It is important to highlight that the plaintiffs are taking contradictory
stands - asserting before this Court that LH / LHH are covered and disclosed
in the suit patent, and specifically asserting before the Patent Office that
LH/LHH are distinct and different from Lorcaserin/suit patent and are not
taught, suggested or motivated by the suit patent. While in principle a single
product may be covered by different patents, a patentee cannot keep shifting

 its stand in litigation before a Court and in prosecution before the Patent
Office. It is reiterated that the plaintiffs have been changing their position as
per their convenience - while on the one hand they are asserting before this
Court that the suit patent can be asserted to injunct a LH or LHH, on the
other hand they have taken a categorical position in various replies to pre-
grant oppositions and to FER before the Patent Office that LH and LHH are

also filed pre-grant oppositions to the 311 application on 29th October, 2018,
2296 application on 06th November, 2018 and the 1208 application on 11th
October, 2018. Thus, the defendants have the highest respect for patent
rights and are very conscious of ensuring that its products do not infringe
any patent.
</p><p id="p_46">42.   Defendant No.2 has undertaken considerable effort and expenses to
conduct clinical trials, and has obtained marketing approvals for their
product, as against the plaintiffs who are a foreign patent owner/foreign
licensee and who have failed, despite passage of more than 15½ years of the
life of the patent (almost 11 years from the date of grant of the suit patent) to
even file for regulatory approvals, let alone marketing approvals to work or
commercially launch the Lorcaserin free base or its enantiomers, or even
LH or the hemihydrate form of LH in India. For obtaining marketing
approvals for India, clinical trials have to be conducted on Indian patients.
The plaintiffs‟ BELVIQ (containing LHH) was approved on 27th June, 2012
in USA. The plaintiffs‟ claim to have conducted studies in 12,000 patients,
however, not a single Indian patient was enrolled in any of these clinical

 trials. This clearly shows that the plaintiffs never gave importance to making
their product available to the Indian patients. On the other hand, the
defendants have undertaken considerable effort and expenses to conduct
clinical trials in India, and to obtain marketing approvals for their product:

<p id="p_47">      Assuming but not conceding that the defendants' product is within the
scope of the suit patent, it is submitted that the balance of convenience is in
favour of the defendants; the defendants have undertaken considerable effort
and expenses to conduct clinical trials and obtain marketing approvals for
their product; the defendants had initiated process for approvals for clinical
trials in 2016 and approvals for the trials were granted in November, 2016.
The plaintiffs, on the other hand, have failed to work the Suit Patent at all or
even file for regulatory approvals, despite passage of more than 15½ years
of the life of the suit patent or almost 10½ years from the date of grant of the
suit patent. The plaintiffs are merely sitting on their patent registration,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS (COMM) 1169/2018                                                Page 23 of 37</span>
 thereby stifling further innovation and depriving the Indian public of the
critical and useful properties of the suit patent. The plaintiffs have evidently
registered the suit patent to the very detriment of the Indian consumers,
without any intention to make available the benefits of the suit patent to the
Indian public. Assuming but not conceding that the defendants‟ product is
within the scope of the suit patent, it is submitted that grant of an injunction
in favour of the plaintiffs, would cause irreparable harm not only to the
defendants, but also to the concerned patient pool in India. Admittedly, the
plaintiffs have not commercially worked the suit patent in India at all, let
alone make it available to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the Indian
public or at reasonably affordable prices. Further, the plaintiffs own product
as available in other countries is priced at roughly INR 312/- per tablet,
whereas the defendants‟ product is likely to be priced around INR 29/- per
tablet. Furthermore, per the plaintiffs‟ admission, the alleged loss that will
be caused to them is that of loss of "substantial sales" and "goodwill and
reputation". It is submitted that the plaintiffs have no commercial presence
or sales in respect of the suit patent in India, whatsoever. Thus, there can be
no loss that cannot be compensated.
</p><p id="p_48">43.   The plaintiffs have obtained a patent monopoly to purportedly protect
their rights but have miserably failed in their corresponding duties and
obligations imposed by the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_50">Patents Act</a> to satisfy the reasonable
requirements of the Indian public, or to make available the patented
invention to the Indian public or work the patented invention in India within
a reasonable time of the grant of the patent.

<p id="p_50"> working and lack of making availability the patented invention and the
possible injunction, is incalculable. No final judgment will be able to
restitute and compensate such patients. In cases involving pharmaceutical
products, particularly life-saving drugs, public interest plays a major factor
in deciding grant or rejection of interim relief. As per the plaintiffs own
assertion, obesity is a life threatening disorder. Obesity is a rising health
concern in India, wherein around 153 million individuals suffer from
abdominal obesity and about 135 million individuals suffer from generalized
obesity. In fact, as of 2016, India was in the top five most obese countries in
the world. Obesity is a major risk factor for Type-II diabetes, hypertension,
heart attack, stroke and certain forms of cancer. Thus, there is evident public
interest involved herein that far outweighs the Plaintiffs‟ request for relief.
Public interest demands that a life-saving drug like the patented invention
ought to be made available to the largest number of people and at affordable
prices. The plaintiffs ought not to be permitted to restrain the manufacture
and sale of such a life-saving drug under the garb of the suit patent, which
the plaintiff anyways itself is not working in India. The public interest in
providing access to a life-saving drug at low cost clearly outweighs the
public interest in granting a monopoly to the plaintiffs over the said drug.
</p><p id="p_51">45.   Since the plaintiffs have not made available the patented invention or
even worked the patent in India till date, there is no question of any harm, let
alone any irreparable harm being caused to them. The alleged loss and
irreparable harm that would be caused to the plaintiffs is that of substantial
sales and revenue and profits, which is clearly calculable and determinable.
In the event, the plaintiffs succeed in the instant case, the loss of sales or




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CS (COMM) 1169/2018                                               Page 25 of 37</span>
 revenue or profit can clearly be compensated based on the defendant No.2‟s
sales records.
</p><p id="p_52">46.   The plaintiffs have obtained marketing approvals in the US for their
product „BELVIQ‟, which purportedly contains Lorcaserin, as far back as
27th June, 2012 and commercially launched it in the US in June 2013.
Admittedly, plaintiff No.2 entered into a marketing and supply agreement
with the plaintiff No.1 as far back as November, 2013, which became an
exclusive license arrangement in December, 2016. However, it is evident
that not only did the plaintiffs not take any steps, if at all, till November,
2013 to even consider working the suit patent in India, but it is also evident
that even after the exclusive rights in the suit patent were acquired by the
plaintiff No.1, no steps have been taken till date to work out and exploit the
suit patent in India. The plaintiffs cannot be permitted to sit on a patent
monopoly and refuse to let the Indian public have the benefit of the patented
invention, particularly at reasonably affordable prices. The plaintiff is a
squatter of patents. The plaintiffs have asserted that over 65 countries have
granted patents for invention claimed in the suit patent. However, despite
having patents in more than 65 countries, the plaintiffs have received
regulatory approvals in only six countries. Further, out of these six countries,
the plaintiffs have launched only in four countries. It has not yet launched in
two countries, despite obtaining approvals more than 2 years ago. This
clearly establishes that the plaintiff is a squatter of patent who only believes
in getting patents but does not intend to exercise them or work them at all in
more than 90% of the jurisdictions where it has obtained a patent.
</p><p id="p_53">47.    The plaintiffs have delayed in approaching this Court. The
information about defendants‟ interest in LHH has been in the public domain


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CS (COMM) 1169/2018                                               Page 26 of 37</span>
 since November/December 2016. Yet, the plaintiffs chose to wait for 2 years
till the completion of the clinical trials and grant of approvals to the
defendants to try and stifle the defendants‟ launch at the last moment.
</p><p id="p_54">48.   The submission of the defendants on the suggestion of withdrawal of
defendants‟ products if or when plaintiffs start marketing their product in
India is that LHH is a long-term therapy and once the patients start taking
our medicine, withdrawing the medicine not only impacts the credibility of
defendants but also has negative psychological impact on the patients.
Obesity is a major risk factor for Type-II diabetes, Hypertension, Heart
attack, Stroke and some forms of cancer. In India, about 15.3 crores people
have abdominal obesity and 13.5 crores people have generalized obesity.
There is also a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity in India. In
an overweight or obese population, modest weight loss of 5%-10% can
improve existing comorbid conditions or reduce the risk of developing new
comorbid conditions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
Due to the lack of effective and safe options, a significant proportion of
diagnosed obese patients are not prescribed a pharmacotherapy option.
According to IMS Rx data, less than 10% of patients diagnosed with obesity
are prescribed Orlistat to treat obesity, primarily due to side effects of
Orlistat (Oily spotting on underwear; Fatty or oily stool; Urgent bowel
movements).     Several   anti-obesity   drugs   introduced   in    India    like
Fenfluramine (1998); Dexfenfluramine (1998); Sibutramine (2011);
Rimonabant (2009), have subsequently been withdrawn due to safety
concerns (Year in brackets is DCGI banned year). Rimonabant was
approved by DCGI in 2007 and banned in 2009 (suicidal tendencies). There
is an unmet need of a safe and effective pharmaco-therapeutic agent in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CS (COMM) 1169/2018                                                Page 27 of 37</span>
 treatment of patients with obesity to improve outcomes. The defendants have
already spent more than five years to bring LHH product to Indian patients.
The defendants have spent considerable amount of time, energy &amp; money on
development, clinical trials &amp; approval of LHH for India. Now marketing of
the product would require further efforts, including detailing to top
cardiologist, endocrinologist, dieticians and monitoring the patient response.
'Good Health‟ is always the defendants‟ goal. The defendants see medicines
not just as molecules, but as means to help patients regain their health. As a
leader in the pharmaceutical industry, defendants realize that they have the
ethical and moral imperative to ensure good health that can be delivered to
those who need it, and to promote wellness among them. Helping patients
manage disease better is one of the defendants‟ goals. They look at business
as an opportunity to serve the patients. Thus, defendants would never agree
to launch a product for short-term gains if it has negative repercussion on
patients.

Findings
</blockquote><p id="p_57">50.   The plaintiffs have made out a strong prima facie case for grant of
interim injunction against the defendants for the reasons given hereunder:-
50.1 Plaintiff No.2 claims to have invented a man-made molecule named
Lorcaserin around the year 2001. The plaintiff further claims to have
researched and conducted clinical trials and studies for the next eight years
on over 8,000 patients; Phase-III studies were concluded in 2010; cardio
vascular trials were concluded in 2018 on over 12,000 patients to establish
the safety of Lorcaserin; Lorcaserin has been studied on over 20,000
patients over the last 15 years and almost 18 years approximately one billion
dollars have been spent in developing Lorcaserin molecule and in
conducting clinical trials to commercialize the same.
50.2 Plaintiff no.2 obtained patents in over 65 jurisdictions and the said
patents have not been revoked in any country. Marketing approvals have
been granted in six countries namely USA, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel,
Brazil and Mexico. In 2006, WHO recognized Lorcaserin to be a new
molecule. From 2010 to 2018, the plaintiff carried out the mandatory
requirements of US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).

 (suit patent) there is explicit and unambiguous disclosure of hydrochloride
salt of Lorcaserin and method of preparing thereof.
</p><p id="p_62">50.9 With respect to the defendants‟ objection that the plaintiffs have made
admissions that the plaintiffs‟ patent does not disclose LHH in reply to
oppositions filed by a third party against the plaintiffs‟ subsequent patent
applications concerning LHH, this Court is satisfied with the plaintiffs‟
explanation that the suit patent is in the nature of an originating/genus patent
and the various subsequent patent applications are for improvement/
selection inventions, which specifically disclose and claim a particular
„species‟ of the genus patent, i.e. the hydrochloride hemihydrate form.
Merely because the plaintiffs have applied for a patent separately for a
specific species of the genus, it does not mean that the species patent cannot
be granted or that the species patent would not fall within the coverage of
the genus patent (i.e. the suit patent in the present case). Grant of a
subsequent patent, which is an improvement invention, does not take the
said forms out of the first/basic patent, which in the present case is the suit
patent.
</p><p id="p_63">50.10 The plaintiffs have strongly relied upon the admissions of the
defendants in the statement made before this Court on 22nd December, 2018
&amp; 14th January, 2019 and the US patent application referred in para 11 above
whereas the defendants have strongly relied upon the plaintiffs‟ admission
made in the reply dated 15th January, 2018 and 16th April, 2018. The
plaintiffs have satisfactorily explained the aforesaid admissions referred to
by the defendants whereas this Court is not satisfied with the explanation of
the defendants to their admissions. The admissions of the defendants are
sufficient to grant the injunction against the defendants.

<p id="p_64"> 50.11 With respect to the defendants‟ contention that the plaintiffs have not
worked out the suit patent in India; the defendants had a remedy to seek a
compulsory License under <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_53">Sections 83</a> and <a href="/doc/799603/" id="a_54">84</a> of the Patents Act, 1970.
However, the defendants, instead of applying for either a voluntary license
or a compulsory license, decided to go ahead on their own volition and seek
a marketing approval. The non-working of a patent particularly for a
pharmaceutical product cannot have a bearing on the rights of a patentee
under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_55">Section 48</a> of the Patents Act, 1970. Reference be made to <a href="/doc/56225903/" id="a_56">Cipla v.
Novartis</a>; 2017 (Supra).

by the defendants related to a special kind of loom which was vital for the
textile industry of the country and which would affect the economy of the
country, thereby seriously affecting the market and economy. The Court, in
the said case, found that if the plea for injunction was accepted then it would
seriously affect the market and economy conditions in our country inasmuch
as it would enable a mechanical device invented abroad (or in India) to be
registered in India and kept unused thereby excluding public of its benefit
and at the same time preclude the similar device being produced or used in
our market or industry. In that case, the defendants‟ products were already
out in the market. Moreover, this case is prior to 2005 and there have been
significant changes in the compulsory licensing regime under <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_58">Sections 83</a>
and <a href="/doc/799603/" id="a_59">84</a> of the Patents Act, as a result of the amendment to the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_60">Patents Act</a> in

</p><p id="p_67">51.   The balance of convenience for the grant of interim injunction lies in
favour of the plaintiffs as the defendants have evidently not "cleared the
way" before going ahead with obtaining a marketing approval for launch of
the infringing drug. The defendants were aware that there may be a possible
challenge to its product, but they chose to go ahead to seek the marketing
approvals without first invoking revocation proceedings or attempting to
obtain a licensee. Where litigation is bound to ensue if the defendants
introduce their product, the defendants could have avoided the interlocutory
injunction if they had cleared the way first. Reference be made to <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_69">Merck v.
Glenmark</a>; 2015 (63) PTC 257 [Del][DB].
</p><p id="p_68">52.   The plaintiffs shall suffer irreparably if the injunction is not granted.
On the other hand, the defendants obtained manufacturing approval on 22nd
October, 2018 and have not commenced the manufacturing of the infringing
product. If the defendants are permitted to market its product pending trial,
the loss to the plaintiffs cannot be compensated in terms of the money.
</p><p id="p_69">53.   The Court, at the interim stage, has to take a prima facie view of the
matter. In that view of the matter, the dissection and analysis of all the
submissions is not warranted at this stage.

</p><p id="p_71">54.   In the facts and circumstances of this case, the application is allowed
and the defendants are restrained from making, using, selling, distributing,
advertising, exporting, offering for sale, and in any other manner, directly or
indirectly dealing in any product that infringes the claimed subject matter of
the Plaintiffs‟ Indian Patent No.215528 or any of the claims thereof

thereof till the disposal of the suit.
</p><p id="p_72">55.    The plaintiffs are entitled to the costs from the defendants. However,
the order as to quantum of costs is deferred till the final decision of this suit.
Both the parties are directed to submit the actual cost incurred by them. The
parties are also directed to submit their estimate of future cost before the
commencement of trial so that the parties shall have notice of actual cost that
the other side estimate would be incurring in the course of litigation and the
parties have an opportunity to take appropriate decision as to manner in
which to conduct the litigation. Greater transparency about cost will promote
access to justice.     This process shall also keep the cost in check and
potentially eliminate the need for a detailed assessment at the end as well as
dispute as to the amount of the actual cost.
