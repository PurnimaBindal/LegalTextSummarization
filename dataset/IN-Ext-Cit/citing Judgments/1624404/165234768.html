3.     It has been strongly contended   on behalf of the State by 

       the Ld. Sr. PP for the CBI  that this is a corruption case, in 

       which,   the   convicts   have   been   convicted   of   white   collar 

       crime.  That they operated as an organised racket and have 

       caused   illegal   huge   pecuniary   loss   to   the  Canara   Bank, 

       Maya Puri Branch, a  Govt. of India  Undertaking.     That 

       they have cheated the said bank  and caused wrongful loss, 

       in or around the year 2001, to the tune of Rs. 36.36 lakhs 

       after  loan   of  Rs.50   lakhs (Rs.25   lakhs +  Rs.25  lakhs)  was 

       fraudulently got sanctioned to the convicts (A­2) and (A­3). 

       They   have,   therefore,   caused   wrongful     loss   of   public 

       money, of the said amount.  It has further been stated that 

       the amount, to the extent to which the Government has 

       been   cheated,   was   not   a   small   amount   as   the   banking 

       fraud in question  pertains to the year 2001, when it was a 

       sizable and fat   amount. The loss might have swelled up 

       and overgrown to more than Rs. One Crore, by now.

           

4.     The   State   has   further   contended   that   the   maximum 

       prescribed   substantive   punishment   with   heavy   fine   be 

       handed   over   to   the   convicts,   so   that   enough   and   clear 

       message goes to one and all and especially to the potential 

       offenders,   who   are   in   the   waiting   to   commit   such   like

       banking fraud so that the punishment act as a deterrence 

       and the intent  of the legislature is fulfilled. It has also been 

       urged   that   suitable   compensation   be   awarded   to   the 

       complainant/victim (which is the public in this case).

       himself,   has   also   been   afflicted   with   various   health 

       problems.   That he has faced long trial.    That he is not a 

       previous convict.

       mother of 85 years. That he has one unmarried  daughter, 

       aged about 25 years. That he is the only male member in 

       the family to support his family. That he, himself, had also

13.    The contentions, raised by the the convicts, have met stiff 

       and very strong opposition on behalf of the State.   It has 

       been   urged   that   convict,  N.   Rajaram,   the   then   public 

       servant,   has   been   convicted,   as   he   had   illegally   and 

       dishonestly processed, recommended and got sanctioned 

       loans/Cash Credit Limits on the basis of false, forged and 

       fraudulent documents in the year 2001, when it was quite 

       a big sum.     It has, further, been   stated on behalf of the 

       State   that     being   a   public   servant   at   the   relevant   time, 

       convict   N.   Rajaram   acted   corruptly   with   full   vigour,   in 

       processing  and recommending for sanction of loan and, 

       then in the quick withdrawal of the loan money for being 

       eaten up by  the  other convicts.      It has,  therefore, been 

       urged that this convict   has played  vital and  key role  in 

       cheating and defrauding the bank while using forged and 

       fabricated   documents   and   deserves                                      exemplary 

       punishment. 



14.    Regarding the convicts,  Ashok Kumar Singhal  (A­2) and 

       Neeraj Kumar  (A­3),  it is stated that they were the main 

       misuser   of   the   fraudulently   obtained   loan   amount   and 

       were   the   key   perpetrators   of   the   offences   committed   in

       this case.  That they  pocketed the loan money, to which, 

       they   were   not   legally   entitled   to.     They     successfully 

       cheated the public sector bank i.e. Canara Bank, Maya Puri 

       Branch, N. Delhi, alongwith  other convicts while forging 

       various   documents   and   using   those   documents   and 

       offering impersonated guarantor with fake title deed.  That 

       they are not entitled to any mercy or compassion. 



15.    Regarding the convicts,  Raj Kumari (A­5)  it is stated that 

       she   impersonated   herself   as   Swarn   Lata   and   gave     false 

       address.     She     forged   the   signature   of   Swarn   Lata     and 

       submitted/used the forged documents in the bank.   She, 

       thus,   cheated   the   public   sector   bank   i.e.   Canara   Bank, 

       Maya Puri Branch, N. Delhi, alongwith other convicts.  She 

       is also not entitled to any mercy or compassion.



16.    Similarly, it is stated that convict Hukum Chand Garg was 

       involved with full amplitude in the conspiracy and that in 

       pursuance to the systematic and well­planned conspiracy 

       with   other   co   convicts,   he   fabricated     false   report   and 

       acted   in   connivance   with   other   convicts   in   this   case   to 

       cheat the bank while using forged and fabricated title deed 

       and house tax receipt, etc.

17.    Regarding the convicts, Ram Das Gupta (A­7) and Manish 

       Gupta (A­8) it is stated that they were the Directors of M/s 

       Shree  Ram  Polychem  P Ltd.  and  got  issued  fraudulently 

       two Letters of Credits of Rs.11,04,000 and Rs.8,14,000/­ on 

       the   basis   of   false,   forged   and   fabricated   bills   without 

       supplying any   goods and siphoned off the money. Thus, 

       both   of   them  cheated    Canara   Bank   to   the   tune   of  Rs.

       19,18,000/­,  along with convict Ashok Kumar Singhal and 

       Neeraj   Kumar     in   pursuance   to   well   crafted   criminal 

       conspiracy. 



18.    It   is   further   urged   on   behalf   of   the   State   that   the   pleas 

       taken by the convicts   are routine and stock pleas and in 

       any event, in a case under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_33">Prevention of Corruption 

       Act</a>,   these pleas taken   are not considered as mitigating 

       circumstances.     It   has,   therefore,     been     prayed   that 

       exemplary   severe   punishment     be   awarded   to   all   the 

       convicts  herein.

       Subramanyam Swami    Vs. Dr. Manmohan Singh,  2012, 

       AIR(SC) page 1185, has observed that ­:


       "The magnitude of corruption in our public life is  
       incompatible   with   the   concept   of   socialistic 
       secular democratic public.  The duty of the Court

       interpreted and worked out in such a fashion as  
       to strengthen to fight against corruption."


22.    It has further been observed in the aforesaid case that  "In 

       a   situation   where   two   constructions   are   eminently  

       reasonable,  the Court  has to accept  the one  that  seeks  to  

       eradicate  corruption  to the one which seeks to perpetuate  

       it."



23.    It has been held in case reported as  Narendra  Champak 

       Lal Trivedi Vs. State of Gujrat, 2012 (7) SCC page 80 that­: 

       "Corruption at any level does not deserve either  

       sympathy or leniency."  



24.    The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan 

       Vs. Vinod  Kumar,  decided  on,  18th  May,  2012 (Criminal  

       Appeal No. 1887) reiterated   the law laid down in State of 

       J&amp;K   Vs.   Vinay Nanda,  AIR 2001 SC P 611,  and observed 

       that  superannuation of the convict   and the pendency   of  

       criminal  trial  for over a period of time cannot  be treated  a  

       special reason to reduce  the sentence.

                "It   is   a   normal   thing   that   'trial'   of   the 
                person  is   considered     a period  of   'agony'  
                undergone by him.  But  we tend to forget 
                the   agony   of   the   society   and   the 
                complainant   who   dared     lodge   the  
                complaint.   The   entire   purpose   of   the 
                legislature   of   sentencing   the   offenders  
                stands defeated  and that is the one reason  
                that   wages   of   corruption   are   considered  
                more   attractive     in   this   country.     The  
                person caught is not always   a first­timer  
                corrupt.       He   may   have   been   indulging  
                into     corrupt   activities   /   practices   for   a  
                long   number     of   years.       It   is   to   his  
                advantage that the trial is prolonged.   He  
                spends   a   fraction   of   amount,   earned   by 
                corrupt   practices   on   litigation   and 
                professionals     to   see   that   ultimately     he  
                makes     Criminal     Justice   System     a  
                laughing stock.   In this process, the entire  
                legislative purpose of punishing a corrupt  
                stands defeated.

                "Corruption by public servant has become  
                gigantic   problem.   It   has   spread 
                everywhere. No facet of public activity has  
                been   left   unaffected   by   the   stink   of

       Maharashtra, AIR 2001 SC 147' the Hon'ble   Apex   Court

        870,  that­:         

        "Corruption in a civilised  society  is a disease like  

        cancer, which  if not detected  in time  is sure to  

        maliganise   the   polity   of   the   country   leading   to 

        disastrous   consequences.   It   is   termed   as   plague 

        which   is   not   only   contagious     but   if     not  

        controlled  spreads like a fire in a jungle. Its virus  

        is   compared   with   HIV     leading   to   AIDS   being  

        incurable.   The socio­political system exposed to  

        such a dreaded   communicable   disease is likely 

        to crumble  under its own weight.  Corruption is  

        opposed   to   democracy     and   social   order,   being  

        not   only   anti   people,   but   aimed   and   targeted

       "If   a   given   transaction   constitutes   two   offences

       application     if   the   transaction     relating   to  

       offences is not  the same  or the facts constituting 

       the two  offences are quite  different. Sentencing

       "In   arriving     at   an   appropriate     sentence,     the

       many factors.   The court must  'recognise, learn

       "When corruption was sought to be eliminated  

       from   the   polity   all   possible   stringent   measures  

       are to be adopted within the bounds of law. One  

       such measure is to provide condign punishment.  

       Parliament   measured  the  parameters     for  such  

       condign punishment and in that process wanted 

       to fix a minimum sentence of imprisonment for  

       giving deterrent impact on other public servants

       precisely the reason why the sentence   was fixed  

       as seven years and directed  that even if the said  

       period  of  imprisonment  need  not  be  given,  the  

       sentence shall not be less than the imprisonment  

       for   one   year.   Such   a   legislative   insistence     is  

       reflection   of   Parliament's   resolve     to   meet  

       corruption   cases   with   very   strong   hand   to   give 

       signals of deterrence as the most pivotal feature  

       of   sentencing   of   corrupt   public   servants.   All  

       public   servants     have   to   face   very   serious  

       consequences.   If on the other hand any public  

       servant     is   given   the   impression   that   if   he  

       succeeds   in   protracting   the   proceedings   that  

       would help him to have the advantage of getting  

       a   very   light   sentence   even   if   the   case   ends   in  

       conviction, its fallout would afford incentive to 

       public   servants   who   were   susceptible   to  

       corruption to indulge in such nefarious practices 

       with   immunity.   Increasing   the   fine   after 

       reducing the imprisonment to a nominal period  

       can also defeat the purpose as the corrupt public 

       servants   could     easily   raise   the   fine   amount  

       through the same means."
