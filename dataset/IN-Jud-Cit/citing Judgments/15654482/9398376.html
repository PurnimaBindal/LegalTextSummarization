</p><p id="p_3">2.    The short facts giving rise to the present Appeal from

Order are that the plaintiff is a private limited company

engaged in the business of manufacturing, marketing and

selling varieties of ceramic items under the Trademark and

trade name &quot;Simero&quot; along with other application in class-19

bearing application no.2936647 and application no.2963106.
</p>
<p id="p_5">Same came to be granted by the Trademark registry in the

respect of the trademark.

are carrying on business in city Morbi and both the products

are available on the same counter/shop. That the defendant

has not challenged the validity of the plaintiff&#x27;s registered

trade mark &quot;Simero&quot;. That the defendant has adopted the

identical and deceptively similar trade mark, which cause

confusion and deception amongst the public at large.

2.5   The plaintiff has filed the suit, inter alia, seeking decree

for   permanent      and   perpetual     injunction    restraining           the

defendant from infringement of plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark &quot;Simero&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_11">and passing of defendants goods as those of plaintiffs. Along

with the plaint, the plaintiff has filed the application Exh.5 for

interim injunction.
</p>


<p id="p_12">2.6   The defendant has filed its reply at Exh.25, inter alia,

denying the contentions of the plaintiff. It is the contention of

the defendant that plaint does not disclose cause of action for

infringement registered trademark as well as passing of the

trade mark &quot;Simero&quot;. It is also contended that defendant has

not commenced the use of trade mark &quot;Simero&quot; and the

plaintiff has filed the suit by suppressing material facts and by

making false and frivolous statement. According to the

defendant, it has yet not commenced business and, therefore,

it cannot be said that the defendant is using the trade mark of

the plaintiff. It is also contended that plaintiff is not the true

proprietor and owner of the trade mark &quot;Simero&quot; as there is

already business entities in the name of &quot;Simero&quot; and,

therefore, plaintiff cannot be said to be lawful proprietor of the

trade mark Simero. It is also contended that it is absolutely in

the business of building material, tiles and ceramic industries

using the trade mark with prefix &quot;sim&quot; and the large number of

persons of business of building materials, tiles and ceramic

industries are using the trade mark with prefix &quot;sim&quot; and,

therefore, plaintiffs trade mark cannot be said to be a

distinctive trade mark. It is also contended that the plaintiff

cannot claim monopoly over a trade mark containing prefix

&quot;sim&quot;. It is also contended that the trade of the plaintiff and

defendant are entirely different. That suffix of the defendant is

Ora, while suffix of the plaintiff is Ero and uncommon suffix

creates natural distinction of plaintiff and defendant&#x27;s trade

mark.
</p>


<p id="p_13">2.7   That the defendant has not infringed the trade mark or

passing of his goods as alleged in the plaint. It is also

contended that plaintiff is not entitled to any equitable relief as

no irreparable loss or injury has been caused to the plaintiff by

the act of the defendant. That the trade mark of the plaintiff

and defendant are virtually different. On all these grounds, it is

prayed to dismiss the suit as well as injunction application.

2.8   The learned trial Court, after hearing both the sides, and

considering the material placed on record rejected the

application for interim injunction filed by the plaintiff.
</p>


<p id="p_15">2.9   Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned trial

Court, the plaintiff has preferred this Appeal from Order

contending that the trial Court has materially erred in passing

the impugned order and has not considered the material

placed on record. It is also contended that the impugned order

of the trial Court is not sustainable in the eyes of law. The

plaintiff has also referred to various judgments in the memo of

appeal and has prayed to allow the present Appeal from Order

by setting aside the impugned order of the trial Court and to

pass necessary order restraining the defendant from using the

trade mark, which is deceptively similar to the trade mark of

the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_19">4.   Learned advocate, Mr.Shah for the appellant-plaintiff has

vehemently submitted that there is no dispute to the fact that

it is the registered proprietor of the trademark &quot;Simero&quot; as

well as prior user of the trademark. According to him, there is

no dispute that both the parties are from the same industry i.e.

ceramic industry. According to him, both the parties are

carrying on business in the same locality i.e. Morbi and, the

class of customer of both the parties is also same. According to

him, the only issue is whether the trademark of both the

parties are similar or not. He has submitted that the trial Court

has passed the impugned order ignoring the provisions of the

Trademark Act as well as the settled principles of law prevalent

with regard to grant or refusal of interim injunction application

in the suit for trademark. He has also submitted that according

to the settled principles of trademark law, the trademark

should be compared as a whole and to compare to similarity

between the two and not the dissimilarity. It is his submission

that learned trial Court has not followed this very basic

principle of law, while passing the impugned order, whereby it

has rejected the interim injunction application of the plaintiff.

4.1   Learned advocate for the plaintiff has submitted that the

trademark of the plaintiff is spelled as &quot;Simero&quot; whereas the

defendant&#x27;s trademark &quot;Simora&quot; and according to him, &quot;sim&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_21">word prefix has been used by both the parties and it is similar

in nature, and there is confusion amongst the public at large.
</p>
<p id="p_22">He has also submitted that this is a ceramic articles. Even

common man is using the same for their necessity. According

to him, this very fact is not properly considered by the trial

Court.
</p>


<p id="p_23">4.2   He has also referred to the application of both the parties

filed before registry, which has been kept in paper book and

tried to show that the &quot;S&quot; is identical and by using the word

&quot;sim&quot;as a prefix, created great confusion in the minds of the

people at large. He has also submitted that the plaintiff has

also produced invoices and advertisements, whereby that the

plaintiff has acquired reputation and goodwill over the

trademark. He has submitted that the trial Court has not

considered all these aspects and mechanically passed the

impugned order, which deserves to be set aside by this Court.

4.3   He has also submitted that the finding of the trial Court is

misconceived, perverse and without application of mind.                          He

has also submitted that the trial Court has observed that &quot;sim&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_25">is generic term on the basis of trademark act as well as

ceramic industry directory. But the word &quot;Sim&quot; is not a generic

term in the ceramic industry. He has also submitted that a

mere report of the trademark is not sufficient to prove third

party claim and, therefore, such report is not evidence to

establish     the    mark   as   generic.       According     to     him,       the

respondent itself has applied with the word &quot;sim&quot; and claimed

monopoly over the word &quot;sim&quot; then the respondent cannot

claim that mark is a generic word. He has also submitted that

by virtue of long use of the trademark &quot;Simero&quot; and the

plaintiff successfully obtained the registration show that the

trademark is still valid and the validity is neither challenged by

the respondent at any point of time and, therefore, the mark is

still valid on the register. According to him, once the mark is

registered, the plaintiff is entitled to protection under Section

28, 29 and 31 of the Trademarks Act, 1999. He has submitted

that the trial Court has lost sight of the provisions of the

Trademarks Act and has passed the impugned order, which is

perverse and arbitrary, which requires interference by this

prayed by the plaintiff, in Exh.5 application. He has relied upon

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      &quot;28. ......................The action for infringement is a
      statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor
      of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the
      exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to
      those goods (Vide<a href="/doc/1056401/" id="a_5"> s. 21</a> of the Act). The use by the
      defendant of the trade mark of the plaintiff is not
      essential in an action for passing off, but is the sine qua
      non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt,
      where the evidence in respect of passing off consists
      merely of the colourable use of a registered. trade mark,
      the essential features of both the actions might coincide
      in the sense that what would be a colourable imitation of
      a trade mark in a passing off action would also be such in
      an action for infringement of the same trade mark. But

      there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an
      action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt,
      make out that the use of the defendant&#x27;s mark is likely to
      deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff&#x27;s
      and the defendants mark is so close either visually,
      phonetically    or   otherwise          and   the     court        reaches
      the .conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
      evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff&#x27;s rights
      are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential
      features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been
      adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get- up,
      packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on
      the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show
      marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin
      different from that of the registered proprietor of the
      mark would be immaterial; whereas in the case of
      passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can
      show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his
      goods from those of the plaintiff.&quot;

     in two particulars, namely (I ) it is concerned&#x27; only
     with one method of passing-off, namely, the use of a
     trade mark, and (2) the statutory protection is
     absolute in the sense that once a mark is shown to
     offend, the user of it cannot escape by showing that
     by something outside the actual mark itself he has
     distinguished his goods from those of the registered
     proprietor. Accordingly, in considering the question of
     infringement the Courts have held, and it is now
     expressly      provided    by       the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_7">Trade       Marks          Act</a>,
     1938, <a href="/doc/340780/" id="a_8">section 4</a>, that infringement takes place not
     merely by exact imitation but by the use of a mark so

     to deceive.&quot;

<p id="p_28">In an action for infringement where the defendant&#x27;s trade
mark is identical with the plaintiff&#x27;s mark, the Court will
not enquire whether the infringement is such as is likely
to deceive or cause&quot; confusion. But where the alleged
infringement consists of using not the exact mark on the
Register, but something similar to. it, the test of
infringement is the same as in an action for passing off in
other words, the test as to likelihood of confusion or
deception arising from similarity of .marks is the same
both in infringement and passing off actions.

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">      &quot;71. From the above discussion, in the light of decided
      cases, it can be broadly stated that in an action for
      infringement of passing off, that crux of enquiry is
      whether mark used by defendant on comparison is
      deceptively similar to that of plaintiff which is likely to
      deceive or cause confusion amongst its buyers. The
      similarity which can cause infringement may be ocular as
      well as phonetic similarity on comparison of two marks,

depending upon the essential feature of the marks in
question. Comparison has to be concerning essential
feature of the marks and not with each and every detail
of each mark to find exact or near exact reproduction.
</blockquote><p id="p_32">The essential feature of a mark is one by which an
average person with imperfect recorrection remembers it
rather by general impression or by some significant
detail than by any photogenic recollection of the while in
visual detail. Test of such enquiry being in the state of
mind of an average buyer of the goods, it is equally
important to consider the class of persons who are likely
to buy the goods bearing the mark, back ground from
which they come, leval of their education and degree of
care they are likely to exercise in purchasing goods.
What degree of resemblance is necessary and in which
field, visual or sound, is from the very nature of things a
matter incapable of a definition a priori. Each case must
depend on its own facts and on the satisfaction of Court
on totality of evidence where words or group of words
are considered essential feature of the mark, than
instead of its visual detail, resemblance in sound or
phonetic similarity will be of prime relevance.

comas. The advertisement of this particular class of
goods          also   gives   prominence       to   word       &quot;xNuU&quot;         in
vernacular script. Thus, the manner in which defendant is
projecting its product in the market leaves little room of
doubt in the mind of buyers that the goods offered to
him are of &#x27;DON&#x27; or &quot;DAWN&quot; mark. Notwithstanding that
there is quite dissimilarity in the visual background of the
packing carton, one cannot say with confidence that a
buyer of average intelligence with imperfect recollection
is not likely to be confused by the manner in which the
mark of defendant is projected to treat it as the trade
mark under which the goods are being sold and
confusion between the two marks is likely to prevail in
his mind. Particularly, keeping in mind that goods in
question         are    hosiery     products    like     banyans           and
underwear of daily use used by thousands of persons
from common milieu scattered all over the country in far
flung areas, with level of common education and
acquaintance with English language, the likelihood of
average buyer discerning differences is spelling of &#x27;DON&#x27;
and &#x27;DAWN&#x27; and difference between their etymological
meaning is little, as was the case in an English Court in
the application. Thomas A Smithy Ltd. (supra). He is
more likely to relate the goods by name &quot;DAWN&quot; than by
pictorial presentation on the package. The very fact that
both the plaintiff and defendant have registered words
&#x27;DAWN&#x27; and &#x27;RUPA&#x27; respectively as their trade marks in
connection with conveying on their trade of hosiery

      name of the brand and not by pictorial background of
      package or label or the device on which the brand mark
      is projected. With all these material on record, the
      conclusion of trial court that the use of word &#x27;DON&#x27; by

      mark in question, is a reasonable conclusion.&quot;

deceptively similar to the Plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark.
</blockquote><p id="p_40">Secondly, the registration of the marks containing the
letters &#x27;NEBI&#x27; is irrelevant for deciding the instant case.
What is required to be considered is whether the mark of
Defendant No. 1 is deceptively similar to the Plaintiff&#x27;s
registered trademark. Under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_19">Section 28</a> of the Trade
Marks Act 1999, the Plaintiff gets an exclusive right to
use its registered trademark and to obtain relief in
respect of infringement of the trademark in the manner
provided by this Act. Further, Defendant No. 1 is not
entitled to contend that there are several trademarks
with the word &#x27;NEBI&#x27; and that the letters &#x27;NEBI&#x27; are
common to the trade. Defendant No. 1 itself having
applied for registration of the mark NEBISTOL which
contains the letters &#x27;NEBI&#x27; is estopped from raising the
said contention. In the case of UltraTech Cement Ltd. Vs.
Alaknanda Cement Pvt. Ltd. (supra) this Court observed,
&quot;Thus, Defendants who have admittedly applied for
registration of the impugned mark containing the word
&quot;Ultratuff&quot; are therefore estopped from contending that
the Plaintiff&#x27;s mark containing the word &quot;UltraTech&quot; is
deceptive or common to the trade and therefore cannot
be registered&quot;. Also, in the case of Neon Laboratories V
Themis Medicare Ltd. (supra) this Court has held as
under:

applied for registration is no longer res integra. the
second action defeats the first argument. This seems to
me logical. A man may well say, &quot;I choose to use this
particular mark because it is my belief that it is common
to our trade and therefore none may claim exclusivity
over it.&quot; It is quite another for him to say &quot;I will contend
in opposition to a claim of exclusivity that the mark I have
adopted is so common to our trade that none may claim
exclusivity, but I will myself nonetheless apply for
registration and thereby mount precisely such a claim to
monopoly, and it matters not that implicit in my
registration application is a self-annihilating contradiction
of my own stand of the mark being commonplace.&quot; There
is a form of estoppel by conduct that applies to such a
defendant. A man may not &#x27;approbate and reprobate&#x27;. He
may take inconsistent stands, but not ones that are
mutually destructive.&quot;
</p>


<p id="p_42">Further, Defendant No. 1 has not produced any evidence
of the parties using the marks containing the word &#x27;NEBI&#x27;.
As held in the case of Corn Products Refining Co. Vs.
Shangrila Food Products (supra), and Pidilite Industries
Ltd. Vs. S.M. Associates (supra) in the absence of any
such       evidence,   the    said       contention       cannot          be
entertained.

<p id="p_43">........

<p id="p_44">25. According to the first Defendant, the mark NEBISTOL
used by the Defendants is dissimilar to the mark

NEBISTAR of the Plaintiff. In my view the marks are
phonetically almost identical. There is phonetic, visual
and structural similarity between the mark NEBISTOL and
NEBISTAR. It is a settled principle of law that the question
of deceptive similarity is to be answered, inter alia, by
considering the two marks as a whole. Splitting of marks
is not permissible. The Defendants&#x27; contention is that the
syllable STAR in the Plaintiff&#x27;s mark, and the same is
different from the syllable &#x27;STOL&#x27; in the Defendant&#x27;s mark
and therefore the marks are not similar. As submitted on
behalf of the Plaintiff such splitting of marks is not
permissible. In the case of Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs.
Satya Deo Gupta (supra) although the said case related
to     the     opposition   proceedings,     the      principles          of
comparison laid down therein are applicable to all cases
where the question of deceptive similarity is to be
considered. In paragraph 9 of its Judgment, the Hon&#x27;ble
Supreme Court held that the critical comparison of the
two marks may disclose some points of difference, but an
unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
recollection would be deceived by the over all similarity
of two marks. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court further
observed that a trademark is the whole thing i.e. the
whole word has to be considered. In that case, the two
marks were AMRIT DHARA and LAXMAN DHARA. The
Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the overall
similarity between the two names was likely to cause
deception or confusion.

</p><p id="p_47">32. The contention of Defendant No. 1 that there are
dissimilarities inter alia qua packing, size of strips, labels,
cartons, etc, is also not sustainable. In this case, the two
marks involved are word-marks NEBISTAR and NEBISTOL.
This is not a case to prevent Defendant No. 1 from using
the packing material or the label. This is a simple case
involving two word-marks and all that is required to be
considered is whether the two marks are deceptively
similar. Once the two marks are held to be deceptively
similar, the differences in packing or price etc. are totally
irrelevant. In any event, such considerations as to the
carton, price, label being different are irrelevant as far as
the claim for infringement is concerned. The Hon&#x27;ble
Supreme Court has in the case of Durga Dutta Sharma
Vs. Navaratna Pharma (supra) held as follows:
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_27">     &quot;28. . ...In an action for infringement, the plaintiff
     must, no doubt, make out that the use of the
     defendant&#x27;s mark is likely to deceive, but where the
     similarity between the plaintiff&#x27;s and the defendant&#x27;s
     mark is so close either visually, phonetically or
     otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that
     there is an imitation, no further evidence is required
     to establish that the plaintiff&#x27;s rights are violated.
     Expressed in another way, if the essential features of
     the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by
     the defendant, the fact that the get-up, packing and
     other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets
     in which he offers his goods for sale show marked

           marks. Now in the present case the applicant, the
           respondent before us, led no evidence as to the user
           of marks with the common element. What had
           happened was that Deputy Registrar looked into his
           register and found there a large number of marks
           which had either &#x27;Gluco&#x27; or &#x27;Vita&#x27; as prefix or suffix in
           it. Now of course the presence of a mark in the
           register does not prove its user all. It is possible that
           the mark may have been registered but not used. It is
           not permissible to draw any inference as to their user
           from the presence of the marks on the register.

rights over the same and the plaintiff is also not the
proprietor of the mark „Ozone‟. The said argument is a
self defeating argument. Firstly, the mark „Ozone‟ is a
registered trade mark in favour of the plaintiff and
secondly        the    defendant         himself       has      applied          for
registration of the trade mark „Ozone‟ in class 41 in
relation to the services as that of the plaintiff. It does not
lie in the mouth of the defendant to contend now that the
mark is a generic mark, in fact the defendant is debarred
from raising such a plea in view of his own conduct. The
said contention is totally misconceived. In the case
of <a href="/doc/1806604/" id="a_30">Automatic Electric Limited v. R.K. Dhawan &amp; Anr</a>., 1999
PTC (19) 81 in para 16, the learned Single Judge of this
Court has observed that the defendant had got their trade
mark &quot;DIMMER DOT&quot; registered in Australia. The fact that
the defendant itself has sought to claim trade proprietary
right and monopoly in &quot;DIMMER DOT&quot;, it does not lie in
their mouth to say that the word &quot;DIMMER&quot; is a generic
expression. User of the word &quot;DIMMER&quot; by others cannot
be a defence available to the defendants, if it could be
shown that the same is being used in violation of the
statutory right of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_71">4.5     As     noted   above,    the      original    defendant            has

abandoned the application. Even if it was not so, the

mere fact that the original plaintiff is having the

registration in his favour, is the sufficient ground to press

into service the provisions of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_34">Section 31</a> of the Act by the

plaintiff. On the reading of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_35">Section 31</a> of the Act and the

registration certificate in favour of the plaintiff, this Court

finds that, the grant of injunction in the facts of the

present case was required and the Court below has

rightly granted it. No interference would be required in

the       impugned      order.      Any       interference             would

consequently negate <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_36">Section 31</a> of the Act. For these

reasons, this Appeal needs to be dismissed.

State of Andhra Pradesh. In this background the appellant
cannot be referred or termed as an honest concurrent
user of the mark `Eenadu&#x27;;
</p>
<p id="p_80">b) The adoption of the words `Eenadu&#x27; is ex facie
fraudulent and mala fide from the very inception. By
adopting the mark `Eenadu&#x27; in the State of Andhra
Pradesh, the appellant clearly wanted to ride on the
reputation and goodwill of the respondent company;

<p id="p_81">c) Permitting the appellant to carry on his business would
in fact be putting a seal of approval of the court on the
dishonest,      illegal     and    clandestine     conduct         of     the
appellant;
</p>
<p id="p_82">d) Permitting the appellant to sell his product with the
mark `Eenadu&#x27; in the State of Andhra Pradesh would
definitely create confusion in the minds of the consumers
because the appellant is selling Agarbathies marked
`Eenadu&#x27; as to be designed or calculated to lead
purchasers to believe that its product Agarbathies are in
fact the products of the respondent company. In other
words, the appellant wants to ride on the reputation and
goodwill of the respondent company. In such a situation,
it is the bounden duty and obligation of the court not only
to protect the goodwill and reputation of the respondent
company        but   also    to    protect   the   interest        of     the

to Kerly (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, Twelfth
Edition, para 16.49), the name under which a business
trades will almost always be a trade mark (or if the
business provides services, a service mark, or both).
Independently of questions of trade or service mark,
however, the name of a business (a trading business or
any other) will normally have attached to it a goodwill
that the courts will protect. An action for passing-off will
then lie wherever the defendant companys name, or its
intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert
business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion
between the two businesses. If this is not made out there
is no case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of
the proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in
which the business may be carried on in the future, and to
its not being carried on precisely as carried on at the date
of   the       proceedings.     Where         there   is   probability          of
confusion in business, an injunction will be granted even
though the defendants adopted the name innocently.

<p id="p_91">9.      It will be useful to have a general view of certain
statutory definitions as incorporated in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_43">Trade Marks
Act</a>, 1999. The definition of trade mark is very wide and
means, inter alia, a mark capable of being represented
graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the
goods or services of one person from those of others.
Mark includes amongst other things name or word also.
Name includes any abbreviation of a name.

</p><p id="p_93">10.     A person may sell his goods or deliver his services
such as in case of a profession under a trading name or
style. With the lapse of time such business or services
associated with a person acquire a reputation or goodwill
which becomes a property which is protected by courts. A
competitor initiating sale of goods or services in the same
name or by imitating that name results in injury to the
business of one who has the property in that name. The
law does not permit any one to carry on his business in
such a way as would persuade the customers or clients in
believing      that   the   goods      or   services     belonging           to
someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does
not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently
or otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and
fair play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the
world of business. Secondly, when a person adopts or
intends to adopt a name in connection with his business
or services which already belongs to someone else it
results in confusion and has propensity of diverting the
customers and clients of someone else to himself and
thereby resulting in injury.

business,          commercial     or     professional        reputation           or
goodwill. So to sell merchandise or carry on business
under such a name, mark, description, or otherwise in
such a manner as to mislead the public into believing that
the merchandise or business is that of another person is a
wrong actionable at the suit of that other person. This
form of injury is commonly, though awkwardly, termed
that of passing off ones goods or business as the goods or
business of another and is the most important example of
the wrong of injurious                 falsehood. The gist of the
conception of passing off is that the goods are in effect
telling        a   falsehood    about          themselves,       are      saying
something about themselves which is calculated to
mislead. The law on this matter is designed to protect
traders against that form of unfair competition which
consists in acquiring for oneself, by means of false or
misleading devices, the benefit of the reputation already
achieved by rival traders.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_96">12.       In Oertli Vs. Bowman (1957) RPC 388, (at page 397)
the gist of passing off action was defined by stating that it
was essential to the success of any claim to passing off
based on the use of given mark or get-up that the plaintiff
should be able to show that the disputed mark or get-up
has become by user in the country distinctive of the
plaintiffs goods so that the use in relation to any goods of
the kind dealt in by the plaintiff of that mark or get up will
be understood by the trade and the public in that country
as meaning that the goods are the plaintiffs goods. It is in
the nature of acquisition of a quasi-proprietary right to the

exclusive use of the mark or get-up in relation to goods of
that kind because of the plaintiff having used or made it
known that the mark or get-up has relation to his goods.
Such right is invaded by anyone using the same or some
deceptively similar mark, get-up or name in relation to
goods not of plaintiff. The three elements of passing off
action are the reputation of goods, possibility of deception
and likelihood of damages to the plaintiff. In our opinion,
the same principle, which applies to trade mark, is
applicable to trade name.
</p>
<p id="p_97">13.     In an action for passing off it is usual, rather
essential, to seek an injunction temporary or ad-interim.
The principles for the grant of such injunction are the
same as in the case of any other action against injury
complained of. The plaintiff must prove a prima facie
case, availability of balance of convenience in his favour
and his suffering an irreparable injury in the absence of
grant of injunction. According to Kerly (ibid, para 16.16)
passing off cases are often cases of deliberate and
intentional misrepresentation, but it is well-settled that
fraud is not a necessary element of the right of action,
and the absence of an intention to deceive is not a
defence        though   proof   of     fraudulent     intention          may
materially assist a plaintiff in establishing probability of
deception. Christopher Wadlow in Law of Passing Off
(1995 Edition, at p.3.06) states that the plaintiff does not
have to prove actual damage in order to succeed in an
action for passing off. Likelihood of damage is sufficient.
The same learned author states that the defendants state

      of mind is wholly irrelevant to the existence of the cause
      of action for passing off (ibid, paras 4.20 and 7.15). As to
      how the injunction granted by the Court would shape
      depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.
      Where a defendant has imitated or adopted the plaintiffs
      distinctive trade mark or business name, the order may
      be an absolute injunction that he would not use or carry
      on business under that name. (Kerly, ibid, para 16.97).&quot;

under:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      &quot;13. The next question is would the principles of trade
      mark law and in particular those relating to passing off
      apply? An action for passing off. as the phrase &quot;passing
      off itself suggests, is to restrain the defendant from
      passing off its goods or services to the public as that of
      the plaintiff&#x27;s. It is an action not only to preserve the
      reputation of the plaintiff but also to safeguard the public.</blockquote>
<p id="p_99">      The defendant must have sold its goods or offered its
      service in a manner which has deceived or would be
      likely to deceive the public into thinking that the
      defendant&#x27;s goods or services are the plaintiff&#x27;s. The
      action is normally available to the owner of a distinctive
      trademark and the person who, if the word or name is an
      invented one. invents and uses it. If two trade rivals claim
      to have individually invented the same mark, then the

trader who is able to establish prior user will succeed. The
question is, as has been aptly put, who gets these first? It
is not essential for the plaintiff to prove long user to
establish reputation in a passing off action. It would
depend         upon the volume of sales         and extent             of
advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_100">14.     The second element that must be established by a
plaintiff in a passing off action is misrepresentation by the
defendant to the public. The word misrepresentation does
not mean that the plaintiff has to prove any malafide
intention on the part of the defendant. Of course, if the
misrepresentation is intentional, it might lead to an
inference that the reputation of the plaintiff is such that it
is worth the defendant&#x27;s while to cash in on it. An
innocent misrepresentation would be relevant only on the
question of the ultimate relief which would be granted to
plaintiff. What has to be established is the likelihood of
confusion in the minds of the public, (the word &quot;public&quot;
being understood to mean actual or potential customers
or users) that the goods or services offered by the
defendant are the goods or the services of the plaintiff. In
assessing the likelihood of such confusion the courts must
allow for the &quot;imperfect recollection of a person of
ordinary memory&quot;.

different and it can only be said to be a generic word. He has

submitted that when the word itself is used by everybody, it

would be generic and, therefore, by prefixing the only word

&quot;sim&quot; does not make a trademark separate and distinct from

the other word. He has submitted that when the two words are

not phonetically similar or there is no deceptive similarity

between two words, there is no need to refer to Section 28, 29

and 30 of the Trademarks Act, as the owner of respective

also submitted that the page 51, and 52 of the paper book

depicts that these are the only labels and therefore, the

graphic of alphabet &quot;S&quot; is different and would not be seen by

the public at large in a minute manner. He has submitted that

simply because alphabet &quot;S&quot; is used, on the label, it does not

mean that two trademarks are deceptively similar. He has

available to the plaintiff is to opposed the registration of the

defendant by applying to the trademark registry and that right

is available to the plaintiff. He has submitted that the learned

trial Court has properly considered all these aspects and has

not committed any error of law in rejecting the application of

</p><p id="p_122">6.    In rejoinder, learned advocate for the plaintiff has

submitted that according to the provisions of the trademark

Act, while considering the similarity of the two trademarks,

&quot;likely to cause similarity&quot; is also to be looked into. He has also

submitted that, therefore, the Court has to compare both the

trademarks as to whether there is any likelihood to cause

similarity to use of the similar words or not. He has also

submitted that the defence raised by the defendant regarding

applicability of Section 17 of the Trademarks Act is raised for

the first time in this appeal and it was not raised before the

trial Court and, therefore, it cannot be looked into at this stage.

<p id="p_123">He has also submitted that the judgments relied upon by other

side are all pertaining to the pharmaceutical products only,

whereas the parties in the present suit are dealing with

ceramic products and, therefore, those judgments are not

applicable to the facts of the present case.

case, the provisions of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_59">Section 29</a> (5) of the Trademark Act

&quot;Simero&quot; is not similar in ceramic industries and, therefore, it

has distinct mark. He has submitted that considering the facts

and circumstances of the case, the present appeal from Order

be allowed by setting aside the impugned order of trial Court

and injunction against the defendant be granted.
</p>


<p id="p_125">7.   At the outset, it needs to be observed that during the

course of arguments, learned advocates appearing for the

parties have relied upon number of authorities, which are

pertaining to well-known principles regarding infringement and

passing of under the Trademarks Act. This Court is guided by

the time bound principles laid down therein and the same are

considered while deciding this Appeal from Order. All the

authorities are not discussed in detail in this order.
</p>


<p id="p_126">8.   It is well settled principle of law that in an appeal against

exercise of &quot;discretion&quot; by the Court of first instance, the

power of appellate Court to interfere with the exercise of

discretion is restrictive. Merely because on facts, the appellate

Court would have concluded differently from that of the Court

below, that would not, by itself, provide justification for

appellate Court to interfere. To justify interference, the

appellate Court would have to demonstrate that the discretion

has been shown to have been exercised arbitrarily or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                             Page 61 of 74</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                                                  Downloaded on : Sat Dec 24 04:38:56 IST 2022</span>
      C/AO/83/2022                            ORDER DATED: 22/12/2022




capriciously or perversely or where the Court had ignored the

settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of

interlocutory injunction. In appeal against the exercise of

discretion is an appeal in principles. In the case of Wardopn v.
</p>
<p id="p_127">Antrox India (supra) wherein it has been enumerated that the

appellate Court ought not to re-assess the material and seek to

reach a conclusion different from the one reached by the Court

below, if the one reached by that Court was reasonably

possible on the material. The appellate Court would normally

not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion

under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the

matter at the trial Court, it would have come to a contrary

conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by the trial

Court reasonably and in judicial manner, the fact that the

appellate Court would have taken a different view, may not

justify interference with the trial Court&#x27;s exercise of discretion.
</p>


<p id="p_128">9.   In view of above settled principles of law, power of this

Court, as an appellate Court, to interfere with the order passed

by the trial Court is very limited and only in exceptional

circumstances, the appellate Court can interfere with the

discretionary order passed by the trial Court. The appellate

       C/AO/83/2022                           ORDER DATED: 22/12/2022




Court cannot re-evulate the entire evidence and arrive at a

conclusion contrary to the conclusion arrived at by the trial

Court. However, in case where the order passed by the trial

Court is found to be invalid, illegal, arbitrary, perverse or

contrary to the settled principles of law, the appellate court

has all powers to interfere with same. Considering the above

principles of law, this Court has only to see whether the trial

Court has committed any error in passing the impugned order.
</p>
<p id="p_129">It has also to see whether the main basic principle of law viz.
</p>
<p id="p_130">prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable loss

are satisfied or not in passing the order.
</p>


<p id="p_131">10.   Keeping in mind the aforesaid principles of law, along

with the submissions made on behalf of both the sides,

coupled with the pleading of the parties and the materials

placed on record and the decisions cited at bar, it appears that

there is no dispute regarding the fact that both the parties are

dealing with the same product i.e. ceramic and they are also

operating in Morbi and both are having same class of

consumers and the market of the goods. Now, it emerges from

record that the trademark used by the plaintiff is &quot;Simero&quot;,

whereas the trademark of the defendant is &quot;Simora&quot;. Thus,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                             Page 63 of 74</span>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                                                  Downloaded on : Sat Dec 24 04:38:56 IST 2022</span>
      C/AO/83/2022                            ORDER DATED: 22/12/2022




similarity of the two marks is prefix &quot;sim&quot;, whereas words

&quot;ero&quot; and &quot;ora&quot; are following the word &quot;sim&quot;. Except the prefix

&quot;sim&quot;, there is phonetically no similarity between the &quot;ero&quot; and

&quot;ora&quot;. Now, it is well settled principle of law that while

comparing two trademarks whole word has to be seen for

comparison and similarity of them needs to be considered

while deciding as to whether there is a similarity, which may

cause confusion in the minds of the public at large. It is also

well settled that similar or similarity or likelihood of similarity

can also be taken into consideration. Now, considering the two

words &quot;Simero&quot; and &quot;Simora&quot;, it appears that except the

prefix, there is no similarity. Even phonetically both the words

are different from each other and there is difference in

pronunciation. That phonetically it is not similar. At this

      or more trade marks registered under this Act which are
      identical or nearly resemble each other, in exercise of
      the right to the use of that trade mark given by
      registration under this Act.
</p>
<p id="p_178">      (3) Where the goods bearing a registered trade mark are
      lawfully acquired by a person, the sale of the goods in
      the market or otherwise dealing in those goods by that
      person or by a person claiming under or through him is
      not infringement of a trade mark by reason only of--
</p>
<p id="p_179">      (a) the registered trade mark having been assigned by
      the registered proprietor to some other person, after the
      acquisition of those goods; or

</p><p id="p_180">      (b) the goods having been put on the market under the
      registered trade mark by the proprietor or with his
      consent.
</p>
<p id="p_181">      (4) Sub-section (3) shall not apply where there exists
      legitimate reasons for the proprietor to oppose further
      dealings in the goods in particular, where the condition of
      the goods, has been changed or impaired after they have
      been put on the market.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_182">11.   Now, considering the aforesaid provisions, it is crystal

clear that by virtue of registration of trademark, the registered

owner has every right to oppose the use of the same or similar

or deceptively similar trademark being used by other side.
</p>
<p id="p_183">However, when there are two different trademarks and are

registered then each owner of such registered trademarks has

equal right of using the same and it would be concurrent use of

that trademark. Therefore, the provisions of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_66">Section 28</a>, <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_67">29</a> and

<a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_68">30</a> would be applicable to both the sides. However, in the

present case, the defendant has raised defence under Section

17 of the Trademarks Act. Of course, it was not raised before

the trial Court but this being a continuous proceeding from the

suit and it is an appellate forum, a legal point can be raised at

any point time. Therefore, submissions made on behalf of the

plaintiff that the defendant has first time raised this point of

defence of under <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_69">Section 17</a> need not be taken into

consideration at this appellate stage is devoid of merits.
</p>


<p id="p_184">12.   Now, considering the provisions of <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_70">Section 17</a>, it clearly

provides that when the trademark consists of several matters,

its registration was conferred on the proprietor, exclusive right

to use of the trademark be taken as a whole. However, as per

Sub-section (2) thereof, proviso has been carved out to the

effect that when a trademark contains any part, (i) which is not

subject of a separate application by the proprietor for

registration as a trademark; or (ii) which is not separately

registered by the proprietor as a trademark; or (b) contains

any matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise of a

non-distinctive character, the registration thereof shall not

confer any exclusive right in the matter forming only a part of

the whole of the trademark so registered. Therefore, by

registration of the trademark by the plaintiff, containing &quot;sim&quot;

<p id="p_185">does not ipso facto give any right to the plaintiff regarding this

alphabets. In the same manner, the defendant also does not

have any right for the use of these alphabets.
</p>


<p id="p_186">13.   Considering the material placed on record, it clearly

appears that the alphabets &quot;sim&quot; are used for many other

products and it appears that the alphabets &quot;sim&quot; is generic

and used at large. Therefore, merely there is prefix of

alphabets/words &quot;sim&quot; in the trademark of the plaintiff as well

as the defendant. That it has not given any exclusive right to

both the parties. On comparison of the trademarks of both the

parties, it clearly appears that it is not phonetically same nor it

is similar or deceptively similar. On perusal of the impugned

order of the trial Court, it appears that the trial Court has

considered this aspect while rejecting the application of the

plaintiff. The view taken by learned trial Court is plausible one.
</p>
<p id="p_187">Therefore, considering limited jurisdiction of this Court in

interfering with order of the trial Court and considering the

material placed on record, this Court is of the considered

opinion that the order of the trial Court is sustainable in the

eyes of law and no interference is required at the hands of this

Court.

be dismissed. Accordingly, this Appeal from Order is dismissed.
