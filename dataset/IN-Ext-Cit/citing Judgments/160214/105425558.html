       the plot under the Town Planning Scheme. It is
       submitted       that       under      the     provisions            of     the
       Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development
       Act, 1976 (in short &quot;the Town Planning Act&quot;),
       the Town Planning Officer has the power to

       variation on account of an error, irregularity
       or informality is to ensure that no lawful
       owner or occupant is divested of his or her
       land/property             while      giving        effect         to       the

       statute,          and    the     Court&#x27;s           endeavour             shall
       always       be     to    harmoniously                construct            such
       provisions         so     that       the    legislative                intent
       underlying         both    statutes             can    be      fulfilled.
       Thus, it is urged that since the provisions of
       Section 135 of the Gujarat Land Revenue Code
       read with the provisions of the Gujarat Town
       Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976, are
       violated,          the    action           of      the       respondents
       suffers from patent illegality, which warrants
       interference of this Court.

(6)    The         facts,    which        are        established            from        the
       record are that the respondent-SMC declared
       its         intention       to    make        Town      Planning           Scheme
       Surat         No.6      (Majura-Khatodra)                         under          the
       provisions of Section 23 of the                              Town Planning
       Act,         1954,         which      is      corresponding              to      the
       provisions of Section 42 of the Gujarat Town
       Planning             Act,        1976         on      23.12.1968.                The
       intention of the scheme has been declared on
       23.12.1968            and        on     06.09.1971,               the        State
       Government granted sanction to the Draft Town
       Planning            Scheme.        The        entire        case        of       the
       petitioners hinges on the partition deed dated
       03.10.1975            of    land        bearing          Revenue           Survey
       No.53/2/1, which has been re-numbered as Final
       Plot No.85 , which is unquestionably after the
       sanction of the Draft Town Planning Scheme by
       the         State    Government             on     06.09.1971.             Hence,
       when the intention of the scheme was declared
       and the same was sanctioned and Entry No.1350
       was         mutated         in        the        revenue         record            of
       partition,            the        draft        scheme          was        already
       sanctioned by the State Government. The State
       Government sanctioned the preliminary scheme
       being Town Planning Scheme No.6 under Section
       65 of the Gujarat Town Planning Act, 1976 on
       27.10.1980 and the final scheme was sanctioned
       on      28.07.1987.              Thus,        the      contention              with

              &quot;In view of <a href="/doc/1693670/" id="a_20">Section 53</a>, once property has vested
            absolutely in the local authority and all rights of
            these persons occupying the same have come to an end,
            the eviction power would be merely an administrative
            power of eviction. Such eviction would be of the same
            nature as of the persons who are evicted under the
            provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_21">Land Acquisition Act</a> after the
            acquired land has vested in the State and the matter
            is only of taking possession.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_59">          In this decision, the Full Bench has observed that,
      once the land vests with the authority concerned as per
      Scheme, the Scheme has become a legislative measure under
      which the rights of the parties have totally ceased to
      occupy the property and the power of eviction in such a
      context would be in the nature of an administrative
      power, and, therefore, when the parties admittedly have
      no right under the final scheme to continue their
      occupation, they could never invoke any prejudice or
      consideration of the principle of fair play and justice
      so as to have been these impugned notices invalidated.

<p id="p_60">          7. Considering the abovesaid decisions and also the
      fact that the preliminary Scheme has been already
      sanctioned as early as 27-10-1980, which has become the
      part of the Act, same cannot be questioned as late as in
      the year 1988.&quot;

<p id="p_65">(12) Thus, it is no more res integra that once the
       draft T.P. Scheme and the preliminary scheme
       have become part of the Act, the same cannot
       be questioned, since it partakes the character
       of          statute.     In     the       present        case,           the
       petitioners, though have very modishly stated
       that they are not questioning the T.P Scheme,
       but         simultaneously       are      claiming       the       relief
       which         directly        affects      the     Town        Planning
       Scheme by asserting that the final plot should
       have been finalized after considering their
       respective shares as per the partition deed.
       The aforesaid submissions, though seem to be
       innocuous, do not merit acceptance, since all
       the objections of the concerned parties and
       the niceties and nuances of the T.P. Scheme
       can only be considered as per the time frame
       specified in the statute, and not at any stage
       as per the convenience of the petitioners. In
       the         case   of   Advance       Builders       (supra),            the

  C/SCA/3018/1999                                          CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 24/02/2023




       being an implementing authority, is duty bound
       to      implement          the     scheme,            which        has        been
       sanctioned under <a href="/doc/1383654/" id="a_31">Section 65</a> of the 1976 Act.
       The         Division       Bench,            vide        judgment           dated
       20/22.04.1992              passed             in         Special            Civil
       Application No.1608 of 1979 has held that once
       a public notice is given and issued by the
       Town Planning Officer, there is no requirement
       of      issuing        a     personal           notice           under          the
       provisions of the Act. The Division Bench has
       placed reliance on the judgment of <a href="/doc/1708491/" id="a_32">State of
       Gujarat vs. Panch of Nani Hanuman</a>&#x27;s Pole, AIR
       1986 S.C. 803. Hence, after 28.07.1987, when
       the final T.P. Scheme was sanctioned, the writ
       petition cannot be entertained on an objection
       raised by the petitioners for the first time
       in the year 1999. In case the contention of
       the petitioners is accepted with regard to the
       division        of     the    plot       as        per    the       partition
       deed, the same will amount to tinkering with
       the T.P. Scheme. In fact by not responding to
       the public notice or registering their concern
       with regard to the manner of finalizing the
       concern        plot,       the      petitioners               have        waived
       their right of taking such objections.

      Badriprasad      Varma      (supra),       wherein,            while
      examining the provisions of the Gujarat Town
      Planning Act, it has been held thus:
</p>
<p id="p_67">      &quot;24......A person may waive a right either expressly or
      by necessary implication. He may in a given case
      disentitle himself from obtaining an equitable relief
      particularly when he allows a thing to come to an
      irreversible situation.
</p>

<p id="p_68">      28. <a href="/doc/1308552/" id="a_33">Section 67</a> of the Act provides that all lands
      required by the appropriate authority shall, unless it
      is   otherwise  determined   in   such  scheme,   vest
      absolutely in the appropriate authority free from all
      encumbrances with effect from the date on which the
      preliminary scheme comes into force. What would be the
      quantum of payment of compensation therefor is also
      provided in <a href="/doc/1626845/" id="a_34">Section 82</a> of the Act. It is in the
      aforementioned situation, a claim is to be made before
      the authority whenever a notice in Form H is
      published. If a claim is not filed, the person, who is
      said to be injuriously affected, does so at its own
      peril. Had such a claim been filed, the authority
      before making final allotment could have considered
      the competing claims wherefor a large number of
      factors were required to be taken into consideration,
      viz., the location of the land, the area of the land,
      the nature of right, etc.


      &quot; 33.    ......................In Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             &quot;The expression `waiver&#x27; may, in law, bear
             different meanings. The primary meaning has been
             said to be the abandonment of a right in such a
             way that the other party is entitled to plead the
             abandonment by way of confession and avoidance if
             the right is thereafter asserted, and is either
             express or implied from conduct. It may arise
             from a party making an election, for example

              knowledge on the part of the person making the
              representation,   and   the   estoppel   may   be
              suspensory only... Where the waiver is not
              express, it may be implied from conduct which is
              inconsistent with the continuance of the right,
              without the need for writing or for consideration
              moving from, or detriment to, the party who
              benefits by the waiver, but mere acts of
              indulgence will not amount to waiver; nor may a
              party benefit from the waiver unless he has
              altered his position in reliance on it.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_70">              13. As early as 1957, the concept of waiver was
              articulated  in  a  case   involving  the   late
              assertion   of  a   claim   regarding   improper
              constitution of a Tribunal in <a href="/doc/80596/" id="a_35">Manak Lal v. Dr.
              Prem Chand</a>, AIR 1957 SC 425 in the following
              terms:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                   &quot;It is true that waiver cannot always and in
                   every case be inferred merely from the
                   failure of the party to take the objection.
                   Waiver can be inferred only if and after it
                   is shown that the party knew about the
                   relevant facts and was aware of his right to
                   take the objection. As Sir Johan Romilly M.
                   R. has observed in Vyvyan v. Vyvyan [(1861)
                   30 Beav. 65, 74; 54 E.R. 813, 817] &quot;waiver
                   or acquiescence, like election, presupposes
                   that the person to be bound is fully
                   cognizant of his rights, and, that being so,
                   he neglects to enforce them, or chooses one
                   benefit instead of another, either, but not
                   both, of which he might claim&quot;.

<p id="p_71">(14) As noticed hereinabove, the entire case of the
       petitioners hinges on finalization of the plot
       by calculating their respective shares on the
       entire plot. In this regard the petitioners
       have also contended that the respondent-SMC,
       in the process of finalizing the T.P. Scheme,

 C/SCA/3018/1999                                         CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 24/02/2023




      should have considered Entry No.1350 mutated
      in the revenue record showing the respective
      plot of the each of the petitioners. Such a
      contention raised by the petitioners cannot be
      entertained           in    wake       of        the     aforementioned
      mentioned           provisions          of        the       Bombay           Town
      Planning Act, 1954 and also the Gujarat Town
      Planning Act, 1976, after finalization of the
      Town Planning Scheme.                       As noted hereinabove,
      the partition deed dated 03.10.1975 of land
      bearing        Revenue      Survey           No.53/2,              has       been
      executed subsequently, after sanction of the
      Draft        Town     Planning          Scheme           by     the        State
      Government on 06.09.1971. Thus, till the stage
      of the Draft Scheme the revenue record showed
      a     consolidated         plot       and         not    in      divisions,
      hence the Town Planning Officer proceeded on
      the basis of the single plot of Revenue Survey
      No.53/2. The State Government sanctioned the
      preliminary scheme being Town Planning Scheme
      No.6        under    Section       65       of     the     Gujarat           Town
      Planning Act, 1976 on 27.10.1980 and the final
      scheme       was    sanctioned              on    28.07.1987.             At     no
      point of time, the petitioners have raised an
      objection,            hence       the            grievance           of        the
      petitioners does not merit acceptance. This
      Court        cannot        exercise              its     discretion              by
      invoking        its    extraordinary                   powers      conferred

      under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
      for issuing any directions as prayed for in
      the writ petition, since such directions will
      dilute the entire purport and the scheme of
      the Act. The writ petition is barred by the
      principle        of        waiver          and         estoppel.               Any
      directions          issued      at         this        stage         will        be
      deleterious          to     the       objects            of       the        Town
      Planning        Scheme,         and         will         set        a      wrong
      precedent.          No      directions,                even          on        the
      suggestion of the respondent-Corporation can
      be     issued    by      this     Court          for     examining             the
      grievance of the petitioners by a Committee
      formed under <a href="/doc/1308552/" id="a_37">section 67</a> of the T.P. Act, 1976.
      Such a direction, if is issued, will further
      give rise to a fresh cause of action and new
      litigation, after passage of almost 35 years
      from the finalization of the T.P.Scheme and
      that too in a writ petition, which has been
      filed       after     a     period          of      12      years          after
      finalization          of    the       Town         Planning             Scheme.
      Hence, I am not inclined to interfere with the
      notice       dated        16.03.2022,             which         is       served
      recently        during      the       pendency            of       the       writ
      petitions and are produced in the connected
