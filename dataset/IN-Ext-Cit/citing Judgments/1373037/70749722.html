                                 present is whether the term ‘document’ of title
                                 would only apply to a document by which the
                                 mortgagor derives title to the property to be
                                 mortgaged, or whether it would also apply to any
                                 document which provides some, if not conclusive,
                                 evidence that the mortgagor has title to the
                                 property. In our view, it is beyond doubt that the
                                 term lends itself to the interpretation that it

                      immediately traceable. The learned Additional Government Pleader (Taxes)

</p><p id="p_60">                            30.The learned Additional Government Pleader (Taxes) submits that if

                      an opportunity is given, they will trace out the same before proceeding

                      further with the Revenue Recovery proceedings. I find this reasonable

                      suggestion and therefore I am of the view that the impugned Revenue

                      Recovery proceedings can be kept in abeyance for some time.




</p><p id="p_61">                            31.Under these circumstances, I am inclined to dispose this Writ

                      Petition with a direction to the respondent to call upon the petitioner for a

                      hearing after furnishing a photo copy of the title deed of the petitioner's

                      property purportedly containing such endorsement of the petitioner and her

                      husband. The respondent shall furnish a photo copy of the said document to

                      the petitioner within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a

                      copy of this order.
