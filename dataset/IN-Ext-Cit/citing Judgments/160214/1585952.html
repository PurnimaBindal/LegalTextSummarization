<p id="p_44">16.   A learned single judge of the High Court disposed of the writ petition

filed by the appellant being O.P. No. 8563 of 2003.

advance payment in the specified manner had not been made by it before

payments in respect of `necessary plant and machinery and/or equipments'

and not to any or `certain or a small portion of the plant and machinery

necessary for the project', to hold:

<p id="p_46">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">             "31. The latter part of Sub-clause (iii) which is
             applicable to Sub-clauses (ii) and (iii) alike is a
             deeming provision as per which if any advance
             payments are made by means of demand drafts or
             cheque for the purchase of plant, machinery and
             equipments which have been credited to the
             account of the seller prior to January 1, 2000, it
             shall be deemed that firm orders have been placed
             by the unit for the purchase of such plant,
             machinery and equipments.           This deeming
             provision, if complied with, it must be noted, only
             dispenses with the requirement of establishing that
             firm orders have been placed by the unit for the
             purchase of plant, machinery and equipments
             which are required for setting up the unit and for
             commencing commercial production.               This,
             however, does not mean that the above is the only
             means for establishing that "firm orders have been
             placed". The last sentence in Clause (iii) latter part
             states that "the onus of proving that an industrial
             unit had placed firm order for purchase of such
             plant, machinery and equipments prior to 1st
             January, 2000 shall be on such industrial unit".
             This makes the position clear that it is open to the
             industrial unit to independently establish by
             producing other materials that firm orders for
             purchase of plant, machinery and equipments are
             placed before January 1, 2000."

             has obtained provisional registration prior to
             January 1, 2000, it could be said that the said unit
             has taken effective steps. Similarly, an industrial
             unit can be considered to have taken effective
             steps, if it has owned or acquired or has been
             allotted land for establishing the industrial unit and
             also applied for loan from any regular financial
             institution/Government before January 1, 2000.
             Similarly, in the case of self financed units
             acquired or placed firm orders for the purchase of
             necessary plant and machinery before January 1,
             2000, it can be considered to have taken effective
             steps provided the unit commences commercial
             production on or before December 31, 2001.
             Regarding the third situation, it is stated that a unit
             shall be deemed to have placed firm orders for the
             purchase of plant, machinery and equipments if
             such units had made any (emphasis supplied)
             advance payments therefor by means of demand

             account of the seller prior to the first day of
             January, 2000. Here it must be noted that Sub-
             clauses (ii) and (iii) provide for the circumstances
             under which an industrial unit can be
             considered/deemed to have taken effective steps
             but it is not exhaustive. The burden is on the
             industrial unit to establish that the unit had placed

             equipments prior to January 1, 2000."

<p id="p_62">21.      The exemption notification was issued for the purpose of achieving

the economic growth in the State. The letters exchanged by and between the

appellant and the authorities of the State, which we have noticed

heretobefore, in no uncertain terms, show that the appellant was intending to

set up a plant in the State of Kerala pursuant to the provisions made by the

State.
</p>
<p id="p_63">

</p><p id="p_64">22.      It is beyond any doubt or dispute that pursuant to or in furtherance of

the said assurance, the appellant altered its position.           It made a huge

investment. It entered into an agreement of lease with the authorities of the

State for which it had expended a sum of Rs. 2,77,64,000/-. The lease is for

a period of 99 years with an option of renewal for another period of 99
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                     22</span>

years. Indisputably, again in relation to a part of the plant and machinery, it

had placed orders. The Deutsche Bank had issued a certificate on 29.9.2000

in that behalf, stating:
</p>
<p id="p_65">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">              "This is to confirm that the following cheques
              issued by Pepsi Cola India Marketing Company,

              respective accounts were duly honoured and
              credited to the party's respective accounts."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_66">23.    Indisputably, again the appellant had commenced commercial

production much before the cut-off date fixed therefor, viz. 31.12.2001.



</p><p id="p_67">24.    The grant of eligibility certificate is in two tiers. But, it is of some

significance to note that the Director of Industries and Commerce is the

appellate authority of the Deputy Commissioner (General) Commercial

Taxes, as would appear from a notification dated 3.11.1993. On the one

hand, in relation to the grant of exemption, the power of the Board of

Revenue is being exercised by the Deputy Commissioner (General)

Commercial Taxes, the Director of Industries and Commerce was the

appellate authority; on the other, the latter's decision was made subject to

the ultimate grant of exemption by the former.
</p>
<p id="p_68">
</p><p id="p_69">       The effect of such a dichotomy merits serious consideration.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                      23</span>



</p><p id="p_70">25.   It stands admitted that the contention raised by the respondents herein

in the first round of litigation that the investment in the plant and machinery

must be substantial was for all intent and purport rejected. Interpreting

clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the notification, it was held that the conditions

imposed thereby are not absolute. Clauses (b) and (c) of the notification

were read together. It was furthermore held that the term "any" referring to

advance payment is linked up with all the clauses.


</p><p id="p_71">      The said writ application had to be filed by the appellant as the

Director of Industries refused to grant the eligibility certificate in its favour.

The Deputy Commissioner (General) Commercial Taxes was a party thereto.

It has been stated before us that he had not filed any affidavit in the said

proceedings. Only the Director of Commerce and Industries did. Even the

special leave petition was filed by the Industries Department and not by the

Commercial Taxes Department.

            noted in para 13 above (which is extracted from
            Ext. P13) apparently firm orders had been placed
            by the petitioner only for three items which would
            come under the category of necessary plant and

            Ext. P23 written submissions was made on

             entitled to, eligibility having been already certified.

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">      We are herein concerned with contention Nos. 1 and 2.</blockquote><p id="p_96">


</p><p id="p_97">      So far as contention No. 1 is concerned, he determined the said

question in paragraph Nos. 21 to 32, inter alia, stating :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">             "24...Should the certificate of eligibility issued by
             the competent authority necessarily be a certificate
             of exemption. Firstly, clause 10(d) states that the
             eligibility certificate referred to in clause (b) shall
             contain the date of commencement of commercial
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                              31</span>

      production and the monetary limit of exemption
      the unit is eligible for. In my view clause 10(d)
      indicates what should necessarily be contained in
      the eligibility certificate issued under clause 10(b).
      This therefore could also be indicative of the
      parameters of the authority required to be
      exercised by the Director of Industries in terms of
      the notification. What is required to be certified in
      the eligibility certificate, is therefore the date of
      commencement of commercial production and the
      monetary limit of the exemption that the unit is
      eligible for. Can it be said that if these two factors
      are certified, the unit in question would be entitled
      to sales tax exemption? If these two factors are
      certified in the eligibility certificate issued by the
      Director, does it oblige the Deputy Commissioner
      of Commercial Taxes to necessarily consider the
      unit in question as entitled for tax exemption? Mr.
      Vellapally contends that once the unit is certified
      as eligible for tax exemption then the limited brief
      available to the Secretary, Board of Revenue or the
      Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (who
      is currently the competent authority) is only to
      quantify the monetary limits of the tax exemption
      that the unit is entitled to."

<p id="p_98">Contention No. 2 was dealt in paragraphs 33 to 36, concluding:

<p id="p_101">31.   Although a contention has been raised before us that despite

opportunities granted, the appellant had not adduced the additional evidence

to establish compliance of the conditions precedent for grant of eligibility

certificate, it has not been denied or disputed that even in the first round of

litigation, the requisite documents formed part of the writ petition. The

Deputy Commissioner (General) Commercial Taxes, therefore, in our

opinion, even it be assumed that he was not totally bound by the

observations made therein, should have taken into consideration the

interpretation of the notification adverted to by the learned Single Judge.



</p><p id="p_102">32.   This brings us to the question of interpretation of the notifications.



</p><p id="p_103">      The notification dated 3.11.1993 was issued in terms of an industrial

policy; pursuant whereto exemption was to be granted for a period of seven

years. Appellant had placed orders for supply of plant and machinery both

with advances and without advances.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                    34</span><p id="p_104">

</p><p id="p_105">      What was necessary was to take effective steps for setting up of new

industrial units. A deeming provision existed in terms whereof the effective

steps would be considered to have been taken; if it has :


</p><p id="p_106">(a)   obtained provisional registration (applicable only in the case of SSI

      units);
</p>
<p id="p_107">(b)   owned or acquired or has been allotted land for establishing the

      industrial units and applied for financial support from any regular

      financial institution/ government before 1.1.2000; or

</p><p id="p_108">(c)   in the case of self financed units acquired or placed firm orders for the

      purchase of the necessary plant and machinery before 1.1.2000.



      Although clause (a) has no application in the instant case but it

becomes relevant for the purpose of construing the notification so as to

measure the level of rigours imposed thereby. In case of SSI units, thus,

merely a provisional registration would serve the purpose.           Even no

investment was necessary for obtaining the benefit. So far as clause (b) is

concerned, mere application for financial support from any regular financial

institution again would entitle the entrepreneur to obtain the benefit of the

exemption notification.
</p>
<p id="p_109">      It is in the aforementioned context, applications for grant of

exemption by the self-financed units are required to be taken into
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                      35</span>

consideration.    They are either to acquire or place firm orders for the

necessary plant and machinery. It is not that order for entire machinery and

equipment were required to be placed for before the first day of January,

2000. Even in relation thereto, a legal fiction has been created stating that if

such unit had made any advance payments therefor by means of demand

draft or cheque, the requirements would stand satisfied.

legislative intent and deliberate dilutions of the rigours as to what effective

steps would merit consideration of the application for grant of exemption by

an entrepreneur.

</p><p id="p_117">34.   It is also of some significance that the said notification was withdrawn

by a notification dated 31.12.1999, subject of course to an exception curved

out therein, viz., the industries which had been set up on or before 1.1.2000

and which have already commenced commercial production, set up or taken

effective steps to establish industrial unit prior to 1.1.2000 were to be

allowed the benefit of exemption.
</p>
<p id="p_118">
</p><p id="p_119">      That notification stood amended on 31.3.2000 in terms whereof some

benefits had been given to an entrepreneur like the appellant, as noticed

hereinbefore.
</p>
<p id="p_120">
</p><p id="p_121">35.   Appellant need not have questioned the validity thereof as the

notification in question was issued by relaxing the conditions imposed in the

notification dated 31.12.1999 which was one of withdrawing the grant of

earlier benefits. Thus, by reason of the said notification, certain benefits had

been confirmed on it.
</p>
<p id="p_122">
</p><p id="p_123">36.   There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the burden of proof was on

the appellant. According to the Director of Industries, he had discharged the

burden.    Only because the procedural sanction of grant of financial

exemption was to be received from the Deputy Commissioner (General)

Commercial Taxes, the same, in our opinion, would not mean that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                      38</span>

conditions had not been satisfied. In any event, the certificate granted by the

Director deserved serious consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_124">
</p><p id="p_125">      Both the learned Single Judge as also the Division Bench did not

consider this aspect of the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_126">
</p><p id="p_127">37.   Although payment of advance in respect of some machinery and plant

would subserve the requirements for the purpose of obtaining the eligibility

certificate, the learned Single Judge read the word `any' to be synonymous

to the word `all', whereas the Division Bench considered it to be

"substantial". It is in that view of the matter the opinion of the learned

Single Judge in O.P. No. 8563 of 2003 assumes importance wherein, as

noticed hereinbefore, it was categorically held:



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">             "...Regarding the third situation, it is stated that a
             unit shall be deemed to have placed firm orders for
             the purchase of plant, machinery and equipment if
             such units had made any (emphasis supplied)
             advance payments therefor by means of demand
             draft or cheque which have been credited to the
             account of the seller prior to the first day of
             January, 2000..."</blockquote><p id="p_128">


</p><p id="p_129">      The High Court although laid emphasis on the word "any" but

proceeded on the basis as if, purchase of plant, machinery and equipment

prior to 1st January, 2000 in their entirety, was imperative.

</p><p id="p_130">38.   Appellant's bonafide is not in dispute. The fact that it had set up an

industry and started commercial production nine months prior to the cut-off

date, viz., 31.12.2001 is also not disputed.

fact arrived at by the statutory authorities but was only required to consider

the correctness of judgment of the learned Single Judge as also the Division

authorities stuck to their own stand which is not expected from a statutory

authority. See, however, <a href="/doc/1502934/" id="a_3">K.I. Shephard and Others v. Union of India and

<p id="p_141">42.   An exemption notification and a notification withdrawing the benefit

granted would, however, stand on different footings. For the said purpose,

the industrial policy is required to be kept in mind. It must also be taken

into consideration for the purpose of construing the exemption notification.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">            "32. The general principles with regard to
            construction of exemption notification are not of
            much dispute. Generally, an exemption
            notification is to be construed strictly, but once it is
            found that the entrepreneur fulfils the conditions
            laid down therein, liberal construction would be
            made.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_79">            34. A question as to whether, in a given situation,
            an entrepreneur was entitled to the benefit under an
            exemption notification or not, thus, would depend
            upon the fact of each case. A bare perusal of the
            notification dated 6-2-1992 issued by the first
            respondent would show that the purport and object
            thereof was to grant benefit of a concessional
            power tariff which came into force on and from 1-
            1-1992. The phraseology used in the said
            notification postulates that the benefit was to be
            granted in regard to the "enhanced power tariff".
            Thus, where the new units had started production
            between 1-1-1992 and 31-12-1996, such
            exemption was available to the entrepreneurs.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_81">            "24. Learned Senior Counsel invited our attention
            to a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/994554/" id="a_11">State of Punjab v.
            Nestle India Ltd</a>. in which a representation was
            made by the Government in the manner dehors the
            rules but a statement was made by the Finance
            Minister in his Budget speech for 1996-1997
            making representation to the effect that the State
            Government had abolished purchase tax on milk.
            The manufacturers of milk products, therefore,
            were not paying the purchase tax on milk for
            Assessment Year 1996-1997 and mentioned this
            fact in their returns. The taxing authority
            entertained such returns. The manufacturers passed
            on the benefit of exemption to the dairy farmers
            and milk producers. However, after expiry of the
            said assessment year, the Government took a
            decision not to abolish purchase tax on milk and
            the taxing authority therefore raised a demand for
            Assessment Year 1996-1997. On these facts, the
            Court held that in absence of proof of any
            overriding public interest rendering the
            enforcement of estoppel against the Government
            was inequitable, notwithstanding that no
            exemption notification as required by the statute
            was issued. It was held that the State Government
            cannot resile from its decision to exempt milk and
            raise a demand for the aforesaid assessment year.
            However, the same principle of estoppel was not
            invoked after Assessment Year 1996-1997. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                               43</span>

      Court enforced the principle of estoppel. All the
      earlier cases on the subject were reviewed by the
      Court and ultimately it was concluded as follows:
      (SCC pp. 481-82, para 47)
      "47. The appellant has been unable to establish any
      overriding public interest which would make it
      inequitable to enforce the estoppel against the
      State Government. The representation was made
      by the highest authorities including the Finance
      Minister in his Budget speech after considering the
      financial implications of the grant of the
      exemption to milk. It was found that the overall
      benefit to the State's economy and the public
      would be greater if the exemption were allowed.
      The respondents have passed on the benefit of that
      exemption by providing various facilities and
      concessions for the upliftment of the milk
      producers. This has not been denied. It would, in
      the circumstances, be inequitable to allow the State
      Government now to resile from its decision to
      exempt milk and demand the purchase tax with
      retrospective effect from 1-4-1996 so that the
      respondents cannot in any event readjust the
      expenditure already made. The High Court was
      also right when it held that the operation of the
      estoppel would come to an end with the 1997
      decision of the Cabinet."

<p id="p_146">It was furthermore observed:
</p>
<p id="p_147">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_82">      "35. In this 21st century, when there is global
      economy, the question of faith is very important.
      The Government offers certain benefits to attract
      the entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurs act on
      those beneficial offers. Thereafter, the Government
      withdraws those benefits. This will seriously affect
      the credibility of the Government and would show
      the short-sightedness of governance. Therefore, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                     44</span>

             order to keep the faith of the people, the
             Government or its instrumentality should abide by
             their commitments. In this context, the action
             taken by the appellant Corporation in revoking the
             benefits given to the entrepreneurs in the hill areas
             will sadly reflect their credibility and people will
             not take the word of the Government. That will
             shake the faith of the people in the governance.
             Therefore, in order to keep the faith and maintain
             good governance it is necessary that whatever
             representation is made by the Government or its
             instrumentality which induces the other party to
             act, the Government should not be permitted to
             withdraw from that. This is a matter of faith."</blockquote><p id="p_148">


</p><p id="p_149">      Furthermore, in this case, the appellant admittedly has even not

realized any tax from its purchasers.       Keeping in view the facts and

circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion, that the respondents must,

thus, be held to be bound by the doctrine of promissory estoppel.



</p><p id="p_150">43.   For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment is set aside.

The appeal is allowed. However, in view of the fact that the appellant had

instructed the Senior Counsel not to appear in the matter despite the fact that

the same was heard in part, we not only deny cost to it but also direct that

the appellant must pay a sum of rupees one lakh to the Kerala State Legal

Services Authority within four weeks from date.
