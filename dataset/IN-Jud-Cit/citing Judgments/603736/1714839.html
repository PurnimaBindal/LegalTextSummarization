HEADNOTE:
     The States of Orissa, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh levied a
cess  which  was based on the royalty  derived	from  mining
lands.	The  cess  was levied by  these	 States under  their
respective statutes viz. Orissa Cess Act, 1962, Bengal	Cess
Act,  1880  (as applicable to the State	 of  Bihar),  Madhya
Pradesh	 Upkar	Adhiniyam 1981 and Madhya  Pradesh  Karadhan
Adhiniyam, 1982.
     The assesses challenged the constitutional validity  of
the  cess by filing various petitions in the High  Courts of
Orissa declared the cess unconstitutional on the ground that
it  was	 beyond	 the legislative  competence  of  the  State
Legislatures, but rejected the prayer of the assessees for a
direction to the State to grant refund of the cess collected
from the assessees. Against the decision of the Orissa	High
Court the assessees have filed appeal in this Court  whereas
the State of Orissa has filed a cross-appeal. The High Court
of   Madhya   Pradesh  also  declared  the  levy   of	cess
unconstitutional  on  the  ground that	it  was	 beyond	 the
legislative  competence of the State  legislature.   Against
the  decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court the State  of
Madhya	Pradesh has filed an appeal in this Court.   On	 the
other  hand  the  High Court of	 Patna	dismissed  the	writ
petition of the assessee.  Against the decision of the Patna
High Court the assessee has filed an appeal in this court.
     In appeal to this court, it was contended on behalf  of
the  State  of	Orissa;	 that (i) the  levy  of	 cess  being
referable to Entries 45, 49 and 50 of the State List of	 the
Seventh	  Schedule   of	 the   Constitution   the   impugned
legislation  was  within the legislative competence  of	 the
State  legislature;  (ii)  the limitations  imposed  in	 the
statute on the modes of utilisation of cess supports a	view
that  the  cess is fee on which the   State  legislature  is
competent to legislate under Entry 23 read with Entry 66  of
the  State List; (iii) since the impugned Act  was concerned
with the raising of funds to enable panchayats and  Samithis
to discharge their responsibilities of local  administration
and  take  steps for proper development of  the	 area  under
their  jurisdiction, the impugned legislation was  referable
to  Entry  5 of State List; and (iv) the  enactment  of	 the
Central Legislation viz. Mines and Minerals (Regulation	 and
<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_5">Development) Act</a>, 1957 has not denuded the State legislation
of  its competence to enact the impugned  legislation  since
the  scope  and subject matter of the two  legislations	 are
entirely  different and the impugned State Legislation	does
not   encroach	upon  the  field  covered  by  the   Central
Legislation i.e. 1957 Act.
						       107
     On	 behalf of the assessees it was contended inter alia
that  (i)  all	the State levies were ultra  vires  for	 the
reasons	 given by this Court in the India Cement case;	(ii)
the  State cannot seek to sustain the levy under the  Bengal
Cess Act 1880 by relying on <a href="/doc/300888/" id="a_6">Article 277</a> of the Constitution;
and  (iii) the levy being unconstitutional the Court  should
direct	the  States to refund the cess	collected  from	 the
assessees  because  (a)	 a  refund  is	the  automatic	 and
inevitable  consequence of the declaration of invalidity  of
tax  and (b) the States have given undertakings before	this
Court  that they would refund the amount collected  in	case
the levy is declared invalid by this Court.
     Disposing of the appeals, this Court,
     HELD: 1. The levy of cess under sections 5 to 7 of	 the
Orissa Cess Act, 1962 is beyond the competence of the  State
Legislature. [169B]
     1.1. A royalty or the tax thereon cannot be equated  to
land  revenue.	Therefore the cess cannot be  brought  under
Entry 45 of List II. [142D]
     <a href="/doc/1907642/" id="a_7">India  Cement  &amp; Ors. v. State of Tamil  Nadu  &amp;  Ors</a>.,
[1990] 1 S.C.C. 12, followed.
     1.2  A tax on royalties cannot be a tax on minerals and
is  outside  the  purview  of Entry  50	 of  List  II.	Even
otherwise, the competence of the State Legislature under the
said  Entry is circumscribed by "any limitations imposed  by
Parliament  by	law relating to	 mineral  development".	 The
Mines and Minerals (Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_8">Development) Act</a>, 1957 is
a  law	of Parliament relating to  mineral  development	 and
<a href="/doc/1302057/" id="a_9">Section 9</a> of the said Act empowers the Central Government to
fix,  alter, enhance or reduce the rates of royalty  payable
in respect of minerals removed from the land or consumed  by
the  lessee,  Sub-Section (3) of <a href="/doc/1302057/" id="a_10">Section 9</a> in  terms  States
that the royalties payable under the Second Schedule to that
Act shall not be enhanced more than once during a period  of
three  years.  This is a clear bar on the State	 legislature
taxing	royalty	 so  as,  in effect,  to  amend	 the  Second
Schedule  to  the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_11">Central Act</a>.	 This is  exactly  what	 the
impugned  Act does.  Therefore the validity of the  impugned
Act  cannot be upheld by reference to Entry 50 of  List	 II.
And if the cess is taken as a tax falling under Entry 50  it
will be ultra vires in view of the provisions of the Central
ACt. [144B, 153B-D, 168D]

explained.
     1.3 There is a difference in principle between a tax on
royalties  derived from land and a tax	on land measured  by
reference  to  the  income derived  therefrom.	 A   tax  on
buildings  does	 not cease to be such merely because  it  is
quantified on the basis of the income it fetches. But in the
impugned legislation the levy is not measured by the  income
derived	 by the assessee from the land, as is the case	with
lands other than mineral lands.	 The measure of the levy  is
the royalty paid, in respect of the land, by the assessee to
his  lessor which is quite a different thing.  The  impugned
statute only purports to levy a cess on the annual value  of
all land.  There is a clear distinction between tax on	land
and tax on income arising from land.  The former must be one
directly  imposed  on  land, levied on land as	a  unit	 and
bearing	 a  direct  relationship to it.	 A  tax	 on  royalty
cannot	be  said  to be a tax directly on land	as  a  unit.
Hence  the cess is outside the purview of Entry 49 List	 II.

Act,  1920  and	 Section  3 of	the  Finance  Act  (Northern

     2. If the levy in question cannot be described as a tax
on  land, it cannot be described as fee with regard to	land
either. [169A]
     2.1   Section 10 of the Orissa Cess Act, 1962  earmarks
the  purposes of utilisation of only fifty per cent  of	 the
proceeds  of the cess and that, too, is limited to the	cess
collected  in  respect of "lands other than lands  held	 for
carrying  on mining operations".  Therefore the levy  cannot
be correlated to any services rendered or to be rendered  by
the  State  to the class of persons from whom  the  levy  is
collected.  Accordingly the levy cannot be treated as a	 fee
which  the State legislature is competent to  legislate	 for
under entry 66 of the State List. [153E-F]
     2.2   Even assuming that the levy is a fee,  the  State
legislature  can impose a fee only in respect of any of	 the
matters in the State List.  The
						       109
entry  relied upon for this purpose i.e. Entry 23 is  itself
"subject  to  the  provisions  of List	I  with	 respect  to
regulation and development" of mines and minerals under	 the
control	 of the Union. Under Entry 54 of List I,  regulation
of  mines  and	mineral	 development  is  in  the  field  of
parliamentary  legislation  "to	 the extent  to	 which	such
regulation and development under the control of the Union is
declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the  public
interest".  Such a declaration is contained in <a href="/doc/276791/" id="a_18">Section 2</a>  of
the  Mines  and Minerals (Regulation and  <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_19">Development)	Act</a>,
1957.  The validity of the impugned Act cannot be upheld  by
reference to Entry 23 List II. [153G-H, 154A, 168D]
     3.	  There is a difference between the 'object' of	 the
Act  and  its 'subject'.  The object of the levy may  be  to
strengthen  the	 finances of local bodies but  the  Act	 has
nothing	 to  do	 with  municipal  or  local  administration.
Accordingly  State's  reliance	on Entry 5  of	List  II  is
plainly too tenuous. [164D]
     4.	 The  answer  to  the  question	 whether  the  State
Legislature  was  denuded  of its competence  to  enact	 the
impugned  legislation  because	of  the	 Parliament   having
enacted the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and	<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_20">Development)
Act</a>, 1957 depends on a proper understanding of the scope  of
the  Act and an assessment of the encroachment made  by	 the
impugned  State	 legislation into the field covered  by	 it.
[161D]
     4.1 The mere declaration of a law of Parliament that it
is   expedient	for  an	 industry  or  the  regulation	 and
development  of miners and minerals to be under the  control
of  the Union under Entry 52 or entry 54 of List I does	 not
denude	the State legislatures of their	 legislative  powers
with respect to the fields covered by the several entries in
List  II  or  List  III. Particularly,	in  the	 case  of  a
declaration under Entry 54, this legislative power is eroded
only to the extent control is assumed by the Union pursuance
to  such  declaration  as  spelt  out  by  the	 legislative
enactment  which  makes	 the declaration.   The	 measure  of
erosion	 turns	upon the field of the  enactment  framed  in
pursuance of the declaration. [161E-F]
     4.2   In  assessing  the field covered by	the  Act  of
Parliament  in question, one should be guided not merely  by
the  actual provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_21">Central Act</a> or the rules	made
thereunder  but	 should also take into account	matters	 and
aspect which can legitimately be brought within the scope of
the said statute.  Viewed in this light and in the Light  of
the  provisions of the Bihar Cess Act the  conclusion  seems
irresistible  that  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_22">State Act</a> has  trespassed  into	 the
field covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_23">Central Act</a>
						       110
viz.  Mines  and Minerals (Regulation  and  Development)Act,
1957.[163F]
     4.3  The impugned legislation which stands impaired  by
the Parliamentary declaration under Entry 54, can hardly  be
equated	 to  the  law  for  land  acquistion  or   municipal
adminstration  which  are traceable  to	 different  specific
entries in List II or List III [163G-<a href="/doc/1464523/" id="a_24">H]

     5. Section 6 of the Bengal Cess Act, 1880	specifically
enacts	that  the  cess will be on royalty  from  mines	 and
quarries  and  on  the annual net  profit  of  railways	 and
tramways.   The	 further amendments to <a href="/doc/1062891/" id="a_46">Section	6</a>  have	 not
changed	 this  basic position. Though the  Section  referees
also  to  the  value  of  the  mineral-bearing	land,	that
furnishes  only	 the maximum upto which the cess,  based  on
royalty,  could go.  Therefore, the cess is levied  directly
on  royalties  from  mines  and	 quarries.   The   different
notifications issued by the State of Bihar under <a href="/doc/1062891/" id="a_47">section 6</a>
						       <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_48">111</a>
of  the	 Act determining the rate of cess on the  amount  of
rayalty of all minerals of the State place the matter beyond
all  doubt.   The levy is a percentage or  multiple  of	 the
royalty	 depending upon the kind of mineral and in the	case
of  iron  ore-the  method of extraction and  nature  of	 the
process	 employed.   There are no clear indications  in	 the
statute that the amounts are collected by way of fee and not
tax.  <a href="/doc/1302057/" id="a_49">Section 9</a> indicates that only a small percentage	goes
to  the	 district fund and the remaining forms part  of	 the
consolidated  fund of the State	 " for the  constrution	 and
maintenance of other works of public utility".	However, the
proviso	 does require at least ten percent to be  spent	 for
purposes   relating  to	 mineral  development.	  Even	 the
assumption  that the levy can be treated, in part, as a	 fee
and,  in  part, as a tax will not advance the  case  of	 the
respondents.  Therefore, the levy of cess sunder the  Bengal
Cess Act, 1880 is declared invalid. [169C-F,H,170A]

     6.	 The  levy of cess under section 11  of	 the  Madhya
Pradesh Upkar Adhiniyam, 1981 is not covered by Entry 49  or
Entry 50 of List II and is therefore, ultra vires., [172B]

(1989) M.P. 264 referred to.
     6.1   Under  Section  9  of  Madhya  Pradesh   Karadhan
Adhiniyam, 1982 the proceeds of the cess are to be  utilised
only  towards  the general  development	 of  mineral-bearing
areas.	Although there is no provision for the	constitution
of a separate fund for this purpose as is found in  relation
to  the cesses levied under Part II or Part III of  the	 Act
yet this consideration alone does not preclude the levy from
being  considered  as a fee.  The clear ear-marking  of	 the
levy  for  purposes connected with  development	 of  mineral
areas was rightly considered by
						       112
the  High  Court, as sufficient to treat it as a  fee.	 The
High  Court was also right in holding that such a fee  would
be  referable  to item 23 but out of bounds  for  the  State
Legislature,  after the enactment of the Mines and  Minerals
(Regulation and <a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_55">Development) Act</a>, 1957. [171F-H]
     Srinivasa	Traders	 v.  State,  [1983]  3	S.C.R.	843,
referred to.
     7.	 The grant of refund is not an automatic consequence
of a declaration of illegality i.e. where the levy of  taxes
is found to be unconstitutional, the Court is not obliged to
grant an order of refund.  Therefore a finding regarding the
invalidity  of	a  levy need  not  automatically  result  in
direction for a refund of all collections thereof made	made
earlier.   The	declaration regarding the  invalidity  of  a
provision and the determination of the relief that should be
granted in consequence thereof are two deferent things	and,
in  the	 latter sphere, the Court has, and must be  held  to
have,  a certain amount of discretion.	Once  the  principle
that  the Court has a discretion to grant or decline  refund
is recognised, the ground on which such discretion should be
exercised is a matter of consideration for the Court  having
regard to all the circumstances of the case.  The Court	 can
grant,	would  or  restrict  the relief	 in  a	manner	most
appropriate  to the situation before it is such a way as  to
advance the interests of justice.  The Court is entitled  to
refuse	the  prayer for good and valid reasons.	  Laches  or
undue  delay  or intervention of third	party  rights  would
clearly	 be one of those reasons.  Unjust enrichment of	 the
refundee may or may not be another.  Also there is no reason
why the vital interest of the State should not be a relevant
criterion for deciding that a refund should not be  granted.

     7.1  In the instant case though the levy of the cess is
unconstitutional, yet there shall be no direction to  refund
to the assessees of any amounts of cess collected until	 the
date  on  which	 the  levy in  question	 has  been  declared
unconstitutional.  This, in regard to the Bihar cases,	will
be  the date of this judgment i.e. 4.4.1991.  In respect  of
Orissa	and Madhya Pradesh cases the relevant date  will  be
the date on which the concerned High Court has declared	 the
levy  unconstitutional i.e.22.12.1989 in case of Orissa	 and
28.3.1986  in  case  of Madhya Pradesh.	 The  dates  of	 the
judgments of the appropriate High Court, may not  constitute
a declaration of law within the scope of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_56">Article 141</a> of	 the
Constitution,  but  it	cannot be gainsaid  that  the  State
cannot, on any ground of equity, be permitted to retain	 the
cess  collected	 on and after the date of the  High  Court's
judgment.   Accordingly the State should refund the  amounts
of  cess  collected  after the relevant	 dates	to  assesses
directly or in the Coalfields from whom they were collected,
with

interest at the rate directed by this Court or mentioned  in
the  undertaking from the date of the relevant	judgment  to
the  actual  date of repayment.	 The Coalfields,  when	they
get the refunds, should pass on the same to their customers,
the assessees.	[186F-G, 187B-C]

<p id="p_11">THE ISSUE
     The  validity  of the levy of a "cess",  based  on	 the
royalty	 derived from mining lands, by the States of  Bihar,
Orissa	and Madhya Pradesh is challenged in these  petitions
and  appeals.	A seven-Judge Bench of this Court  in  India
Cement, [1990] 1 S.C.C. 12 struck down a similar levy  under
a <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_75">Tamil Nadu Act</a> as beyond the legislative competence of the
State Legislature. The assessees, in the matters now  before
us,  claim  that  the issue here is  directly  and  squarely
governed  by  the above decision.  The State, on  the  other
hand,  claim  that the nature and character  of	 the  levies
imposed by them is totally different from that of the  Tamil
Nadu levy and that they are entirely within the scope of the
States' Legislative powers under the Constitution.  This  is
the  issue to be decided in these matters.  As the  impugned
enactments  of	Bihar, Orissa and  Madhya  Pradesh  mutually
differ	from one another in some respects,  they  will	need
separate consideration.	 However, the basic issue being	 the
same,  all these matters have been heard together and it  is
found  convenient  to  dispose of them all  by	this  common
judgment.  We may mention in passing that, initially,  these
matters	 were  listed before a Bench of two Judges  of	this
court.	It referred the matters on 17.8.1990 to the  learned
Chief  Justice for the constitution of a larger Bench.	 The
matters	 have  come  up	 before	 us  in	 pursuance  of	 the
directions of the Hon'ble Chief Justice.

     It	 will be convenient, at the outset, to refer to	 the

</p><p id="p_27">		      EARLIER HISTORY
     Before  proceeding	 to consider the provisions  of	 the
enactments  impugned, and the issues debated, before us,  it
is  necessary to set out certain earlier controversies	that
led to India Cement.
</p><p id="p_28">Hingir Rampur Case [1961-2 S.C.R. 537]
     As	 early	as in 1960, this Court had to  consider	 the
constitutional	 validity   of	the  Orissa   Mining   Areas
Development Fund Act, 1952 (Orissa Act XXVII of 1952). S.  3
of  the	 Act empowered the State  Government  to  constitute
mining areas whenever it appeared to the Government that  it
was necessary and expedient to provide amenities
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">							117</span>
life  communications, water supply and electricity  for	 the
better	development  of	 such areas or to  provide  for	 the
welfare	 of the residents or workers in areas  within  which
persons	 employed  in a mine or a group of mines  reside  or
work.  S.4  empowered  the State Government  to	 impose	 and
collect a cess or fee on the minerals extracted the rate  of
which was not to exceed 5% of the valuation of the  minerals
at the pit'smouth. S.5 provided for the constitution of	 the
Orissa	Mining Areas Development Fund. The proceeds  of	 the
cess  recovered	 in  pursuance	of  S.4	 along	with   other
subsidies  from	 Government,  local  authorities  and  other
public	subscriptions  were  credited to the  fund  and	 the
expenses for such collection debited thereto.  The fund	 has
to  be utilised to meet expenditure incurred  in  connection
with such development measures as the State Government might
draw up for the purposes above mentioned as well as for	 the
purposes  specified  in clauses (a) to (e) of  S.5(5).	 The
validity  of  this  levy  of  cess  was	 challenged  by	 the
petitioner  coal company in the Hingir Rampur case as  ultra
vires  the powers of the State Legislature because  (a)	 the
cess was not a fee but a duty of excise on coal which was  a
field covered by Entry 84 of List I in the Seventh  Schedule
and  repugnant to the Local Mines Labour Welfare  Fund	Act,
1947  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_76">(Central	Act</a> XXXII of 1947); and (b) even if  it	 was
treated	 as a fee relatable to Entries 23 and 66 of List  II
in  the Seventh Schedule, it was hit by Entry 54 of  List  I
read with the Mines and Minerals (Development &amp;	 <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_77">Regulation)
Act</a>,  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_78">(Central Act</a> LIII of 1948) (`the MMRD Act' for  short)
or  by	Entry  52  of  List  I	read  with  the	  Industries
(Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_79">Regulation) Act</a> (`the IDR Act' for  short),
1951  (Central	ACt LXV of 1951).  The first  of  the  above
arguments was based on the fact that the cess was fixed at a
percentage  of	the valuation of the  mineral  concerned  at
pit's mouth.  This argument was based on two considerations.
The  first related to the form and the second to the  extent
of  the levy. Repelling the argument, it was held  that	 the
extent of levy of a fee would always depend upon the  nature
of  the services intended to be rendered and  the  financial
obligations incurred thereby and cannot by itself alter	 the
character  of  the  levy from a fee into the of	 a  duty  of
excise	except	where the correlation between the  levy	 and
services  is  not  genuine  or real or	where  the  levy  is
disproportionately  higher  than  the  requirements  of	 the
services  intended  to	be rendered.  So far  as  the  first
consideration was concerned, it was observed that the method
in which the fee is recovered is a matter of convenience and
by  itself  it cannot fix upon the levy the character  of  a
duty  of  excise.  Though the method in which an  impost  is
levied	may  be relevant in determining	 its  character	 its
significance  and effect cannot be exaggerated.	 The  court,
therefore,  came to the conclusion that the cess  levied  by
the impugned act was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">						       118</span>
neither a tax nor a duty of excise but a fee.
</p><p id="p_29">     The  second argument turned on the impact of  the	MMRD
Act  on the State's power to levy a fee under Entry 66	read
with Entry 23 of List II as a consequence of the declaration
contained in S.2 of the Central Act.  The Court agreed	that
a  declaration by Parliament in terms of Entry 54 of List  I
operated  as a limitation on the legislative  competence  of
the State Legislature itself and observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "if  Parliament  by  its  law	 has  declared	that
	  regulation  and  development of  mines  should  in
	  public interest be under the control of the Union,
	  to the extent of such declaration the jurisdiction
	  of  the State Legislature is excluded.   In  other
	  words,  if  a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_80">Central Act</a> has	 been  passed  which
	  contains  a declaration by Parliament as  required
	  by  Entry 54, and if the said	 declaration  covers
	  the  field  occupied	by  the	 impugned  Act,	 the
	  impugned  Act would be ultra vires not because  of
	  any  repugnance  between  the	 two  statutes	 but
	  because the State Legislature had no	jurisdiction
	  to pass the  law."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">					  (underlining ours)
However, the answer to the argument was easily found by	 the
Court  inasmuch as the declaration on the terms of Entry  54
of List I relied on for the coal company was founded on	 Act
LIII  of 1948 which was an Act of the Dominion	 Legislature
and  not  an Act of Parliament. However, the Court  did	 not
stop here.  It proceeded to review the provisions of Central
ACt  LIII of 1948 and concluded that, if this Act were	held
to  contain the declaration referred to in Entry  23,  there
would  be  no  difficulty in holding  that  the	 declaration
covered	 the  field  of	 conservation  and  development	  of
minerals, and that the said field was indistinguishable from
the  field covered by the impugned Act.	 In coming  to	this
conclusion the Court pointed out that the rule-making powers
conferred  on the Central Government under <a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_81">Section  6(2)</a>  of
the Act included the levy and collection of royalties,	fees
and taxes in respect of minerals, mines, quarried  excavated
or  collected.	The circumstance that no rules had  in	fact
been framed by the Central Government in regard to the	levy
and collection of any fees, it was held, would not make	 any
difference, The Court observed:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	  "What	 Entry 23 provides is that  the	 legislative
	  competence of the State Legislature is subject  to
	  the	provisions  of	List  I	 with	respect	  to
	  regulation and development under the con-
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">						       119</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">	  trol of the Union, and Entry 54 in List I requires
	  a declaration by Parliament by law that regulation
	  and  development  of	mines should  be  under	 the
	  control   of	 the  Union  in	  public   interest.
	  Therefore,  if a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_82">Central Act</a> has been	 passed	 for
	  the purpose of providing for the conservation	 and
	  development  of minerals, and if it  contains	 the
	  requisite  declaration,  then	 it  would  not	  be
	  competent to the State Legislature to pass an	 Act
	  in  respect of the subject-matter covered  by	 the
	  said	declaration.  In order that the	 declaration
	  should be effective it is not necessary that rules
	  should be made or enforced; all that this required
	  is   a  declaration  by  Parliament  that  it	  is
	  expedient  in	 the  public interest  to  take	 the
	  regulation  and  development of  mines  under	 the
	  control  of  the Union.  In such a case  the	test
	  must be whether the legislative declaration covers
	  the  field or not.  Judged by this test there	 can
	  be no doubt that the field covered by the impugned
	  Act is covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_83">Central Act</a> LIII of 1948."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">The Court then considered the argument based on Entry 52  of
List  I	 and the provisions of the IDR Act but came  to	 the
conclusion  that the vires of the impugned Act could not  be
successfully challenged on this ground.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     Wanchoo  J., delivered a separate dissenting  judgment.
</blockquote><p id="p_30">He  held  that the levy was not a fee or a land cess  but  a
duty of excise. He pointed out (at p-579-80) how taxes could
be turned into fees on the so-called basis of quantification
with the help of the device of creating a fund and attaching
certain	 services to be rendered out of monies in the  fund.
In  this view, he did not consider the question how far	 the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_84">Central	  Act</a>s	of  1948  and  1951  impaired  the   State's
competence  to levy the fees in question.  He negatived	 the
State's	 attempt to bring the levy in question (treating  it
as  a tax) within the scope of Entry 50 of List II.  He	 was
of  opinion that the expressions "taxes on  mineral  rights"
referred  to taxes on the right to extract minerals and	 not
taxes on the minerals actually extracted.  He held that	 the
cess in the present case was not a tax on mineral rights but
a  tax	on  the	 minerals  actually  produced.	 It  was  no
different  in  pith  and substance from a  a  tax  on  goods
produced  which	 comes under Item 84 of List I	as  duty  of
excise.
</p><p id="p_31">Tulloch case [1964] 4 SCR 461.
</p><p id="p_32">     The  same issue regarding the competence of the  Orissa
State  Legislature  to levy the very same cess came  up	 for
consideration again
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">						       120</span>
in  the Tulloch case.  The scenario had changed because	 the
levy  now challenged was in respect of the period July	1957
to March, 1958 by which time the MMRD Act, 1957 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_85">(Central Act
(Central Act</a> LIII of 1948).  The 1948 Act, which had earlier
provided for the regulation of mines and oil fields and	 for
the  development  of minerals, was now limited only  to	 oil
fields and the 1957 Act provided for the regulation of mines
and  mineral  development.  S.2 of the 1957  Act,  like	 the
predecessor 1948 Act, contained the following declaration in
terms of Entry 54 of List I.  It read:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	  "It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the
	  public  interest that the Union should take  under
	  its  control	the  regulation	 of  mines  and	 the
	  development of minerals to the extent	 hereinafter
	  provided".
</blockquote><p id="p_33">but unlike the earlier one this was a declaration  contained
in   an Act of Parliament which had the effect of  impairing
the legislative competence of the State under Entry 23	read
with Entry 66 of the State List.  The hurdle which prevented
the  Supreme  Court from considering the provisions  of	 the
1948 Act as a bar to the levy of the cess was therefore	 out
of the way.  The Court analysed in detail the provisions  of
the impugned <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_86">State Act</a> as well as the two <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_87">Central Act</a>s.	  It
referred  to its conclusion in the Hingir-Rampur  case	that
the  field covered by the impugned <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_88">State Act</a> was covered  by
the  1948  Act and observed that this fully applied  to	 the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_89">State  Act</a> vis-a-vis the 1957 Act also, particularly as	 Ss.
18(1)  and  (2)	 of the 1957 Act were  wider  in  scope	 and
amplitude  and	conferred  larger  powers  on  the   Central
Government  than  the corresponding provisions of  the	1948
Act.   Counsel	for the State attempted to  distinguish	 the
ambit  of  the 1957 Act from that of the 1948 Act.  But	 the
Court pointed out that the argument could not prevail. S. 13
of the 1957 Act contained an express provision for the	levy
of  a fee. S. 25-though not as categorically as<a href="/doc/62870779/" id="a_90"> s. 6</a> of	 the
1948  Act-clearly  implied a power to levy  "rent,  royalty,
tax, fee and other sums" a nd, besides,<a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_91"> S. 18</a> of the Central
Act of 1957 were wider in scope and amplitude and  conferred
larger	 powers	  on  the  Central   Government	  than	 the
corresponding  provisions  of  the  Act	 of  1948.   It	 was
reiterated,  referring to Hingir-Rampur	 and  distinguishing
Ch.  Tika Ramji &amp; Ors. etc. v. The State of Uttar Pradesh  &amp;
Ors., [1956] S.C.R. 393 that it was incorrect to think that,
until rules were made under<a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_92"> S. 13</a> or steps taken under	S.25
to  collect fees etc., the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_93">Central Act</a> would not  cover	 the
field.	The Court observed, further:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">						       121</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">	  "But	even  if  the matter  was  res	integra	 the
	  argument  cannot be accepted.	  Repugnancy  arises
	  when two enactments both within the competence  of
	  the	two  Legislatures  collide  and	  when	 the
	  Constitution expressly or by necessary implication
	  provides that the enactment of one legislature has
	  superiority  over the other then to the extent  of
	  the repugnancy the one supersedes the other.	 But
	  two enactments may be repugnant to each other even
	  though  obedience  to	 each of  them	is  possible
	  without  disobeying  the other.  The test  of	 two
	  legislations	containing contradictory, for  if  a
	  competent  legislature  with a  superior  efficacy
	  expressly or impliedly evinces by its	 legislation
	  an  intention	 to  cover  the	 whole	field,	 the
	  enactments of the other legislature whether passed
	  before  or after would be overborne on the  ground
	  of  repugnance.  Where such is the  position,	 the
	  inconsistency	 is demonstrated not by	 a  detailed
	  comparison  of provisions of the two statutes	 but
	  by  the  mere	 existence  of	the  two  pieces  of
	  legislation.	 In the present case, having  regard
	  to  the terms of<a href="/doc/78068651/" id="a_94"> s. 18(1)</a> it appears clear  to  us
	  that the intention of Parliament was to cover	 the
	  entire  field and thus to leave no scope  for	 the
	  argument  that until rules were framed, there	 was
	  no inconsistency and no supersession of the  <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_95">State
	  Act</a>".
</blockquote><p id="p_34">Meeting	 the  argument that the power to levy a fee  was  an
independent  head  of legislative power under  each  of	 the
three  legislative lists and that the levy of tax undue	 the
<a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_96">State  Act</a> could be traced to this entry, the Court  pointed
out  the  fallacy underlying the argument in  the  following
words:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	  "The materials words of the Entries are: "Fees  in
	  respect  of any of the matters in this List".	  It
	  is,  therefore,  a  prerequisite  for	 the   valid
	  imposition  of  a fee that it is in respect  of  a
	  "matter  in  the  list".   If	 by  reason  of	 the
	  declaration  by  Parliament  the  entire  subject-
	  matter   of  "conservation  and   development	  of
	  minerals"  has  been taken over, for	being  dealt
	  with	by Parliament, thus depriving the  State  of
	  the power which it theretofore possessed, it would
	  follow that the "matter" in the State List is,  to
	  the extent of the declaration, subtracted from the
	  scope	 and  ambit of Entry 23 of the	State  List.
	  There	 would, therefore, after the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_97">Central Act</a>  of
	  1957, be "no matter in the List" to which the fee
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">						      122</span>
	  could be related in order to render it valid."</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">     The  result was that Tulloch declared the levy  of	 the
cess  to  be  invalid  and it was held	that,  as  and	from
1.6.1958,  the date on which the 1957 Act came	into  force,
the  Orissa  Act should be deemed to  be   non-existent	 for
every purpose.
</p><p id="p_36">Murthy case [1964-6 S.C.R 666]
     We	 now come to the third important case on the  topic,
<a href="/doc/21773/" id="a_98">Murthy	v.  Collector of Chittoor</a>, which seems to  strike  a
somewhat different note although in both Tulloch and  Murthy
the  judgments	were delivered within a few  month  of	each
other by Rajagopala Ayyangar J. on behalf of 5-Judge Benches
which were constituted differently.
</p><p id="p_37">     The erstwhile Province of Madras (later State of  Tamil
Nadu)  had been levying, since long, a cess on land  revenue
under  the  Madras District Boards Act (Madras Act  XIV)  of
1920.	Under  S.78  of the Act, a cess was  levied  on	 the
annual	rent value of all occupied lands on whatever  tenure
held.  It was a tax at two annas in the rupee of the  annual
rent  value of all lands ins the district.  The annual	rent
value  of  the	land  was to be	 calculated  in	 the  manner
prescribed  in S.79 of the Act.	 The appellant held  certain
lands under a mining lease (for extraction of iron ore) from
the  Government	 which	stipulated  for	 the  payment  of  a
stipulated  amount of dead rent, a royalty on the  basis  of
every ton of ore mined as well as a surface rent per acre of
the  surface  area occupied or used.  In the  case  of	such
lands,	S.79(i) provided that "the lease amount, royalty  or
other sum payable to the Government for the lands" shall  be
taken  to  be  the  such  lands,  annual  rent	value.	 The
appellant was, therefore, called upon to pay a cess based on
the  royalty paid by him to the State Government (of  Andhra
Pradesh,  which	 had  succeeded to the State  of  Madras  in
respect	 of  the  territories in question) and	it  was	 the
validity  of  this levy which was upheld by the	 High  Court
that came up for the consideration of this Court.
</p><p id="p_38">     It	 was contended, on behalf of the appellant,  relying
on  Hingir-Rampur and Tulloch, that the	 provision  imposing
land cess quoad royalty must be held to be repealed by	MMRD
Act of 1948 or, in any event, by the MMRD Act, 1957 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_99">(Central
Act</a>  LXVII  of	1957) and that, after the  date	 when  these
enactments  came  into force, the land cess  that  could  be
levied	must be exclusive of royalty under a  mining  lease.
Distinguishing the decisions cited, this Court rejected	 the
contention.  It observed:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">						       123</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "It  will  be seen that there is  no	resemblance,
	  whatever, between the provision of the Orissa	 Act
	  considered in the two decisions and the  provision
	  for the levy of the land cess under<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_100"> ss. 78</a> and  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_101">79</a>
	  of the Act with which we are concerned.   <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_102">Sections
	  78</a> and <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_103">79</a> have nothing to do and are not concerned
	  with	the  development of mines  and	minerals  or
	  their	 regulation.  The proceeds of the land	cess
	  are, under s.92 of the Act, to be credited to	 the
	  District fund, into which, under the terms of	 the
	  Finance Rules	 in s. V  to the  Act, the land-cess
	  as well as several other taxes, fees and  receipts
	  are  directed to be credited.	 This fund is to  be
	  used	under  Ch. VII of the Act with	which  s.112
	  starts "for everything necessary for or  conducive
	  to the safety, health, convenience or education of
	  the inhabitants or the amenities of the local area
	  concerned   and  everything  incidental   to	 the
	  administration"  and	include	 in  particular	 the
	  several  matters  which  are	mentioned  in  those
	  sections.   It will thus be seen that there is  no
	  connection between the regulation and	 development
	  of  mines  and collection of land-cess  for  which
	  provision  is	 made by ss.78 and 79  of  the	Act.
	  There	 is  therefore	no  scope  at  all  for	 the
	  argument that there is anything in common  between
	  the  Act and the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_104">Central Act</a>s of 1948 and 1957  so
	  as  to require any detailed examination  of  these
	  enactments  for discovering whether there  is	 any
	  over-lapping"
</blockquote><p id="p_39">A second contention raised before the Court was that, as the
impugned  land-cess  was payable only in the  event  of	 the
lessee	winning	 the mineral and not when no  minerals	were
extracted,  it was in effect a tax on the minerals won	and,
therefore,  on mineral rights.	Rejecting  this	 contention,
the Court observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">	  "We  are  unable to accept this argument.  When  a
	  question   arises  as	 to  the  precise  head	  of
	  legislative power under which a taxing statue	 has
	  been	passed, the subject for enquiry is  what  in
	  truth and substance is the nature of the tax.	  No
	  doubt, in a sense, but in a very remote sense,  it
	  has relationship to mining as also to the  mineral
	  won  from  the  mine under  a	 contract  by  which
	  royally  is  payable on the  quantity	 of  mineral
	  extracted. But that does not stamp it as a tax  on
	  either  the  extraction of the mineral or  on	 the
	  mineral right.  It is unnecessary for the  purpose
	  of this case
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">							124</span>
	  to  examine the question as to what exactly  is  a
	  tax  on mineral rights seeing that such a  tax  is
	  not  leviable by Parliament but only by the  State
	  and  the sole limitation on the State's  power  to
	  levy the tax is that it must not interfere with  a
	  law	made  by  Parliament  as   regards   mineral
	  development.	Our attention was not invited to the
	  provision  of any such law enacted by	 Parliament.
	  In  the context of ss.78 and 79 and the scheme  of
	  those	 provisions it	is clear that the land	cess
	  is in truth a "tax on land" within Entry 49 of the
	  State List".</blockquote>
<p id="p_40">					    (emphasis added)
The  Court proceeded to explain why the land cess before  it
was nothing else except a land tax falling within Entry 49.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	  "Under <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_105"> s. 78</a>	 of the Act the cess  is  levied  on
	  occupied land on whatever tenure held.  The  basis
	  of  the levy is the "annual rent value" i.e.,	 the
	  value of the beneficial enjoyment of the property.
	  This being the basis of the Tax and disclosing its
	  true nature, s.79 provides for the manner in which
	  the  "annual rent value" is determined i.e.,	what
	  is the amount for which the land could  reasonably
	  be let, the benefit to the lessor representing the
	  rateable value "or the annual rent value".  In the
	  case of ryotwari lands it is the assessment  which
	  is payable to the Government that is taken as	 the
	  rental value being the benefit that accrues to the
	  Government.  Where the land is held under lease it
	  is  the lease amount that forms the basis.   Where
	  land is held under a mining lease, that which	 the
	  occupier is willing to pay is accordingly  treated
	  as the "annual rent value" of the property.	Such
	  a rent value would, therefore, necessarily include
	  not merely the surface rent, but the dead rent, as
	  well	as  the	 royalty payable  by  the  licensee,
	  lessee  or occupier for the user of the  property.
	  The position then is that the rent which a  tenant
	  might	 be expected to pay for the property is,  in
	  the  case of lease-hold interests, treated as	 the
	  statutory  "annual rent value".  It  is  therefore
	  not  possible to accept the contention,  that	 the
	  fact that the lessee or licensee pays a royalty on
	  the  mineral won, which extended only to the	mere
	  use  of the surface land, places it in a  category
	  different  from other types where the lessee	uses
	  the  surface of the land alone.  In each case	 the
	  rent
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">						       125</span>
	  which	 a lessee or licensee actually pays for	 the
	  land being the test, it is manifest that the land-
	  cess is nothing else except a land tax."</blockquote>
<p id="p_41">     The  judgment of the Supreme Court in the	Murthy	case

</p><p id="p_44">India Cement case [1990] 1 S.C.C. 12
     The correctness of the above line of decisions came  to
be tested in <a href="/doc/1907642/" id="a_109">India Cement Ltd. v. State</a>.  The Government  of
Tamil  Nadu and granted a mining lease on 19.7.1963  to	 the
appellant  for	extraction  of limestone and  kankar  for  a
period	of  twenty  years.  The lease  deed,  which  was  in
accordance with the Mineral Concession Rules, stipulated for
the payment of royalty, dead rent and surface rent and	also
provided  that the lessee was bound to pay all	Central	 and
State Government dues except land revenue.  At the time	 the
lease  was obtained, S.115(1) of the Madras Panchayats	Act.
1958  provided for the levy, in each  panchayat	 development
block,	of  a local cess at the rate of 45  paise  on  every
ruupee of land revenue payable to the Government in  respect
of any land for every fasli. S. 115(2) provided that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">						       126</span>
local  cess will be deemed to be public revenue and all	 the
lands  and buildings thereon shall be regarded	as  security
therefore. S 115(3) and (4) set out the various purposes for
which  the cess levied and collected under<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_110"> S. 115</a>  could  be
utilised.  S116	 provided  for	the levy  of  a	 local	cess
surcharge.   The  maximum  amount  of  such  surcharge	 was
originally  left to be prescribed by the Government and	 was
in  1970 limited to Rs.1.50 on every rupee of  land  revenue
and  in	 1972  to Rs.2.50 on every rupee  of  land  revenue.
Apparently  inspired  by the decision in Murthy,  the  Tamil
Nadu Panchayats (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
(Tamil	Nadu Act 18 of 1964) added, with full  retrospective
effect, the following Explanation to S.115(1):

</blockquote><p id="p_45">The  appellants' challenge in the High Court to	 this  levy-
which was consequent on the 1964 amendment-was unsuccessful.
The  High Court upheld it as a "tax on land"  measured	with
reference to land revenue, royalty or lease or other  amount
as  mentioned  in the Explanation.  The challenge  based  on
Entry  54  of List I read with Entry 23 of List II  and	 the
provisions of the MMRD Act, 1957 was also repelled, applying
the  decision  in  Murthy.  The appeal	to  this  Court	 was
referred  to  a	 Bench	of seven  Judges  who  came  to	 the
conclusion that Murthy dity of the levy of the cess.  It may
be  necessary to refer, in greater detail, to some  passages
in  the judgment later but it will be convenient,.  for	 the
present, to summarise the salient conclusions of the Court.
These were:
</p><p id="p_46">1.   The levy could not be supported under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     (a) Entry 45 of List II: as it is	not  a	tax  on land
     revenue,  an  expression  which  has  a  well   defined
     connotation.  `Land revenue' is separate  and  distinct
     from  `royalty.   The Explanation	to  S.115(1)  itself
     proceeds  on  the	basis that royalty  cannot  be	land
     revenue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">						       127</span>
     properly so called or conventionally so known.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">	  (b)  Entry  49 of List II: as it is not a  tax  on
     land.   A	tax on land can only be levied on tax  as  a
     unit, must be imposed directly on land and must bear  a
     definite	relationship  to  it.	There  is  a   clear
     distinction between a tax directly on land and a tax on
     income  arising  from  land.  The cess  is	 not  a	 tax
     directly  on land as a unit but only a tax	 on  royalty
     which is indirectly connected with land.  In the  words
     of	 Oza. J. it is a tax not only on land but on  labour
     and  capital as well.  It could have been treated as  a
     tax  on land if it had been confined to `surface  rent'
     instead of `royalty.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">	  (c)	Entry 50 of List II: as a tax on royalty  as
     it is not a tax on mineral rights and so is outside the
     purview  of  Entry	 50.  Even otherwise,  Entry  50  is
     subject to the provisions of List I and is,  therefore,
     subject  to  the  declaration  contained  in,  and	 the
     purview of, the MMRD Act  1957.
</blockquote><p id="p_47">2.    Even  if the cess is regarded as a  fee,	the  State's
competence  to	levy  the  same can,  if  at  all,  only  be
justified with reference to Entry 23 and Entry 50 of List II
but  this recourse is not available as the field is  already
covered by Central Legislation referable to Entry 54 of List
I.
</p><p id="p_48">3.    Murthy  was  not rightly decided.	  The  view  of	 the
Rajasthan,   Punjab,  Gujarat  and  Orissa   decisions	 was
overruled.   In	 the view taken by the	Court,	i.e.  Madhya
Pradesh ruling was not examined n detail, particularly as it
was said to be pending in appeal before the Supreme Court.
</p><p id="p_49">     In	 issue before us now are the levies of cesses  based
on  royalty from lands containing minerals by the States  of
Orissa,	 Bihar	and  Madhya  Pradesh.	Since  the  relevant
statutes vary in detail and the parties concerned have	also
taken  different stands, emphasising different aspects,	 the
arguments  have to be considered and dealt with	 separately,
We may, however, mention that the appeals before us  include
those in the cases of Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla (Orissa). land
Harilal Rameshwar Prasad (Madhya Pradesh) noticed earlier.
</p><p id="p_50">		   THE VARIOUS ENACTMENTS
ORISSA
     The invalidation in 1961 of Orissa Act XXVII of 1952 in
Hingir Rampur apparently rendered it necessary for the State
to bring in fresh
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">						       128</span>
legislation.   The  Orissa enactment with which we  are	 now
concerned  is the Orissa Cess Act (Orissa Act IIof 1962)  as
amended	 by Act 42 of 1976.  According to the  Statement  of
Objects	 and  Reasons  accompanying the	 bill,	the  primary
objective of the legislation is to condense and simplify the
existing  law on the subject by consolidating the  different
enactments, customs and usages relating to the levy of	cess
in  the State, to cure defects and deficiencies therein	 and
to  introduce uniformity in the levy of cess throughout	 the
State.	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_113">The Act</a> proposed to adopt a uniform rate of 25 paise
in  the rupee of the annual rental value and distribute	 the
entire gross collection among the zilla parishads, panchayat
samithis  (referred to as `samithis' in the Act)  and  grama
panchayats  in the ratio 5:8:12 respectively thus  providing
them  with  enhanced revenues to enable	 them  to  discharge
their statutory responsibilities more efficiently by  taking
up  development works and providing better amenities to	 the
people	of  the	 State.	 Its  principal	 provisions  are  as
follows:
</p><p id="p_51">     (i) Under <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_114">Section 4</a>, from and after the commencement of
the  Act, all lands (other than lands which were not  liable
to payment of rent or revenue before 1.4.77 and lands  which
were  subject  to  a  tax on land  holdings  sunder  a	1950
Municipal  Act) are made liable to the payment of  cess	 (in
addition  to  any  land	 revenue,  tax,	 cess  rate  or	 fee
otherwise payable in respect thereof) determined and payable
"as herein provided".  A 1976 amendment makes it clear	that
`lands held for carrying on mining operations" ar not exempt
from the cess.
</p><p id="p_52">     (ii)   The "rate of cess, assessment [and] fixation  of
cess year" are dealt with by S.5 which originally read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">	  "5.(1)  The cess shall be assessed on	 the  annual
	  value	 of  all  lands	 on  whatever  tenure	held
	  calculated in the manner hereinafter appearing.
	  (2) The rate per year at which such cess shall  be
	  levied  shall	 be  twenty five  percentum  of	 the
	  annual value of the land.
</blockquote>	  (3)	x    x	  x"
<p id="p_53">Sub-section(2) was amended by Act 13 of 1970 by substituting
of 50% in place of 25% but a 1982 amendment inserted S.5A to
provide	 that for a period 1.4.1977 to 31.3.1980,  the	cess
would  be  levied at 25% of the annual value in	 respect  of
lands held for carrying on mining

operations. S. 5 was again amended by Act 15 of 1988  w.e.f.
26.10.1988 to read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">	  "(2)	The rate at which such cess shall be  levied
	  shall be.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">	  a)  in case of lands held for carrying  on  mining
	  operations  in  relation to any mineral,  on	such
	  percentum of the annual value of the said lands as
	  specified against that mineral in Schedule II; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">	  b)  in case of other lands fifty percentum of	 the
	  annual value.
</blockquote><p id="p_54">Clause (a) was again amended by Act 17 of 1989 to read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">	  "(a)	in  the case of land held  for	carrying  on
	  mining operations in relation to any mineral, such
	  percentum  of	 the  annual  value  as	 the   State
	  Government may, by notification, specify from time
	  to time in relation to such mineral".
</blockquote><p id="p_55">It  will  thus be seen that, in place of a  fixed  rate,  an
elasticity  was	 provided for, initially, by  requiring	 the
rates  to  be  specified in  the  Schedule  differently	 for
different  minerals.  Schedule II prescribed the  percentage
which  the  cess  was  to bear	to  the	 annual	 value;	 the
percentages varied from 650% in the case of sand, to 300% in
the  case of coal, 200% in respect of certain minerals	such
as  iron ore, limestone, manganese ore (except	those  meant
for  export  or	 cement manufacture), 150% in  the  case  of
certain	 other	minerals and 100% in respect  of  the  rest.
Further elasticity was provided for in 1989 by leaving it to
the Government to vary the rates by a  simple  notification.
In consequence of this amendment, Schedule has been  omitted
and   a	 notification  has  been  issued   prescribing	 the
percentage of the royalty or the dead rent (as the case	 may
be)  that is to be levied as the cess in respect of  various
items of specified minerals.  The rates specified are  650%,
400%,  300%, 200% and 150%. In respect of all  minerals	 not
specified  in  the notification, the rate of cess is  to  be
100% of the royalty or dead rent.
</p><p id="p_56">     (iii)  S.6	 specifies the person by whom  the  cess  is
payable. In so far as is material for our present  purposes,
it directs that the cess is payable "(c) by a person for the
lands  he holds for carrying on mining operations and  shall
be paid by him to the Government".  This clause was inserted
in S.6 simultaneously with the amendment of S.5 by Act 42 of
1976.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">						       130</span>
<p id="p_57">	  (iv) "Annual value" is defined in S.7 thus:
	  "7.  Annual  Value-(1) The annual value  of  lands
	  held by a raiyat shall be the rent payable by such
	  raiyat to the land-lord immediately under whom  he
	  holds the land:
</p><p id="p_58">		 x    x	   x	x    x	  x
	  (2)  In  the case of lands held as an	 estate	 the
	  annual value shall be the aggregate of -
</p><p id="p_59">	  (a) the amount which the intermediary is  entitled
	  to receive on account of revenue or rent less	 the
	  amount payable by such intermediary as revenue  to
	  the intermediary immediately superior to him or to
	  the Government, as the case may be; and
</p><p id="p_60">	  (b) the rent, if any, payable held for carrying on
	  mining operations,  the annual value shall be	 the
	  royalty  or,	as the case may be,  the  dead	rent
	  payable   by	 the  person  carrying	 or   mining
	  operations(s) to the Government."
</p><p id="p_61">The  Explanation  to  the section defines  "dead  rent"	 and
"royalty"  in  terms  of  their	 definitions  in  the	MMRD
Act,1957.  It also states the "royalty" would  include	"any
payments made or likely to be make to the Government for the
right  of  raising  minerals from the land  which  shall  be
calculated  on every tone of such minerals  despatched	from
the  land at the same rate as prescribed under the said	 Act
or such other rate as may be fixed by the Government but not
exceeding the amount which would have been otherwise payable
as royalty under the said Act". Act 17 of 1989 also  amended
S.7(3) to red thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">	  "(3)	In  the case of lands held for	carrying  on
	  mining  operations, the annual value shall be	 the
	  royalty  or,	as the case may be,  the  dead	rent
	  payable   by	 the  person  carrying	 on   mining
	  operations(s) to the Government or the pit's mouth
	  value wherever it has determined".
</blockquote><p id="p_62">This was apparently intended to regulate the cess on coal in
respect of which the pit's mouth value had been	 determined.
So a notification
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">						       131</span>
dated  14.8.89	was  issued to	provide	 that  the  cess  in
respect	 of  coal bearing lands would be 30%  of  the  pit's
mouth value of the said mineral.
</p><p id="p_63">     (v) <a href="/doc/105251258/" id="a_115">Sections 8</a> to <a href="/doc/60685020/" id="a_116">9B</a> provide for the assessment of	 the
cess in respect of various cases. S.9B, inserted by the 1976
amendment, provided:

set  out in the Orissa Cess Rules, 1963.  Rule 6A,  inserted
in  1977,  deals with this but it is unnecessary for  us  to
consider  the details except to mention that it is  assessed
and  collected,	 along with the amount of  royalty  or	dead

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">						       139</span>
M.P.  High  Court in Hiralal Rameshwar Prasad v.  State	 and
other	connected   cases.  The	 Madhya	  Pradesh   Karadhan
Adhiniyam,  1982,  was	enacted by  State  Legislature	``to
provide for levy of school building cess, forest development
cess   and  mineral  areas  development	 cess  and   matters
incidental  thereto''.	Part II of the Act  deals  with	 the
school building cess. <a href="/doc/115038149/" id="a_139">Section 5</a> therein requires the  holder
of every holding of six hectares and above to pay the school
building  cess	as  provided therein. The  proceeds  of	 the
school building cess are required by S.4 to be credited to a
separate Fund supplemented by a State contribution equal  to
50% thereof and utilised for construction and furnishing  of
primary school buildings in non-urban areas. Part III of the
Act  deals  with  the forest  development  cess.  <a href="/doc/61089437/" id="a_140">Section  7</a>

rehabilitation	and  other purposes  connected	with  forest
development.  Then  comes Part IV dealing with	the  mineral

for  the  purpose of these appeals and it  is  the  charging
provision  therefor  contained in <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_141">Section 9</a> which  has	been

of cess. Rules have been framed under this Act called  ``The
Madhya Pradesh Mineral Areas Development Cess Rules, 1982''.
Rule  3 provided for the collection of the cess every  month

relevant  for  the purpose of these partitions and  read  as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">	  ``10.	 Application of cess: The  State  Government

</blockquote><p id="p_93">In  1985,  an  amendment  substituted  the  words  ``mineral
bearing''  for the words ``mining lease'' in this  rule.  It
will  be seen that, unlike the cesses referred to in Part  I
and  III,  the	Act did not provide for the  creation  of  a
separate  Fund for the mineral areas development  cess.	 The
manner	 of  utilisation  thereof  was	also  left  to	 the
discretion of the State Government though it had to be spent
for development of mineral bearing areas.

<p id="p_94">		      THE CONTENTIONS
ORISSA
     In the historical and statutory context set out  above,
the attempt of Sri T.S. Krishnamurthy Iyer, learned  counsel
for the State of Orissa to save the impugned legislation  of
the  State is two fold. First, he points out that  in  India
Cement	the statute, by Ss. 115 and 116, imposed a cess	 and
surcharge  on `land revenue' and the explanation to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_143"> s.	 115</a>
defined	 `land revenue' to mean `royalties'. In other  words
that  was a clear case of direct cess or Tax  on  royalties.
Here,  on the other hand, s.5 makes it clear that  what	 the
legislature has provided for is a tax assessed on the annual
value of all lands, on whatever tenure held, calculated at a
percentage  of	the annual value of the land.  S.  7,  which
defines `annual value', provides for different measures	 for
determining the annual value in respect of lands held  under
different  kinds of tenures; and, in the case of lands	held
for  mining operations, the measure of such annual value  is
the royalty or dead rent paid to the Government. On a proper
construction of the statute, he submits, the cess levied  is
a  cess or tax on land and the `royalty' is only taken as  a
measure for determining the quantum of tax. He contends that
India  Cement only forbids a cess or tax on royalty as	such
and not	 a  cess or tax on land, which may  be	measured  by
reference to the royalty derived from it. He presses in	 aid
of  his	 argument the well-marked  distinction	between	 the
subject	 matter of a tax and its measure  outlined,  amongst
others, in Ralla Ram's case [1948] F.C.R.207 at pp. 218, 224
and Bombay Tyre International v Union, [1984] 1 S.C.C.487 at
pp.  481-4. This argument, Sri Iyer contended, is  based  on
the statutory language used in the Orissa Cess Act, 1962 and
should prevail independently of the correctness or otherwise
of  Murthy, Secondly, he submitted that `royalty' is  not  a
tax  and  the cess on royalty is also not a tax but  only  a
fee.  This  view is supported, he said, by  the	 limitations
imposed	 in  the statute on the modes  of  its	utilisation.
Being a fee, the State Legislature's competence to impose it
has  to be determined with reference to Entry 23  read	with
Entry  66 of the State List. So doing, the validity  of	 the
levy  has  to  be upheld as, in	 counsel's  submission,	 the
declaration  contained in, and the provisions of,  the	MMRD
Act,  1957  do not, in any way whittle down or	impair	this
competence.
</p><p id="p_95">	  Basically, it will seen, two questions arise-
	  (1) Can the cess be considered as ``land revenue''
	  under Entry 45 or as a ``tax on land'' under Entry
	  49 or as a ``tax
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">						       142</span>
	  on  mineral rights'' under Entry 50 of  the  State
	  List?
</p><p id="p_96">	  (2)  If  the	answer to question  (1)	 is  in	 the
	  negative,  can the cess be considered to be a	 fee
	  pertaining to the field covered by Entry 23 of the
	  State	 List or has the State been denuded  of	 the
	  legislative competence under this Entry because of
	  Parliament having enacted the MMRD Act, 1957?
     Taking up the first question, the attempt to bring	 the
levy under Entry 45 of the State List proceeds in two steps.
First, land revenue is the sovereign's share of the proceeds
of  the land belonging to the sovereign and is	represented,
in  the case of land containing minerals, by the payment  of
royalty	 to  the  Government. Second,  the  cess,  being  an
accretion  to royalty, partakes of the same character.	This
argument,  however,  must fail in view	of  the	 categorical
observations  of  the Supreme Court in india  Cement,  (vide
paras  20  and 21) as to the connection	 of  the  expression
`land  revenues'. At  least, in India  Cement,	the  statute
sought	to  include  royalty within  the  meaning  of  `land
revenue'  but there is no such provision in the	 Orissa	 Act
and,  this  being so, royalty or the tax thereon  cannot  be
equated to land revenue. The cess here cannot be, therefore,
brought under Entry 45.
</p><p id="p_97">     Turning  next to Entry 50, though Murthy left open	 the
question how far a levy of this nature can be considered  to
be a tax on mineral rights (vide page 676), India Cement has
chosen	to  approve the contrary view of Wanchoo J.  in	 his
dissenting judgment in Hingir Rampur (para 30). Actually, it
appears	 that the observations of Wanchoo J. have  not	been
fully  examined. The learned Judge held that the tax in	 the
case  before him was not a tax on mineral rights because  it
was  levied on the value of the minerals extracted.  If	 his
observations  in this context are read as a whole, it  would
seem that he also was of opinion that a tax on royalty would
be a tax on mineral rights, for he observed (at pp. 582-3):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">	  `The	 next contention on behalf of the  State  of
	  Orissa  is that if the cess is not justified as  a
	  fee,	it is a tax under item 50 of List II of	 the
	  Seventy  Schedule. Item 50 provides for  taxes  on
	  mineral rights subject to any limitations  imposed
	  by   Parliament   by	law  relating	to   mineral
	  development. This raises a question as to what are
	  taxes	 on  mineral  rights.  Obviously,  taxes  on
	  mineral  rights  must be different from  taxes  on
	  goods produced in the nature of duties of  excise.
	  If
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">						       143</span>
	  taxes	 on  mineral rights also  include  taxes  on
	  minerals  produced, there would be  no  difference
	  between  taxes  on mineral rights  and  duties  of
	  excise  under item 84 of List I. A  comparison  of
	  List	I and II of the Seventh Schedule shows	that
	  the  same tax is not put in both the Lists.  There
	  fore,	 taxes on minerals rights must be  different
	  from duties of excise which are taxes on  minerals
	  produced. The difference can be understood if	 one
	  sees that before minerals are extracted and become
	  liable  to  duties of excise somebody has  got  to
	  work	the mines. The usual method of working	them
	  is  for  the	owner of the mine  to  grant  mining
	  leases  to those who have got the capital to	work
	  the mines. There should therefore be no difficulty
	  in holding that taxes on mineral rights are  taxes
	  on the right to extract minerals and not taxes  on
	  the  minerals	 actually  extracted.  Thus  tax  on
	  mineral rights would be confined, for example,  to
	  taxes	 on leases of mineral rights and on  premium
	  or  royalty  for that. Taxes on such	premium	 and
	  royalty  would  be taxes on mineral  rights  while
	  taxes on the minerals actually extracted would  be
	  duties  of  excise. It is said that there  may  be
	  cases	 where the owner himself  extracts  minerals
	  and  does  not  give any right  of  extraction  to
	  somebody  else  and  that in	such  cases  in	 the
	  absence of mining leases or sub-leases there would
	  be no way of leaving tax on mineral rights. It  is
	  enough  to say that these cases also, rare  though
	  they are, present no difficulty. Take the case  of
	  taxes on annual value of buildings. Where there is
	  a  lease  of	the building, the  annual  value  is
	  determined by	 the lease-money; but there are many
	  cases	 where owners themselves live in  buildings.
	  In  such cases also taxes on buildings are  levied
	  on  the  annual  value  worked  out  according  to
	  certain rules. There would be no difficulty  where
	  an  owner  himself  works the mine  to  value	 the
	  mineral  rights  on the same principles  on  which
	  leases of mineral rights are made and then to	 tax
	  the  royalty which, for example, the	owner  might
	  have got if instead of working the mine himself he
	  had  leased it out to somebody else. there can  be
	  no  doubt therefore that taxes on  mineral  rights
	  are taxes of this nature and not taxes on minerals
	  actually  produced. Therefore the present cess  is
	  not  a tax on mineral rights; it is a tax  on	 the
	  minerals actually produced. Therefore the  present
	  cess	is not a tax on mineral rights; it is a	 tax
	  on  the minerals actually produced and can  be  no
	  different in pith and substance from a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">						       144</span>
	  tax on goods produced which comes under Item 84 of
	  List	I,  as	duty of	 excise.  The  present	levy
	  therefore  under <a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_144"> s.	4</a>  of  the  Act	 cannot	  be
	  justified as a tax on mineral rights.
</blockquote><p id="p_98">However, the conclusion of India Cement is clear that a	 tax
on  royalties cannot be a tax on minerals and we  are  bound
thereby. This apart, we shall also advert, while  discussing
the  second  question, to another hurdle in the way  of	 the
State's attempt to have recourse to Entry 50, which has also
been touched upon by India Cement.
</p><p id="p_99">     Can,  then, the cess be described as a tax	 on  land''?
The Status considered in India Cement, as Sri Iyer correctly
points	out, was differently worded. It purported to levy  a
cess  on land revenue and `royalty' was brought	 within	 the
definition  of	that expression. It was	 therefore,  a	case
where they levy had no reference to land at all but only  to
the  income from the land, in the case of Government  lands,
got by way of land revenue or otherwise. Here the Statute is
different. The objective of the <a href="/doc/302871/" id="a_145">Cess Act</a> as set out earlier,
is  to levy a cess on all land. Indeed, originally the	idea
was to levy a uniform cess at 25% of the annual value of all
land which was subsequently raised to 50%. It is argued that
the  tax  here	is,  therefore, a tax  on  land	 and  it  is
immaterial that this tax is quantified with reference to the
income	yielded	 by the land. A tax on land may	 be  levied,
inter  alia  with  reference to its capital  value  or	with
reference to its annual value. One realistic measure of such
capital	 or  annual value will be the income that  the	land
will  yield just as, for property tax purposes,	 the  annual
value  is  based on the amount for which  the  property	 can
reasonably  let from year to year. The income from the	land
may be more or less due to a variety of reasons. In the case
of agricultural lands, it may depend on the fertility of the
soil,  the  sources of irrigation available, the  nature  of
crops grown and other such factors. Likewise, where the land
is  one	 containing minerals, naturally the  value  (whether
annual or capital value) will be more if it contains  richer
minerals  and can be legitimately measured by  reference  to
the royalties paid in respect thereof. the mere fact, it  is
argued, that the annual value is measured with reference  to
the  royalty, dead rent or pit's mouth value of the  mineral
does not mean that it ceases to have the character of a	 tax
on land. In this context, Sri Iyer places strong reliance on
the  decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in	Ajay
Kumar  Mukherjea v. Local Board of Barpeta,  [1965]3  S.C.R.
</p><p id="p_100">47.  There  a  local Board was	authorised  to	``grant....a
license	 for the use of any land as a market and  impose  an
annual	tax thereon''. The Court held, examining the  Scheme
and the language of the provision in question, that the	 tax
imposed was a tax
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">						       145</span>
on  land under Entry 49. The Court indicated  the  following
approach to the issue before it:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">	  ``The first question which falls for consideration
	  therefore  is	 whether the impost in	the  present
	  case is a tax on land within the meaning of  Entry
	  49  of  List	II of the Seventh  Schedule  to	 the
	  Constitution. It is well-settled that the  entries
	  in   the  three  legislative	lists  have  to	  be
	  interpreted interpreted in their widest  amplitude
	  and  therefore if a tax can reasonably be held  to
	  be  a	 tax on land it will come within  Entry	 49.</blockquote>
<p id="p_101">	  Further  it  is equally well-settled that  tax  on
	  land may be based on the annual value of the	land
	  and would still be a tax on land and would not  be
	  beyond the competence of the State legislature  on
	  the  ground that it is a tax on income: see  <a href="/doc/1546265/" id="a_146">Ralla
	  Ram  v.  The	Province  of  East  Punjab</a>,   [1948]
	  F.C.R.207.  it follows therefore that the  use  to
	  which the land is put can be taken into account in
	  imposing  a tax on it within the meaning of  entry
	  49 of List II, for the annual value of land  which
	  can certainly be taken into account in imposing  a
	  tax	for   the  purpose  of	this   entry   would
	  necessarily depend upon the use to which the	land
	  it  put.  It	is  in the  light  of  this  settled
	  proposition that we have to examine the scheme  of
	 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_147"> s.  62</a>  of  the  Act which  imposes  a  tax  under
	  challenge.''
     On the other hand, it is contended for the	 respondents
that,  whatever	 may have been the original  intention,	 the
true  and real impact of the cess is only on the  royalties.
It is said that, at any rate, after the amendments of  1976,
when  lands held for mining operations were  segregated	 for
levy  of separate and steep rates of cess based on  royalty,
the ostensible appearance of levying a tax on all land	with
reference  to  annual value has disappeared  and  a  direct,
undisguised tax on royalties from mining lands has taken its
place.	it  is urged that, for deciding whether the  tax  is
really a tax on land as in Murthy or whether it is really  a
tax on royalties which has been struck down in India Cement,
it is not the form or the statutory machinery that  matters;
one has to look at the real substance and true impact of the
levy.  If  this is done, it is said, there can be  no  doubt
that the cess impugned here suffers from the same vice	that
vitiated the levy in India Cement.

	  even	though the free flow of trade is impeded  in
	  its Government throughout the territory of  India,
	  it  is  in consequence of an	indirect  or  remote
	  effect of the levy and that it cannot be said that
	  <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_153">article 301</a> is contravened. The contention of	 the
	  petitioners  is,  however, that it  is  ostensibly
	  only in respect of tea estate but in fact it is  a
	  levy	on despatches of tea. If that contention  is
	  sound, there can be no doubt that it constitutes a
	  violation of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_154">article 301</a> unless the legislation is
	  brought  within  the scope of <a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_155">article	 304(b).</a>  To
	  determine  whether the levy is in respect  of	 tea
	  estates  or  is a levy on despatches of  tea,	 the
	  substance  of the legislation must be	 ascertained
	  from	the relevant provisions of the	statute.  It
	  cannot  be disputed that the subject of the  levy,
	  the  nature  of which defines the quality  of	 the
	  levy,	 must  not be confused with the	 measure  of
	  liability, that is to say, the quantum of the tax.
	  There	 is a plenitude of case law supporting	that
	  principle,  among the cases, being <a href="/doc/27891/" id="a_156">Union of  India
	  v. Bombay Tyre International</a>, [1984] 1 S.C.R.347.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">	  10.  But what is the	position  here?.........Now,
	  for	determining   the   true   nature   of	 the
	  legislation,	whether	 it  is	 a  legislation	  in
	  respect of tea estate and therefore of land, or in
	  respect of despatches of tea, we must, as we	have
	  said	take  all relevant provisions  into  account
	  and  ascertain the essential substance of  it.  It
	  seems to us that although the impugned  provisions
	  speak of a levy of cess in respect of tea estates,
	  what	is contemplated is a levy on  despatches  of
	  tea  instead.	 The entire structure  of  the	levy
	  points to that conclusion. If the levy is regarded
	  as  one in respect of tea estates and the  measure
	  of the liability is defined in terms of the weight
	  of  tea dispatched, there must be a nexus  between
	  the two indicating relationship between the  levy,
	  on the tea estate and the criteria for determining
	  the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">						       148</span>
	  measure of liability. If there is no nexus at	 all
	  it  can conceivably be inferred that the  levy  is
	  not	what  it  purports  to	be.  The   statutory
	  provisions for measuring the liability on  account
	  of the levy throws light on the general  character
	  of the tax as observed by the Privy Council in Re:
	  A  Reference under the Government of Ireland	Act,
	  1920	and Section 3 of the Finance  Act  (Northern
	  Ireland),  1934  [1963]  2  A.E.R.  III.  <a href="/doc/1448438/" id="a_157">In	R.R.
	  Engineering  Co.  v.	Zilla  Parishad,   Barielly</a>,
	  [1980] 3 SCR 1 this Court observed that the method
	  of determining the rate of levy would be  relevant
	  in  considering  the character of  the  levy.	 All
	  these	 cases	were  referred	to  in	Bombay	Tyer
	  International	 Ltd., [1984] 1 S.C.R. 347 where  in
	  the  discussion  on this point at  page  367	this

	  essential character of the levy can be regarded as
	  a  valid  basis for assessing the measure  of	 the
	  levy''.
</blockquote><p id="p_105">Applying  the above tests to the case before it,  the  Court
reached the conclusion that, in substance the impugned	levy
was  a	levy  in respect of despatches of  tea	and  not  in
respect	 of  tea estates. It was then pointed out  that	 the
question  of  legislative  competence also  turned  on	this
issue:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_75">	  ``If this impugned legislation were to be regarded
	  as  a levy in respect of the estates, it would  be
	  referable  to entry 49 in List II of	the  Seventh
	  Schedule of the Constitution which speaks  ``taxes
	  on  lands and buildings''. But if the	 legislation
	  is   in  substance  legislation  in	respect	  of
	  despatches  of tea, legislative authority must  be
	  found for it with reference to some other entry''
Pointing  out that no such entry in List II or III had	been
brought o its notice and further that, under S.2 of the	 Tea
Ct, 1953, control over the tea industry has been assumed  by
Parliament  within  the meaning of Entry 54 of List  I,	 the
Court  upheld the challenge to the competence of  the  State
legislature to levy the impugned cess. it is submitted that,
likewise, here the levy is one in substance on royalties and
not one on land.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_76">     There  is force in the contention urged by	 Sri  T.S.K.
</blockquote><p id="p_106">Iyer  that there is a difference in principle between a	 tax
on royalties derived
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">						       149</span>
from  land  and a tax on land measured by reference  to	 the
income	derived therefrom. That a tax on building  does	 not
cease  to  be such merely because it is	 quantified  on	 the
basis of the income it fetches is nowhere better illustrated
than  by  the form of the levy upheld in Ralla	Ram,  [1948]
F.C.R.	207 followed by Bhagwan Dass Jain, [1981] 2 SCR	 808
which illustrates the converse situation. Mukherjea  (supra)
also  supports this line of reasoning. But here the levy  is
not measured by the income derived by the assessee from	 the
land,  as is the case with lands other than  mineral  lands.
The  measure of the levy is the royalty paid, in respect  of
the  land,  by the assessee to his lessor which is  quite  a
different  thing. Moreover, interesting as the argument	 is,
we are constrained to observe that it is only a	 reiteration
of the ratio in Murthy which has been upset in India Cement.
We  may	 point	out that this is  of  significance  because,
unlike in India Cement, the statute considered in Murthy, as
the  one here, only purported to levy a cess on	 the  annual
value of all land. India Cement draws a ``clear	 distinction
between	 tax on land and tax on income arising from  land''.
The  former must be one directly imposed on land, levied  on
land  as a unit and bearing a direct relationship to it.  In
para 23 of the judgment, the Court has categorically  stated
that a tax on royalty cannot be said to be a tax directly on
land as a unit.
</p><p id="p_107">     Sri  Iyer	contended  that	 all  the  observations	 and
propositions in India Cement stem from the basic  conclusion
of  the	 Court	that the cess levied there  was	 a  cess  on
royalty	 in  view  of the Explanation to <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_158"> S.  115</a>.  He	also
submitted  that	 the  statue under  consideration  in  India
Cement	did  not provide for any cess in the  case  of	land
which did not yield any royalty; in other words, the Act did
not use dead rent as a basis on which land was to be valued.
He  drew attention to the observations of Oza, J.In para  42
of  India Cement that if the Explanation to<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_159"> S. 115</a> had	used
the words `surface rent' in place of `royalty' the  position
would  have  been  different and that, if  a  cess  on	such
`surface  rent'	 or  `dead rent' is  charged,  it  could  be
justified  as  a tax on land falling within the	 purview  of
Entry  49, Here, however, the position is different and	 so,
he  urged, the nature of the levy is also different. We	 may
have  considered these points as furnishing some  ground  to
distinguish  the present levy from that in india Cement	 but
for  the  Court's  specific disapproval of  Murthy.  We	 are
unable	to  accept the plea of Sri Iyer that,  in  spite  of
Murthy,	 he  can support the validity of the  levy,  as	 the
statute	 considered  in Murthy contained  exactly  the	same
features  as  are  here	 emphasised by	Shri  Iyer  and	 the
validity  of such Levy cannot be upheld after India  Cement.
As to the second contention based on the observations in the
judgment of Oza J., we may point out here the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">						       150</span>
levy  is  not one confined to dead rent or surface  rent  as
suggested by Oza J. but one on royalty which even  according
to Oza J. cannot be described as a tax on land.
</p><p id="p_108">     Sri  Iyer	contended  that	 unless	 the  case  of	 the
assessees  is  that  the statute is a  piece  of  colourable
legislation,  it  is not possible to construe  the  levy  on
mineral	 lands differently. He pointed out that S. 4 of	 the
Orissa Cess Act, 1962 levies a cess on all land and that, if
Sc.  7(1)  and (2) measuring the cess by  reference  to	 the
income	of other categories of land are valid, there  is  no
reason	why S.7(3) alone should be treated  differently	 and
objected to as imposing a tax on royalties particularly when
the levy also extends to dead rent.
</p><p id="p_109">     The  answer to this contention appears to be  that	 the
plea  of  the assessee need not go to the extent  of  saying
that  the levy is a colourable piece of legislation.  it  is
sufficient  to	restrict oneself to the issue  of  a  proper
determination of the pith and substance of the	legislation.
There is no doubt an apparent anomaly in considering<a href="/doc/61089437/" id="a_160"> S. 7(1)</a>
and  (2) as levying a tax on land but construing<a href="/doc/61089437/" id="a_161"> S. 7(3)</a>  as
imposing  a  tax  on royalties and  this  anomaly  has	been
noticed in India Cement (vide para 42). But the question is,
what is it that is really being taxed by the Legislature? So
far as mineral-bearing lands are concerned, is the impact of
the  tax  on  the land or on royalties? The  change  in	 the
scheme	of  taxation under S.7 in 1976; the  importance	 and
magnitude of the revenue by way of royalties received by the
State;	the charge of the cess as a percentage and,  indeed,
as  multiples  of the amount of royalty; and  the  mode	 and
collection  of the cess amount along with the royalties	 and
as part thereof are circumstances which go to show that	 the
legislation in this regard is with respect to royalty rather
than with respect to land.
</p><p id="p_110">     Sri  Iyer had invited our attention to the decision  of
this Court in R.R. Engineering Co. v Zila Parishad, [1980] 3
S.C.R.	1 which upheld the validity of a `circumstances	 and
property tax' levied by a Zila Parishad. The High Court	 had
held  this levy could not be traced to any entry other	than
the  residuary	Entry 97 of List I. This Court,	 on  appeal,
pointed out the distinction between a tax of this type and a
tax  on	 income. It held that the tax was  a  composite	 one
referable to Entry 49 (tax on lands and buildings), Entry 58
(taxes	on  animals  and  boats) and Entry  60	(tax  as  on
professions,  trades, callings and employments) of List	 II.
While  holding,	 therefore, that the ceiling of	 Rs.250	 per
annum referred to in Entry 60 would not be applicable to the
tax, the Court uttered a ``word of caution''.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">						       151</span>
<p id="p_111">	  ``The	 fact  that  one of the	 components  of	 the
	  impugned    tax,   namely,   the   component	  of
`circumstances' is referable to other entries in addition to
Entry 60, shall not be construed as conferring an  unlimited
charter	   on	 the	local	 authorities	to    impose
disproportionately excessive levies on the assessees who are
subject	  to  their  jurisdiction.  An	excessive  levy	  on
circumstances  will tend to blue the distinction  between  a
tax  on income and a tax on circumstances. income will	then
cease to be a mere measure or yardstick of the tax and	will
become the very subject matter of the tax. Restraint in this
behalf	will  be  a  prudent  prescription  for	 the   local
authorities to follow''.
</p><p id="p_112">While Sri Iyer sought to use this decision in support of his
contention  that  a  tax on  property  can  be	legitimately
measured on the basis of the income therefrom, we think	 the
observations  extracted	 above are very apposite  here.	 The
manner	in  which the levy, initially introduced  a  uniform
cess  on all land, was slowly converted, qua  mining  lands,
into  a	 levy computed at multiples of the  royalty  amounts
paid  by the lesses thereof seem to bear out the  contention
that it is being availed of as a tax on the royalties rather
than  one  on the annual value of the  land  containing	 the
minerals.  In the words of Chandrachud J. (as he  then	was)
one can legitimately conclude that royalty has ceased to  be
a  mere measure or yardstick of the tax and has	 become	 the
very subject matter thereof.
</p><p id="p_113">     For   the	reasons	 discussed  above,  we	 repel	 the
contention  of the State seeking to justify the	 levy  under
Entry 45, 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule.
</p><p id="p_114">     There has been considerable discussion before us as  to
whether	 `royalty' itself is a tax or not.  The	 controversy
before us centres round the discussion contained in paras 31
to  34	of  the	 India Cement  judgement.  Counsel  for	 the
assessees-respondents	invite	attention  to  the   opening
sentence  of para 34 which runs: ``In the aforesaid view  of
the  matter, we are of the opinion that royalty is  a  tax''
and  argue that this clinches the issue. On the other  hand,
Sri  Iyer  submits that this purported conclusion  does	 not
follow from the earlier discussion and is also	inconsistent
with  what  follows. He points out that though	there  is  a
reference  in para 27 to the conclusion of Venkataramiah  J.
in  a judgement of the Mysore High Court that royalty  under
S.9 of the MMRD Act is really a tax, and a reference in para
31 to the Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat and Orissa decisions to
the effect that royalty is not a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">						       152</span>
tax, there is no discussion, criticism or approval of any of
the  decision on this point and that, therefore,  the  first
sentence  of  para 34, relied upon for the  respondents,  is
non-sequitir.	He  submits  that,  perhaps,  there   is   a
typographical  error  in the first sentence of para  34	 and
that the sentence should really read thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_77">	  ``In	the aforesaid view of the matter, we are  of
	  opinion that cess is a tax, and as such a cess  on
	  royalty  being  a tax on royalty,  is	 beyond	 the
	  competence of the State Legislature........''
He  also points out that the last sentence of para 34  reads
thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_78">	  ``Royalty  on mineral right is not a tax  on	land
	  but a payment for the use of land''.</blockquote>
<p id="p_115">He submits, therefore, that this issue has not been  decided
in  India  Cement. He submits that, before  we	express	 any
opinion on this issue, we should consider the matter  afresh
and  places  before us extracts from  various  lexicons	 and
dictionaries to show that a royalty is nothing more than the
rent  or lease amount paid to a lessor in consideration	 for
the grant of a lease to exploit minerals. Reference may also
be made to the discussion in this respect in paras 35-<a href="/doc/1992295/" id="a_162">40  of
Trivedi &amp; Sons v. State of Gujarat</a>, [1986] Supp. S.C.C.	 20.
It is therefore, neither a fee nor a tax but merely a  price
paid for the use of mineral-bearing land.
</p><p id="p_116">     We do not think that it is necessary for us to  express
an  opinion either way on this controversy for, it seems  to
us,  it is immaterial for the purposes of the present  case.
If  royalty  itself  were to be regarded as a  tax,  it	 can
perhaps be described properly as a tax on mineral rights and
has  to	 conform  to the requirements of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_163"> S.  50</a>  which	 are
discussed  later. We are, however, here concerned  with	 the
validity of the levy of not royalty but of cess. If the cess
is taken as a tax, then, unless it can be described as	land
revenue	 or  a	tax on land or a tax on	 mining	 rights,  it
cannot be upheld under Entry 45, 49 or 50. On the  contrary,
if it  is treated to Entry 23, a proposition the  effect  of
which will be considered later. the question whether royalty
is  a  tax or not does not assist us much in  furnishing  an
answer	to the two questions posed in the present  case	 and
set out earlier. We shall, therefore, leave this question to
rest here.
</p><p id="p_117">     This  takes  us  to the second  question  posed  by  us
initially and this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">						       153</span>
turns	on  the	 effect	 of  M.M.R.D.  Act,  1957  and	 the
declaration   contained	 in  S.2  thereof  which  has	been
extracted earlier. This will arise if we treat the levy as a
tax falling under Entry 50 of List II or, alternatively,  as
a fee though it may not affect the State's competence if  it
can be attributed to Entry 49 of List II.
</p><p id="p_118">     To take up Entry 50 first, a perusal of entry 50  world
show  that  the	 competence of the  State  Legislature	with
respect	 thereto  is  circumscribed  by	 ``any	 limitations
imposed	  by   Parliament  by  law   relating	to   mineral
development''.	The M.M.R.D Act, 1957, is - there can be  no
doubt  about  this a law of Parliament relating	 to  mineral
development.  S.9  of  the said	 Act  empowers	the  Central
Government  to	fix, alter, enhance or reduce the  rates  of
royalty payable in respect of minerals removed from the land
or  consumed by the lessee. Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_164">Section 9</a>  in
terms  states  that the royalties payable under	 the  Second
Schedule  to  the Act shall not be enhanced more  than	once
during	a period of three years. India Cement has held	that
this is a clear bar on the State legislature taxing  royalty
so  as,	 in  effect, to amend the  Second  Schedule  to	 the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_165">Central	 Act</a> and that if the cess is taken as a tax  falling
under  Entry  50  it  will be ultra vires  in  view  of	 the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_166">Central Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_119">     It is possible, then, to treat the levy as a fee  which
the  State legislature is competent to legislate  for  under
Entry  66  of  the State List? Sri Iyer	 contends  for	this
position particularly on the strength of S.10 of the  Orissa
Cess  Act, 1962. There is one great difficulty in  accepting
this solution to the State's problem. S.10 as it stands	 now
earmarks  the purposes of utilisation of only fifty  percent
of the proceeds of the cess and that, too, is limited to the
cess  collected in respect of ``lands other than lands	held
for  carrying  on mining operations''. In other	 words,	 the
levy cannot be correlated to any services rendered or to  be
rendered by the State to the class of persons from whom	 the
levy is collected. Whether royalty is a tax or not, the cess
is only a tax and cannot be properly described as a fee.
</p><p id="p_120">     This  consideration apart, even assuming it is  a	fee,
the  State legislature can impose a fee only in	 respect  of
any of the matters in the State List. The entry in the State
List  that is relied upon for this purpose is Entry 23.	 But
Entry 23, it will be seen, is ``subject to the provisions of
List I with respect to regulation and development'' of mines
and minerals under the control of the Union. Under Entry  54
of List I, regulation of mines and mineral development is in
the  field of Parliamentary legislation ``to the  extent  to
which such regulation and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">						       154</span>
development  under the control of the Union is	declared  by
Parliament by law to be expedient in the public	 interest''.
Such a declaration is contained in S. 2 of the M.M.R.D. Act,
1957, which has been set out earlier. It, therefore,  follow
that  any State legislation to the extent it  encroaches  on
the  field covered by the M.M.R.D. Act, 1957, will be  ultra
vires.	The  assessees	contend,  in  this  case,  that	 the
legislation  in question is beyond the purview of the  State
legislature by reason of the enactment of the M.M.R.D.	Act.
It  would appear, prima facie that the contention has to  be
upheld on the basis of the trilogy of decisions referred  to
at the outset viz. Hingir-Rampur, Tulloch and India  Cement.
They seem to provide a complete answer to this question. The
argument  is, however, discussed at some length, because  it
has  been put forward, mutatis mutandis, in support  of	 the
levy of cess by the other State as well.
</p><p id="p_121">     Before dealing with the contentions of the counsel	 for
the  State  in	this behalf, a reference may be	 made  to  a
difference in wording between Entry 52 and Entry 54 of	List
I.  The	 languages  of Entry 52 read  with  Entry  24  would
suggest that, once it is declared by Parliament by law	that
the  control  of  a  particular industry  by  the  Union  is
expedient  in  the public interest, the	 State	legislatures
completely lose all competence to legislate with respect  to
such an industry in any respect whatever, indian <a href="/doc/1880654/" id="a_167">Tobacoo Co.
Ltd.  v.  Union</a> [1985] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 145. But,	 even  here,
there  are judicial decisions holding that such	 declaration
does  not divest the State legislature of the competence  to
make  laws the pith and substance of which fall	 within	 the
entries in List II, (see for e.g. <a href="/doc/1682508/" id="a_168">Kannan Dewan Hills Co.  v.
State  of  Kerala</a>, [1973] 1 S.C.R. 856	and  <a href="/doc/1293816/" id="a_169">Ishwari  Khetan
Sugar  Mills Ltd. v. State of U.P</a>., [1980] 3 S.C.R.  331  to
which  reference  will	also be made later,  merely  on	 the
ground that it has some effect on such industry. Compared to
that of Entry 52, the language of Entry 54 is very  guarded.
It deprives the States of legislative competence only to the
extent to which the law of Parliament considers the  control
of  Union  to be expedient in the matter  of  regulation  of
mines and mineral development. Emphasising this	 difference,
learned	 counsel  for the State of Orissa submits  that	 the
intent,	 purpose  and scope of the M.M.R.D. Act	 is  totally
different  and	does  not cross the  field  covered  by	 the
impugned  Act.	It  is	a law  to  provide  for	 the  proper
exploitation  and development of minerals and regulates	 the
persons to whom, the manner in which and procedure according
to  which  licenses for prospecting or leases  for  minerals
should be granted. The enactment is concerned with the	need
for  a	proper	exploitation of	 minerals  from	 lands.	 The
impugned Act, on the other hand, concentrates on the need
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">						       155</span>
for  development of mineral areas as such and  provides	 for
the  collection of cess to cater to these needs.  The  scope
of the subject matter of legislation under the two Acts	 are
entirely different and the M.M.R.D. Act cannot be considered
to  exclude State legislation of the nature presently  under
consideration.
</p><p id="p_122">     Before  considering  the above contention, it  will  be
useful	to refer to certain earlier decisions of this  Court
which have a bearing on this issue. <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_170">State of West Bengal  v.
Union</a>, [1964] 1 S.C.R. 371 concerned the validity of an	 Act
of  Parliament	proposing to acquire  certain  coal  bearing
areas  in  the State qua certain areas vested in  the  State
itself.	 While upholding the general right of Parliament  to
legislate  for the acquisition of even property vested in  a
State, the Court pointed out that this could be done only if
there  is  some provision in the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_171">Central Act</a>,  expressly  or
necessarily implying that the property of the State is to be
acquired  by the Union.	 However, the Court held,  when	 the
requisite  declaration under Entry 54 is made, the power  to
legislate  for	regulation  and	 development  of  mines	 and
minerals under the control of the Union, would, by necessary
implication,   include	the  power  to	acquire	 mines	 and
minerals.

this  Court.  The Court, applying Hingir Rampur and  Tulloch
held  that  the	 whose whole of	 the  legislative  field  in
respect	 of  minor  minerals was  covered  by  Parliamentary
legislation  and Entry 23 of List II was to the	 extent	 cut
down  by  Entry 54 of List I.  The old leases could  not  be
modified except by a legislative enactment by Parliament  on
the lines of S.16 of the M.M.R.D. Act, 1957.
</p><p id="p_124">     <a href="/doc/1201636/" id="a_174">In State of Haryana v. Chanan Mal</a>, [1976] 3 S.C.R., 688
the  State  Government	had declared saltpetre	as  a  minor
mineral and auctioned saltpetre mines in the State under the
M.M.R.D.  Act,	1957  read with the  Punjab  Minor  Minerals
Concession Rules, 1964.	 In a writ petition filed by one  of
the owners, the High Court held, unless the mineral deposits

as  having  vested  in	the  State,  their  ownership  would
continue   to  remain  vested  in  the	former	 proprietors
according  to the record of rights. To meet this  difficulty
and  the  difficulties that had been  created  by  haphazard
leases	created	 by  the erstwhile  proprietors,  the  State
legislature passed the Haryana Minerals (Vesting of  Rights)
Act,   1973  and  issued  notifications	  thereunder   again
acquiring  the rights to the saltpetre in the lands  putting
up  certain  saltpetre-bearing lands to auction.   The	High
Court	upheld	the  challenge	to  the	 validity   of	 the
notifications  holding	that,  in view	of  the	 declaration
contained  in S.2 of the M.M.R.D. Act, the field covered  by
the  impugned  Act  was already fully  occupied	 by  Central
legislation and that, therefore, the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_175">State Act</a> was void	 and
imperative  on grounds of repugnancy.  This Court,  however,
reversed the High Court's decision. It held that though	 the
stated objects and reasons of the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_176">State Act</a> showed that	 the
acquisition   was  to	be  made  to  protect  the   mineral
potentialities	of  the	 land and  to  ensure  their  proper
development  and exploitation on scientific  lines-and	this
did  not materially differ from that which could be said  to
lie  behind the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_177">Central Act</a>- the character of the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_178">State	 Act</a>
had  to	 be  judged   by the substance	and  effect  of	 its
provisions  and	 not  merely by the  purpose  given  in	 the
Statement of Objects and Reasons.  Analysing the  provisions
of  the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_179">Central Act</a>, the Court pointed out that, subject  to
the overall supervision of the Central Government, the State
Government  had	 a sphere of its own powers and	 could	take
legally	 specified actions under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_180">Central Act</a> and  rules.
In  particular	S.16(1)(b) of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_181">Central  Act</a>	showed	that
Parliament itself contemplated State legislation for vesting
of   lands  containing	minerals  deposits  in	 the   State
Government,  a feature that could be explained only  on	 the
assumption that Parliament did not intend to touch upon	 the
power  of State legislatures under Entry 18 of List II	read
with Entry 42 of List III.S.17 also showed that there was no
intention  to interfere with vesting of lands in the  States
by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_182">Central Act</a>. The decision of Hingir
Rampur,	 Tulloch and Baijnath Kedia were distinguished.	  In
Chanana	 Mal  (Supra), the respondents relied  upon  certain
observation  in	 Hingir-Rampur and State of West  Bengal  v.
Union,	(supra).   The Court,  however,	 distinguished	them
saying:

	  purposes  of	development and regulation  has	 not
	  been	exercised by Act 67 of 1957.  The  existence

and  the M.M.R.D. Act 1957 precluded the  State	 legislature

Special Area Development Authority, constituted under a 1973
Act  of	 the  State legislature, in  respect  of  lands	 and
buildings  used	 for  the purposes of and  covered  by	coal
mines.	 The plea on behalf of the appellant-coalfields	 was
that  the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_193">State Act</a> was invalid (a) as it encroached on	 the
field  vested in the Centre by reason of the declaration  of
S.2  of	 M.M.R.D. Act and (b) as it impeded the	 powers	 and
functions of the union under the Coal Mines  Nationalosation

acquisition  of coal mines with a view to  reorganising	 and
restructuring  such  coal mines so to ensure  the  rational,

Rejecting this contention the Court held :

	  and  Special	Area  Development  Authorities	 are
	  constituted  afford  an effective  answer  to	 the
	  Attorney  General's contention.  Entry 23 of	List
	  II  relates  to "Regulation of mines	and  mineral
	  development  subject to the provisions of  List  I
	  with	respect to regulation and development  under

	  List	I.  But in order to judge whether,  on	that
	  account,   the   State   legislature	 loses	 its
	  competence  to  pass	the   Act  of  1973,  it  is
	  necessary to have regard to the object and purpose
	  of  that  Act	 and  to  the  relevant	  provisions
	  thereof,  under  which  Special  Area	 development
	  Authorities  are given the power to tax lands	 and
	  buildings within their jurisdiction.	We have	 set
	  out the objects of the Act at the commencement  of
	  this judgement, one of which is to provide for the
	  development  and administration of  Special  Areas
	  through  Special  Area  Development	Authorities.
	  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_197">Section 64</a> of the Act of 1973, which provides	 for
	  the  constitution of the special areas, lays	down
	  by sub-section (4) that: Notwithstanding  anything

	  perform the function and duties which the  Special

	  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_199">Section  68</a>  defines the function of	the  Special

	  in   pursuance  of  this  power  that	 the   State

	  impose  tax on lands and buildings is	 derived  by
	  the State Legislature from Entry 49 of List II:  "

</blockquote><p id="p_128">The Court pointed out that Murthy provided a complete answer
to the above contention. Chanan Mal and Ishwari Khetan, were
referred to and Baijnath Kedia distinguished.  The  decision
of  the Madhya Pradesh High Court in <a href="/doc/870844/" id="a_203">Central  Coalfields  v.
State of M.P</a>., A.I.R. 1986 M.P. 33 also arose out of similar
facts:	The  question  for  consideration  was	whether	 the
functions,  powers and duties of Municipalities and  Special
Area  Development Authority (SADA) become an occupied  field
by virtue of S.2 of the MMRD Act, 1957 and the powers vested
in  them  to regulate construction  activities	relating  to
mining	areas was ultra vires.	It was found that  SADA	 had
become	the local authority to discharge the functions of  a
municipal  adminstration  under	 a <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_204">State Act</a>  and  that	 the
regulation of construction activities was one of the aspects
of   municipal	adminstration  and  management.	   In	this
situation,  the question posed was answered in the  negative
following Ishwari Khetan, Western Coalfields and Chanan Mal.
</p><p id="p_129">     Placing  considerable  reliance  on  the  decisions  in
Chanan Mal, Ishwari Khetan and Western Coalfields, Sri	Iyer
contended that the State legislation in the present case  is
not  vitiated  by  reason of M.M.R.D. Act,  1957.   He	also
pointed	 out  that India Cement also dies  not	consider  in
detail	the reasoning in Hingir-Rampur and Tulloch but	only
reefers to certain observations in the dissenting  judgement
of Wanchoo J ( as His Lordship then was) in the former	case
and urged.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">						       161</span>
<p id="p_130">that  the entire matter requires careful consideration.	  He
submitted that Tulloch and Western Coalfields represent	 two
lines of cases which need reconciliation and that this	task
has not been attempted at all in India Cement.
</p><p id="p_131">     On the other hand, learned counsel for the	 respondents
submitted  that the authority of the Constitution  Bench  in
Western	   Coalfields-which   endorsed	 Murthy-should	  be
considered  weak  after	 India	Cement-which  has  overruled
Murthy.	 The  present case, it is  submitted, is  closer  to
Baijnath  Kedia.  It  is submitted that	 the  principles  of

168 and are too well settled to need any reconsideration.
</p><p id="p_132">     It is clear from a perusal of the decisions referred to
above that the answer to the question before us depends on a
proper understanding of the scope of M.M.R.D. Act 1957,	 and
an assessment of the encroachment made by the impugned State
legislation into the field covered by it.  Each of the cases
referred  to  above turned on such an  appreciation  of	 the
respective spheres of the two legislations.  As pointed	 out
in  Ishwari  Khetan,  the  mere	 declaration  of  a  law  of
Parliament  that  it  is expedient for an  industry  of	 the
regulation and development of mines and minerals to be under
the control of the Union under Entry 52 or entry 54 does not
denude	the State legislatures of their	 legislative  powers
with respect to the fields covered by the several entries in
List  II  or  List  III.  Particularly, in  the	 case  of  a
declaration  under  Entry  54,	this  Legislature  Power  is
extended  to  the  extent control is assumed  by  the  Union
pursuant to such declaration as spelt out by the legislative
enactment  which  makes	 the declaration.   The	 measure  of
erosion	 turns	upon the field of the  enactment  framed  in
pursuance  of  the declaration.	 While	the  legislation  in
Hingir-Rampur and Tulloch was found to fall within the	pale
of the prohibition, those in Chanan Mal, Ishwari Khetan	 and
Western	 Coalfields were general in nature and traceable  to
specific  entries in the State List and did not encroach  on
the  field  of	the  Central  enactment	 except	 by  way  of
incidental  impact.  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_205">The Central Act</a>, considered  in  Chanan
Mal, seemed to envisage and indeed permit State	 legislation
of the nature in question.
</p><p id="p_133">     To	  turn	to  the	 respective  spheres  of   the	 two
legislations  we are   here concerned with, the Central	 Act
(M.M.R.D. Act, 1957) demarcates the sphere of Union  control
in  the	 matter	 of mines and  mineral	development.   While
concerning itself generally with the requirements
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">						       162</span>

thereof,  has  already	been noticed.  S.9A  enacts  a	like

provisions  of the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_206">Central Act</a> or the rules made  thereunder
but should also take into account matters and aspects  which
can  legitimately  be brought within the scope of  the	said
statute, the conclusion seems irresistible, particularly  in
view  of Hingir-Rampur and Tulloch, that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_207">State  Act</a>	 has
trespassed  into the field covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_208">Central Act</a>.	 The
nature of the incursion made into the fields of the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_209">Central
Act</a>  in	 the  other  cases  were  different.   The   present
legislation, traceable to the legislative power under  Entry
23  or Entry 50 of the State List which stands	impaired  by
the Parliamentary declaration under Entry 54, can hardly  be
equated	 to  the  law  for  land  acquisition  or  municipal
administration which were considered in the cases cited	 and
which are traceable to different specific entries in List II
or List III.

     *Newly inserted by Act 37 of 1986
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">						       164</span>
     Sri Iyer contended that the object and purposes of	 the
Orissa	Act  and  its provisions  were	quite  distinct	 and
different  from the object and purposes of the	<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_210">Central	 Act</a>
with  the  result  that the  two  enactments  could  validly
coexist	 since	they do not cover the same  field.   It	 was
argued that the impugned Act was concerned with the  raising
of funds to enable panchayats and Samitis to discharge their
responsibilities of local administration and take steps	 for
proper	development of areas (including mining areas)  under
their jurisdiction whereas the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_211">Central Act</a> was concerned not
with  any social purpose but merely with the development  of
mineral	 resources  of the country  and as  such  the  State
legislation in this regard may also be treated as  referable
to  Entry No.5 of the State List as the statute	 in  Western
Coalfields (supra).
</p><p id="p_147">     As to the reliance on Entry 5 of List II, it is plainly
to  tenuous.   As  pointed  out by Sri	Bobde,	there  is  a
difference between the `object' of the ACt and its `subject.
The object of the levy of the fees may be to strengthen	 the
finances  of local bodies but the Act has noting to do	with
municipal  or local administration. In this context, it	 may
be  pointed  out  that	while S.10 of  the  Orissa  Act,  as
originally enacted, provided for a distribution of the	cess
collected   among  local  bodies,  an  amendment   of	1970
restricted  the utilisation of the cess partly	for  primary
education  and partly for the above purpose.  Even this	 was
amended	 in  1976 whereafter there has been  no	 restriction
regarding  the	cess collected in respect  of  mining  areas
which form part of the consolidated fund of the State.	 The
levy has, therefore, ceased to be capable of being described
as  a fee.  Even if its purpose is only to levy a  fee,	 the
fee  can  be described only as one with	 respect  of  `land'
(Entry 18) if considered generally or with respect to  mines
and  minerals  development (Entry23) if	 restricted  to	 the
nature	of  the	 issue	before us.   We	 shall	discuss	 the
relevance  of  Entry  18 later but, so far as  Entry  23  is
concerned, the State's legislative competence is subject  to
the field covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_212">Central Act</a>.  Turning therefore  to
the  distinction  sought to be made between  the  respective
areas  of  operation  of the two Acts  the  answer  to	this
contention  is provided by Hingir Rampur.  The	Constitution
Bench first set out the scheme of the impugned Act thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_88">	  "The scheme of this Act thus clearly shows that it
	  has been passed for the purpose of development  of
	  mining  areas	 in the State.	The  basis  for	 the
	  operation  of	 the Act is the	 constitution  of  a
	  mining  area, and it is in regard to mining  areas
	  thus	constituted  that the provision of  the	 Act
	  come
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">						       165</span>
	  into play.  It is not difficult to appreciate	 the
	  intention  of the State Legislature  evidenced  by
	  this	Act. Orissa is an under-developed  State  in
	  the Union of India though it has a lot of  mineral
	  wealth of great potential value. Unfortunately its
	  mineral  wealth  is  located	generally  in  areas
	  sparsely   populated	 with	bad   communication.
	  Inevitably  the  exploitation of the	minerals  is
	  handicapped  by  lack of communications,  and	 the
	  difficulty experienced in keeping the labour force
	  sufficiently	  healthy    and    in	   congenial
	  surroundings.	  The  mineral	development  of	 the
	  State, thereof, requires that provision should  be
	  made	 for   improving   the	 communications	  by
	  constructing good roads and by providing means  of
	  transport  such as tramways, supply of  water	 and
	  electricity  would  also help.  It would  also  be
	  necessary  to provide for amenities of  sanitation
	  and  education  to the labour force  in  order  to
	  attract  workmen to the area.	 <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_213">Before the  Act</a>  wa
	  passed  it appears that the mine owners  tried  to
	  put  up small length roads and tramways for  their
	  own  individual purpose, but that obviously  could
	  not  be as effective as roads constructed  by	 the
	  State	 and tramway service provided by it.  It  is
	  on  a consideration of these facts that the  State
	  Legislature  decided to take an active part  in  a
	  systematic development of its mineral areas  which
	  would	 held  the  mine  owners  in  moving   their
	  minerals  quickly through the shortest  route	 and
	  would attract	 labour to assist the excavation  of
	  the minerals.	 Thus there can be no doubt that the
	  primary and the principal object of the Act is  to
	  develop  the	mineral areas in the  State  and  to
	  assist more efficient and extended exploitation of
	  its mineral wealth".
</blockquote><p id="p_148">A  little later, at pare 559, the provisions of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_214">Central	 Act</a>
LIII of 1948 which were less far reaching that those of 1957
ACt  as	 can be seen from the observations at  page  476  of
Tulloch- were analysed and the Court concluded :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_89">	  "Amongst the matters covered by S.6(2) is the levy
	  and  collection  of royalties, fees  or  taxes  in
	  respect of minerals mined, quarried, excavated  or
	  collected.  It is true that no rules have in	fact
	  been framed by the Central Government in regard to
	  the  levy and collection of any fees; but, in	 our
	  opinion, that would not make any difference.	  If
	  it is held that this Act contains the	 declaration
	  referred to in Entry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">						       166</span>
	  23  there would be no difficulty in  holding	that
	  the  declaration covers the field of	conservation
	  and development of minerals, and the said field is
	  indistinguishable  from the field covered  by	 the
	  impugned  Act. What Entry 23 provides is that	 the
	  legislative competence of the State Legislature is
	  subject  to the provisions of List 1 with  respect
	  of regulation and development under the control of
	  the  Union,  the  Entry 54 in List  1	 requires  a
	  declaration  by Parliament by law that  regulation
	  and  development  of	mines should  be  under	 the
	  control   of	 the  Union  in	  public   interest.
	  Therefore,  if a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_215">Central Act</a> has been	 passed	 for
	  the purpose of providing for the conservation	 and
	  development  of minerals, and if it  contains	 the
	  requisite  declaration,  then	 it  would  not	  be
	  competent  to State Legislature to pass an Act  in
	  respect of the subject matter covered by the	said
	  declaration.	In order that the declaration should
	  be effective it is not necessary that rules should
	  be  made or enforced; all that this required is  a
	  declaration by Parliament that it is expedient  in
	  the  public  interest to take the  regulation	 and
	  development  of  mines under the  control  of	 the
	  Union.   In such a case the test must	 be  whether
	  the  legislative declaration covers the  field  or
	  not.	 Judged by this test there can be  no  doubt
	  that	the  field covered by the  impugned  Act  is
	  covered by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_216">Central Act</a> LIII of 1948".
</blockquote><p id="p_149">The  following observations in Tulloch are also apposite  in
this context:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_90">	  " On the other hand, Mr. Setalvad-learned  counsel
	  for  the  respondent-urged that  the	Central	 ACt
	  covered  the entire field of mineral	development,
	  that	being the "extent" to  which Parliament	 had
	  declared  by	law and it was	expedient  that	 the
	  Union	 should assume control.	 In this  connection
	  he  relied most strongly on the terms	 of  s.18(1)
	  which laid a duty upon the Central Government	 "to
	  take	all such steps as may be necessary  for	 the
	  conservation and development of minerals in  India
	  and " for that propose the Central Government may,
	  by notification, make such rules as it deems fit".</blockquote>
<p id="p_150">	  If  the  entire field of mineral  development	 was
	  taken	 over, that would include the  provision  of
	  amenities  to workmen employed in the mines  which
	  was  necessary in order to stimulate	or  maintain
	  the working of mines.	 The test which he suggested
	  was whether, if under the power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">						       167</span>
	  conferred   by  s.18(1) of the  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_217">Central  Act</a>,	 the
	  Central  Government has made rules  providing	 for
	  the amenities for which provision was made by	 the
	  Orissa  Act  and  if the  Central  Government	 had
	  imposed  a  fee  to defray  the  expenses  of	 the
	  provision of these amenities, would such rules  be
	  held to be ultra vires of the Central	 Government,
	  and  this particularly when taken  in	 conjunction
	  with	the  matters for which rules could  be	made
	  under	 s.13  to which reference has  already	been
	  made.	 We consider there is considerable force  in
	  this	 submission  of	 learned  counsel  for	 the
	  respondent,  and thus would require very  detailed
	  and  careful scrutiny.  We are, however,  relieved
	  from	 this  task  of	 detailed  examination	 and
	  discussion of this matter because we consider that
	  it is concluded by a decision of the Court in	 the
	  <a href="/doc/1464523/" id="a_218">Hingir-Rampur Coal Co. Ltd &amp; Ors. v. The State  of
	  Orissa &amp; Ors</a>., [1961] 2.S.C.R. 537
The above argument was accepted by the Court, vide page 476,
Reference  may also be made here to the recent	decision  of
this Court in <a href="/doc/1247047/" id="a_219">Bharat Coking Coal v. State of Bihar</a>, [1990] 2
Scale 256.  The question whether the State of Bihar had	 the
authority  to grant a lease for lifting coal  slurry  coming
out of the appellants washeries and getting deposited on the
river  bed or other lands was answered in the  negative	 the
court  came  to	 the  conclusion that  the  "slurry"  was  a
"mineral"  and that its regulation was within the  exclusive
jurisdiction  of  Parliament. The Court, in  coming  to	 the
conclusion, held that no rules had been framed under S.18(1)
or  18(2)  (k)-	 disposal or discharge of  waste,  slime  or
tailing arising from any mining or metallurgical  operations
carried out but held that this was immaterial in view of the
principles laid down in Hingir Rampur, Tulloch and  Baijnath
Kedia.	 These observations establish on the one  hand	that
the   distinction   sought  to	be  made   between   mineral
development  and mineral area development is not a real	 one
as  the	 two  types  of	 development  are  inextricably	 and
integrally  interconnected and, on the other, that, fees  of
the  nature  we are concerned with squarely  fall  with	 the
scope  of the provisions of <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_220">Central Act</a>.  The object of	 S.9
of  the Central Act cannot be ignored. The terms of S.13  of
the Central Act extracted earlier empower the Union to frame
rules in regard to matters concerning roads and environment.
S.18(1)	 empowers  the Central Government to take  all	such
steps	as  may	 be  necessary	for  the  conservation	 and
development  of	 minerals  in India and	 for  protection  of
environment.   These, in the very nature of  things,  cannot
mean  such amenities only in the mines but take in also	 the
areas leading to and all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">						       168</span>
around	the  mines.   The development of  mineral  areas  is
implicit  in them.  S.25 implicitly authorises the  levy  of
rent,  royalty, taxes and fees under the Act and the  rules.
The  scope of the powers thus conferred is very wide.	Read
as  a whole, the purpose of the Union control  envisaged  by
Entry 45 and the M.M.R.D. Act 1957, is to provide for proper
development  of	 mines and mineral areas and also  to  bring
about  a  uniformity all over the country in regard  to	 the
minerals specified in Schedule I in the matter of  royalties
and,  consequently  prices.   Sri  Bobde,  who	appears	 for
certain Central Government undertakings, points out that the
prices	of their exports are fixed and cannot  be  escalated
with the enhancement of the royalties and that, if different
royalties  were	 to be charged in  different  States,  their
working would become impossible.  There appears to be  force
in  this  submission.  As pointed out in India	Cement,	 the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_221">Central	 Act</a> bars an enhancement of the royalty directly  or
indirectly, except by the Union and in the manner  specified
by  the 1957 Act, and this is exactly what the impugned	 Act
does.	We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that	 the
validity  of the impugned Act cannot be upheld by  reference
to Entry 23 or Entry 50 of List II.
</p><p id="p_151">     An attempt was made to rest the legislation of Entry 18
of List II viz. `land'.	 This attempt cannot succeed for the
reasons whichever have set out to negative the plea that  it
falls  under  Entry  49.  A similar pleas  in  Baijnath	 was
rejected by Hidayatullah C.J. in the following words :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_91">	  "Mr.	 L.N.  Sinha  argued  that  the	  topic	  of
	  legislation  concerns	 land  and  therefore  falls
	  under	 entry 18 of the State List and he drew	 our
	  attention  to other provisions on the	 subject  of
	  mines	 in  the  Land	Reforms	 Act  as  originally
	  passed.    The   abolition  of   the	 rights	  of
	  intermediaries  to  the mines	 and  vesting  these
	  rights  as lessors in the State Government  was  a
	  topic	 connected with land and land tenures.	 But
	  after	 the mining leases stood  between the  State
	  Government   and  the	 lessees,  any	attempt	  to
	  regulate  those  mining leases will  fall  not  in
	  entry	  18  but  in  entry  23  even	though	 the
	  regulation  incidentally touches land.   The	pith
	  and  substance  of the amendment to  s.10  of	 the
	  Reforms  Act	falls within entry  23	although  it
	  incidentally	touches	 land and  not	vice  versa.
	  Therefore  this  amendment  was  subject  to	 the
	  overriding power of Parliament as declared in	 Act
	  67  of 1957 in S.15.	Entry 18 of the State  List,
	  therefore, is no help".
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">						       169</span>
<p id="p_152">It  will  be seen that, if the levy in	question  cannot  be
described  as a tax on land, it cannot be described  as	 fee
with regard to land either.
</p><p id="p_153">     For the reasons above mentioned, we hold that the	levy
of  cess  under	 S.5 to 7 of the Orissa Cess  Act,  1962  is
beyond the competence of the State Legislature.
Bihar:
</p><p id="p_154">     The relevant provisions of the Bihar statutes have been
set  out  earlier.   While  S.5	 only  lays  down  that	 all
immovable  property shall be liable to a local cess and	 S.6
provides  for  the levy to be based on the annual  value  of
lands  and  sale value of other	 immovable  properties,	 the
latter section specifically enacts that the cess will be  on
royalty from mines and quarries and on the annual net profit
the  railways  and tramways. The further amendments  of	 S.6
have  not  changed this basic position. Though	the  section
refers	also to the value of the mineral-bearing land,	that
furnishes  only	 the maximum upto which the cess,  based  on
royalty,  could	 go.   In other words, the  cess  is  levied
directly on royalties from mines and quarries.	The case is,
therefore,   indistinguishable	from  India   Cement.	 The
notifications  place the matter beyond all doubt.  The	levy
is  a percentage or multiple of the royalty  depending	upon
the  kind  of  mineral and - in the case of  iron  ore-	 the
method	of  extraction and nature of the  process  employed.
There  are  no	clear indications in the  stature  that	 the
amounts	 are  collected	 by way of fee	and  not  tax.	 The
provisions of S.9 extracted earlier would indicate that only
a  small  percentage  goes  to the  district  fund  and	 the
remaining forms parts of the consolidated fund of the  State
"for  the  construction and maintenance of  other  works  of
public utility".  However, the proviso does require at least
ten  percent  to be spent for purposes relating	 to  mineral
development.   We shall, therefore assume that the levy	 can
be  treated, in part, as a fee and, in part, as a tax.	 But
even  this does not advance the case of the respondents	 for
the reasons already discussed.
</p><p id="p_155">     Shri Chidambaram submits that, in the original  counter
affidavit  filed on behalf of the State, no case was  sought
to be made out that it was a tax on land, the case was	that
it was a "tax on mineral rights".  He urged that, this being
out  of question because of India Cement (para 23 and 30)  a
belated	 attempt is made to bring it under Entry 49.  we  do
not  need to discuss the contentions here in detail  because
this  is a clearer case of levy on royalty than	 in  Orissa;
and,  for the reasons we have outlines in our discussion  in
regard to the Orissa Acts, this levy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">						       170</span>
has also to be declared invalid.
</p><p id="p_156">     Shri  Chidambaram also contended that the State  cannot
seek  sustain  the  levy  by relying  of  <a href="/doc/300888/" id="a_222">Art.	277</a>  of	 the
Constitution  , in view of the fact that the cess  is  being
levied since 1880.  <a href="/doc/300888/" id="a_223">Article 277</a> is in these terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_92">	  "Any	 taxes,	 duties,  cesses  or   fees   which,
	  immediately	before	the  commencement  of	this
	  Constitution,	 were being lawfully levied  by	 the
	  Government  of any State or by an municipality  or
	  other	 authority or body for the purposes  of	 the
	  State, municipality, district or other local	area
	  may,	notwithstanding	 that those  taxes,  duties,
	  cesses  or fees are mentioned in the	Union  List,
	  continue  to	be levied and to be applied  to	 the
	  same	purposes until provision to the contrary  is
	  made by Parliament by law".
</blockquote><p id="p_157">We  think,  as rightly contended by Sri Chidambaram  that  a
reliance on <a href="/doc/300888/" id="a_224">Art. 277</a> will be misplaced for three reasons :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_93">     (a)  The  levy  that is challenged	 is  under  S.6,  as
     amended in 1975, i.e. a post-constitution levy;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_94">     (b)  S.6 on its own language, is operative only  "until
     provision	to the contrary is made by  the	 Parliament"
     and,  as we have held that the field is covered by	 the
     M.M.R.D.	Act,  is  supersedes  the  effect   of	 S.6
     re:mineral lands; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_95">     (c)  <a href="/doc/300888/" id="a_225">Article 277</a> only saves taxes, duties,	 and  cesses
     mentioned	therein if they continue to be	applied	 for
     the same purposes and until Parliament by law  provides
     to the contrary and with the enactment of the  M.M.R.D.
     Act,  1957, they cease to be valid.  In  this  context,
     the following observations of this Court in <a href="/doc/32134/" id="a_226">Ramakrishna
     Ramanath v. Janpad Sabha</a>,[1962] Supp 3 SCR 70 quoted in

<p id="p_158">	  "Dealing  next with the import of the	 words	`may

terms:

	  (3)  the rate of the tax is not enhanced  not	 its
	  incidence  in	 any  manner  altered,	so  that  it
	  continues to be the same tax".
</blockquote><p id="p_159">It is obvious that if these tests were	applied the  attempt
to sustain the tax on the basis of <a href="/doc/300888/" id="a_228">Art. 277</a> cannot  succeed.
Indeed, no such attempt was made before us.
</p><p id="p_160">     We,  therefore,  hold that the levy of cess has  to  be
struck	down. It has also been brought to our notice that  a
Bench  of  two Judges of this Court has already	 allowed  an
appeal	by  an assessee from a judgement of the	 Patna	High
Court  to the contrary viz. CA No.1521 of 1990. It has	been
brought	 to  our notice also that the Patna High  Court	 has
recently  invalidated  the  levy  of  the  cess	 in  Central
Coalfields Ltd. v. State, (CWJC 2085/89 and connected cases)
in a judgement dated 6.11.90, following India Cement.
Madhya Pradesh :
</p><p id="p_161">     We now turn to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1407416/" id="a_229">Madhya Pradesh Act</a>  15
of 1982.  We are concerned only with Part IV which levies  a
cess not on land in general which could be referred to Entry
18  or	Entry 49 but only on land held	in  connection	with
mineral	 rights	 which,	 in the State,	are  principally  in
regard to coal and limestone.  Under S.9 the proceeds are to
utilised  only towards the general development	of  mineral-
bearing	 areas.	  Although  there is no	 provision  for	 the
constitution of a separate fund for this purpose as is found
in  relation to the cesses levied under Part II or Part	 III
of  the Act this considerations alone does not preclude	 the
levy  from being considered as a fee:vide <a href="/doc/1653713/" id="a_230">Srinivasa  Traders
V. STate</a> [1983] 3.SCR 843 at 873.  The clear ear-marking  of
the levy for purposes connected with development of  mineral
areas was considered by the High Court, in our view rightly,
sufficient  to treat it as a fee.  However, the	 High  Court
pointed	 out,  such fee would be referable to item  23	and,
hence,	out of bounds for the State Legislature,  after	 the
enactment of M.M.R.D. Act, 1957.  For the reasons which have
already been discussed in relation to the Orissa Statute, we
uphold this conclusion.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">						       172</span>
<p id="p_162">     The  other	 statute  viz.	the  Madhya  Pradesh   Upkar
Adhiniyam  (Act	 1 of 1982) came up for consideration  of  a

Manufacturer's	<a href="/doc/1159177/" id="a_231">Association v. State</a>, (and connected  cases)
in AIR 1989 M.P. 264.  The Full Bench held that, in view  of
s.12  of the Act having been deleted by the 1989  amendment,
the levy under s.11 of the Act ceased to be a fee and become
a  tax.	  It held further that the levy was not	 covered  by
Entry  49 or Entry 50 of List II and was,  therefore,  ultra
vires. It observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_97">	  "It  is  significant	to note	 that  cess  is	 not
	  imposed  on all land and that it is not  dependent
	  either   on  the  extent  of	the  land  held	  in
	  connection  with  mineral rights or on  the  value
	  thereof.  The subject-matter of tax, therefore, is
	  major	 mineral  raised  from	the  land  held	  in
	  connection with mineral right.  If no minerals are
	  raised,  tax	is  not livable.   The	tax  is	 not
	  dependent  on	 the  extent of	 the  land  held  in
	  connection  with  mineral rights. It is  not	case
	  where all land is liable to payment of cess,	that
	  the  liability  is assessed on the  basis  of	 the
	  value of the land and that the measure of the	 tax
	  in  so  far as land held under a mining  lease  is
	  concerned, is the value of the minerals  produced.
	  Under	 the impugned Act, value of the land  or  of
	  the  minerals produced does not play any  part  in
	  the  levy of cess. The quantity of major  minerals
	  produced from the land determines the liability to
	  pay tax. In these circumstances, the impugned levy
	  cannot  be  held  to be a tax	 on  land  which  is
	  covered by Entry 49 of the State List.
</blockquote><p id="p_163">After  distinguishing Ajay Kumar Mukherjea v.  Local  Board,
AIR   1965  SC	1561  and  referring  to  <a href="/doc/1230460/" id="a_232">Union	 v.   Bombay
International Ltd</a>. AIR 1984 SC 420 the	Courted concluded :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_98">	  "  The character of impost in the instant case  is
	  that	though	in form it appears to be  a  tax  on
	  land,	 in  substance,	 it is	a  tax	on  minerals
	  produced therefrom. The subject-matter of tax	 is,
	  therefore,  not covered by Entry 49 of  the  State
	  List."
</blockquote><p id="p_164">As  for Entry 50, after referring Hingir Rampur,  the  Court
observed :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_99">	  "Now	from a perusal of S.11 of the Act, it  would
	  be clear that in the instant case by the  charging
	  section, tax is not imposed on the mineral  rights
	  of every holder of mining
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">						       173</span>
	  lease.  The tax is levied on minerals produced  in
	  land	 held	under	mining	 lease.	  In   these
	  circumstances, the tax levied by the Act cannot be
	  held to be a tax covered by Entry 50 of List II of
	  the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.  In	 our
	  opinion, therefore, it has not been shown that the
	  State	  Legislature  is  competent  to  levy	 the
	  impugned cess."
</blockquote><p id="p_165">This  conclusion  is obviously correct in the light  of	 our
earlier	 discussion.   The  court,  however,  expressed	  an
opinion, in paras 10 to 12 of the judgment, that in case the
levy  could be treated as a tax imposable under Entry 49  or
50  of List II in the Second Schedule to  the  Constitution,
such power "has not been taken away by the provision of	 the
MMRD  Act".    We think, as already pointed out by  us	that
though	the  MMRD Act, 1957, unlike s.6(2) of the  1948	 Act
does not contain a specific provision for the levy of taxes,
s.25  of  the  former does indicate the	 existence  of	such
power.	The above observations of the High Court, therefore,
in our view, do not attach sufficient importance to s.25  of
the  MMRD  Act and the field covered thereby.  This  aspect,
however,  is not of significance in view of  the  conclusion
that the tax is not referable to Entry 49 or Entry 50.
</p><p id="p_166">     We	 may  add  that a Bench of this	 Court	has  already
dismissed the State's petition for leave to appeal from	 the
judgment  of the Full Bench (S.L.P. 10052/89, 12696/84	etc.
disposed  of  on 5.2.90) in limine as  squarely	 covered  by
India  Cement.	It is brought to our notice that the  Madhya
Pradesh High Court, after India Cement, has reaffirment	 its
conclusions   in  Hiralal  and	M.P.   Lime   Manufacturers'
Association  in Ankur Textiles and Another v. South  Eastern
Coalfields,  (M.P. No. 1547 of 1990) in the light  of  India
Cement.
</p><p id="p_167">		      THE REFUND ISSUE
     Having  thus concluded that the levy of cess under	 the
Orissa, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh enactments is invalid,,  it
becomes	 necessary to consider the logical  consequences  of
such a conclusion.  Prima facia it would seem that the	levy
should	be considered bad since its inception and  that	 all
cess levied under the impugned provisions should be directed
to  be	refunded to the assessees, particularly in  view  of
<a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_233">Article	 265</a> of the Constitution. For the  States,  however,
reliance is placed on the following observations in para  35
of the judgement in India Cement to contend to the contrary.
Towards	  the  conclusion  of  his   judgement,	  Sabyasachi
Mukherjee, C.J. dealt with this issue thus :
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">						       174</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_100">	  "Mr.	Krishnamurthy Iyer, however, submitted that,
	  in  any event, the decision in H.R.S. Murthy	case
	  was the decision of the Constitution Bench of this
	  Court.   Cess has been realised on that basis	 for
	  the  organisation of village and  town  panchayats
	  and  comprehensive programme of measures had	been
	  framed  under	 the National Extension	 of  Service
	  Scheme  to  which our attention  was	drawn.	 Mr.
	  Krishnamurthy	 Iyer  further	submitted  that	 the
	  Directive  Principles of State Policy embodied  in
	  the  Constitution enjoined that the States  should
	  take	steps  to organise  village  panchayats	 and
	  endow	 them  with power and authority	 as  may  be
	  necessary  to enable them to function as units  of
	  self-government  and	as  the	 amounts  have	been
	  realised  on	that  basis, it at  all,  we  should
	  declare the said cess on reality to be ultra vires
	  prospective, In other words, the amounts that have
	  been	collected by virtue of the said	 provision,s
	  should   not	 be   declared	 to    be    illegal
	  retrospectively  and	the  State  made  liable  to
	  refund the same.  We see good deal of substance in
	  this submission.  After all, there was a  decision
	  of  this Court in H.R.S. Murthy case	and  amounts
	  have	been  collected on the basis that  the	said
	  decision  was	 the  correct  position.   We	are,
	  therefore,   of  the	opinion	 that  we  will	  be
	  justified  in declaring the levy of the said	cess
	  to   be  ultra  vires	 the  power  of	 the   State
	  Legislature prospectively only".</blockquote>
<p id="p_168">     Relying on the above, observations, it is submitted for
the States that they should not be directed to refund a cess
which  they have been levying for several years in the	past
on  the	 basis of the law declared by the Supreme  Court  in
Murthy.	 Certain other circumstances have also been  brought
to our notice in this connection :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">	  (i) Several States have preceded on the basis that
     they  are	entitled  to levy a cess of  the  nature  in
     question. In addition to the States referred to earlier
     in	 the  judgement, Rajashtan and Andhra  Pradesh	have
     also similar statues.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_102">	  (ii)	The levy accounts for a substantial part  of
     the  States finances particularly in States  which	 are
     rich  in  minerals.  For e.g. State of  Madhya  Pradesh
     accounts  for  a  good  percentage	 of  this  country's
     mineral resource.	It produces 26.53% of the  country's
     production	 in limestone.	36% in dolomite,  28.14%  in
     coal,  21.5%  in iron ore, 13% in	bauxite,  21.38%  in
     Manganese ore,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">						       175</span>
     14.43% in rock phosphate, 33% in copper ore and so	 on.
     The amounts of cess run to several crores.	 A direction
     to	 refund the cess collected thus far will  result  in
     crying  halt to all developmental activities  initiated
     and  put  through	and cause irreparable  loss  to	 the
     State.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_103">	  (iii)	 As pointed out (for e.g. in pars 5 to 8  in
     CMP  Nos.	31187 to 31196 of 1984 in CA  Nos.  1640  to
     1643,1645,1649, 1654,  1655,1659, and 1662 of 1986) the
     impact  of the cess has already been passed on  by	 the
     assessees- which are leading industries that can easily
     bear  the	brunt of the same- to  their  customers.   A
     refund granted to them will only result in their unjust
     enrichment	 and  this  should  be	safeguarded  against
     applying  the  principles	in  <a href="/doc/716347/" id="a_234">U.P.  State	 Electricity

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_104">     568.</blockquote>
<p id="p_169">     The  above	 request  was  vehemently  opposed  by	 the
assessees counsel.  Presenting their case on this issue, Sri
Nariman	 (appear for the appellants in C.A. 4353-4  of	1983
and  C.A. 2053-80 of 1980) contended that we  should  ignore
the  dicta in para 35 of India Cement as per  incuriam.	  He
submitted,  first,  that the Court there has  acted  on	 the
assumption  that  a doctrine of prospective  overruling	 had
been  enunciated in Golaknath, [1967] 2 SCR 762.   Analysing
the  various judgments delivered in that case, he  submitted
that,  while Subba Rao C.J. and four other judges  (pp	805-
</p><p id="p_170">813)  approved	of  the applicability of  this	doctrine  in
India, five other judges spoke against it (pp 890, 897, 899-
922,  921  and	952)  and the  eleventh	 judge	was  neutral
(p.408).   He  therefore,  submitted  that  the	 judges	 who
decided	 Golaknath were equally divided on the issue and  so
there  is  no reason disdained of the Court binding  on	 us.
Second,	 he  submitted	that  the  doctrine  of	 prospective
overruling  was evolved by the Supreme Court of	 the  United
States	in  the	 absence  of  any  constitutional  provision
militating  against it, vide sunburst 77 L.Ed. 310 (at	page
</p><p id="p_171">366)  and Linkletter, 14 L.Ed (2d) 601 (at page 604-8).	  In
India,	 however,   the	  application	of   the   doctrine,
particularly  in  the  context of  an  issue  regarding	 the
validity  of  a	 tax levy, would  run  counter	to  specific
provisions   contained	 Articles  246	and   265   of	 the
Constitution.	Where the Court finds that a legislation  is
beyond	the  competence	 of the	 concerned  legislature,  it
stands uprooted altogether because Articles 246 and 265	 say
so.  There is no scope for, and no room for the exercise  of
any discretion by, the Court to say that, there articles  of
the Constitution notwithstanding, they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">						       176</span>
would treat the legislation to be valid for a certain period
or for certain purposes.  Third, he submitted that the above
objection  cannot be "circumvented" by a resort	 to  Article

automatic  and inevitable consequence of the declaration  of
invalidity  and	 should be granted proved a  suit  within  a
period	 of  limitation	 or  a	writ  for  declaration	 and
consequential relief is filed.
</p><p id="p_174">     Supplementing  the	 above arguments, Sri  G.  Ramaswamy
appearing  for some of the assessees, contended	 that  there
can  be no question of the Court exercising  any  discretion
under  <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_240">Article 142</a> so as to destroy a fundamental  right  of
the   assessees.   Learned  counsel   also  submitted	that
considerations	of hardship of the States, in case they	 are
called	upon  to  refund huge amounts, can  be	no  relevant
consideration  at all.	He urged, that in some at  least  of
the cases here, there is no averment, much less evidence, of
any  irreparable  hardship  that is likely to  result  if  a
refund is ordered.  He also pointed out that in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">						       177</span>
converse situation where a retrospective levy is held to  be
valid,	assessees have been held entitled to no relief	from
payment of back duty on grounds of hardship: vide <a href="/doc/1404351/" id="a_241">Chhotabhai
Jethabhai  Patel  &amp; Co.v. Union of India</a> [1962] 2  Supp.  at
Pp12,13 and urged that there cannot be a different rule	 for
the  State.  Sri B. Sen submitted that the ruling in  Murthy
could not be invoked to seek prospective invalidation as, at
least  so  far as Orissa was concerned, as the	decision  in
Tulloch	 had clearly defined the limitations of the  State's
power to make such levies.
</p><p id="p_175">     In	 addition to the above general	arguments,  reliance
had  also been placed by the assessees on  certain  specific
interim	 orders	 passed	 in  these cases  and  it  has	been
contended that these orders should be given effect to, or at
least taken into account, in deciding the issue of the final
relief to be granted.  It is therefore necessary to refer to
these orders :
</p><p id="p_176">     (i)  In C.A. Nos. 4353-4 of 1983, there is	 no  interim
order  staying	recovery of the cess at all  except  of	 the
arrears	 for the period from 1.1.1983 to 31.3.1983 and	even
this was made subject to the furnishing of a bank  guarantee
by the assessee.
</p><p id="p_177">     (ii)  In C.A. 2053-80 of 1980 there was  initially	 (on
2/2/1981)  an  order  of stay of recovery  of  cess  on	 the
furnishing   of	 bank  guarantees.   But  this	 was   later
substituted by an order of 25.3.1983 by which the amounts of
cess  were to be deposited in the High Court  every  quarter
and  then  withdrawn  by  the State  but  this	was  on	 the
undertaking  buy the State's Advocate General to refund	 the
amount	"if  deposited, in the event the  appeal  succeeds".
This continued till 30.1.90 when the Counsel of the State of
Orissa	undertook, in view of the decision in India  Cement,
that  the levy of the cess for the quarter ending  December,
1989  onwards  will not be enforced  until  further  orders.
Presumably, therefore, there has been no collection for cess
in Orissa since that period.
</p><p id="p_178">(iii)  The  position in the Orissa case of  Orient  Paper  &amp;
Industries  Ltd.  is somewhat different. It is	pointed	 out
that  when  the levy of cess first came	 into  force  w.e.f.
1.4.1977,  the Western Coalfields Ltd. who supplied coal  to
the  assessees	had challenged the levy of cess	 by  a	writ
petition  and  obtained	 an  interim  injunction  order	 but
eventually withdrew the writ petition.	But  simultaneously,
the  said company wrote to the assessee that the amounts  of
cess (which were collected from the assessee) would be	kept
in a suspense account and that, after a deci-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">						       178</span>
<p id="p_179">sion  is  rendered  by a court of law, it  will	 be  decided
whether they should be deposited with the State against cess
or be refunded to the assessees.  It was made clear that, in
case  the  levy of cess is held invalid, "there will  be  no
hitch  in refunding the amount".  This arrangement  went  on
between 1977 and 1982.
</p><p id="p_180">     On	 21.9.1982,  the  assessee  filed  a  writ  petition
challenging  the levy as it was enahanced from 25%  to	100%
from  1.4.80. An interim stay was granted by the High  Court
restricted  to be enhanced demand but even this was  vacated
by  the High Court on 13.5.1983 in view of the	decision  in
<a href="/doc/1427520/" id="a_242">Lakshmi	 Narain Agarwala v. State</a> AIR 1983  Orissa 210	that
the  levy  was	valid.	 Finally,  the	High  Court  by	 its
judgement dated 22.12.1989 followed India Cement and allowed
the writ but directed that the collections so far made shall
be  allowed to be retained by the State as was	directed  by
the Supreme Court in the case of India Cement (supra).	This
judgement  is the subject matter of SLP 1479 of 1990 by	 the
State.
</p><p id="p_181">     The assessee thereupon file a review petition in regard
to  the above direction contending ; (a) that a	 High  Court
had   no   jurisdiction	  to  declare	provision   to	 the
unconstitutional only "prospectively"; (b) that the cess  in
the case had been collected only by Western Coalfields	Ltd.
and  had  not been deposited in the State coffers;  and	 (c)
that  the  principle of `unjust enrichment'  should  equally
apply  to the State which should not be permitted to  enrich
itself by the levy of an illegal exaction.  The	 application
for  review  was  dismissed by the High	 Court	on  13.7.90.
Thereupon  the assessee has preferred the unnumbered SLP  on
1990 and SLP 11939 on 1990 respectively against the original
judgement  dated  22.12.1989  and the order  on	 the  review
petition dated 13.7.1990.
</p><p id="p_182">     It	 is contended that the High Court, having regard  to
the  circumstances set out earlier, should have	 directed  a
refund	 of  the  cess.	 collected.   IT  is  stated   that,
subsequently, Western Coalfields have paid over the  amounts
of cess to the Government [vide orders of this Court referred
to  in sub para (v) below].  It is also submitted  that	 the
averments  by the State now made that the amounts  collected
have  been  utilized by the State on objects  enumerated  in
Part   IV  of  the  Constitution  are  the  result   of	  an
afterthought  and  are	being  put  forward  to	 defeat	 the
rightful entitlement of the assessee to the refund.
</p><p id="p_183"> (iv)  In  the	Bihar case, there was an  interim  order  on
10.2.1986 to the following effect:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">						       179</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_105">	  "On the stay application there will be no stay  of
	  recovery of cess but in case appellants succeed in
	  appeal  in  this  Court,  the	 excess	 amount	  so
	  recovered  will  bepaid  to  the  appellants	with
	  interest  at	the  rate of 12% from  the  date  of
	  recovery"
</blockquote><p id="p_184">This  was  modified on 30.1.90 in view of the  judgement  in
India  Cement which had been delivered by this time, and  it
was directed that the State of Bihar should not also enforce
any  demand for cess for the quarters ending December,	1989
and thereafter until further orders.  Presumably, therefore,
there  has  been  no levy of cess in  Bihar  from  the	last
quarter	 of  1989 onwards.  Counsel for the  assessees	from
Bihar-Sri  Chidambaram	and Sri Shanti Bhushan	stated	that
they seek compliance with the order dated 10.2.86 and  would
not insist on refund of cess collected earlier to that date.
</p><p id="p_185">     (v) Turning to the Madhya Pradesh matters, the position
is  this, The High Court, by its judgement  dated  28.3.1986
held the levy to be invalid.  In C.A. 1640 to 1662 of  1986,
the initial order passed on 2.5.1986 was this :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_106">	  " There will be stay of refund of the cess already
	  collected   pending  disposal	 of   the   appeals.
	  Learned counsel for the State states that, in	 the
	  event of the appeals being dismissed the State  is
	  prepared to pay interest at 12% per annum.   There
	  will,	 however,  be no stay of  operation  of	 the
	  judgement."
</blockquote><p id="p_186">As  a  result  of  the order,  there  should  have  been  no
collection  of cess by the State subsequent to the  date  of
the  judgement and only issue could have been regarding	 the
refund of the cess already collected from 1982 to 28.3.1986.
</p><p id="p_187">     However,  the  Western Coalfields Ltd.  approached	 the
Court  with an application in one of the appeals (viz.	C.A.
1649/86)  praying that, pending disposal of the appeals,  it
should	be  permitted  to collect the  amount  of  cess	 and
deposit the same in a separate account in the Bank vis-a-vis
each  of  its customers.  This application  was	 ordered  on
1.8.86.	  When this order was passed, the  State  Government
moved  an  application praying that, instead of	 the  monies
being kept in deposit in bank account by Western  Coalfields
Ltd.,  it will be conducive to public interest if the  State
is  permitted  to  utilise  the	 moneys	 "in  mineral  areas
development programs" and that the State would abide by such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">						       180</span>
terms as the Court may impose at the time of final decision.
It  was,  therefore,  prayed that the  Western	Coal  fields
should be directed to deposit the amounts collected by it to
the   State  Government.   The	Court  found  this   request
reasonable and passed the following order on 15.10.86 :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_107">	  "The order dated 1.8.86 passed in the above appeal
	  is modified as follows :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_108">	       The   amount   deposited	  by   the   Western

	  Government  of Madhya Pradesh.  In the  event,  of
	  the  State Government failing in this appeal,	 the
	  amount  received by the Madhya Pradesh  Government
	  under	 this  order  shall  be	 refunded  by	that
	  Government  within three months from the  date  of
	  the judgement to the Western Coalfields Ltd.	with
	  interest at 12% per annum to disburse in favour of
	  those who had paid it, subject to such  directions
	  which	 this court may give in its judgement.	 The
	  amount  received  by	the  Madhya  Pradesh   State
	  Government  shall be spent in accordance with	 the
	  provisions contained in the impugned Act."
</blockquote><p id="p_188">Fresh  applications were filed by the State in a  number  of
the  other  appeals  seeking similar direction	as  in	C.A.
1649/86	 but the request does not show that any	 such  order
were passed in appeal other than C.A. 1649/86.	However,  it
seems that, in the case of coal, the cess is being collected
by  Western  Coalfields Ltd. and other	like  public  sector
organisation  (which  are subsidiaries of Coal	India  Ltd.)
from  all   their customers and passed on to the  State	 not
only  in Madhya Pradesh but also in Orissa (as indicated  in
sub-para (iii) above), apparently on the understanding	that
it should be refunded by the concerned State Government with
interest  in case the levy is ultimately held invalid.	 Sri
Bobde, appearing for the Western Coalfields , made it  clear
that  this  company would abide	 by the	 direction  of	this
Court,	in  so far as the amounts of cess  collected  by  it
remain	with it or are directed to be refunded by the  State
Government to it.
</p><p id="p_189">     We	 have  given  our  earned  consideration  to   these
contentions and were are of opinion that the ruling in India
Cement	 concludes   the  issue.   There   the	 Court	 was
specifically called upon to consider an argument that,	even
if the statutory levy should be found invalid, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">						       181</span>
Court  may  not give directions to  refund  amounts  already
collected  and the argument found favour with the  bench  of
seven  judges.	 We  are bound by  their  decision  in	this
regard.	 It is difficult to accept the plea that, in  giving
these  directions,  the Court overlooked the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_243">Article	 246</a>  and <a href="/doc/1405898/" id="a_244">265</a> of the Constitution.   The  Court	 was
fully  aware  of  the  position	 that  the  effect  of	 the
legislation is question being found beyond the competence of
the  State legislature was to render it void ab	 initio	 and
the  collections  made thereunder without the  authority  of
law.   Yet the Court considered that a direction  to  refund
all the cesses collected since 1964 would work hardship	 and
injustice.  The directions, now impugned, were given in	 the
interest of equity and justice after due  consideration	 and
we cannot take a contrary view.
</p><p id="p_190">     In	 our  view, we need enter into a discussion  of	 the
principles of prospective validation enunciated by at  lease
some of the Judges in Golaknath (supra) as the direction  in
India  Cement  can  be supported  on  another  well  settled
principle applicable in the area of the writ jurisdiction of
Courts.	 We are inclined to accept the view under on  behalf
of  the state that a finding regarding the invalidity  of  a
levy need not automatically result in a direction for  refund
of  all	 collections thereof made earlier.  The	 declaration
regarding   the	  invalidity   of  a   provision   and	 the
determination  of  the	relief that  should  be	 granted  in
consequence  thereof  are two different things and,  in	 the
latter	sphere,	 the Court has, and must be  held  to  have,
certain	  amount  of  discretion.   It	is  a	well-settled
proportion that it is open to the Court to grant , could  or
restrict  the  relief  in a inner most	appropriate  to	 the
situation  before  it  is insuch a way	as  to	advance	 the
interests of justice. It will be appreciated that it is	 not
always	possible  in all situations to give  a	logical	 and
complete effect to a finding.  Many situations of this arise
in actual practice . For instance , there are cases where a
comes to the conclusion that the termination of the  services
of  an employee is invalid, yet in refrains from giving	 him
benefits of "reinstatement" (i.e. continuity in service)  on
"back  wages".	 In such cases, the direction of  the  Court
does not  result in a person being denied the benefits	that
should flow to him as a logical consequence of a declaration
inhis  favour.	 It may be said that, in such  a  case,	 the
Court's direction does not violate any fundamental right  as
happens	 in a case like this were an "illegal"	exaction  is
sought to be retained by the State.  But even in the  latter
type of cases relief has not been considered automatic.	 One
of  the	 commonest issue that arose in the  context  of	 the
situation  we are concerned with is where a person  affected
by an illegal exaction files an application for refund under
the  provisions of the relevant statute of files a  suit  to
recover the taxes as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">						       182</span>
paid  under a mistake of law.  In such a case, the Court can
grant  relief only to extent permissible under the  relevant
rules  of limitation.  Even if he files an  application	 for
refund or a suit for recovery of the taxes paid for  several
years,	the  relief will be limited only to  the  period  in
regard	to  which the application for refund or a  suit	 for
recovery  of  the taxes paid for several years,	 the  relief
will  be limited only to the period in regard to  which	 the
application  or suit is not barred by limitation.   If	even
this instance is sought to be distinguished as a case  where
the  Court's hands are tied by limitations inherent  in	 the
form of forum in which the relief is sought, let us consider
a  very	 case  where a petitioner seeks	 relief	 against  an
illegal exaction in a writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_245">Article 226.</a>
In this situation, the question has often arisen whether the
petitioner's  prayer for refund of taxes collected  over  an
indefinite  period of years should be granted once the	levy
is  found  to  be illegal.  To answer the  question  in	 the
affirmative  would result in discrimination between  persons
based	on  their  choice  on  the  forum  for	 relief,   a
classification	which,	prima  facie is too  fragile  to  be
considered   a	 relevant  criterion   for   the   resulting
discrimination.	  This is one of the reasons why  there	 has
been  an understandable hesitation on the part of Courts  in
answering the above question in the affirmative.
</p><p id="p_191">     The  above aspect of the matter has been considered  in
several decisions of this Court.  <a href="/doc/1204286/" id="a_246">In State of Madhya Pradesh
v. Bhailal Bhai &amp; ORs</a>., [1964] 6 SCR 261 the respondents who
were dealers in tobacco in the State of Madhya Bharat  filed
a  writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_247">Article 226</a> of the  Constitution	 for
the issue of writ of mandamus directing the refund of  sales
tax collected from them on the ground that the impugned	 tax
was  violative	of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_248">Article 301 (a)</a> of the  Constitution	 and
that they had paid the same under a mistake of law.   It was
contended on behalf of the State that even if the  provision
violated  the fundamental rights, the High Court should	 not
exercise  its  discretionary  power of	issuing	 a  writ  of
mandamus directing refund since there was unreasonable delay
in  filing the petition.  This contention of the  State	 was
rejected by the High Court but on further appeal this  Court
tool a different view.	While agreeing that the Courts	have
the  power, for the purposes of enforcement  of	 fundamental
rights and statutory rights, to give a consequential  relief
by   ordering  repayment  of  any  money  realised  by	 the
government without authority of law, the Court said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_109">	  "At the same time we cannot lose sight of the fact
	  that the special remedy provided under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_249">Article 226</a>
	  is not intended to supersede completely the  modes
	  of  obtained relief by an action in a civil  court
	  or  to  deny defends	legitimately  open  in	such
	  actions.   It has been made clear more  than	once
	  that the power to give relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_250">Article 226</a> is
	  a discretionary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">						       183</span>
	  power. This is specially true in the case of power
	  to  issue writs in the nature of mandamus.   Among
	  the several matters which the High Courts  rightly
	  take	into consideration in the exercise  of	that
	  discretion  is  the delay made  by  the  aggrieved
	  party	 in  seeking  the special  remedy  and	what
	  excuse there is for it.  Another matter which	 can
	  be rightly taken into consideration is the  nature
	  of  the facts and law that may have to be  decided
	  as  regarded	the  availability  of  consequential
	  relief.  Thus, where, as in these cases, a  person
	  comes to the Court for relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_251">Article 226</a> on
	  the  allegations that he has been assessed to	 tax
	  under a void legislation and having paid it  under
	  a  mistake is entitled to get it back, if  it	 the
	  Court,  finds that the assessment was void,  being
	  made	under  a  void provision  of  law,  and	 the
	  payment was made by mistake, it is still not bound
	  to  exercise its discretion  directing  repayment.
	  Whether   repayment  should  be  ordered  in	 the
	  exercise  of this discretion will depend  in	each
	  case	of its own facts and circumstances.   It  is
	  not easy nor is it desirable to lay down any rules
	  of universal application it may however be  stated
	  as   a  general  rule	 that  if  there  has	been
	  unreasonable delay, the Court ought not ordinarily
	  to  lend its aid to a party by this  extraordinary
	  remedy of mandamus."
</blockquote><p id="p_192">The  Court  further  pointed  out  that	 the  delay  may  be
considered  unreasonable even if it is less than the  period
of  limitation prescribed for a civil action for the  remedy
but where the delay is more than this period, it will almost
always	be  proper  for	 the  court  to	 hold  that  it	  is
unreasonable.	The  relief  given by  the  High  Court	 was
modified on this basis.	 <a href="/doc/623976/" id="a_252">In Tilokchand Mothichand v.  Munshi</a>
[1969] 2 S.C.R., 824 the petitioners had collected sales tax
from  their  customers and paid it over to the	State.	 The
Sales Tax Authorities directed a refund but on the condition
that  the  amounts  should be passed on	 to  the  customers.
Since the petitioner did not comply with the condition,	 the
sales  tax  officer forfeited the sum under S.21(4)  of	 the
Bombay	Sales Tax Act, 1953.  A writ petition was  filed  by
the  petitioner contending that S.21(4)	 infringed  Articles
19[10(f)]  and 365 of the Constitution and hence, they	were
not  liable to repay the amount.  This was dismissed on	 the
ground	 that  they  had  defrauded  their  customers	and,
therefore,  not entitled to any relief even if there  was  a
violation  of fundamental rights.  An appeal to	 a  Division
Bench  was  also  dismissed.   Subsequently,  when  coercive
proceedings were taken for recovering the amounts as arrears
of  land revenue, the petitioners paid the amounts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">						       184</span>
in 1959-60.  Much later, there was a decision of this  Court
striking  down	the corresponding provision  of	 the  Bombay
Sales  Tax  Act	 1946  as  ultra  vires.   The	 petitioners
thereupon  filed  a writ petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_253">Article	 32</a>  of	 the
Constitution  claiming a refund of the amounts paid by	them
in  consequence of the recovery proceedings. It was held  by
four of the five learned Judges of this Court that the	writ
petition should be dismissed on the ground of laches.  Chief
Justice	 Hidayatullah held that though <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_254">Article 32</a> gives	 the
right  to  move	 the Court by  appropriate  proceedings	 for
enforcement of fundamental rights and State cannot place any
hindrance in the way of an aggrieved person, once the matter
reached this court, the extent or manner of interference was
for the Court to decide.  The learned Chief Justice  pointed
out  that  this Court  had put itself in  restraint  in	 the
matter	of  petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_255">Article 32.</a>	 For example,  if  a
party  had already moved High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_256">Article 226</a>,	this
court  would refuse to interfere.  Similarly,  in  inquiring
into  belated and stale claims, this Court should take	note
of evidence of neglect of the petitioner's own rights for  a
long  time or of the rights of innocent parties which  might
have merged by reason of the delay. It was possible for this
Court  to lay down any specific period as the ultimate limit
of action and the case will have to be considered on its own
facts.	 On  the facts of the case before it,  the  majority
found  that the petitioner had by his own conduct  abandoned
his  litigation	 years ago and	could not  be  permitted  to
resume	it  several years later merely	because	 some  other
person	had got the statue declared unconstitutional.  While
Hidayatullah C.J. was of the view that the Court should not,
on the facts of the case apply for analogy of the article in
the  <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_257">Limitation Act</a> in cases of mistake of law give  relief,
Bachawat  and Mitter JJ. felt that even for a writ  petition
the limitation period fixed for a suit would be a reasonable
standard  for  measuring  delay.    Sikri  J  and  Hegde  J.
dissented. Sikri J. was of the view that on the facts of the
case  there  was  no delay but that  the  period  under	 the
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_258">Limitation Act</a> should not be applied to such cases and	that
a  period  of one year should be taken as  a  period  beyond
which the claim would be considered a stale claim unless the
delay  is  explained. " Such a practice" the  learned  Judge
observed, "would not destroy the guarantee under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_259">Article  32</a>
because	 the  article  nowhere lays  down  that	 a  petition
however	 late,	should be entertained.	Only  Hegde  J.	 was
emphatic  that laches or limitation should be no  ground  to
deny  relief.  The learned Judge observed (for	brevity,  we
quote from head note):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_110">	  "Since  the right given to the  petitioners  under
	  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_260">Article 32</a> is itself a fundamental right and	does
	  not  depend  on the discretionary powers  of	this
	  Court, as in the case of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_261">Article
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">						       185</span>
	 226</a>, it is inappropriate to equate the duty imposed
	 on  this Court to the powers of Chancery  Court  in
	 England or the equitable jurisdiction of Courts  in
	 the  United States.  The facts that the  petitioner
	 have  no  equity in their favour is  an  irrelevant
	 circumstance  in deciding the nature of  the  right
	 available  to an aggrieved party under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_262">Article	 32.</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_193">	 This Court is charged by the Constitution with	 the
	 special responsibility of protecting and  enforcing
	 the  fundamental  rights, and hence laches  on	 the
	 part  of an aggrieved party cannot deprive  him  of
	 his right to get relief under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_263">Article 32.</a>  In fact,
	 law  reports do not show a single instance of	this
	 Court	refusing to grant relief on the	 grounds  of
	 delay.	 If  this Court could refuse relief  on	 the
	 ground	 of  delay , the power of  the	Court  under
	 <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_264">Article  32</a>  would be discretionary power  and	 the
	 right	would cease to be a fundamental right.	 The
	 provisions  contained in the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_265">Limitation Act</a> do	 not
	 apply to proceedings under Articles 226 and 32	 and
	 if  these  provisions	of the	<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_266">Limitation  Act</a>	 are
	 brought  in  indirectly  to  control  the  remedies
	 conferred  by the Constitution, it would be a	case
	 of Parliament indirectly abridging the	 fundamental
	 rights	 which	this  court,  in  Golaknath's  case.
	 [1967]2 S.C.R. 752 held that Parliament cannot	 do.
	 The fear that forgotten claims and discarded  right
	 against  Government  may be sought to	be  enforced
	 after the lapse of a number of years if fundamental
	 rights are held to be enforceable without any	time
	 limit,	 is an exaggerated one, for , after  all,  a
	 petitioner can only enforce an existing right."
The above principles have been applied in several subsequent
cases:	<a href="/doc/20762/" id="a_267">Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar v. State of	Maharastara</a>,
[1974] 2 SCR 216; Shri Vallabh Glass works Ltd. v. union  of
India  [1984] 3 SCR 180; <a href="/doc/320843/" id="a_268">State of M.P. v.  Nandlal  Jaiswal</a>,
[1986]	4  SCC	566; <a href="/doc/1907321/" id="a_269">D. Cawasji &amp; Co. v.  State	 of  Mysore</a>,

of Taxes</a>.[1988] 1 SCC 401.
</p><p id="p_194">     The  above	 cases no doubt only list  situations  where
directions for refund have been refused, or considered to be
liable	to be refused, on grounds of unreasonable  delay  or
laches	on  the part of the petitioners in  approaching	 the
Court	in  the	 interests  of	justice	 and  equity.	 The
importance of these cases, however, lies not in the  grounds
on  which refund has been held declinable but  because	they
lay  down unequivocally that the grant of refund is  not  an
automatic consequence of a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">						       186</span>
declaration  of	 illegality.  Once the	principle  that	 the
Court  has  a  discretion  to grant  or	 decline  refund  is
recognised,  the ground on which such discretion  should  be
exercised is a matter of consideration for the Court  having
regard to all the circumstances of the case.  It is possible
that  a direction for refund may be opposed by the State  on
grounds	 other	than  laches  or  limitation.	To  give  an
instance,  in  recent years the question  has  often  arisen
whether	 a  refund could be refused on the ground  that	 the
person who seeks the refund has already passed on the burden
of  the illegal tax to others and that to grant a refund  to
him would result in his "unjust enrichment". Some  decisions
have  suggested a solution of neither granting a refund	 nor
permitting  the State to retain the illegal exaction.	This
issue has been referred to a larger Bench of this Court	 and
its  is	 not necessary for us to enter	into  that  question
here.	so  far as the present cases are  concerned,  it  is
sufficient   to	 point	out  that  all	the  decided   cases
unmistakably  show  that, even where the levy  of  taxes  is
fount  to be unconstitutional, the Court is not	 obliged  to
grant  an  order of refund.  It is entitled  to	 refuse	 the
prayer	for good and valid reasons.  Laches and undue  delay
or  intervention of third party rights would clearly be	 one
of those reasons.  Unjust enrichment of the refundee may  or
may  not  be another.  But we see no reason  why  the  vital
interests of the State, taken note of by the learned  judges
in  India  Cement  should not be a  relevant  criterion	 for
deciding  that	a  refund should not be	 granted.   We	are,
therefore, unable to agree with the learned counsel for	 the
petitioners  that any different criterion should be  adopted
and  that  the	direction in paragraph 35  of  India  Cement
should not be followed in those cases.
</p><p id="p_195">     For  the  reasons discussed above, we  are	 of  opinion
that,  though  the levy of the	cess  was  unconstitutional,
there shall be no direction to refund the  assessees of	 any
amounts	 of cess collected until the date on which the	levy
in  question  has been declared	 unconstitutional.  This  in
regard	to  the	 Bihar	cases, will  be	 the  date  of	this
judgement.  In respect of Orissa, the relevant date will  be
22.12.1989  on which date, the High Court,  following  India
Cement	 declared   the	 levy  by  the	 State	 Legislature
unconstitutional.    In	 respect  of  Madhya  Pradesh,	 the
relevant date will be the date of the judgement	 in  Hiralal
Ramswarup  and connected cases (viz. M.P. 410/83 decided  on
28.3.1986)  in	respect of the levy under <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_271">State	 Act</a>  15  th
1982.	Though there are the dates of the Judgement  of	 the
appropriate   High  Court,  which  may	not   constitute   a
declaration  of law within the scope of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_272">Article 141</a>  of	 the
constitution,  it cannot be gainsaid that the State  cannot,
on  any grounds of equity, be permitted to retain  the	cess
collected  on  and  after  the	date  of  the  High  Court's
judgement.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">						       187</span>
<p id="p_196">     Another  point  that was raised, was that	in  many  of
these cases the State or a Coal field Companies had given an
undertaking  that incase the levy is held to be	 invalid  by
this  Court,  they would refund the amount  collection	with
interest.   It is submitted that the condition	imposed,  or
undertakings given, to this effect and recorded at the	time
of  passing  interim orders in the various cases  should  be
given  implemented. The interim undertakings  or  directions
cannot	be understood in such a manner as to  conflict	with
out final decision on the writ petitions set out above.	 But
we  agree  that, to the extend refunds of amounts  of	cess
collected  after the relevant dates are permissible  on	 the
basis indicated by us, the State should refund those amounts
to  the	 assessees directly or to the Coalfields  from	whom
they  were collected, with interest at the rate directed  by
this Court or mentioned in the undertaking from the date  of
the relevant judgment to the actual date of repayment.	 The
Coalfields, when hey get th refunds, should pass on the same
to their customers, the assessees.
