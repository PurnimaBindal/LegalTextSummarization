<p id="p_1">BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J

</p><p id="p_2">1.      The appellants („Intex‟) are aggrieved by the judgment and / or order

dated 24.12.2016 delivered by a learned single Judge of this court in IA

No.17138/2013, which was an application filed under Order XXXIX Rules

1 &amp; 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 („Code‟) in CS(OS) 2060/2013,

filed by the respondents („AZ Tech‟). The said suit and application were

filed in respect of the trade mark „AQUA‟. The respondents filed the said

suit seeking a permanent injunction against the appellants („Intex‟)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                 Page 1 of 48</span>
 restraining them from using the mark „AQUA‟ in respect of mobile phones

/ cellular phones. The case was one of purported passing off. By virtue of

the impugned judgment and / or order, the learned single Judge has allowed

the application (IA No.17138/2013) filed by the respondents under Order

XXXIX Rules 1 &amp; 2 of the Code and has restrained Intex from using the

mark "AQUA" or any other deceptively similar mark in respect of cellular /

mobile phones and their accessories. Of course, when the present appeal

came up for hearing on 06.01.2017, we had granted stay of the operation of

the said judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">2.      Mr Sudhir Chandra, the learned senior counsel, appearing on behalf

of Intex, submitted that as per the respondents, Intex had launched its

product under the mark "AQUA" in 2012. This is evidenced by paragraph

17 of the amended plaint.       However, Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted

specifically that Intex launched its mobile phones under the mark "AQUA"

in August 2012.      He also submitted that, as indicated in their written

statement, the adoption of the mark "AQUA" was an honest adoption as it

had no knowledge whatsoever of the respondent‟s product under the mark

"AQUA". In fact, it was submitted that at the time when the Intex launched




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                            Page 2 of 48</span>
 its product under the mark "AQUA", the respondent‟s alleged product with

the mark "AQUA" was non-existent in the market.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.      The learned senior counsel further submitted that the suit was filed

on 28.10.2013, that is, after 14 months of the launch of the mobile phones

of Intex under the mark "AQUA" which was, as pointed out above, within

the knowledge of the respondents.       Within this period, Intex had sold

"AQUA" phones to the extent of Rs 200 crores. It was pointed out that

between 01.08.2012 and 31.03.2013, Intex had sold 1.75 lakh phones under

the mark "AQUA". Between 01.04.2013 and 13.11.2013, a further 2 lakh

phones under the mark had been sold by Intex. It was also pointed out that

approximately Rs 27 crores were spent on advertising and, in particular, on

TV Commercials, which include commercials featuring the famous actor,

Mr Farhan Akhtar. It was also submitted that the TV advertisements were

first telecast on 11.06.2013 and the second video clip was telecast on

01.10.2013 onwards.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4.      Mr Sudhir Chandra further pointed out that the sales in 2015-16 of

the appellant‟s mobile phones under the mark "AQUA" had grown to Rs

3193 crores. He also pointed out that far from the appellant attempting to

ride on the goodwill and reputation of the respondents, it was the latter who


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                               Page 3 of 48</span>
 tried to benefit from the appellant‟s mark "AQUA". He submitted that this

is evidenced by the fact that AZ Tech, which allegedly had been using a

different font and style for its mark "AQUA", adopted an identical font and

style which had been used by Intex. This imitation, according to the

appellant, was done in the year 2015 during the pendency of the suit filed

by the respondents [CS(OS) 20602013]. The font and style of the word

mark "AQUA", as used by AZ Tech and Intex and copied by AZ Tech in

2015, are set out in tabular form hereinbelow:-

</blockquote><p id="p_9">5.      Because of this, Intex filed CS(OS) 2668/2015 against the

respondents for infringement of copyright and for passing off. It was

pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that no explanation was

offered by AZ Tech as to why this was done and the only reply forthcoming

was that this was done to give a „fresh approach‟. However, the said suit

was disposed of by a learned single Judge of this court on 05.12.2016 as

AZ Tech had indicated its intention not to use the artistic work, which was




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                              Page 4 of 48</span>
 the subject matter of the suit. The operative portion of the order passed on

05.12.2016 in that suit is as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                "Learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the
        defendants submits that the defendants do not intend to use the
        artistic work, subject matter of the present suit, without
        prejudice to the rights and contentions as raised by the
        defendants in Suit No. 2060/2013 on the word mark "AQUA"
        and the plaintiffs giving up the relief and costs. Mr. Anand,
        learned counsel for the plaintiffs very fairly agrees to the
        same.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                Accordingly, the suit is disposed of binding the
        defendants to the statement made by the learned Senior
        Counsel appearing on their behalf, on instructions. The
        statement so made shall be treated as an undertaking to this
        Court. The undertaking is accepted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">6.      It was submitted that the fact that the respondents copied the font and

style and the artistic work in the logo employing the word mark "AQUA",

clearly demonstrated two things. First of all, it demonstrated the dishonest

conduct on the part of the respondent, particularly because this was done

during the pendency of the suit filed by the respondents which was pending

before this court. Secondly, this indicated that it was not Intex which was

trying to pass off its goods as those of the respondents, but just the other

way round.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">7.      Mr Sudhir Chandra, however, submitted that the impugned judgment

and / or order cannot be sustained on account of several points of law which



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                Page 5 of 48</span>
 were not taken into account by the learned single Judge. The points were as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        I.      Before an injunction in a passing off action can be passed in
                favour of the plaintiff, the plaintiff must establish that it had a
                goodwill / reputation in the mark on the relevant date, that is,
                the date when the defendant is alleged to have launched its
                product under the same or deceptively similar mark;
        II.     Insofar as the point of similarity or deceptive similarity of the
                mark is concerned, the issue of added matter is also an
                important one while considering the grant of an injunction in a
                passing off action;

                going towards disentitling the plaintiff to an injunction and, at
                least, to an ad interim injunction;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        IV.     The principles of grant of an interim injunction had not been
                considered in the correct light by the learned single Judge;
        V.      The plaintiff‟s (AZ Tech‟s) conduct in copying the font and
                style of the logo used by Intex was clearly dishonest and
                would disentitle it to the equitable remedy of injunction;

<p id="p_13">We shall consider each of these points in detail.
</p>
<p id="p_14">I.    Before an injunction in a passing off action can be passed in
      favour of the plaintiff, the plaintiff must establish that it had a
      goodwill / reputation in the mark on the relevant date, that is, the

</p><p id="p_16"> 8.      On behalf of the appellants, it was submitted that in order to succeed

in a passing off action, the classical trinity of (1) goodwill / reputation; (2)

misrepresentation; and (3) likelihood of damage has to be established.

Insofar as goodwill is concerned, it is gauged by the volume of sales and

the extent of advertisements. Reference was made to the decision of the

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_1">Satyam Infoway Limited v. Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd</a>:

2004 (28) PTC 566 (SC) and, in particular, to paragraph 12 thereof which

reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        "12. The next question is would the principles of trade mark
        law and in particular those relating to passing off apply? An
        action for passing off, as the phrase "passing off" itself
        suggests, is to restrain the defendant from passing off its goods
        or services to the public as that of the plaintiff's. It is an action
        not only to preserve the reputation of the plaintiff but also to
        safeguard the public. The defendant must have sold its goods or
        offered its services in a manner which has deceived or would be
        likely to deceive the public into thinking that the defendant's
        goods or services are the plaintiff's. The action is normally
        available to the owner of a distinctive trademark and the person
        who, if the word or name is an invented one, invents and uses it.
        If two trade rivals claim to have individually invented the same
        mark, then the trader who is able to establish prior user will
        succeed. The question is, as has been aptly put, who gets these
        first? It is not essential for the plaintiff to prove long user to
        establish reputation in a passing off action. It would depend
        upon the volume of sales and extent of advertisement."

Shah and Another: 2002 (3) SCC 65. In the said decision, the Supreme

Court observed as under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "8. It is common in trade and business for a trader or a
        businessman to adopt a name and/or mark under which he
        would carry on his trade or business. According to Kerly
        (Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 12th Edn., para
        16.49), the name under which a business trades will almost
        always be a trade mark (or if the business provides services, a
        service mark, or both). Independently of questions of trade or
        service mark, however, the name of a business (a trading
        business or any other) will normally have attached to it a
        goodwill that the courts will protect. An action for passing-
        off will then lie wherever the defendant company's name, or
        its intended name, is calculated to deceive, and so to divert
        business from the plaintiff, or to occasion a confusion
        between the two businesses. If this is not made out there is no
        case. The ground is not to be limited to the date of the
        proceedings; the court will have regard to the way in which
        the business may be carried on in the future, and to its not
        being carried on precisely as carried on at the date of the
        proceedings. Where there is probability of confusion in
        business, an injunction will be granted even though the
        defendants adopted the name innocently.

        as in case of a profession under a trading name or style. With
        the lapse of time such business or services associated with a
        person acquire a reputation or goodwill which becomes a
        property which is protected by courts. A competitor initiating
        sale of goods or services in the same name or by imitating that
        name results in injury to the business of one who has the

         property in that name. The law does not permit any one to
        carry on his business in such a way as would persuade the
        customers or clients in believing that the goods or services
        belonging to someone else are his or are associated therewith.
        It does not matter whether the latter person does so
        fraudulently or otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly,
        honesty and fair play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in
        the world of business. Secondly, when a person adopts or
        intends to adopt a name in connection with his business or
        services which already belongs to someone else it results in
        confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers and
        clients of someone else to himself and thereby resulting in
        injury.

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             "The legal and economic basis of this tort is to provide
             protection for the right of property which exists not in a
             particular name, mark or style but in an established
             business, commercial or professional reputation or
             goodwill. So to sell merchandise or carry on business
             under such a name, mark, description, or otherwise in
             such a manner as to mislead the public into believing

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">        12. In Oertli v. Bowman [1957 RPC 388 (CA)] (at p. 397)
        the gist of passing-off action was defined by stating that it was
        essential to the success of any claim to passing-off based on
        the use of given mark or get-up that the plaintiff should be able
        to show that the disputed mark or get-up has become by user
        in the country distinctive of the plaintiff's goods so that the use
        in relation to any goods of the kind dealt in by the plaintiff of
        that mark or get-up will be understood by the trade and the
        public in that country as meaning that the goods are the
        plaintiff's goods. It is in the nature of acquisition of a quasi-
        proprietary right to the exclusive use of the mark or get-up in
        relation to goods of that kind because of the plaintiff having
        used or made it known that the mark or get-up has relation to
        his goods. Such right is invaded by anyone using the same or
        some deceptively similar mark, get-up or name in relation to
        goods not of plaintiff. The three elements of passing-off action
        are the reputation of goods, possibility of deception and
        likelihood of damages to the plaintiff. In our opinion, the
        same principle, which applies to trade mark, is applicable to

             inherently distinctive marks ownership is governed by the
             priority of use of such marks. The first user in the sale of
             goods or service is the owner and senior user. These
             marks are given legal protection against infringement
             immediately upon adoption and use in trade if two
             companies make use of the same trade mark and the gist

             goods.

<blockquote id="blockquote_26">        8.     Some courts indicate that even prior small sales of goods
        with the mark are sufficient to establish priority, the test being
        to determine continuous prior user and the volume of sale or the
        degree of familiarity of the public with the mark. Bona fide test
        of marketing, promotional gifts and experimental sales in small
        volume may be sufficient to establish a continuous prior use of
        the mark. But on some other occasions courts have classified
        small sales volume as so small and inconsequential for priority
        purposes. Therefore, these facts will have to be thrashed out at
        the trial and at the stage of grant of temporary injunction a
        strong prima facie case will have to be established. It has also to
        be borne in mind whether the appellant had also honestly and
        concurrently used the trade marks or there are other special
        circumstances arising in the matter. The courts below have
        merely looked at what the prima facie case is and tried to decide
        the matter without considering the various other aspects arising
        in the matter. Therefore, we think, the appropriate order to be
        made is that injunction either in the favour of the appellant or
        against them or vice versa is not appropriate and the
        proceedings in the suit shall be conducted as expeditiously as
        possible or the Registrar under the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_7">Merchandise

        even by the learned Single Judge. But this prima facie case
        made out by the appellant is said to be considerably watered

 Court observed that traditionally, passing off in common law is considered

to be a right for protection of goodwill in the business against

misrepresentation caused in the course of trade and for prevention of the

resultant damage on account of the said misrepresentation and that the three

ingredients of passing off are goodwill, misrepresentation and damage. The

Supreme Court reiterated that these ingredients are considered to be the

classical trinity under the law of passing off. It was observed that the use of

a mark in respect of a business confers the rights in favour of the person,

who has used it and generates goodwill in the market. It was also observed

that a later user of the same mark or deceptively similar mark cannot be

permitted to misrepresent his business as that of the prior right holder. It

was further observed that this is the reason why essentially the prior user is

considered to be superior than that of any other rights.

                    and goodwill, since they are not synonymous. As "the
                    attractive force which brings in custom", goodwill is a
                    form of legal property, representing the connection
                    between business and customer. Reputation is a
                    matter of fact: to what extent is the indicium in
                    question known in the public mind? The existence of
                    reputation does not require there to be a business in
                    this country, whereas there must be some business or
                    market in this country for goodwill to exist.</blockquote><p id="p_22">

necessary ingredient of the tort of passing off and that although goodwill

and reputation are closely linked, they are not necessarily the same thing.

For example, an internationally known mark may have a reputation in this

country, but yet have no goodwill because there are no sales of the product

under that mark in this country. In the above extract, it has been clearly

indicated that goodwill is the attractive force which brings in custom and is

a form of legal property representing the connection between the business

and customer. Whereas, reputation is a matter of fact and its existence does

not require that there should be a business in this country. However, there

must be some business or market in this country for goodwill to exist.

</p><p id="p_30"> 18.     Based on the submissions made by the learned counsel for the

parties, this much is clear that the establishment of goodwill is an essential

ingredient of the tort of passing off. There is also a clear distinction

between reputation and goodwill. Thus, while the respondents and, in

particular, the respondent No.2 may have a reputation in Hong Kong or in

other parts of the world insofar as its mark "AQUA" is concerned, it cannot

be regarded as having a goodwill in India unless and until there are sales

and an established market in India. It is also evident that insofar as a

registered trade mark is concerned, the property exists in the mark, but in

the case of passing off, the property is not in the mark but in the goodwill.

The establishment of goodwill is indicated by the extent of sales and the

advertising expenses etc.    We agree with Mr Sudhir Chandra that the

decision in Century Traders (supra) may have been misunderstood and

perhaps misapplied in a number of cases.

entirely different concepts. Insofar as a trade mark is concerned, it is

of the mark is concerned, may be sufficient but, it is not so in the case of

establishing goodwill in respect of that mark. Insofar as the question of

 goodwill in the present case is concerned, we find that as on August, 2012,

when Intex started selling its mobile phones under the mark, "AQUA", it

cannot be stated with any degree of confidence that the mark „AQUA‟ had

acquired a goodwill or reputation in respect of the respondents mobile

phones. The property which is protected in an action of passing off is not

the plaintiff‟s proprietary right in the mark which the defendant allegedly

misappropriates, but the goodwill and reputation of his business, which is

likely to be harmed by the defendants misrepresentation (see: Reddaway v.

„AQUA‟.

        otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an

Intex, to the word mark "AQUA" was sufficient to distinguish the

appellant‟s goods from those of the respondent. A reference was also made

to a Division Bench decision of this court in Star Bazar Pvt Ltd v. Trent

<blockquote id="blockquote_54">        "21. On a consideration of the entire case law placed before us
        as well as on the facts as presented, it is quite clear that one of
        the primary requirements for the grant of temporary injunction
        in a case of passing off is that the customers of a Plaintiff might
        be led to believe or might be confused between the goods of
        that Plaintiff and the goods of the Defendant. To avoid any such
        confusion, learned Counsel for the Respondent has made it
        absolutely clear that his client is willing to add the words "A
        Tata Enterprise" or words to the same effect above "Star
        Bazaar" in respect of its retail store in Delhi. In our opinion,
        once these words are added, it is unlikely that there would
        remain any confusion in the mind of any customer that the retail
        departmental store of the Respondent is the same as the retail
        departmental store of the Appellant. This by itself should dispel
        all doubts that any customer might have and should be adequate
        protection in so far as the Appellant is concerned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">        22. However, learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted
        that the prior use of "Star Bazaar" by his client cannot be
        forgotten. We agree (and this was argued by learned Counsel
        for the Respondent on a demurrer) that the Appellant is a prior
        user of "Star Bazaar" and if another store by the same name is
        opened up by somebody else in another part of Delhi, it is likely
        to lead to a diversion of customers in the normal course of
        business. However, if it is made absolutely clear to those
        customers that the two stores are distinct entities having no
        connection with each other, even this likelihood of diversion
        will disappear. In our opinion, this can be achieved by the
        Respondent using the words "A Tata Enterprise" above "Star
        Bazaar" in its retail departmental store to be opened in Delhi."

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_57"> 22.     This was relied upon by Mr Sudhir Chandra to indicate that by

addition of the words, two similar marks can be easily distinguished so as

to enable the customers to differentiate the two products as having no

connection with each other and indicating that the sources of the two

products were different. In that case, the Division Bench was of the view

that the use of the words "A Tata Enterprise" above Star Bazar was

sufficient to distinguish the appellant from the respondent. Mr Sudhir

Chandra submitted that even when there was a similarity, the court directed

that the above words be added to bring about a distinction. But, in the

present case, even this is not necessary. The word "Intex" is already used

alongwith the word mark "AQUA" in respect of mobile phones.

<p id="p_38">23.     Ms Pratibha M. Singh, in response to the added matter argument,

submitted that the issue was much more complex than what Mr Sudhir

Chandra made it out to be. There were the concepts of initial interest

confusion, reverse confusion as also the case that on facts, the present case

would not be one of added matter. Insofar as the concept of initial interest

confusion was concerned, reliance was placed on the decision of a Division

Bench of this court in the case of <a href="/doc/23763843/" id="a_17">Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd and

Another v. Allied Blender and Distillers Pvt. Ltd</a>: 2015 (63) PTC 551

 (Del) (DB). In that decision, it was pointed out that confusion can be of the

following categories:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">        (1)     Point of Sale confusion;
        (2)     Post-sale confusion;
        (3)     Initial interest confusion, which refers to the confusion that
</pre><p id="p_39">                may be caused initially, that is, prior to purchase, but at the
                time of purchase of alleged infringer‟s / tortfeasor‟s product or
                using its service, the consumer is not confused;
</p><p id="p_40">        (4)     Reverse confusion. This occurs when consumers purchase the
                goods or use services of senior user thinking them to originate
                from the junior user. It was also noted in the said decision that
                when a person knows that the mark in question does not
                originate from the senior user but the senior user is called to
                mind, then it is a step before confusion. If on the other hand,
                the consumer is in a state of wanderment if there is a
                connection, this is confusion. It was further observed that if
                this consumer then purchases the junior user‟s product, this is
                then deception.
</p>
<p id="p_41">24.     A reference was also made to a single Bench decision in the case of

<a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_18">Baker Hughes Limited v. Hiroo Khushalani</a>: 1998 PTC (18) 580. In that

decision, a learned single Judge of this court noted that there could be an

informed class of purchasers, who had a degree of knowledge and a sense

of discrimination more substantial than that of ordinary purchasers, but the

 mere fact that the consumers are sophisticated, knowledgeable and

discriminating does not rule out the element of confusion if the trade marks

/ trade names / corporate names of two companies were identical or if the

similarity between them was profound. It was further observed that in

several cases it has been held that initial confusion is likely to arise even

amongst sophisticated and knowledgeable purchasers under the mistaken

belief that the two companies using the same corporate name, trading name

or style are inter-related. Therefore, it does not matter if, after the initial

confusion, the same is removed and there does not exist any confusion at

the point of purchase.

Unfair Competition, 4th Edition (Thomson Reuters), wherein reverse

confusion has been dealt with as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">      "23:10 Reverse confusion
        What is "Reverse Confusion"? The traditional pattern of
      classic "forward confusion" occurs when customers mistakenly
      think that the junior user‟s goods or services are from the same
      source as or are connected with the senior user‟s goods or
      services. Customers want to buy the senior user‟s product and
      because of the similarity of marks, mistakenly buy the junior
      user‟s product instead. In "reverse confusion," customers
      purchase the senior user‟s goods under the mistaken impression
      that they are getting the goods of the junior user. That is,
      reverse confusion occurs when the junior user‟s advertising and
      promotion so swamps the senior user‟s reputation in the market


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                Page 30 of 48</span>
       that customers are likely to be confused into thinking that the
      senior user‟s goods are those of the junior user: the reverse of
      traditional confusion.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_59">          In a reverse confusion situation, rather than trying to profit
        from the senior user‟s mark, the junior user saturates the
        market and "overwhelms the senior user." "The result is that
        the senior user loses the value of the trademark, its product
        identity, corporate identity, control over its goodwill and
        reputation, and ability to move into new markets." The Second
        Circuit has said that: "Reverse confusion is the misimpression
        that the junior user is the source of the senior user‟s goods....
        [C]onsumers may consider [the senior user] the unauthorized
        infringer, and [the senior user‟s] reputation and impair its
        goodwill."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_60">          A reverse confusion case is proven only if the evidence
        shows that the junior user was able to swamp the reputation of
        the senior user with a relatively much larger advertising
        campaign. As the Third Circuit remarked: "[T]he doctrine of
        reverse confusion is designed to prevent the calamitous
        situation we have here - a larger, more powerful company
        usurping the business identity of a smaller senior user."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">          Large Company Rolls Over Small Senior User. The
        archetypical case of reverse confusion occurs when the junior
        user is a larger company which, prior to its nationwide launch,
        discovers a small (usually regional) senior user with a very
        similar mark in a related field. Because the smaller senior user
        has only a relatively small group of customers, the large
        company may (mistakenly) think that there is no conflict
        because there will be only a local and minimal level of
        forward confusion. And the junior user has no intention of
        taking a free ride on the goodwill and reputation of the small,
        local user. So the junior user rolls out its new mark nationally,
        swamping the local recognition of the senior user. For
        example, assume the hypothetical senior user uses AUNTIE
        ISABELLA‟S as its mark for a chain of three small pizza
        restaurants in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington.
        Hypothetical national marketer Colossal Foods Inc.
        coincidentally chooses the mark AUNT ISABELLA‟ for its

            new nationally distributed line of frozen pizza. Colossal
           Foods finds the senior user on a trademark search, but
           dismissing it as a tiny user with only local recognition, decides
           to launch nationally.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">             Forward confusion will be likely to occur only when people
           in Seattle who know of the local senior user first come into
           contract with the junior user‟s nationally advertised and
           distributed product and, because of the similarity of the marks,
           mistakenly think that the junior user is an offshoot or licensee
           of the senior user. Reverse confusion will be likely to occur
           when a person who only knows of the well-known junior user
           (e.g. a visitor from San Francisco) first comes into contact
           with the lesser-known senior user in Seattle and, because of
           the similarity of the marks, mistakenly thinks that the senior
           user is the same as or is affiliated or connected with the junior
           user. Simply put, when a large national company finds a
           conflicting mark of a small local user on a trademark search, it
           cannot simply go ahead and roll over the smaller senior user.
           To avoid the risk of losing a case of reverse confusion,
           Colossal Foods must either buy the senior user‟s mark or
           change to another mark.3"

that if the added matter is so prominent as to completely distinguish one

product from the other, then there would be no case for confusion whether

it be confusion proper or, initial confusion or reverse confusion. In the

present case, we find that the mark "Intex" is as prominent, if not more,

than the mark "AQUA" in the appellant‟s product packaging. This is also

evident from the images of the packaging employed by the parties as given

the alleged senior user of the said mark. Such evidence, even upon a prima

would escape liability inasmuch as the added matter is, in our view,

sufficient to distinguish the appellant‟s products from those of the

respondents.

 III.    Delay in filing the suit is also to be considered as a factor going
        towards disentitling the plaintiff to an injunction and at least to
        an ad interim injunction.

<p id="p_51">21.     Mr Sudhir Chandra submitted that there was clear delay of at least 14

months in the filing of the suit from the date on which the appellant

launched its products under the mark "AQUA". During this period, the

respondents allowed the appellant‟s business to grow. A huge amount of

expenditure amounting to approximately Rs 27 crores was spent by the

appellants on TV Commercials, as already noted above. He submitted that

there was no explanation whatsoever for the delay, there was also no cease

and desist notice issued to the appellant by the respondents. A reference

was made to the decision of a learned single Judge of this court in <a href="/doc/1214260/" id="a_19">BDA

                injunction is merely of a provisional nature and does
                not conclude the rights of the parties in any way, the
                Court will exercise its discretion in favour of the
                applicant only in strong cases. The plaintiff must make
                out a prima facie case in support of his application for
                the ad interim injunction and must satisfy the Court
                that his legal right has been infringed and in all
                probability will succeed ultimately in the action. This

                reason of the acquiescence or delay or other estoppel
                or of the defendant's concurrent rights, the Court will

                arise from granting or withholding the injunction as
                well as the justice of the cause after considering all the

                balance of convenience that is by the relative amount
                of damage which seems likely to result if the

<p id="p_53"> 23.     From the above extract, it is evident that improper and unexplained

delay is fatal to an application for an interlocutory injunction and an interim

injunction is not to be granted if the plaintiff had delayed action until the

defendant had built-up a large trade in which he has notoriously used the

mark.      Furthermore, the considerations where a defendant is yet to

commence his enterprise and where he has already done so, would be

different. This would be particularly relevant in the backdrop of delay in

filing the suit and in seeking an interlocutory injunction.


</p><p id="p_54">24.     It was sought to be contended on behalf of the respondents that the

point of delay was not raised before the learned single Judge. However, in

any event, it was contended that, in fact, there was no delay.           It was

submitted that till June 2013, there was no publicity of the appellant‟s

marks and the suit was filed in 2013. Reference was made to the decision

in Sumeet Machines (supra) as also to Cadila Pharmaceuticals Limited v.

Sami Khatib of Mumbai and Another: 2011 (47) PTC 69 (Bom.)(DB).


</p><p id="p_55">25.     Upon considering the arguments on this aspect of the matter, we

would tend to agree with the submissions made by Mr Sudhir Chandra that

there was delay in filing the suit. In paragraph 17 of the amended plaint



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                Page 38 of 48</span>
 itself, it was stated by the respondent / plaintiff that Intex had launched its

product in 2012. The suit was filed much later on 28.10.2013. During this

period, the appellant had sold phones under the mark "AQUA" to the extent

of Rs 200 crores.      Approximately, Rs 27 crores had been spent on

advertisements and, particularly, the TV commercials featuring the famous

actor, Mr Farhan Akhtar. By 31.03.2013, the appellant had sold 1.75 lakh

phones under the mark "AQUA" and this number rose to 3.14 lakh phones

between 01.04.2013 and 13.11.2013. It, therefore, becomes clear that the

presence of the appellant in the market in India under the mark "AQUA"

was not insignificant. The respondent itself noted that the appellant (Intex)

had launched its product under the mark "AQUA" in 2012. There is no

explanation forthcoming as to why there was a delay of at least 14 months

in approaching the court. During this period, the business of the appellant

grew to a large extent.      It was not as if the appellant was about to

commence the sale of its products under the word mark "AQUA" or that it

had just recently commenced such marketing. In fact, the appellant was in

the market and with a great deal of publicity. In this backdrop, the aspect

of delay attains a greater significance and, therefore, would disentitle the

respondent from obtaining an interlocutory injunction.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                Page 39 of 48</span>
 IV.     The principles of grant of an interim injunction had not been
        considered in the correct light by the learned single Judge.

</p><p id="p_56">26.     It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that one of the principles

of grant of interim injunction was to consider the injury that may be caused

to the defendant in case an injunction is granted. It was submitted that if

this was considered in the correct perspective, which the learned single

Judge did not do, the balance of convenience would be in favour of the

defendant / appellant and against the grant of an interlocutory injunction. It

was submitted that irreparable injury would be caused to the appellant as,

by the time the impugned judgment was passed, the sales of the appellant‟s

phones under the mark "AQUA" had attained massive proportions. As an

example, in 2015-16, the revenue from the sale of such phones was Rs

3193 crores and in 2016-17 till December, the sales were approximately Rs

2000 crores.         Advertising costs till December 2016 in respect of the

products sold under the "AQUA" mark had gone up to Rs 250 crores. Even

on the date of filing of the suit, the appellants were in the market under the

mark "AQUA" in a big way. It was submitted that if the appellant is

injuncted, irreparable injury would be caused to it, whereas there would be

no corresponding injury to the respondent / plaintiff.        In fact, it was

submitted that they even tried to ride piggy back on the goodwill and

 reputation of the appellant by attempting to copy the font and style of the

word mark "AQUA", as already mentioned above. It was submitted that in

case the injunction is not granted, the respondent‟s phone under the mark

"AQUA" would sell even more.

in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_23">Wander Limited &amp; Another v. Antox India P. Ltd</a>: 1990 (Supp) SCC

</p><p id="p_59">727. It reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">        "Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory injunction is at
        a stage when the existence of the legal right asserted by the
        plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and
        uncertain and remain uncertain till they are established at the
        trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts on certain well
        settled principles of administration of this form of interlocutory
        remedy which is both temporary and discretionary. The object
        of the interlocutory injunction, it is stated:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_72">                ".... is to protect the plaintiff against injury by
                violation of his rights for which he could not

                the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour
                at the trial. The need for such protection must be
                weighed against the corresponding need of the
                defendant to be protected against injury resulting from
                his having been prevented from exercising his own
                legal rights for which he could not be adequately
                compensated. The court must weigh one need against
                another and determine where the „balance of
                convenience lies‟."

<blockquote id="blockquote_73">        The interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo,
        the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie. The

         court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he
        considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be
        prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration
        whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or
        whether he has already been doing so in which latter case
        considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a
        case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are
        attracted."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_60">28.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent submitted

that the principles of grant of injunction were considered by the learned

single Judge. The question of irreparable injury as well as of balance of

convenience were elaborately dealt with by the learned single Judge which

did not call for any interference.
</p>
<p id="p_61">
</p><p id="p_62">29.     We are of the view that while it is true that a larger company cannot

be permitted to run roughshod over a smaller company, who has been in the

market and is the senior user of a mark, at the same time, if the senior user

and smaller company permits the junior user and larger company to grow

rapidly and establish a huge market presence without any action on the part

of the senior user, if an injunction were to be granted at a belated stage, it

would amount to causing irreparable injury to the junior user (larger

company). The balance of convenience, when considered in the light of

delay, would be in favour of the junior user, that is, Intex.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                Page 42 of 48</span>
 V.      The plaintiff's (AZ Tech's) conduct in copying the font and style
        of the logo used by Intex was clearly dishonest and would
        disentitle it to the equitable remedy of injunction.

</p><p id="p_63">30.     The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the conduct of

the respondent was dishonest on several counts. First of all, because of the

fact that the respondent had copied the font and style of the word mark

"AQUA" as used by the appellant. Secondly, the respondent‟s packaging

indicates "AQUA" as a registered trade mark by using the ® symbol, when,

in fact, the mark has not been registered in India. A reference was made to

<a href="/doc/1289320/" id="a_24">Section 107</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 which provides that if somebody

represents an unregistered mark as a registered mark, it would be an offence

punishable with upto three years imprisonment. The purported registration

of the mark "AQUA" in Hong Kong is an entirely different issue and the

same cannot be used in India. Thirdly, the sale invoices submitted by the

respondents were contested by the appellants. According to them, none of

the invoices show sales to a retailer or to individuals. It was pointed out

that many of the sales invoices were generated between 15.01 hrs and 15.04

hrs. However, we do not get into this issue of sale invoices as that is highly

debatable and would have to be established through evidence.                It is

sufficient for us to note that the learned counsel for the appellant has raised

serious concerns about the sale invoices between the period 2009 to 2013


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                Page 43 of 48</span>
 which have been filed by the respondents. A reference was made to Uniply

(supra) and, in particular, to paragraphs 7 and 8 thereof, which we have

already extracted above. It was submitted in that context that the question

of priority and prior user needs to be thrashed out in the trial. There must

not only be prior sales, but the sales must be substantial and continuous.

This, according to the learned counsel for the appellant, has not even been

established prima facie.
</p>
<p id="p_64">
</p><p id="p_65">31.     The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that insofar as the

issue of copying the font and style of logo are concerned, they had adopted

the Typeface Microgramma. However, there is no worthwhile explanation

forthcoming as to why during the pendency of the suit filed by the

respondents with regard to passing off of a product under the word mark

"AQUA", the respondents adopted the same font and style for the logo as

was being used by the appellants. Even before us, no explanation was

forthcoming. This leads us to believe that rather than the appellants, it were

the respondents, who were trying to come as close to the appellant‟s

products as possible so that they may ride on the appellants reputation and

goodwill. Insofar as the use of the ® symbol is concerned, no explanation,

other than stating that it was an honest mistake, has been offered.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">FAO (OS) No.1/2017                                                Page 44 of 48</span>
</p><p id="p_66"> 32.     We have already set out in tabular form the manner in which the font

and style of the appellants logo concerning the word mark "AQUA" was

copied by the respondent. We may point out that the respondent‟s logo at

the time when the suit was instituted, comprised of capital letters. On the

other hand, the appellant‟s logo was in small Caps.          The font of the

appellant‟s logo was also different from that of the respondent‟s logo. But,

during the pendency of the suit, the respondents adopted exactly the same

logo in small caps style and font as that of the appellant‟s. Prima facie, this

would amount to a deliberate act of copying in an attempt to ride on the

reputation and goodwill of the appellant. We may also note that the mark

as registered and used in Hong Kong by the respondent No.2 is as under:-

 blue.     In other words, "AQUA" was written in silver with a blue

background and it was in the same font and style as that of the mark

"AQUA" used by the appellant. Thus, it is apparent that not just the words

and the font style, but all the elements of colour were changed in order to

adopt the appellant‟s logo. So, far from the respondent establishing, even

prima facie, a case of passing off against the appellants, it appears to be the

other way round. Apart from this, the conduct of the respondents in using

the ® symbol and adopting the font and style of the appellant‟s logo has not

been honest, to say the least.

<p id="p_69">Conclusion

</p><p id="p_70">35.     For all these reasons, on all the aspects, which we have discussed

above, we feel that the respondents have neither made out a prima facie

case in their favour nor is the balance of convenience in their favour. In

fact, irreparable injury would be caused to the appellants if an injunction

were to be granted or continued.       And, above all, the conduct of the

respondents has not been honest, to say the least. This by itself disentitles

the respondents from getting an order of injunction in their favour.

Consequently, the impugned judgment is set aside and IA No.17138/2013

 is dismissed. The appeal is allowed as above. The parties shall bear their

own costs.
