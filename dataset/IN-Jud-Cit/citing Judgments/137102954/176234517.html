this High Court. The contention was that the loans had been wrongly
classified as Non Performing Assets (NPA). In the hearing in this Writ
Petition held on 8th April, 2015, learned counsel for the appellants had stated
that the appellants were admitting their liability provided some time was
granted to settle the matter finally. The appellants had pleaded to be afforded
an opportunity to deposit Rs.7 crores i.e. 25% of the notice amount in three
instalments on or before 30th June, 2015. This order refers to personal presence
of the first appellant in the Court and that he was a director and was

was also directed that on complying with the order, the appellants would be
at liberty to move an application seeking relief to the respondent bank for
re-structuring of the amount due, which would be considered reasonably
under the applicable policy of the respondent bank. The Receivers who were

2015 and 30th April, 2015, deferred their action. Possession was not taken.

dated for 6th May, 2015 of Rs.50 lacs each to the respondent bank. As the
payment offered was not in terms of the order dated 8th April 2015 passed
by the Court, the respondent bank had moved CM No. 8353/2015 for
clarification in Writ Petition (C) No. 3406/2015. They were cautious by not
wanting to accept and present the cheques for encashment without
informing the Court, as it could be interpreted and claimed that the terms
and undertaking given by the appellants were modified. This application
was disposed of by the Division Bench on 27th May, 2015 observing that
this tender of four cheques of Rs.50 lacs was not in conformity with the
directions in the order dated 8th April, 2015 and the appellants had
committed default. The said order also records that the respondent bank

<p id="p_30">25.     Aforesaid cheques were not issued by M/s Parul Polymers Private
Limited or the two appellants. The said cheques, as per the appellants, were
issued by their alleged debtors, namely, Remex Enterprises, Nandini
Enterprises and M/s Countrywide Traders. The judgment under challenge
before us, refers to the enquiry conducted by the Serious Fraud Investigation
Office on the order of the learned single Judge dated 7th December, 2015.
As per the report of the Serious Fraud Investigation Office, the three
concerns who had issued these cheques were conduit/shell companies
operating under the control of the first appellant. The impugned judgment
with merit observes that the defence taken by the appellants that they had
handed over cheques given to them by their debtors to honour their
commitments, was a sham, dubious and malevolent act to avoid and defend
contempt proceedings.
</p><p id="p_31">26.     The first issue, which arises for consideration in the present appeal, is
whether the appellants had given an undertaking to the Court to make
payment of Rs.7 crores, which was accepted and acted upon by the Court.
Learned single Judge, in our opinion, has rightly observed that the appellant
Nos. 1 and 2 had not only admitted their liability to pay the outstanding
amount of Rs.28,82,25,942.24 as on 18th August, 2014 but also had
promised and undertaken to the Court to deposit Rs.7 crores on or before

 30th June, 2015. It is only on the said solemn assurance and undertaking to
the Court that the Receivers were restrained from taking further action and
accordingly, the Division Bench had ordered that possession of Shahdara
and Rohini properties would not be disturbed. The undertaking to the Court
was the basis and foundation of the favourable order.
</p><p id="p_32">27.      Statement of the first appellant on oath was recorded. As the second
appellant was not available on the said date, she was asked to file an
affidavit/undertaking confirming the statement of the first appellant, which
was filed by her. The first appellant on oath had agreed to pay/deposit Rs.7
crores on or before 30th June, 2015 to stall and defer the action of taking
over of physical possession. Undertaking given by the second appellant is
also clear. She had affirmed the statement made by her husband and had
given an undertaking to abide by the same. The Court would not have
recorded statement of the first appellant on oath and directed the second
appellant to file an affidavit, if the assurance was merely a statement but not
a solemn promise and undertaking that was given to and accepted by the
Court.
</p><p id="p_33">28.      As elucidated below, there is a difference between right of execution,
which right every decree holder has in case of default of payment, and
contempt of Court proceedings, which arises not because of default and
failure to make payment but is predicated and is a consequence of wilful
disobedience and deliberate non-compliance of assurances and promises
given to the Court in the form of undertaking to procure and obtain orders
and indulgence. When there is wilful disobedience and non-performance of
the undertaking given to the Court, proceedings under the Act, i.e. <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_8">The

 assurance in the form of undertaking to the Court, which he had no intention
to fulfil or knew was a mere pretence and was a false promise, it would
amount to an act of fraudulence practiced on the Court to procure an order
that otherwise would not have been passed.

against the two appellants as directors of M/s Parul Polymers Private
Limited and M/s New Era Trading Private Limited and others. The Central
Bureau of Investigation was required to file status report. The status report
filed on 17th January, 2018 records that M/s Parul Polymers Private Limited
was granted loan/credit facilities of Rs.6 crores by the Central Bank of
India, Rohini Branch in 2011. In 2014, this credit facility was enhanced to
Rs.10 crores and with additional facility in the form of Letter of Credit
(Inland) Rs.10 crores, enhancing it to Rs.20 crores. Demand facility of
Rs.1.18 crores was also extended. There were defaults and failure to pay
the afore-stated loans and as per investigation, the two appellants have
caused wrongful loss to the respondent bank and siphoned away more than
Rs.10.50 crores by diverting the same to one Inderjit Singh, stated to be an
accomplice of the appellants. The funds were also diverted by way of
fictitious sales and purchases. To procure loans/finance, total turnover of
M/s Parul Polymers Private Limited was fictitiously escalated to Rs.570
crores by inter-se (cross/circular) transactions in financial year 2013-14
from Rs.57 crores in the Financial Year 2012-13.                 As per the
records/documents, the appellants had dealings of Rs.285 crores in food

and chemicals undertaken by M/s Parul Polymers Private Limited.
</p><p id="p_35">30.     We would, however, not go by the status report filed by the Central
Bureau of Investigation as charge sheet etc. is yet to be filed and the
allegations made would not be relevant for the present proceedings. Copy
of the report was not furnished to the counsel for the appellants as the
alleged criminal offences are under investigation. In the present case, we
are concerned with the contempt proceedings, which are predicated and
arise from the wilful disobedience of the order dated 8th April, 2015 as well
as wilful failure to comply and abide by the statement on oath/undertaking
given by Suman Chadha and the affidavit-cum-undertaking filed by Komal
Chadha. Therefore, we have completely eschewed the status report for the
present judgment.

we would like to refer to <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_16">Section 2(b)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971,
which reads as under:-

versus Ramesh Narang and Another, (2006) 11 SCC 114 had referred to




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">Contempt Appeal (C) No. 3/2017                                        Page 17 of 41</span>
 the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_17">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, 1952, which did not contain many of the
provisions of the Act, for the Legislature had left formulation of the law of
contempt to the Courts, which had resulted in conflicting views expressed
by different High Courts. Reference was made to the conflicting view
expressed by the Calcutta High Court in Nisha Kanto Roy Chowdhury
versus Smt. Saroj Bashini Goho, AIR 1948 Calcutta 294 and the Bombay
High Court in Bajranglal Gangadhar Khemka and Another versus Messrs.
Kapurchand Limited, AIR 1950 Bombay 336. In the former case, it was
held that a compromise decree passed by the Court containing an
undertaking was nothing more than an agreement of the parties with the
sanction of the Court super-added. The order passed by the Court cannot
mean anything more than an agreement and had no greater sanctity than the
agreement itself. Per contra, the Bombay High Court, in Bajranglal
Gangadhar Khemka and Another (supra) had drawn a distinction between
execution proceedings and proceedings for contempt which arise from
wilful default of an undertaking. The judgment referred to the long standing
practice as per which the expression "undertaking" had come to acquire a
technical and legal meaning and understanding. It was observed that the
expression â€žwhen a party undertakesâ€Ÿ is used to give an undertaking to the
Court as distinct from when a counsel states that he undertakes on behalf of
his client. When a person gives an undertaking to the Court, it is not given
to the other side but to the Court itself, and that being said must carry
sanctity. Therefore, when a Court passes a decree after an undertaking was
embodied in the consent terms, it would show that the Court had sanctioned
the particular course and put its imprimatur on the consent terms. The
Supreme Court agreed with the view expressed in Bajranglal Gangadhar



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">Contempt Appeal (C) No. 3/2017                                 Page 18 of 41</span>
 Khemka and Another (supra) in preference over the view expressed in by
the Calcutta High Court in Nisha Kanto Roy Chowdhury (supra).
Thereafter, reference was made to Sanyal Committee report, which had
preceded framing of the enactment of the Act and thereupon interpreting
<a href="/doc/104592159/" id="a_18">Section 2(b)</a> of the Act the Supreme Court in Rama Narang (supra) had
observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">                "18. <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_19">The Act</a> has been duly widened. It provides inter
                alia for definitions of the terms and lays down firmer
                bases for exercise of the court's jurisdiction in
                contempt. <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_20">Section 2(b)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act,
                1971 defines civil contempt as meaning "wilful
                disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction,
                order, writ or other process of a court or wilful
                breach of an undertaking given to a court".
                (emphasis supplied) Analysed, the definition provides
                for two categories of cases, namely, (1) wilful
                disobedience to a process of court, and (2) wilful
                breach of an undertaking given to a court. As far as
                the first category is concerned, the word "any"
                further indicates the wide nature of the power. No
                distinction is statutorily drawn between an order
                passed after an adjudication and an order passed by
                consent. This first category is separate from the
                second and cannot be treated as forming part of or
                taking colour from the second category. The
                legislative intention clearly was to distinguish
                between the two and create distinct classes of
                contumacious behaviour. Interestingly, the courts in
                England have held that the breach of a consent
                decree of specific performance by refusal to execute
                the agreement is punishable by way of proceedings in
                contempt        (see C.H.       Giles     and      Co.

<p id="p_38"> 32.      It is to be, therefore, clearly understood that <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_22">Section 2(b)</a> of the Act,
which defines civil contempt, consists of two different parts and categories,
namely, (i) wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order,
writ or other process of a court and (ii) wilful breach of an undertaking
given to a Court. The expression "any" used with reference to the first
category indicates the wide nature of power given to the Court and that the
statute does not draw a difference between an order passed after
adjudication or an order passed by consent. The first part or category is
distinct and cannot be treated as a part or taking colour from the second
category.     The Supreme Court consciously observed that the Courts in
England have held that breach of consent decree of performance by refusal
to execute an agreement was punishable by way of contempt proceedings.
With reference to the second part, in Rama Narang (supra) it was observed
that giving of an undertaking is distinct from a consent order recording
compromise. In the latter case of violation of compromise, no question of
contempt arises, but the party can enforce the order of compromise either by
execution or injunction from a Court. However, in the former case, when
there is wilful disobedience, contempt application and proceedings would be
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_39">33.      In Rama Narang (supra), several suits inter se and legal proceedings
between the second wife of the deceased and her step sons were
compromised, with both the parties agreeing that the suits/proceedings be
disposed of in terms of the settlement agreement by minutes of the consent
order.     Consent contained various terms agreed upon by the parties.
Allegations were that the step sons had not complied with the consent terms
consequent to which contempt proceedings were initiated for wilful

 disobedience. In this case, the Supreme Court relied upon first part/category
mentioned in <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_23">Section 2(b)</a>, i.e., wilful violation of any order or decree that
would amount to contempt. It was observed that a consent decree is a
compromise by way of command or a contract and the Bombay High
Courtâ€Ÿs view in Bajranglal Gangadhar Khemka and Another (supra)
correctly holds that a consent decree is a contract with imprimatur of the
Court, which means authorised and approved by the Court. Such decrees
are executable under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_24"> the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, but merely because an
order or decree is executable would not take away the Courtâ€Ÿs jurisdiction to
deal with the matter under the Act, provided the Court is satisfied that the
violation of the order or decree is such that if proved, it would warrant
punishment under <a href="/doc/1478730/" id="a_25">Section 13</a> of the Act on the ground that the contempt
substantially interferes or tends to substantially interfere with the course of
justice. Reference was made to Bank of Baroda versus Sadruddin Hasan
Daya and Another, (2004) 1 SCC 360 wherein the ratio in Bajranglal
Gangadhar Khemka and Another (supra) that violation or breach of an
undertaking, which becomes part of the court decree itself, amounts to
contempt, irrespective of whether it is open to the decree holder to execute
the decree, was upheld. This, it was observed was the law and it cannot be

decree passed in a civil suit, the remedy available to an aggrieved person in

 provides for elaborate proceedings in which the parties can adduce
evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses. Proceedings under the Act
are discretionary and, therefore, when the matter relates to infringement of a
decree or decretal order that embodies rights, it may not be expedient to
invoke and exercise contempt jurisdiction. The Supreme Court had referred
to civil contempt as defined in <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_27">Section 2(b)</a> of the Act to mean wilful breach
of an undertaking as distinct from criminal contempt. In civil contempt,
disobedience of a civil action is a matter involving private rights of a party,
albeit contempt jurisdiction is exercised when administration of justice is
undermined if the order of the competent court is permitted to be
disregarded with impunity.       Criminal contempt, on the other hand, is
predicated on public interest. In cases of civil contempt where the civil
contempt jurisdiction is invoked, there should be violation of judgment,
decree, direction or order and such disobedience should be wilful and
intentional. In cases of execution, an executing court may not be bothered
whether the disobedience was wilful or not, as the Court was bound to
execute the decree irrespective of the consequences.             In contempt
proceedings, however, the Court may not direct execution if the
disobedience has been under compelling circumstances and in that situation,
no punishment need be awarded.         In the said case, criminal contempt
proceedings were quashed. Kanwar Singh Saini (supra), makes reference
to Daroga Singh versus B.K. Pandey, (2004) 5 SCC 26 and other

 purposely without reference to bona fides, deliberately, intentionally with
evil intention, wantonly and causelessly. The Supreme Court in Niaz
Mohammad and Others versus State of Haryana and Others, (1994) 6
SCC 332 explaining the expression â€žwilful disobedienceâ€Ÿ had held:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">                "9. <a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_32">Section 2(b)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971
                (hereinafter referred to as â€žthe Actâ€Ÿ) defines "civil
                contempt" to mean "wilful disobedience to any
                judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other
                process of a court ...". Where the contempt consists
                in failure to comply with or carry out an order of a
                court made in favour of a party, it is a civil contempt.
                The person or persons in whose favour such order or
                direction has been made can move the court for
                initiating proceeding for contempt against the alleged
                contemner, with a view to enforce the right flowing
                from the order or direction in question. But such a
                proceeding is not like an execution proceeding under
                Code of Civil Procedure. The party in whose favour
                an order has been passed, is entitled to the benefit of
                such order. The court while considering the issue as
                to whether the alleged contemner should be punished
                for not having complied with and carried out the
                direction of the court, has to take into consideration
                all facts and circumstances of a particular case. That
                is why the framers of the Act while defining civil
                contempt, have said that it must be wilful
                disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction,
                order, writ or other process of a court. Before a
                contemner is punished for non-compliance of the
                direction of a court, the court must not only be
                satisfied about the disobedience of any judgment,
                decree, direction or writ but should also be satisfied
                that such disobedience was wilful and intentional.
                The civil court while executing a decree against the
                judgment-debtor is not concerned and bothered
                whether the disobedience to any judgment, or decree,

                 was wilful. Once a decree has been passed it is the
                duty of the court to execute the decree whatever may
                be consequence thereof. But while examining the
                grievance of the person who has invoked the
                jurisdiction of the court to initiate the proceeding for
                contempt for disobedience of its order, before any
                such contemner is held guilty and punished, the court
                has to record a finding that such disobedience was
                wilful and intentional. If from the circumstances of a
                particular case, brought to the notice of the court, the
                court is satisfied that although there has been a
                disobedience but such disobedience is the result of
                some compelling circumstances under which it was
                not possible for the contemner to comply with the
                order, the court may not punish the alleged
                contemner."

(2003) 11 SCC 1, the expression â€žwilful disobedienceâ€Ÿ in the context of
<a href="/doc/654554/" id="a_33">Section 2(b)</a> of the Act was read to mean an act or omission done
voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something, which
the law forbids or with the specific intention to fail to do something which
the law requires to be done. Wilfulness signifies deliberate action done with
evil intent and bad motive and purpose. It should not be an act, which
requires and is dependent upon, either wholly or partly, any act or omission
by a third party for compliance.

                element and hence, requires looking into the mind of
                a person/contemnor by gauging his actions, which is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">Contempt Appeal (C) No. 3/2017                                      Page 25 of 41</span>
                 an indication of one's state of mind. "Wilful" means
                knowingly intentional, conscious, calculated and
                deliberate with full knowledge of consequences
                flowing therefrom. It excludes casual, accidental,
                bona fide or unintentional acts or genuine inability.
                Wilful acts does not encompass involuntarily or
                negligent actions. The act has to be done with a "bad
                purpose or without justifiable excuse or stubbornly,
                obstinately or perversely". Wilful act is to be
                distinguished from an act done carelessly,
                thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently. It does not
                include any act done negligently or involuntarily. The
                deliberate conduct of a person means that he knows
                what he is doing and intends to do the same.
                Therefore, there has to be a calculated action with
                evil motive on his part. Even if there is a
                disobedience of an order, but such disobedience is
                the result of some compelling circumstances under
                which it was not possible for the contemnor to comply
                with the order, the contemnor cannot be punished.

        Court, observed as under: (AIR p. 337, para 4)
               "4. We are not prepared to accept a position which
           seems to us contrary to the long practice that has been
           established in this Court, and, apparently, also in
           England. There is no reason why even in a consent
           decree a party may not give an undertaking to the court.
           Although the court may be bound to record a
           compromise, still, when the court passes a decree, it puts
           its imprimatur upon those terms and makes the terms a
           rule of the court; and it would be open to the court,
           before it did so, to accept an undertaking given by a
           party to the court. Therefore, there is nothing contrary to
           any provision of the law whereby an undertaking cannot
           be given by a party to the court in the consent decree,
           which undertaking can be enforced by proper committal

         vacant possession of certain premises. The Supreme Court
        held the tenant guilty of contempt. Hon'ble V. Ramaswami,
        J., delivering the judgment observed: (SCC pp. 265-66,
        para 11)
               "11. When a court accepts an undertaking given by
            one of the parties and passes orders based on such
            undertaking, the order amounts in substance to an
            injunction restraining that party from acting in breach
            thereof. The breach of an undertaking given to the court
            by or on behalf of a party to a civil proceedings is,
            therefore, regarded as tantamount to a breach of
            injunction although the remedies were not always
            identical. For the purpose of enforcing an undertaking
            that undertaking is treated as an order so that an
            undertaking, if broken, would involve the same
            consequences on the persons breaking that undertaking
            as would their disobedience to an order for an
            injunction. It is settled law that breach of an injunction
            or breach of an undertaking given to a court by a person
            in a civil proceeding on the faith of which the court
            sanctions a particular course of action is misconduct
            amounting to contempt."

           terms of that assurance to be incorporated as his own
           undertaking to this Court and allowed an order to be

<p id="p_49">         The aforesaid passage refers to the benefit which a party derives by
making and giving an undertaking to the Court, which is a relevant factor
while deciding and examining question of contempt jurisdiction under the
second category. In this context, we would like to reproduce observations
of the Supreme Court in Rosnan Sam Boyce versus B.R. Cotton Mills
Limited and Others, (1990) 2 SCC 636 wherein an undertaking was given
to the Court knowing that it would not be complied with and it was held as
under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">                "7. ....... We have no doubt at all that it was
                respondent 2 who, along with some of his family
                members, was in full charge of the affairs of
                respondent 1-company. In these circumstances, it
                appears clear to us that all the actions taken by the
                legal advisors and counsel of respondent 1 including,
                in particular, the giving of the aforesaid undertaking
                as well as the clarification given by learned counsel
                regarding the meaning of that undertaking as
                aforestated were with the fullest knowledge and
                consent of respondent 2. It is impossible to maintain
                this dichotomy, for the purposes of the contempt
                petition, between respondent 1 and respondent 2.
                Respondent 2 knew fully well when he authorised the
                giving of the undertaking on behalf of respondent 1
                or consented to its being given that respondent 1 was
                in no position to hand over possession of the suit
                premises in execution of the decree because
                respondent 2 claimed to be in possession of the said
                premises and claimed sub-tenancy rights in the same
                and had no intention whatsoever of giving up the
                claim. In fact, the entire course of conduct adopted
                on behalf of respondent 1 was only with one aim in
                view and that was to frustrate or to at least delay
                indefinitely the execution of the decree which the
                appellant had obtained after the lapse of many years



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">Contempt Appeal (C) No. 3/2017                                    Page 34 of 41</span>
                 and after such sustained and lengthy legal
                proceedings which must have caused the appellant
                considerable expenses and anguish. It is significant
                that till Mr R.J. Joshi, the learned counsel, who gave
                the clarification in respect of the said undertaking
                was alive, no contention was ever raised that the said
                clarification was given by him without taking
                instructions or that respondent 1 or respondent 2
                were not aware of the same. It was only after the
                sudden demise of the learned counsel that this
                contention was first raised by respondent 1. This
                conduct speaks volumes for the dishonest attitude
                adopted by respondents 1 and 2. Raising this
                contention after the death of Mr R.J. Joshi can only
                be regarded as one more of the tricks which
                respondents 1 and 2 have played throughout the case
                in order to defeat and delay the execution of the
                decree for possession against respondent 1."
</blockquote><p id="p_50">40.     In the context of the present case we find that the appellants had taken
benefit and advantage of the "undertaking" made by them before the Court
to secure and obtain the order dated 8th April, 2015. The said order is
completely predicated and premised on the promise made by Suman
Chadha, appellant No. 1, and the affidavit and the undertaking given by
Komal Chadha, appellant No. 2, with regard to payment of Rs.7 crores
within the time limit stated and agreed. It was a promise made to the court.
The undertaking and promise had the effect of the Court interfering and
granting stay and restraining the Receiver from taking physical possession
of the properties. The grant of stay resulted in delay of enforcement of the
action by the Receiver appointed to take possession. Thus the appellants had
taken advantage and benefit of the stay order, based upon their undertaking
given to the Court. They would be liable for wilful default under the second
category i.e., wilful disobedience of their undertaking.

<p id="p_51"> 41.     Facts of the case, as exposited above, indicate that the conduct of the
appellants was wilful and mala fide from the very beginning i.e., on the date
when promise and assurance on oath was held out and given to the court on
8th April, 2015. The appellants knew right from the start that they would not
be able to pay the Rs.7 crores. It is not the case wherein the appellants
could have possibly arranged for the said funds. In fact, their conduct in
getting cheques issued from third parties, which was dubious, has
aggravated their malicious and mala fide conduct.
</p><p id="p_52">42.     In Rita Markandey versus Surjit Singh Arora, (1996) 6 SCC 14, it
was observed that even if parties have not filed an undertaking before the
court but if the court was induced to sanction a particular course of action or
inaction on the representation made by a party and the court ultimately finds
that the party never intended to act on the said representation or such
representation was false, the party would be guilty of committing contempt.
It was observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">                "12. Law is well settled that if any party gives an
                undertaking to the court to vacate the premises from
                which he is liable to be evicted under the orders of
                the court and there is a clear and deliberate breach
                thereof it amounts to civil contempt but since, in the
                present case, the respondent did not file any
                undertaking as envisaged in the order of this Court
                the question of his being punished for breach
                thereof does not arise. However, in our considered
                view even in a case where no such undertaking is
                given, a party to a litigation may be held liable for
                such contempt if the court is induced to sanction a
                particular course of action or inaction on the basis
                of the representation of such a party and the court
                ultimately finds that the party never intended to act
                on such representation or such representation was

                 false. In other words, if on the representation of the
                respondent herein the Court was persuaded to pass
                the order dated 5-10-1995 extending the time for
                vacation of the suit premises, he may be held guilty
                of contempt of court, notwithstanding non-
                furnishing of the undertaking, if it is found that the
                representation was false and the respondent never
                intended to act upon it. However, the respondent
                herein cannot be held liable for contempt on this
                score also for the order in question clearly indicates
                that it was passed on the basis of the agreement
                between the parties and not on the representation of
                the respondent made before the Court. It was the
                petitioner who agreed to the unconditional
                extension of time by four weeks for the respondent
                to vacate and subsequent extension of time on his
                giving an undertaking and this Court only embodied
                the terms of the agreement so arrived at, in the
                order. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the
                respondent cannot in any way be held liable for
                contempt for alleged breach of the above order. As
                regards the contention of the petitioner that by
                trespassing into some other portion of the house in
                question during the pendency of the appeal the
                respondent has committed contempt of court, we are
                unable to accept the same; firstly because, the
                respondent's claim is that he has been in occupation
                thereof since long and this contentious issue cannot
                be decided solely on the basis of affidavits and
                secondly because the above issue does not fall
                within the limited scope of our enquiry in this
                proceeding which centres round the order dated 5-
                10-1994."</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">        A similar view has been expressed in Bank of Baroda,(supra)
wherein it was held that the parties since inception had no real intention to
pay the amount but had agreed to the settlement and consent terms only for
the purpose of gaining time whereunder instalments were fixed, this would



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">Contempt Appeal (C) No. 3/2017                                      Page 37 of 41</span>
 still come under the purview of contempt as the party had intentionally and
deliberately adopted a course of action so as to create further hurdles and
obstruction, clearly being a case of wilful breach.
</p>
<p id="p_54">43.     The decision in Rita Markandey (supra) would be squarely
applicable to the facts of the present case, even if we were to assume that
the appellants had not given any "undertaking" to the court.                The
observations made in the said case are significant and refer to another facet
when contempt jurisdiction can be invoked, different and distinct from cases
where parties have given undertaking to the court and have thereafter
wilfully refused to abide and comply with the same. However, we must
caution that where a party has given a statement and made a promise and
representation to the court with the intent and purpose to comply with the
same but due to subsequent events and for bona fide reasons compliance
could not be made, it would not be a case of wilful disobedience. In such
cases, the party aggrieved must ask for execution of the decree or
implementation of the order and the court would not exercise its discretion
in the contempt jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_55">44.     Facts of the case, as noticed by the learned single Judge, are glaring
and disclose the cavalier attitude, scorn and abuse of the process of the
Court by the appellants, not on one occasion but on several occasions, and
demonstrate the intent of the appellants to deceive and procure interim
orders by giving undertaking and making promises on solemn assurance to
the Court, notwithstanding the true intent and knowledge that the
undertaking to the Court would not be complied with.
</p><p id="p_56">45.     It is stated and observed in several cases that the contempt is between
the Court and the contemnor and the aggrieved party cannot insist that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">Contempt Appeal (C) No. 3/2017                                   Page 38 of 41</span>
 Court should exercise such jurisdiction. The discretion is exercised by the
Court for maintenance of Courtâ€Ÿs dignity and majesty of law. However, it
would not be entirely correct to state that punishment under the contempt
jurisdiction is granted to uphold the dignity of the Court.          Contempt
jurisdiction is invoked and punishment is imposed to uphold the authority of
Court to punish the contemnor and to act as a deterrent to others. This
deterrent is motivated in the interest of the public in order to prevent future
incidents of wilful disregard and disobedience of the Court orders by a
party. Further, contempt jurisdiction may even invoke belated compliance,
which is in public interest and when such compliance is made, the
contemnor may seek reduction or discharge of the sentence in view of
subsequent conduct to purge the contempt by complying with the order.
Contempt jurisdiction is invoked when breaches are of the highest level of
culpability in the sense that they are wilful. Further, persistence and
continuous damage and disobedience could in a given case reflect no
remorse from the person against whom action is taken.

pass an order for imprisonment, the principle being that if at all possible,
sentence of imprisonment should not be imposed and that any term should
be as short as possible. This is the basic precept behind the sentencing
policy in contempt. In the context of the present case, however, the intent of
the appellants from the beginning itself, when the representation and
statement/undertaking was given and recorded by the Court in Writ Petition
(C) No. 3406/2015, was fraudulent and dishonest. This is a case wherein
the wilfulness and dishonesty was at the initial and crucial time when the
promise and representation was made to the Court that the two appellants

 would ensure payment of Rs.7 crores.         This is not a case where the
representation was made honestly but subsequently the appellants could not
keep their promise, in which case possibly in the absence of deliberate or
wilful disobedience no case for contempt would be made out. In this case, it
is necessary for the court to step in and invoke contempt jurisdiction as the
appellants had deliberately and intentionally made promises in form of
undertaking to the court which they never intended to comply. Devious
promises which the party knows would not be complied with, would
constitute misrepresentation of wilful nature as they become the ground and
reason to induce the court to grant indulgence and favour by passing an
order of action or inaction. These should not be made with the intent to
obstruct the action being taken in accordance with law. Mala fide
representations in the nature of an undertaking have to be checked as they
make a mockery of the Court order, and lest the Courts start disbelieving
and stop giving due credence to honest and bona fide representations.
Contempt jurisdiction is not only concerned with the contemnor, but is also
concerned with the effectiveness and the piousness attached to the
undertakings and Court orders. Representation to the Court in the form of
undertakings even when a promise to make payment etc., should not be
made in platitude as if the undertaking is inconsequential, for on
disobedience and failure the Court would be helpless and the aggrieved
party has no remedy for violation of the undertaking. The representations
and promises made before the Court should have sanctity and should be
made with the intent and purpose to honour the commitment made and not
with the objective of procuring an order of indulgence on that particular date
though compliance of the promise was never intended. The latter would be

 inexcusable and defeat the very purpose of making such commitment and
undertaking to the Court.

present appeal. We uphold the decision of the learned Single Judge, holding
the appellants guilty of Contempt of Courts. We find no reason to interfere
and uphold the sentence imposed on the appellants. As the appellants are on
interim bail, they would surrender within a period of 10 days from the date
of pronouncement of this order. In case of failure to surrender, the bail
bonds would be forfeited and warrants of arrest would be issued and
executed. In the facts of the case, there would be no order as to costs.
