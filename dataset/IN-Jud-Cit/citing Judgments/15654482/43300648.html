</p><p id="p_26">(xv) It is the case of the plaintiff against the defendants that the
       defendants      are     engaged      in       the    business          of
       manufacturing/marketing/selling      inter    alia   pharmaceutical
       products under the mark BECTODINE.
</p><p id="p_27">(xvi) In or about May 2013, the plaintiff, for the first time, became
       aware of the defendant No.1 when the plaintiff noticed an
       advertisement appearing in Trade Marks Journal No.1584 dated
       15th April, 2013 on page 140 for registration of the mark
       BECTODINE-M (word per se) under application No.1803770 in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS) No.3507/2014                                           Page 10 of 51</span>
        Class 05. The plaintiff immediately took appropriate steps and
       filed an opposition, numbered as 802564 dated 23rd May 2013,
       within the prescribed time. The opposition proceeding inter se is
       currently pending before the Trade Marks Registry.
(xvii) On or about 16th June, 2014, the plaintiff was served with
       evidence in support of application No.1803770 by way of an
       affidavit in the said opposition proceeding. The affidavit of
       Mr.Lekh        Narayan    Karna    dated    11th    June,    2014     and     the
       documents filed therewith by the defendant No.1 claims use of
       the    mark      BECTODINE/BECTODINE-M               and     other     variants
       throughout most of India including Delhi. It further appears from
       paragraph        5   of   the    said   affidavit   that    defendant        No.4
       manufactures products under the mark BECTODINE on behalf of
       the defendant No.1. Meanwhile, recently in the first week of
       November 2014, the plaintiff also came across the products of
       the defendant No.1 in the market which indicates that these
       were     manufactured       by    defendant     No.3.      The   plaintiff    has
       approached this Court immediately upon identifying the products
       of the defendants in the market. It is apparent from a bare
       perusal of the defendants' products obtained from the market
       that they have not only adopted a deceptively similar mark
       BECTODINE for identical products but have also adopted an
       identical get up, lay out and colour scheme as used by the
       plaintiff. Furthermore, the arrangement of features printed on
       packaging of the defendants' product is similar to that of the
       plaintiff's products.
</p><p id="p_28">(xviii) The plaintiff had also noticed that the defendant No.1 on its
       website www.galpha.com claims to be marketing ointments,

        gargle     and   solutions   of   Povidone-Iodine   under     the    mark
       BECTODINE. The photographs of the defendants' products from
       its website are reproduced herein below:

<p id="p_29">4.     It is submitted by the plaintiff that the mark BECTODINE used by
the defendants is deceptively similar to the well-known trademark
BETADINE of the plaintiff. It is pertinent to mention that the words
BETADINE (the trademark of the plaintiff) and BECTODINE (the mark
of the defendants) are and would be pronounced in the same/similar
manner. The competing marks are deceptively similar and are not
distinguishable to a person with imperfect recollection, not having the

 benefit of side-by-side comparison. The defendants' conduct in
adopting the mark BECTODINE, being deceptively similar to the
plaintiff's trademark BETADINE, is fraught with dishonesty and
malafide intent. It is submitted that the product of the defendants
under the mark BECTODINE is bound to cause deception and confusion
in the normal course of business amongst the members of the trade
and public at large. The adoption of the impugned mark is intended
solely to ride piggyback on the enviable reputation and goodwill
created by the plaintiff in its trademark BETADINE.

confusion amongst the people in the trade and the public at large by

<p id="p_32">WRITTEN STATEMENT

</p><p id="p_33">7.     The following defences are raised in the written statement:
</p>
<p id="p_34">(I)    In early 2006, the defendant No.1 had honestly, independently
       coined, conceived and adopted the mark BECTODINE-M for use
       in respect of its medicinal and/or pharmaceutical preparation
       containing     the   molecule   Povidone-Iodine.   The     product
       BECTODINE is an Anti-Bacterial preparation. Thus, the said mark
       was coined by taking prefix "BECT" from BECTERIA and suffix
       "ODINE" from the generic name/molecule "IODINE" to make out
       pronounceable word.
</p>
<p id="p_35">(II)   The defendants have coined and invented the mark as stated
       above in a bonafide and honest manner. There are more than
       700 trademarks registered or pending with the common suffix
       "DINE" available on the Register of the Trademarks. The said
       suffix "DINE" is a publici juris word/ expression which is common
       to the pharmaceutical trade. Specimen/ colour copies of some

        products in the market with the expression DINE have been
       placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_36">(III) The defendant No.1's products under the trademark BECTODINE
       have been manufactured under valid drug license since the year
       2006. Currently, defendant No.4, M/s. Innova Captab under the
       supervision      and   quality   control   of   the   defendant        No.1
       manufacturing the products of the defendant No.1 bearing the
       mark BECTODINE.
</p>
<p id="p_37">(IV) The defendant No.1 launched their product in March, 2006 and
       since then the said mark BECTODINE-M is in extensive use
       throughout most of India. The defendant No.1 is the only entity
       who is using the trademark BECTODINE as on date. The year

<p id="p_39"> (V)    The defendant No.1 made the trademark application No.
       1803770 in class 5 dated 8th April, 2009 claiming use since 31st
       March, 2006 with a view to obtain statutory protection for mark
       BECTODINE. The trademark was published and under opposition
       filed by the plaintiff. The defendant No.1's products under the
       trademark BECTODINE are marketed in labels and packages
       which are distinctive of the defendant No.1's products and
       business. The defendant No.1 does not claim any exclusive
       rights over the use of the Navy Blue, Sky Blue, Green as well as
       White Colour background of packaging which is common to
       trade.
</p><p id="p_40">(VI) It is stated in the written statement that the malafide conduct of
       the plaintiff is evident from the fact that the notice of oppositions
       filed by the plaintiff against third party are pending since the
       year 2011 and another opposition pending between the parties
       since the year 2013 but the plaintiff had no complaint about the
       actual use of the mark BECTODINE by defendant No.1. However,
       in June, 2014, the defendant No.1 produced its compressive
       evidence before the Trademark Registry which indicates the
       enviable goodwill and reputation of the mark BECTODINE and
       the plaintiff by withholding the material information despite the
       knowledge about the defendants' trademark, filed the present
       action just to stop the legal use of the mark BECTODINE by the
       defendants.
</p><p id="p_41">REPLICATION
</p><p id="p_42">8.     In the replication filed by plaintiff to the written statement filed
by defendants, the plaintiff has denied all the pleas raised by the
defendants      in    the   written   statement.   It   is   stated   that    the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS) No.3507/2014                                               Page 16 of 51</span>
 predecessors-in-title of the plaintiff applied for registration of the
trademark BETADINE in India under registration No.203023 in class 05
on 13th June, 1961 and registration No.425874 in class 05 dated 17th
August, 1984 claiming use of the trademark BETADINE in India since
the year 1979. These registrations were assigned in favour of the
plaintiff vide Deed of Assignment dated 1st September, 1990. The
plaintiff launched its range of products, Povidone-iodine combination,
under the trade mark BETADINE in the year 1990. Admittedly, the
defendant is involved in the same trade, inter alia, manufacturing and
marketing       of    Povidone-iodine   combination   under    the     mark
BECTODINE. It is the defendants' case that the mark BECTODINE was
allegedly adopted in the year 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_43">9.     It is submitted that the defendant No.1 has with malafide and
dishonest intention falsely applied for registration of the mark
BECTODINE in class 05 under application No.1803770 dated 8th April,
2009, claiming use since 31st March, 2006. A simple search on the
records of the Trade Marks Registry and/or in the market would have
revealed the presence of the plaintiff and its popular and well-known
trademark BETADINE.
</p>
<p id="p_44">10.    The defendant No.1 has made false and misleading statements.
The defendant No.1 has stated the following in paragraph 10 of the
preliminary submissions - "The defendant No.1 is the only entity who
is using the trademark BECTODINE as on date...." It is submitted that
another entity being Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited has applied for
registration of the mark BECTODINE under application No.1389240 in
class 05 dated 3rd October, 2005. The plaintiff has filed an opposition
under No.784326 dated 15th November, 2011 against registration of
the said application. Contrary to the defendant No.1's submissions, it


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) No.3507/2014                                           Page 17 of 51</span>
 appears that the defendant No.1 was well aware of the adoption of the
mark BECTODINE by Ranbaxy Laboratories at time of filing of the
written statement since      the   defendant No.1    has opposed this
application, being opposition No.783481 dated 10th October, 2011,
evident from the online records of the Trade Marks Registry. The
oppositions filed by both the plaintiff and the defendant No.1 are
pending adjudication before the Registrar of Trade Marks. It is pointed
out that Ranbaxy's date of application is prior to the alleged date of
use claimed by the defendant No.1. It is, thus, evident that the
defendant No.1 has approached this Court with unclean hands.
</p>
<p id="p_45">11.    It is submitted that it cannot be said that there was any delay in
bringing about the present suit. The plaintiff first became aware of its
dishonest adoption of the impugned mark in May 2013, when the
defendant No.1's application was advertised in the Trade Marks
Journal for opposition.   The defendant filed a counter statement in
support of its application No.1803770. In the counter statement, the
defendant's mark was throughout indicated to be 'BACTODINE-M' and
not 'BECTODINE'. In the order dated 19th November, 2014, this Court
had rightly held that: "As far as the question of delay is concerned, in
the trademark matters, it is a recurring cause of action where every
sale gives fresh cause of action in favour of the plaintiff and against
the party who is infringing the registered trademark of the plaintiff In
fact, the delay is not fatal in an action for infringement..." It is
submitted that the grant of injunction in the present matter is
necessary since the adoption of the mark BECTODINE/BECTODINE-M
by defendant No.1 is dishonest and the use of the same would cause
confusion and/or deception amongst the members of the trade and
consumer at large.

PTC (19) (DB) 160, the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court was
considering the case of Ocuflox.     The word 'Ocu' was derived from
Ocular and 'Flox' from Ciprofloxacin. Though the above said judgment
was passed prior to Cadila (supra), the Court on the basis of trans-
border reputation and keeping in view the interest of the public,
injuncted the use of Ocuflox. In para 36, the Court held as under :

that the defendant claims to coin the word from Ocular and
Ciprofloxacin. In para 7, the Cadila (supra) judgment was discussed
and the Court held that exacting judicial scrutiny is required when a

<p id="p_50"> 15.    The Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1335881/" id="a_5">Heinz Italia v. Dabur India
Ltd</a>. 2007 (35) PTC 1 (SC) dealt with the two trademarks , Glucose-D
and Glucon-D, both products containing Glucose power. The learned
Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court held that word
Glucose being generic of the contents, no monopoly can be granted
and thus, refused to grant the injunction in this case. The Supreme
Court reiterated the judgment of Cadila Healthcare (supra) while
granting the injunction and it was held that both Glucon-D and
Glucose-D are items containing glucose which are phonetically so
similar that it can easily confuse a purchaser and small changes in the
packaging is merely an attempt to continue to mislead the purchasers
and to make it more difficult for the owner to protect their mark.

<p id="p_51">Legal Effect of Registration

</p><p id="p_52">16.    On registration of a trademark the registered proprietor under
<a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_6">Section 28</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1940 gets the exclusive right to the
use of such trademarks in relation to the goods in respect of which the
trademark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of any
infringement of such trademark. The action for infringement is a
statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered
trademark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the
trade mark in relation to those goods. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_7">Kaviraj
Pandit     Durga      Dutt   Sharma   v.   Navaratna   Pharmaceutical

<p id="p_53">17.    It is settled law that where the defendant's mark contains the
essential feature of the plaintiff's mark combined with other matter,
the correct approach for the Court is to identify an essential feature

 depending particularly "on the Court's own judgment and burden of
the evidence that is placed before the Court". In order to come to the
conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the
broad and essential features of the two marks are to be considered.
They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are
differences, rather overall similarity has to be judged.   While judging
the question as to whether the defendant has infringed the trademark
or not, the Court has to consider the overall impression of the mark in
the minds of general public and not by merely comparing the
dissimilarities in the two marks.
</p>
<p id="p_54">Essential Features

</p><p id="p_55">18.    The Courts have propounded the doctrine of prominent and
essential feature of the trademark for the purposes of adjudication of
the disputes relating to infringement of trademark. While deciding the
question of infringement, the Court has to see the prominent or the
dominant feature of the trademark. All composite marks are to be
compared as whole. However, it is dependent on case to case to basis
as a matter of jury question as to what can be the possible broad and
essential feature of the trade mark in question.

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       "In an action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no
       doubt, make out that the use of the defendant's mark is
       likely to deceive, but where the similarity between the
       plaintiff's and the defendant's mark is so close either
       visually, phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches
       the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further
       evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff's rights
       are violated. Expressed in another way, if the essential
       features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been

        adopted     by the defendant, the fact that the get-up,
       packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the
       packets in which he offers his goods for sale show
       marked differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin
       different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark

<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is
       claimed to infringe the plaintiff's mark is shown to be "in
       the course of trade", the question whether there has been
       an infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two
       marks. Where the two marks are identical no further
       questions arise; for then the infringement is made out...."

<p id="p_57">Likelihood of Confusion and Deception

</p><p id="p_58">20.    In the decision reported as James Chadwick &amp; Bros. <a href="/doc/486032/" id="a_9">Ltd. v.
The National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd</a>. AIR 1951 Bombay 147
M.C.Chagla, C.J. and Bhagwati, J., referring to the words "likely to
deceive or cause confusion" in <a href="/doc/631993/" id="a_10">Section 10</a> of the Trade Marks Act,
1940, held that:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "Now in deciding whether a particular trade mark is likely
       to deceive or cause confusion, it is not sufficient merely to
       compare it with the trade mark which is already registered
       and whose proprietor is offering opposition to the
       registration of the former trade mark. What is important is
       to find out what is the distinguishing or essential feature of
       the trade mark already registered and what is the main
       feature or the main idea underlying that trade mark, and if
       it is found that the trade mark whose registration is sought
       contains the same distinguishing or essential feature or
       conveys the same idea, then ordinarily the Registrar would
       be right if he came to the conclusion that the trade mark
       should not be registered. The real question is as to how a
       purchaser, who must be looked upon as an average man of
       ordinary intelligence, would react to a particular trade
       mark, what association he would form by looking at the
       trade mark, and in what respect he would connect the
       trade mark with the goods which he would be purchasing.
       It is impossible to accept that a man looking at a trade

        mark would take in every single feature of the trade mark.
       The question would be, what would he normally retain in
       his mind after looking at the trade mark? What would be
       the salient feature of the trade mark which in future would
       lead him to associate the particular goods with that trade
       mark?"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_59">21.    It is not the right practice of a meticulous comparison of two
marks, letter by letter and syllable by syllable. It is the person who
only knows the one mark and has perhaps an impression, or imperfect
recollection of it, who is likely to be deceived or confused.       In fact it
depends on first impression of a person.          In case he is aware or
familiar with both rival marks of the parties he will neither be deceived
or confused.
</p>
<p id="p_60">22.    The degree of similarity between the two rival marks which
depends upon the first impression- whether visual or phonetic and in
case, the Court finds that there is a risk of confusion which is the
matter of public interest, the same should should not be authorised.
The question is merely the dispute of inter se between the parties
but it is    matter of right by the registered proprietor who got           the
exclusive     rights to protect   the same, otherwise, many competing
marks       would be      available in the market in due course and
uncertainty might happen in case the         infringer is   allowed to use
similar mark.
</p>
<p id="p_61">Validity of Registered Trade Mark

</p><p id="p_62">23.    It is well settled that if the party is holding the valid registration
and two rival marks are either identical with or deceptively similar in
relation to the goods in which the trademark is registered, a case of
infringement is made out. The Supreme Court in various cases has
dealt with this aspect.

         rather than breaking the marks up into their component parts
         for comparison. This is the "anti-dissection" rule. The
         rationale for the rule is that the commercial impression of a
         composite trademark on an ordinary prospective buyer is

        created by the mark as a whole, not by its component parts.
       However, it is not a violation of the anti-dissection rule to
       view the component parts of conflicting composite marks as a
       preliminary step on the way to an ultimate determination of
       probable customer reaction to the conflicting composites as a
       whole. Thus, conflicting marks must be compared in their
       entireties. A mark should not be dissected or split up into its
       component parts and each part then compared with
       corresponding parts of the conflicting mark to determine the
       likelihood of confusion. It is the impression that the mark as a
       whole creates on the average reasonably prudent buyer and
       not the parts thereof, that is important. As the Supreme
       Court observed: "The commercial impression of a trademark
       is derived from it as a whole, not from its elements separated
       and considered in detail. For this reason it should be
       considered in its entirety."

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       The anti-dissection rule is based upon a common sense
       observation of customer behavior: the typical shopper does
       not retain all of the individual details of a composite mark in
       his or her mind, but retains only an overall, general
       impression created by the composite as a whole. It is the
       overall impression created by the mark from the ordinary
       shopper's cursory observation in the marketplace that will or
       will not lead to a likelihood of confusion, not the impression
       created from a meticulous comparison as expressed in
       carefully weighed analysis in legal briefs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">       In litigation over the alleged similarity of marks, the owner
       will emphasize the similarities and the alleged infringer will
       emphasize the differences. The point is that the two marks
       should not be examined with a microscope to find the
       differences, for this is not the way the average purchaser
       views the marks. To the average buyer, the points of
       similarity are more important that minor points of difference.
       A court should not engage in "technical gymnastics" in an
       attempt to find some minor differences between conflicting
       marks. However, where there are both similarities and
       differences in the marks, there must be weighed against one
       another to see which predominate.

<blockquote id="blockquote_20">        The rationale of the anti-dissection rule is based upon this
       assumption: "An average purchaser does not retain all the
       details of a mark, but rather the mental impression of the
       mark creates in its totality. It has been held to be a violation
       of the anti-dissection rule to focus upon the "prominent"
       feature of a mark and decide likely confusion solely upon that
       feature, ignoring all other elements of the mark. Similarly, it
       is improper to find that one portion of a composite mark has
       no trademark significance, leading to a direct comparison
       between only that which remains."

Biotech (P) Ltd. v. Orchid Chemicals &amp; Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.,

rule as well as the test of deceptively similarity have been dealt with in
great detail.         The Division Bench has also laid down the rules of
comparison in para 32 of the judgment. Two rival trade marks in the
matter decided by the Division Bench were ORZID and FORZID and it
was held that two trademarks are visually and phonetically similar and
would cause deception in the minds of the consumer in relation to
medicine. The relevant paras of this judgment reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">            In such case, the central issue is as to whether the
           Defendant's activities or proposed activities amount to
           a misrepresentation which is likely to injure the
           business or goodwill of the plaintiff and cause damage
           to his business or goodwill. To extend this use to
           answer this, focus has to be on the aspect as to
           whether the defendant is making some representation
           in course of trade to prospective customers which is
           calculated to injure the business or goodwill of the
           plaintiff thereby causing damage to him.         In the
           process, difference between the confusion and
           deception is to be understood. This difference was
           explained by Lord Denning in "Difference: Confusion &amp;
           Deception" in the following words:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">                "Looking to the natural meaning of the words, I
                would make two observations: first, the offending
                mark must 'so nearly resemble' the registered
                mark as to be 'likely' to deceive or cause
                confusion. It is not necessary that it should be
                intended to deceive or intended to cause
                confusion. You do not have to look into the mind
                of the user to see what he intended. It is its
                probable effect on ordinary people which you
                have to consider. No doubt if you find that he did
                intend to deceive or cause confusion, you will give
                him credit for success in his intentions. You will
                not hesitate to hold that his use of it is likely to
                deceive or cause confusion. But if he had no such
                intention, and was completely honest, then you
                will look carefully to see whether it is likely to
                deceive or cause confusion before you find him
                guilty of infringement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">                Secondly, 'to deceive' is one thing. To 'cause
                confusion' is another. The difference is this: when
                you deceive a man, you tell him a lie. You make a
                false representation to him &amp; thereby cause him
                to believe a thing to be true which is false. You
                may not do it knowingly, or intentionally, but you
                still do it, &amp; so you deceive him. But you may
                cause confusion without telling him a lie at all, &amp;



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) No.3507/2014                                            Page 30 of 51</span>
                 without making any false representation to him.
                You may indeed tell him the truth, the whole
                truth &amp; nothing but the truth, but still you may
                cause confusion in his mind, not by any fault of
                yours, but because he has not the knowledge or
                ability to distinguish it from the other pieces of
                truth known to him or because he may not even
                take the trouble to do so."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">           31. While examining the question of misrepresentation
           or deception, comparison has to be made between the
           two trademarks as a whole. Rules of Comparison was
           explained by Justice Parker in the following words:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">                "You must take the two words. You must judge of
                them, both by their look &amp; by their sound. You
                must consider the goods to which they are to be
                applied. You must consider the nature &amp; kind of
                customer who would be likely to busy those
                goods. In fact, you must consider all the
                surrounding circumstances; and you must further
                consider what is likely to happen if each of those
                trade marks is used in a normal way as a
                trademark for the goods of the respective owners
                of the marks. If, considering all those
                circumstances, you come to the conclusion that
                there will be confusion- that is to say, not
                necessarily that one man will be injured&amp; the
                other will gain illicit benefit, but that there will be
                confusion in the mind of the public which will lead
                to confusion in the goods- then you may refuse
                the registration, or rather you must refuse the
                registration in that case."

                   in injury to the business of one who has the

<blockquote id="blockquote_41">                "The concept of distinguishing goods or services

                found in the requirements for a mark to be
                registrable. Essentially, whatever the wording
                used, a trade mark or a service mark was an
                indication which enabled the goods or services
                from a particular source to be indentified and thus
                distinguished from goods or services from other
                sources. In adopting a definition of 'trade mark'
                which simply describes the function in terms of
                capability of 'distinguishing the goods or services
                of one undertaking from those of other

                'TIS' or 'BES' and then the two marks to be
                compared. This submission is based on the
                decision in Astrazeneca UK Limited where 'Mero'
                was identified as the generic part of the mark
                derived    from      the    active   pharmaceutical
                ingredient. In the first place, no such submission
                appears to have been made before the IPAB.
                Secondly, the type of dissection suggested, i.e.
                separating 'FOR' and 'ZID' and then replacing
                'ZID' with 'another word 'TIS' before comparing
                the marks does not appear to be permissible in
                law. As already noticed it is not just the generic
                part 'ZID' that is common to both marks. The
                further prefix 'OR' too is common. In other words,
                'ORZID' is common to both marks. No parallel can
                therefore be drawn with the facts in Astrazeneca
                UK Limited. A person of average intelligence and
                imperfect     recollection       seeking   to  buy
                CEFTAZIDIME injection would hardly undertake
                any 'dissection' exercise, much less in the manner
                suggested by learned counsel for UBPL,           to
                discern the fine distinction between the marks.
                Also, unlike a consumer durable product, the
                variations in the size of font, colour scheme,
                trade dress of the label for a medicine would not
                make much of a difference. In the considered
                view of the Court, the IPAB has applied the
                correct test in coming to the conclusion that
                FORZID is deceptively similar to ORZID."

<blockquote id="blockquote_47">28.    Admittedly, the alleged use of the mark BECTODINE by the
defendants is subsequent to the documented use of the trademark
BETADINE by about 34 years. Such adoption and use by the
defendants is fraught with malafide and dishonesty. The sale of
products of the plaintiff under the trademark BETADINE for the year
1990 was Rs. 4,36,00,000/- which grew to Rs. 83,10,00,000/- by the

 mark and Rs. 12,57,00,000/- by the year 2009 when the defendant
No.1 allegedly filed its application with the Registrar of Trade Marks.
</blockquote><p id="p_69">The plaintiff's investment towards promotional expenses alone for the
year 2009 was Rs. 4,48,00,000/-. It is apparent that the plaintiff has
priority of adoption/use and that the trademark BETADINE of the
plaintiff was and continues to be well-known in India as on the date
the defendants allegedly adopted/commenced use of a deceptively
similar mark BECTODINE in relation to identical goods.
</p>
<p id="p_70">29.    The defendants being involved in the same trade ought to have
been aware of the plaintiff and its medicinal products available in the
market under the trademark BETADINE. It is clear that the adoption of
a deceptively similar trademark and the use of a deceptively similar
trade dress shows the dishonest and malafide intention of the
defendants. When the very adoption is tainted with dishonesty no
amount of use can cleanse the dishonesty.
</p>
<p id="p_71">30.    Thus, it is beyond any doubt that the defendants knowingly
adopted and used a deceptively similar mark BECTODINE, on an
identical trade dress and packaging with identical colour scheme,
layout, get up and distinctive features of the plaintiff's trade dress, in
relation to identical products being Povidone-iodine and have evidently
strained every nerve to bring their product closer to the plaintiff's
product BETADINE for Povidone-iodine range of products.
</p>
<p id="p_72">31.    The competing marks BETADINE of the plaintiff and BECTODINE
of the defendants when compared in its entirety are deceptively and
confusingly similar. The defendants adopted the mark BECTODINE,
being aware, of the trademark BETADINE of the plaintiff which is
evident from the fact that the packaging and the trade dress are also
deceptively similar.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">CS(OS) No.3507/2014                                          Page 36 of 51</span>
<p id="p_73"> 32.    The defendants are not merely using a deceptively similar mark
but have also copied the trade dress of the plaintiff and using the
same in relation to identical products. The adoption and alleged use of
the impugned mark / trade dress by the defendants is likely to cause
confusion / deception for a man of average intelligence with imperfect
recollection not having the benefit of side-byside comparison of the
competing goods.
</p>
<p id="p_74">33.    It is also a matter of record that the defendant No.1 is a habitual
infringer which is evident from the fact that various parties such as
Times Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd, Smithkline Beecham PLC
and Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals Ltd. have filed suits against the
defendant No.1 in the past before this Court. In the suit filed by
Smithkline Beecham PLC, being suit No.2371 of 2006, the defendant
No.1, it appears, was restrained from using the mark ECOCIN in
violation of the trademark CROCIN. Similarly, in the suit filed by Times
Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (P) Ltd. being suit No.1839 of 2008, the
defendant No.1 was restrained from using the mark DPS in violation of
the trademark DPS and in the suit filed by Jagsonpal Pharmaceuticals
Ltd, being suit No.1605 of 2008, the defendant No.1 was restrained
from using the mark RINGWORM CUTER in violation of the mark
RINGCUTER.
</p>
<p id="p_75">34.    Thus, both the marks are deceptively similar. The plaintiff has
been able to make a classic case of infringement of trademark and
passing off.          The defendants are also guilty of infringement of
copyright. The defendants cannot be allowed to argue that they would
change the colour-combination but the mark used by them if allowed
as suffix is common to the trade. It is necessary to mention here that
in pharmaceutical cases the entire conduct of the defendants is to be

 examined, as far as the use of the mark and packaging thereof are
concerned. They are not allowed to split the mark for the purpose of
comparison in the cases of infringement, as it is imperative to
compare the impugned mark as a whole with the registered trademark
of the plaintiff. The flimsy grounds should not be allowed to be raised
as the Courts are dealing with medicines which are meant for the
patients who are entitled to consume the original product.
</p>
<p id="p_76">35.    Law of publici juris has been discussed in many cases. The party
who has taken the defence of publici juris has to prove his case.
</p>
<p id="p_77">36.    A simple search on the records of the Trade Marks Registry
would have revealed the presence of the registered trademark
BETADINE in favour of the plaintiff. In any case, the defendants being
in the same trade business ought to have been aware of the plaintiff
and its well-known trademark BETADINE.
</p>
<p id="p_78">37.    The plea of 'common to the trade' has no substance             as the
same has been dealt with by the Supreme Court and various High

             possible that the mark may have been registered but
             not used. It is not permissible to draw any inference as

             its behalf that there were biscuits in the market bearing
             the marks 'Glucose Biscuits', 'Gluco biscuits' and

             the respondent in the present case. They are ordinary

             are really not marks with a common element or
             elements.     We, therefore, think that the learned
             appellate Judges were in error in deciding in favour of

             deny relief to the plaintiff. It cannot also be said that
             the plaintiff's trademark has lost its distinctiveness for
             the said reason. The reply affidavit of the plaintiff lists
             the orders of the Trade Mark Registry from 1964 to
             2000, where plaintiff's mark has been protected inter
             alia for reason of having great reputation. It also shows
             that the plaintiff has been enforcing its rights. Though
             the list filed by defendant No.1 in this regard is long but
             a perusal thereof shows a number of applicants to have
             abandoned or withdrawn their applications. This is a
             vast country. Mere long list of applicants/registrants of

             dent the distinctive character or repute of the mark."

<blockquote id="blockquote_56">           "29. If an action is taken by the registered owner and
           no interim injunction is granted, the effect is that goods
           bearing the infringing mark or spurious goods would
           continue to be sold in the market. After a number of
           years when the case is finally disposed of, after trial,
           and the plaintiff succeeds and gets a permanent
           injunction then, possibly, the plaintiff may also be
           compensated by his being awarded damages or an
           account of profits. In that sense the non-grant of the
           interim injunction would not, ultimately, prejudice the
           plaintiff for he may be compensated with payment of
           money but during this period when the defendant is
           allowed to continue to infringe the intellectual property
           it is the consumer or the purchaser who alone suffers
           and who ultimately cannot be compensated. Therefore,
           in order to curb the menace of manufacture, production
           and sale of spurious goods and the blatant violation of
           intellectual property it will be proper for the Court to
           take into consideration the interest of the general
           public. In this regard reference may usefully be made
           to the following observations of McCarthy at page 346,
           para 30.21, which deals with the protection of third
           parties:

                  infringement cases, "third parties" means the
                 buying public. If the equities are closely
                 balanced, the right of the public not to be
                 deceived or confused may turn the scales in
                 favour of a preliminary injunction."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">           30. It would appear to be difficult to accept hat relief of
           temporary injunction should not be granted, because of
           the delay on, the part of the plaintiff, even though the
           Court feels, at that point of time, that, ultimately
           permanent injunction will have to be granted.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_59">           31. Even though there may be some doubt as to
           whether laces or acquiescence can deny the relief of a
           permanent injunction, judicial opinion has been
           consistent in holding that if the defendant acts
           fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating the
           plaintiff s rights then in that case, even if there is an
           inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in taking
           action against the defendant, the relief of injunction is
           not denied. The defense of laces or inordinate delay is a
           defense in equity. Inequity both the parties mud's come
           to the Court with clean hands. An equitable defense can
           be put up by a party who has acted fairly and honestly.
           A person who is guilty of violating the law or infringing
           or usurping somebody else's right cannot clarify the
           continued misuse of the usurped right. It was observed
           by Romer, J. in the matter of an application brought be
           J. R. Parkington and Co. Ld., (1946) 63 RPC 171 at
           page 181 that "in my judgment, the circumstances
           which attend the adoption of a trade mark in the first
           instance are of considerable importance when one
           comes to consider whether the use of that mark has or
           has not been a honest user. If the user in its inception
           was tainted it would be difficult in most cases to purify
           it subsequently". It was further noted by the learned
           Judge in that case that he could not regard the
           discreditable origin of the user as cleansed by the
           subsequent history. In other words, the equitable relief
           will be afforded only to that party who is not guilty of a
           fraud and whose conduct shows that, there had been,
           on his part, an honest concurrent user of the mark in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">CS(OS) No.3507/2014                                            Page 45 of 51</span>
            question. If a party, for no apparent or a valid reason,
           adopts, with or without modifications, a mark belonging
           to another, whether registered or not, it will be difficult
           for that party to avoid an order of injunction because
           the Court may rightly assume that such adoption of the
           mark by the party was noting honest one. The Court
           would be justified in concluding that the defendant, in
           such an action, wanted to cash in on the plaintiffs name
           and reputation and that was the sole, primary or the
           real motive of the defendant adopting such a mark.
           Even if, in such a case, there may be an inordinate
           delay on the part of the plaintiff in bringing a suit for
           injunction, the application of the plaintiff for an interim
           injunction cannot be dismissed on the ground that the
           defendant has been using the mark for a number of
           years. Dealing with this aspect Harry D. Nims in his
           "The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade Marks",
           Fourth Edition, Volume Two at page 1282 noted as
           follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">              "Where infringement is deliberate and willful and
              the defendant acts fraudulently with knowledge
              that he is violating plaintiff s rights, essential
              elements of estoppels are lacking and in such a
              case the protection of plaintiffs rights by injunctive
              relief never is properly denied. "The doctrine of

            wherever a person commits breach of a registered

</blockquote><p id="p_98">Passing Off
</p><p id="p_99">43.    Even the test of confusion and deception in order to prove the
case of passing off has been very well discussed in the case of
Laxmikant V. Patel v. Chetanbhat Shah and Another, reported in
(2002) 3 SCC 65, wherein the Supreme Court while considering a plea
of passing off and grant of ad interim injunction held in no uncertain
terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services under a
trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a
reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by
the Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or
services in the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to
the business of one who has the property in that name. It was held
that honesty and fair play are and ought to be the basic policy in the
world of business and when a person adopts or intends to adopt a
name which already belongs to someone else, it results in confusion,
has the propensity of diverting the customers and clients of someone
else to himself and thereby resulting in injury.

principles which apply to trademark are applicable to trade name also.

       not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently
       or otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair
       play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of
       business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to
       adopt a name in connection with his business or services

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_66">      "Copyright is a form of intellectual property. With
      advancement in technology it is very easy to copy. The basic
      test in actions based on the infringement of the copyright is
      that if a thing fetches a price, it can always be copied and
      therefore, it needs adequate protection. It is well settled that
      although under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_33">Copyright Act</a>, 1957, there is a provision of
      registration, under <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_34">Section 44</a> of the Act. It is not in doubt
      that the said procedure is an enabling provision and

      copyright. <a href="/doc/1403255/" id="a_35">Section 44</a> of the Act provides for registration of

       work in which copyright exists but in order to claim copyright
      registration is not necessary. This is because registration is
      only to raise a presumption that the person shown in the
      certificate of registration is the author. This presumption is
      not conclusive, but no further proof is necessary unless there
      is a proof rebutting the contents of the said certificate. Under
      <a href="/doc/593677/" id="a_36">Section 48</a> of the Registration Act, therefore, the act of
      registration is ex-facie prima facie evidence of the particulars
      incorporated in the certificate. There is no provision under the
      Act which deprives the author of the rights on account of non
      registration of the copyright. There is nothing in the Act to
      suggest that the registration is condition precedent to the
      subsistent of the copyright or acquisition of copyrights or
      ownership thereof or for relief of infringement of copyright.
      The sine-qua non of existence of a copyright is expenditure of
      skill, labour and capital on anywork expanded by a
      person/author and unless the original work is produced in
      court to prima facie show that the work has originated from
      author, no relief can be granted.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_67">        In other words, copyright exists even without it being
        registered for the purpose of its enforcement. The nature
        of copyright is also meant to be borne in mind. It
        subsists in any material form in which ideas are
        translated. Copyright is a incorporeal right. It does not
        lie in any idea, but it lies in the expression in which the
        idea is expressed. The work of an author therefore,
        becomes the subject matter of the copyright. In essence
        the copyright is a negative right of preventing copying of
        physical material in the field of art, literature etc. Once
        an idea is written down, the writing becomes the subject
        matter of copyright. With globalisation and advancement
        of technology, even computer programmes come within
        the copyright.      Any work conveying a particular
        information comes within the subject matter of a
        copyright and it needs protection."

D.D.S.A.Pharmaceuticals Limited reported in 1972 RPC Page 1 the

black and green capsules bearing the word "Roche" on each capsule,

 the defendants also marked and advertised the drug chlordiazepoxide
in black and green 10mg capsules which were identical to those of the
plaintiffs except that they bore the letters "DDSA" instead of the
plaintiffs' name. The plaintiffs were granted interlocutory injunction to
restrain the defendants from passing off capsules of the patented drug
as the goods of the plaintiffs.    It was held that marketing of the
capsules by the defendants in almost identical form to those of the
plaintiffs was calculated to cause damage to the plaintiffs.        It was
further held that there was a likelihood of confusion as both the
capsules contained the same drug.       The public were not concerned
with the identity of the manufacturing of the capsules as long as the
capsules contained the same substance and had the same effect.
</p>
<p id="p_105">48.    In view of the above said well known settled law on the subject,
it is clear that the defendant is guilty of infringement of copyright and
passing off their goods as the goods of the plaintiff.           Also the
packaging materials produced by both the parties are seen, both are
deceptively similar. It appears that the defendants have designed their
packaging material after having seen the packaging material of the
plaintiff. From the above said judgments cited it is clear that in most
of the cases the copyright has been claimed by the plaintiff on the
article itself. It is also pertinent to mention that the subject matter of
the colour combination, get-up and layout are not only covered in the
subject matter of copyright but also covered under the common law
remedy i.e. law of passing off. Even in the New Trade Mark Act 1999
the definition of the mark is given in <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_37">Section 2(m)</a> which says that
"Mark" include a device, brand, style, label, ticket, name, signature,
word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging or combination of
colours or any combination thereof. As per the definition and as per

 the judgments mentioned above it is clear that the colour scheme, get
up, layout and combination of colours is covered under the action for
passing of also. In view of this, in the present case the defendants
have infringed the Copyright of the plaintiff. This issue is accordingly
decided in favour of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_106">49.    Under these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the
plaintiff has been able to make a strong prima facie case for grant of
interim order.        Since the plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the
trademark BETADINE and the same has been used earlier than the
defendants, thus, the balance of convenience also lies in favour of the
plaintiff and against the defendants.        In case the injunction order is
not passed, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable loss and injury. An ex-
parte ad-interim injunction granted on 14th November, 2014 thereby
restraining       the      defendants    from     using    the     trademark
"BECTODINE/BECTODINE-M" or any other mark which is identical or
deceptively similar to the plaintiff's registered trade mark "BETADINE"
is made absolute.        The application being I.A. No. 22711/2014 under
