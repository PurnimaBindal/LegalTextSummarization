Buildings  (Lease  and Rent Control), Act 1960, as amended by Act 23/73 and by
Act 1/1980, against the Order dated 15.04.2002 in R.C.A.No.755 and 133 of 1998
on the file of VIII Judge, Small Causes Court,  Chennai  reversing  the  order

:COMMON ORDER

        Landlady is the revision petitioner in both  the  revision  petitions,
arising  out  of  the common order dated 15.04.2002 passed in R.C.A.No.755 and
133 of 1998 by the VIII Judge, Small Causes, Court, Chennai, which  themselves
were  preferred  against  the er dated 12.08.1998 passed in R.C.O.P.No.1509 of
1996 by the XIV Judge, Court of Small Causes, Chennai.
</p>
<p id="p_3">        2.  The rent  control  original  petition  was  filed  under  sections
10(2)(i) and 10(2)(ii)(a) of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control)
Act, for eviction on the ground of wilful default and subletting.  The learned
Rent Controller  ordered eviction only on the ground of subletting.  Even that
order of eviction was set aside in R.C.A.No.75 5  of  1998  preferred  by  the
tenants.   R.C.A.No.133  of  1998  was  preferred  by the landlady against the
finding that there was no wilful default and that appeal was dismissed.   Upon
the  dismissal  of  both  the grounds, these revision petitions are separately
filed by the landlady.
</p>
<p id="p_4">        3.  The issues before us are as to (i) whether there is wilful default
in payment of rent for the months of March, April and  May  1996?    and  (ii)
whether there was subletting made by the tenant?
</p>
<p id="p_5">        4.   Regarding  subletting,  the law under section 10(2)(ii)(a) of the
Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_6">"(2) A landlord who seeks to evict his tenant shall apply  to  the  Controller
for a  direction in that behalf.  If the Controller, after giving the tenant a
reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the application, is specified-
</p><p id="p_7">        (ii) that the tenant has after the 23rd  October,  1945,  without  the
written consent of the landlord-
</p><p id="p_8">        (a)  transferred  his  right  under  the  lease  or sub-let the entire
building or any portion thereof if the lease does not confer on him any  right
to do so, or...."
</p>
<p id="p_9">        5.   Although  there  was  no  lease agreement in between the parties,
there is a letter through Ex.P-7 purported to have been written by the  tenant
in favour of the landlord on 21.03.1985; whereby it is found that
"I  shall not use the shop for any other business except for the show room for
sale of cool drinks and shall not store any inflammable or hazardous goods  in
the shop  let  out  to  me.....  I shall not sublet the shop or convert or any
alteration without your written consent......."
Even though the truthfulness in execution of such letter  was  denied  by  the
tenant, it can be relied upon inasmuch as some portion of the letter was found
in the  handwriting of the tenant himself.  According to the above contents of
the said letter, the tenant is forbidden from subletting without  the  consent
of the landlady.
</p>
<p id="p_10">        6.   Mr.V.Ayyadurai,  learned  counsel  for  the tenant submitted that
there is no subletting in this case.  The evidence  on  record  do  show  that
originally the first respondent was running a cool drinks shop in the tenament
and subsequently, he has entered into a partnership deed with one Chander, the
second  respondent,  whereby  the partnership firm began to run a STD booth in
the tenament.  Whether this will amount to subletting is a question before us.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        7.  The learned counsel for the first respondent / tenant relied  upon
<a href="/doc/1052950/" id="a_1">M/s.BENTOOL   STEEL   PRODUCTS   PVT.LTD.,   REP.BY  ITS  MANAGING  DIRECTOR.,
G.K.PATTERY ..vs..  O.M.A.MOHAMMED OMAR AND ANOTHER</a> (2001(3) CTC 618),  <a href="/doc/1378557/" id="a_2">HELPER
GIRDHARBHAI ..vs..   SAIYED MOHMAD MIRASAHEB KADRI AND OTHERS</a> (1987(3)SCC 538)
and P.SENNIAPPAN ..vs..  K ANNAMMAL (1998 (1) CTC 537 ).
</p>
<p id="p_12">        8.  In the above cases cited on the side of the tenant,  it  has  been
clearly  mentioned  in  1998(1)  CTC  537 that when tenant had permitted third
party also to use the building, then there was no sub-letting.  It was held in
1987(3) SCC 538 that tenant becoming a  partner  of  a  partnership  firm  and
allowing  the  firm to carry on business in the demised premises while himself
retaining legal possession thereof, it was held that it  does  not  amount  to
subletting;  similarly  in 2001(3) CTC 618, it was held that in order to prove
subletting, it must establish (i) that third party sub tenant paid the rent to
tenant; and (ii) that tenant had no control over that part of premises,  which
is in occupation of sub tenant.  But the facts of the case show that there was
no  exclusive  possession  by  the  sub-tenant,  namely, the partnership firm,
because the first respondent himself as a partner to the said  firm  continued
in possession.    There  is also no question of payment of rent by partnership
firm in favour of first respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_13">        9.  Placing reliance upon the case law  <a href="/doc/1056962/" id="a_3">JOGINDER  SINGH  SODHI  ..vs..
AMAR  KAUR</a>  ((2005)  I  SCC 31) by landlady is of no use because in that case,
sub-tenant was shown to be in exclusive possession so as to observe that there
was sub-lease.  But in this case, the  second  respondent  was  not  found  in
exclusive possession.    1987(3)  SCC  538  alone is applicable to the present
facts of the case.  So, no sub-letting was established.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        10.  So far as the wilful default in payment of rent is concerned,  to
say  that  there  was an understanding between the parties as if once in three
months, rent is to be paid is not correct.   This  is  so  because  in  Ex.P-7
letter, the following is found:
</p><p id="p_15">        "I  shall  pay regularly the monthly rent and electric current charges
payable for English calendar month on the first day of  the  succeeding  month
without fail.
</p><p id="p_16">This letter  was  written  in  1985.    R.C.O.P.No.1509  of  1996 was filed on
10.07.1996.  The rent for March, April and May, 1996 was  said  to  have  been
sent by  money  order  on  11.07.1996  through its coupon Ex.P-3.  But in that
coupon, it was mentioned by the tenant as if he is sending  the  rent  through
the same  for  the months of April, May and June 19 96.  First of all, sending
three months rent in one money order coupon will by itself show that there was
earlier default for the two prior months.  Secondly, the  rent  actually  sent
through  Ex.P-3  was  April,  May  and  June  1996, whereby the rent for March
remains unpaid.  An explanation was  offered  by  the  tenant  as  if  it  was
mistakenly  written  in  the coupon as rent of April, May and June; but it was
meant only for March to May 1996.  It is not the case of tenant that the  rent
for the  month  of June was already paid.  So, the rent for March or June 1996
remains unpaid.  While four months rent is due, Ex.P-3 shows only payment  for
three months.    Therefore,  whether  it is March 1996 or June 1996, one month
rent is found to remain unpaid since 1996.  It is very strange as to how  both
the  authorities  below  found  on  fact that there was no default, much less,
wilful default.
</p>
<p id="p_17">        11.  Learned counsel for the first respondent / tenant  has  submitted
that  when  once  both the authorities below concurred together on facts, this
Court may not interfere in the said factual finding.  But the learned  counsel
for  the  landlady  cited a decision reported in 2004(4) CTC 286 (<a href="/doc/335599/" id="a_4">M.VELMURUGAN
..vs..  P.SRINIVASAN</a>, which, after  relying  upon  the  judgment  rendered  by
Supreme Court  in  <a href="/doc/87180/" id="a_5">P.S.PAREED  KAKA  AND  OTHERS  ..vs..    SHAFEE AHMED SAHEB</a>
(2004(2) CTC 364), held as follows:
</p><p id="p_18">        "It is also to be remembered that the Honourable Supreme Court in  the
decision reported  in  <a href="/doc/87180/" id="a_6">P.S.PAREED  KAKA  AND OTHERS ..vs..  SHAFEE AHMED SAHEB</a>
(2004(2) CTC 364):  2004(5) SCC 241 held that the High Court has  jurisdiction
to  go  into  the  legality or correctness of the decision, which includes the
power to appreciate evidence and that the High Court can  interfere  with  the
finding of  fact  also.    The  examination  as  to  the  correctness involves
appreciation of evidence and that  the  High  Court  can  interfere  with  the
finding of the Rent Controller is entirely improbable".
</p>
<p id="p_19">        12.   Even  in  the  decision reported in 2004(5) CTC 338 (<a href="/doc/1630420/" id="a_7">MANGALAMBAL
..vs..  ANJALI DEVI</a>), findings of fact are interfered with in a revision filed
by the landlady.  So, this Court is competent to interfere with  the  perverse
finding even it was made by both the authorities below.
</p>
<p id="p_20">        13.   In this case, as I mentioned earlier, one month rent of March or
June 1996 remains unpaid.  What the learned counsel for the  tenant  submitted
is  that there can as well be a direction for the tenant to deposit or pay the
said rent, which cannot be done here, because it is obligatory on the part  of
the  tenant  to  pay the rent every month on the next succeeding month without
any prompting either by this Court or by the learned Rent Controller  or  even
by  the  landlady  by  reminding  the tenant through the issuance of notice on
demand of rent.  The tenant has a statutory obligation to  pay  the  rent  suo
motu.
</p>
<p id="p_21">        14.   Learned  counsel  for  the  first  respondent  /  tenant drew my
attention to the following explanation to the proviso to Section  10(2)(ii)(a)
of the Act is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_22">"Explanation:-  For  the purpose of this sub-section, default to pay or tender
rent shall be construed as wilful, if the default by the tenant in the payment
or tender of rent continues after the  issue  of  two  months  notice  by  the
landlord claiming the rent".
</p>
<p id="p_23">        15.   It  is only a legal construction about wilful default in case if
the tenant fails in payment or tender of rent even after the issuance  of  two
months notice  by  the  landlady  claiming  the  rent.    That  is not a prior
condition before ever a petition for eviction on the ground of wilful  default
is filed.   As mentioned supra, it is obligatory on the part of the tenant, in
accordance with the contractual terms, to pay the rent within two weeks of the
succeeding English Calendar month.
</p>
<p id="p_24">        16.  To show that on  similar  occasions  default  was  considered  as
wilful, the following case laws were cited on behalf of the landlady.
(2004)2 M.L.J.576 (<a href="/doc/1282803/" id="a_8">SUBAM MEDICALS ..vs..DR.(MRS.) ZUBAIDA BEGUM</a>
2004-4-L.W.526 (<a href="/doc/1216654/" id="a_9">A.S.K.VENKATACHARY ..vs..  M.MEERAN SAHEB</a>)
2004-3-L.W.361  (<a href="/doc/1753452/" id="a_10">C.T.MEYAMMAI  ..vs..S.MOHAMED  KAMIL,  PROPRIETOR FASHION 'N'
STYLE</a>)
1994-2-L.W.524 <a href="/doc/1587379/" id="a_11">MOHAMED ROWTHER ..vs..  S.S.RAJALINGA RAJA AND TWO OTHERS</a>;
</p>
<p id="p_25">        17.  The subsequent enhancement of rent may not also be  a  ground  in
favour  of  the  tenant  because  no  rent  will  remain unaltered for decades
together and enhancement parallel to inflation is after  all  justifiable  and
one  cannot take anything adverse to the landlady from that fact of subsequent
enhancement of rent.  No motive could be attributed on this aspect against the
landlady.
</p>
<p id="p_26">        18.  Since the rent of one month is not paid for ten years  and  since
rent  for  three  months  Ex.P-3  was  shown  to  have  been  paid only on the
particular day just prior to preferring of rent control original  petition,  I
find it a wilful default on the part of the tenant.  Hence, the findings given
by both the authorities below are liable to to be interfered with.
</p>
<p id="p_27">        19.  For the reasons mentioned above,
</p><p id="p_28">        (i)  C.R.P.(NPD)  No.171  of  2003  is dismissed, confirming the order
passed in R.C.A.No.133 of 1998 to the  effect  that  there  is  no  subletting
proved.
</p>

<p id="p_29">        (ii) C.R.P.(NPD) No.170 of 2003 is allowed, reversing the order passed
in R.C.A.No.755  of  1998.    There shall be an order of eviction based on the
ground of wilful default in payment of rent.  Time for eviction six months.
No costs.
