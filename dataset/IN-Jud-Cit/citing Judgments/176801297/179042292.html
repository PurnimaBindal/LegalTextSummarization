opinion was specifically called on the point raised by M/s. Sagar

exclusion of the hoardings in the name of the sister concerns of petitioner

hoardings in the name of the petitioner. He raised protest against
decision of respondent to conduct de-novo enquiry regarding entire bid.

<p id="p_19">13.         The petitioner has, therefore, approached this Court
challenging the decision of the respondent No.2 dated 12.9.2022
(published on 19.9.2022) in this writ petition. We have heard learned
counsels appearing for respective parties.
</p>

<p id="p_20">14.         The    learned   Senior     Advocate       Mr.   Venkatesh    Dhond
appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that the respondent No.2
had no reason to re-evaluate the entire technical bid of the petitioner,
particularly when the 47 hoardings of petitioner were declared to be
eligible by respondent No.2 in view of the previous decision of the
Scrutiny Committee. He invited our attention to the relevant paragraphs
from the judgment of this Court in W.P. No. 6731 of 2022 to submit that
in light of observations of this Court, the respondent No.2 was to
consider the hoardings in the name of the sister concerns of petitioner
which were not considered during the earlier round. He would submit
that the term &quot;hoardings&quot; is not defined under the request for proposal
(RFP). He would submit that as per the eligibility criteria, the bidder
should    have     experience     of        erecting      and    handling     of
advertisement/outdoor advertising media of 50 hoardings, each of
minimum 450 sq. ft. in Corporation/Authority area. He would submit
that after adding hoardings in the name of the sister concerns, along with
47 hoardings owned by the petitioner, the petitioner fulfills the requisite
criteria. He invited our attention to the clarification issued by the
respondent No.2 during the pre-bid meeting dated 23.2.2022. He invited
our attention to certain photographs in respect of advertisement boards
                                     {9}

erected by the petitioner and tried to distinguish the same from gantries.
The learned Senior Advocate Mr. Vyankatesh Dhond invited our attention
to the definition of &quot;gantries&quot; under the guidelines framed by the MCGM,
which states as under :-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">            &quot;gantry : means advertisement affixed on a gantry
            erected across a road and usually fabricated of metal
            section pillars fixed on either side of a road with a beam
            shaped section connecting the top of the pillars across
            the road with the advertisement on the fact opposite to
            the direction of traffic.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_21">15.         The learned Senior Advocate Mr. Venkatesh Dhond would
further submit that in light of the definition of &quot;gantries&quot;, the
advertisement boards of the petitioner could not have been labeled as
gantries. He would further submit that after receiving the objection from
respondent No.4, respondents have invited the opinion of the MCGM
regarding advertisement boards of the petitioner. The MCGM under its
communication dated 27.7.2022 and 12.8.2022 clarified that the
advertisement boards of the petitioners are hoardings.          Similarly, the
VJTI, Mumbai vide its communication dated 26.6.2022 opined that the
advertisement structures of the petitioner are not gantries. He would
submit that once the respondent No.2 invited opinion of the Corporation
being expert, there was no reason to discard the said opinion and brand
the advertisement hoardings of the petitioner as gantries.          He would
submit that the decision of the respondent No.2 under impugned
communication dated 19.9.2022 is tainted with malafides. He would
point out that only 24 out of 47 hoardings in the name of the petitioner
are held to be eligible, though 47 hoardings were already declared
qualified. He points out that 32 hoardings which are in MCGM Area on
foot over-bridges are held to be ineligible. He would further submit that
                                      {10}

this court nowhere directed fresh scrutiny of the entire technical bid of
the petitioner, however, the respondent No.2 has deliberately mis-
interpreted the order to initiate fresh scrutiny of the bid of the petitioner.
</p>

<p id="p_22">16.          To supplement the arguments on behalf of the petitioner,
learned Senior Advocate Mr. Chatterji, submits that since respondent
No.2 had already considered 47 advertisement hoardings of petitioner
eligible as per the criteria provided under the Request for Proposal (RFP),
the respondent No.2 is estopped from raising the plea that those 47
hoardings do not pass the eligibility criteria. He would submit that the
respondent No.2 cannot be allowed to &quot;approbate and reprobate&quot; at the
same time. Once they have taken a specific stand while evaluating the
bid of the petitioner during earlier round of litigation, they cannot take
contrary position at subsequent stage of litigation. They cannot blow
&quot;hot and cold&quot; at the subsequent stages of the same litigation. He relies
upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court, in the matter of <a href="/doc/176801297/" id="a_3">Anchor
Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd vs. Proctor and Gamble Manufacturing
(Tianjin) Co. Ltd</a>. 2014 SCC online Del 2968. He has further relied upon
judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of B.L.
Shreedhar and others Vs. K.M. Munireddy (dead) and others (2003) 2
SCC 355 as well as Premlata @ Sunita vsm Naseeb Bee and others dated

</p>

<p id="p_23">17.          Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Sathe, appearing for the
respondent No.2 would submit that it is the trite that no Mandamus can
be issued to accept the tender. He would submit that a careful reading of
the operative part of the order of this Court in W.P. No. 6731 of 2022
would show that this Court has directed to &quot;re-consider the petitioner&#x27;s
                                    {11}

bid&quot; in the light of the observations made therein. He would submit that
the operative part of the order or even the observations made in the
order of this court, do not suggest that the 47 advertising boards of
petitioner which were considered during the earlier round of litigation,
are to be accepted as eligible or the eligibility of the said hoardings
cannot be examined.
</p>

<p id="p_24">18.          Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Sathe would further submit
that the Scrutiny Committee in its earlier decision had considered
hoardings of petitioner located in Corporation area of Mumbai as eligible.
Petitioner has claimed 47 such hoardings in his name. Rest of the
hoardings were found to be in the name of the sister concerns or outside
the Municipal area of the city of Mumbai. Therefore, the petitioner was
declared disqualified for want of requisite number of hoardings within
the corporation area. The detail technical scrutiny to examine the
eligibility of those 47 hoardings of petitioner in city area was not
undertaken during the earlier round. The bid of petitioner was evaluated
assuming that petitioner holds 47 eligible hoardings within the limits of
corporation without going into the details. However, advertisement
boards in the name of sister concerns or those out of corporation area
were discarded.
</p><p id="p_25">19.          Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Sathe would further submit
that after decision of this court in W.P. No. 6731 of 2022 the objections
were received from other bidders; hence, opinion was called from the
corporation (MCGM) regarding the Advertising boards of the petitioner.
It would reveal that the corporation has not issued separate license for
gantries and they are issuing licenses only for the hoardings, though
some of them may be gantries in true sense.

</p><p id="p_27">20.          Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Sathe further invites our
attention to the opinion received from the Corporation and would submit
that the Corporation has not answered the specific query regarding the
advertisement hoardings of the petitioner to qualify them as hoardings or
gantries. He points out that the opinion given by the MCGM is not
determinative to hold that the 47 advertisement boards qualify the
definition of hoarding. He would submit that advertisement boards on
foot over-bridges (FOB) or railway over-bridges (ROB) do not qualify the
definition of hoardings. He would point out that as per the final scrutiny,
the petitioner holds only 24 eligible hoardings in his name.
</p>

<p id="p_28">21.           Mr. Sathe learned Senior Advocate would further point out
that the petitioner refused to give inspection of the sites though there is a
specific condition under the tender notice to provide inspection.         He
would further point out that pleading in petition sans requisite
components on the point of malafides. He would also submit that the
decision of the committee holding that the petitioner&#x27;s hoardings are
gantries in real sense, is not specifically challenged.
</p>

<p id="p_29">22.          Learned Senior Advocate Mr. Anturkar appearing on behalf
of respondent No.4 would submit that this court, while rendering the
decision in W.P. No. 6731 of 2022 simply directed to re-consider the bid
of the petitioner in the light of the observations. He would point out that
there are no directions to consider or accept the 47 hoardings in the
name of the petitioner as valid. He would point out that the decision in
the earlier round of litigation is only pertaining to acceptance of
advertisement boards in the name of the sister concerns. He invited out
attention to the observations of this court from the judgment in W.P. No.
                                     {13}

6731 of 2022 and the prayer clauses in that writ petition to submit that a
prayer was limited to re-consider the decision along with advertisement
boards in the name of the sister concerns. He would submit that the
experience solicited under tender is for the erection and handing of
hoardings. The petitioner do not possess the experience of erection of
hoardings. He would invite our attention to the definition of &quot;hoardings&quot;
to contend that the erection on ground or on dead wall of building is the
basic ingredient. He would further submit that there is a difference
between the hoardings and gantries. Erection is the basic component to
constitute &quot;hoardings&quot; whereas, affixing is the main component of
&quot;gantry&quot;. He would submit that, the so-called hoarding in the name of
the petitioner do not quality the definition of &quot;hoardings&quot;, as adopted by
the respondent No.2/Author of the tender notice. Accordingly, he would
submit that the writ petition sans merit is liable to be dismissed.
</p>

<p id="p_30">23.          We have heard learned counsels for respective parties.
The contentious issue raised for our consideration is regarding propriety
on the part of the Scrutiny Committee of respondent No.2 to venture into
exercise of re-evaluation of the entire tender bid of the petitioner.
According to petitioner, when his 47 advertising boards had been
accepted by scrutiny committee of respondent No. 2, as hoardings,
complying with the tender condition, there was no propriety in reopening
the entire bid.
</p>

<p id="p_31">24.          With a view to ascertain merit of the aforesaid contention,
we have perused the minutes of the meeting of scrutiny committee dated
24.03.2022 which are placed on record before. The relevant paragraph
of the minutes of meeting reads thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                      {14}

             &quot;Similarly, when the documents submitted by M/s. Sagar
      Lookout were scrutinized, they have submitted a list of 96
      advertisement in the documents submitted with the bid. Some
      advertisements in that, have no objection certificates, of Satara
      C.H.S. Limited, Consent Advertisements Pvt. Ltd. M/s. Urja
      Developers &amp; Beautifications, Chiplun Municipal Corporation,
      Grampanchayat Savroli, Palidevde, village Panchayat Devnhal and
      the no objection certificate of Forest Conservator Alibag was also
      seen. However, as the said bidder was not seen to have
      experience of erecting 50 advertisement boards, when they were
      told to be non-eligible, M/s. Sagar Lookout when requested that
      they may he given time to submit their explanation, the
      Committee gave them time to submit the explanation upto 3.00
      p.m. on 25.03.2022&quot;.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_32">25.          We have also perused the representation dated 25.03.2022
addressed by the petitioner to the Scrutiny Committee.            In the said
representation, the petitioner has explained the experience of sister
concerns/partners and requested the Committee to consider the
advertising boards in the name of sister concerns, while assessing the
eligibility. We have also perused the contents of the representation dated
28.03.2022 addressed by the petitioner to MHADB/ respondent No.2.
The petitioner has insisted to consider the experience of the
partners/sister concerns and count 95 advertising boards as &quot;hoardings&quot;.
It appears that the issue regarding the technical specification of 47
advertising boards installed by the petitioner in MCGM area was never
considered or discussed in the aforesaid deliberations.
</p>

<p id="p_33">26.          We have also gone through the representations dated
8.4.2022 and 11.4.2022 addressed by the petitioner to MHADB. It shows
that the petitioner has put forth his request to consider the advertising
                                         {15}

boards of sister concerns in addition to his 47 advertising boards, which
were considered as eligible by the Scrutiny Committee. We have also
taken into account, the final decision of the Scrutiny Committee, which
would show that the petitioner was disqualified with following
observations:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">               &quot;5.    It is seen from the documents submitted by Sagar
               Lookout that the company was registered on 19.12.2007.
               When the list submitted by Sagar Lookout is perused, it is
               seen that Sagar Lookout has 47 advertisement hoardings in
               its own name. The remaining advertisements are in the
               names of Satara C.H.S., Urja Developer &amp; Beautification,
               Mystical Polyplast, M/s. Mystical Thchnoplast, they have not
               been taken into consideration. Also, as there is mention of
               size in the memo issued by the Forest Conservator, Alibag,
               regarding erection of advertisement board, it has not been
               taken into consideration. Similarly, as there is no mention
               of size in the hoarding given by Municipal Council, Chiplun,
               that has not been taken into consideration.

               Gram Panchayat Savroli, Palidevadh, Devnahe and others
               has been given. However, as the Gram Panchayat is not a
               Local Authority under the provisions of MRTP Act - 1966,
               the said no objection certificates are not been taken into
               consideration.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                       Therefore, as per the eligibility criteria, as the number
               of hoardings of Sagar Lookout being less than the eligibility
               criteria, their tender is considered non-eligible.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">27.            The decision of the Scrutiny Committee does not depict that;
the 47 advertising boards of the petitioner were technically qualified as
&quot;hoardings&quot;.      The decision-making process simply suggests that the
petitioners 47 advertising boards which are within the jurisdiction of
MCGM were taken in to consideration. The rest of advertising boards
either in the name of sister concerns or beyond jurisdiction of MCGM
                                     {16}

were discarded as ineligible.      Accordingly, observation is made that
petitioner failed to comply the requisite experience of 50 hoardings. It is,
therefore, evident that the decision of the Scrutiny Committee in earlier
round of evaluation process was not based on technical assessment of the
nature of 47 advertising boards of the petitioner either as Hoarding Or
Gantries. The petitioner was declared disqualified because advertising
boards in the name of sister concerns or advertising boards which were
outside the area of MCGM, were discarded from consideration
resultantly, he failed to comply with the condition of experience of
installation of 50 hoardings


</p><p id="p_35">28.          The petitioner had assailed the said decision of the Scrutiny
Committee before this Court by filing Writ Petition No. 6731 of 2022. As
stated earlier, the writ petition filed by the petitioner was allowed by this
Court vide order dated 14.07.2022. The contention of the petitioner is
that issue regarding eligibility of his 47 hoardings was already concluded.
According to petitioner, this Court has endorsed the aforesaid fact.
However, after going through the reasoning recorded by this Court, we
find that the core issue that was canvassed before this Court was
regarding non-consideration of advertising boards standing in the name
of sister concerns of the petitioner. The concluding para no. 36 of the
judgment in Writ Petition No. 6731 of 2022 reads thus :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">             &quot;36....
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">             ....
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">             ....     From the stand point of MHADB, the credentials
             of the person who is entrusted with the performance of
             work viz. The background of the firm and the persons
             who are in control of the same and their capacity to
             execute the work has to be seen. The tendering
             authority will not go by the name of the firm but the

             person/s behind it. We have no hesitation in concluding
             that    the    Committee      completely      erred     in
             discarding/ignoring the documents relating to the
             experience of the partners of the bidder firm. It is not
             disputed that the bid of the petitioner is held ineligible
             only on the ground that it does not have the experience
             of erecting and handling 50 hoardings and on no other
             ground.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_36">The observations made in the order precisely show that the issue under
consideration before this Court was, regarding exclusion of Advertising
Boards owned by the sister concerns of the petitioner while evaluating
his technical bid.
</p>

<p id="p_37">29.          It is the contention of petitioner that, as per observations of
this Court in para.15, 32 and 36 of the judgment in W.P. No. 6731 of
2022, the issue regarding eligibility of 47 hoardings of petitioner is
concluded. However, we are unable to comprehend this contention
because this Court has merely observed in concluding paragraph of
judgment, that experience of partners of the firm who are in control of
the same and their capacity to execute the work is to be seen. The
Tendering Authority will not go by the name of the firm but person/s
behind it. This Court concluded that the decision of the Committee was
erroneous    while   discarding/ignoring      the    documents      relating   to
experience of the partner of the bidder firm.       The operative part of the
judgment would suggest that the decision of the Committee dated
12.04.2022 declaring the petitioner as ineligible in tender No.4 has been
quashed and set aside and the respondent No.2 was directed to re-
consider petitioner&#x27;s bid in the light of the observations.
</p>

<p id="p_38">30.          On scrutiny of aforesaid facts, it is difficult to accept

contention of the petitioner that his 47 advertising boards could not have
been re-evaluated or the respondent No.2 was estopped from re-
evaluating entire bid including the eligibility of 47 advertising boards in
view of the judgment of this Court in W.P. No. 6731 of 2022. This
discussion brings us to the judgments relied by petitioner in cases of
<a href="/doc/176801297/" id="a_4">Anchor Health and Beauty Care Pvt. Ltd vs. Practor and Gamble
Manufacturing (Delhi High</a> Court), B.L. Shreedhar and others Vs. K.M.
Munireddy (dead) and others (SC) as well as Premlata @ Sunita vsm
Naseeb Bee and others dated 23.3.2022 Civil Appeal No. 2055-56 OF
2022 (SC). We have no difficulty to accept cardinal principle reiterated
in these judgments, however on facts, petitioner has nothing to bank
upon proposition highlighted in reported judgments.
</p>

<p id="p_39">31.         The second contention of the petitioner before us, is that
respondents have erroneously discarded advertising boards on foot over
bridge and flyover bridge from consideration. It is contended that, the
opinion of the MCGM was called regarding advertising boards of the
petitioner and they have certified the advertising boards of the petitioner
as hoardings. However, on perusal of the communication dated
10.08.2022 addressed on behalf of MCGM to the respondent No.2, it can
be observed that, list of advertising boards in the name of the petitioner
is provided without certifying the nature of such advertising boards
either as &quot;hoardings&quot; or &quot;gantries&quot;. In that view of the matter, there is no
substance in the contention of the petitioner that the MCGM has certified
that the advertising boards of the petitioner are &quot;hoardings.&quot;.         The
communication dated 14.08.2022 issued by Advertising Inspector, of
MCGM informs that the petitioner has been issued license for hoardings
to be installed on fly-over-bridges and foot-over-bridges. However, it is
brought on record that, MCGM do not issue independent licenses for
                                       {19}
                                                    wp (L) 30316.22 final.docx

gantries. The licenses for hoardings take in sweep gantries also. Hence
both the aforesaid communications are not enough to gather the nature
of petitioner&#x27;s advertising boards.
</p>

<p id="p_40">32.           The Scrutiny Committee of respondent No.2 has re-
evaluated the bid of the petitioner in terms of the order passed by this
Court. The 29 advertising boards which are on foot over bridge and 1 on
flyover bridge are held to be ineligible as those were not installed on
ground or dead wall of building to meet definition of &quot;hoarding&quot;. As per
the result of reevaluation, Petitioner has failed to comply with the
eligibility criteria laid down under clause 3.2.4 of the RFP.             The
Annexure &#x27;&#x27;A&quot; to communication dated 19.09.2022 addressed to the
petitioner by the respondent No.2 shows that advertising boards, of
petitioner are rejected since those are installed on foot-over-bridges and
fly-over-bridges and therefore, non-eligible as hoardings. This court does
not possess expertise to decide whether subject advertisements are
categorized as hoardings or gantries.
</p>

<p id="p_41">33.          At this stage, it is necessary to refer to the observations of
the Supreme Court in the matter of N.G. Projects Limited Vs. Vinod
Kumar Jain and others (2022) 6 SCC 127, in para. No.23, that reads
thus :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">             &quot;..... The Court does not have the expertise to examine
             the terms and conditions of the present day economic
             activities of the State and this limitation should be kept
             in view. Courts should be even more reluctant in
             interfering with contracts involving technical issues as
             there is a requirement of the necessary expertise to
             adjudicate upon such issues. The approach of the Court
             should be not to find fault with magnifying glass in its
             hands, rather the Court should examine as to whether

observed thus :-

            terms and conditions, the perspective is completely
            different and such an exercise, as can be taken recourse
            to in interpreting a statute, would be impermissible.
            Terms and conditions of a tender fall for consideration
            and the need arises for the Court to understand what is
            meant by a particular clause or what is the requirement
            of a particular clause in such tender, the tendering
            authority&#x27;s version has to be heard by the Court. If such
            version of what it intended by inserting the relevant
            clause appears to the Court not to be manifestly unfair,
            utterly unreasonable, totally arbitrary, or thoroughly
            unjust, the Court cannot substitute its view of what
            would have been a better course for the tendering
            authority to follow to achieve the object of the tender.
            Deference to the view of the tendering authority by the
            Courts is the general rule.&quot;

<p id="p_43">35.         Applying the aforesaid principles of law, we do not find
convincing material on record to dislodge decision of scrutiny committee
of respondent no. 2 regarding nature of Advertisement boards of
petitioner. The author of the tender is the best judge regarding his
requirements. The interpretation adopted by the author of the tender
will prevail, even when two views are possible. The court cannot
substitute its opinion with the opinion of the authority in the matter of
interpretation of terms and conditions and in this case, the nature of

concerned with the due adherence to the decision making process and
may not sit in appeal over the decision of the authorities over the nature
of advertisements.

is no merit in the writ petition. Hence, the same is dismissed without any
orders as to costs.

the interim orders passed earlier are continued for a period of two weeks
