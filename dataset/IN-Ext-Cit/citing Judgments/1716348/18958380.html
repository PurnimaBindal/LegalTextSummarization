                     Brief statement of the reasons for the decision:­

1.</pre><p id="p_1"> The complainant Mr. H.S. Toki, the then Income Tax Officer filed the present 

   complaint against the accused for the offences u/s 276D and 277 of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_3">Income 

   Tax Act</a>, 1961 (hereinafter to be referred as the Act). 


</p><p id="p_2">2. The short facts of the case are that accused filed the return of income for the 

   assessment  year 1992­93   on  18.08.92   declaring   an   income   of  Rs.40,950/­. 

   The   assessment   was,   however,   completed   u/s   143(3)   of   the   Act   on   total 

   income of Rs.8,90,351/­. 
</p>
<p id="p_3">           The   addition   of   Rs.77,337/­   was   made   to   the   returned   income   on 



ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                       1 of 11
    account of inflation of purchases. The assessing officer observed that there 

   was excess purchase of Rs.73,469/­ shown from M/s Goverdhana Traders, in 

   as much as, the accused had shown purchases from the said party at Rs.

   9,43,019.40 whereas in the books of the said party as per the copy of the 

   account   received,   the   purchase   were   at   Rs.8,69,580.73   only.   Again   it   was 

   observed that the accused had shown excess purchase of Rs.4,368/­ from M/s 

   Raja Ram Ajay Kumar, the accused has shown the purchase from the said 

   party at Rs.1,16,251 while the books of the said party reflects Rs.1,01,883/­.

</p><p id="p_4">            The addition of Rs.7,61,937/­ was added to the returned income of Rs.

   7,61,937/­   on   account   of   unexplained   cash   deposits   in   bank   account.   The 

   assessing  officer obtained  copy of bank statement from  Bank of  Baroda  in 

   which   he   observed   that   there   were   cash   deposits   in   the   Bank   Account   on 

   different dates during the period from 01.07.91 to 31.03.92 amounting to Rs.

   7,71,937/­. As no explanation was filed, the assessing offer treated these bank 

   deposits as unexplained and added the same to the total income. Accordingly, 

   a demand of Rs.8,06,193/­ was raised and notice u/s 156 of the Act was issued 

   to the accused to deposit the said amount but she failed to do so. Hence, 

   present complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3. Accused   was   summoned.   Copies   of   complaint   and   of   documents   were 

   supplied. After pre­charge evidence, a charge for the offence punishable u/s 

   276B   and   277   of   the   Act   was   framed   against   the   accused   to   which   she 

   pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. However, during the course of arguments, 

   it was pointed out that charge has been framed u/s 276D IT Act, though it 



ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                          2 of 11
    should have been framed u/s 276<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_4">B of IT Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">4. In order to substantiate the allegations against the accused, the prosecution 

   examined the complainant Sh. H.S. Toki as PW1 and Sh. S.N. Gupta the then 

   ITO, as PW2. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">           PW1   Sh.   H.S.   Toki   was   the   complainant   who   filed   the   present 

   complaint, deposed that he was posted in Ward 66 New Delhi in the month of 

   August, 1999 to August, 2001. He issued notice to the accused for making 

   payment of the outstanding demand as a result of assessment Ex.PW1/A. He 

   also proved on record copy of notice issued u/s 272 of the Act Ex.PW1/B. He 

   also   deposed   that   CIT   Delhi   V   issued   authorization   u/s   279(1)   of   the   Act 

   authorizing him to file the present complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_10">           PW2 Sh. S.N. Gupta also deposed that during the period September, 

   1997   to   March,   1999   he   was   posted   in   the   Ward   no.6   as   ITO.   During   his 

   tenure, he issued the notice u/s 221 and another notice u/s 131 of the Act to 

   the accused which is Ex.PW2/1. The witness also stated that he recorded the 

   statement   of   accused   in   which   she   refused   to   have   any   bank   account. 

   However,   on   inquiry,   it   was   revealed   that   accused   was   having   two   bank 

   accounts  in   her  name,  one   saving     account  no.2324   with   Bank  of  Baroda, 

   Jawahar Nagar, Delhi and another account no.18072 with Bank of Rajasthan, 

   Alipur Road, Delhi and proved statement of account Ex.PW2/2 pertaining to 

   Bank of of Rajasthan. Both witnesses were cross examined at length on behalf 

   of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><p id="p_12">5. Statement of accused was recorded u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_5">Cr.P.C</a>. In his statement, accused 

ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                            3 of 11
    admitted filing of her tax return as well as receipt of notice. However, rest of the 

   allegations have been denied by the accused stating that books of accounts 

   were not in in his possession and therefore, she could not produce the same. 

   Accused also stated that she did not make any false statement as alleged. Her 

   statement   recorded   by   PW2,   was   in   relation   to   the   account   of   Ridhi 

   Enterprises existing in the year 1992­98. She further stated that account in 

   Bank   of   Baroda   was   non­operative   much   prior   to   her   statement   and 

   instructions were given for closing the said account. She further submits that 

   account of Bank of Rajasthan primarily does not contain her funds  and it was 

   her mother's fund and the account was not in existence at the relevant time.

</p><p id="p_13">           In   support   of   her   claim   and   contentions,   accused   examined   two 

   witnesses i.e Sh. Gajender Sharma, Sr. Manager from Bank of Rajasthan as 

   DW1 and Sh. G.S. Verma, computer operator from Bank of Baroda, as DW2.

</p><p id="p_14">           From the statement of DW1, it appears that no such account no. 18072 

   as alleged by PW2, exists in the exclusive name of accused in the said bank. 

   DW1 proved on record copy of account opening form Ex.DW1/DB pertaining to 

   account no.15943 and stated that said account is a joint account in the name 

   of Renu Kalra and Smt. Laxmi Devi who is the primary account holder. The 

   witness   further   stated   that   as   per   the   banking   rules,   the   primary   account 

   holder is the owner of the account but secondary account holder i.e accused 

   can also handle the account.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           DW2 stated that account no.2324 stands in the name of accused. He 

   further stated that a minimum balance of Rs.200/­ is required for having an 

   operational account. As per copy of the statement of account, the last balance 

ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                          4 of 11
    was Rs.1.90., in view of the same, account no.2324 is not operational since 

   27.09.94.

   behalf   of   parties   and   gone   through   the   records/written   arguments   filed   on 

   behalf of parties. I have also considered the relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_6">Income

</pre><p id="p_19">8. Since, entire evidence is led to prove the offence u/s 276D and 277 of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_7">IT Act</a> 

   and no prejudice is going to be caused to either of party, hence charge u/s 

   276­B ordered to be read u/s 276D of IT Act.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
A) The   relevant   provisions   of   <a href="/doc/1908230/" id="a_8">section   276D</a>   as   well   as   277   of   the   Act   is 



ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                          5 of 11
    reproduced as below:­  

       [276D. Failure to produce accounts and documents.­ If a person willfully fails 
       to produce, or cause to be produced, on or before the date specified in any notice 
       served   on   him   under   sub­section   (1)   of   <a href="/doc/511102/" id="a_9">section   142</a>,   such   accounts   and 
       documents   as   are   referred   to   in   the   notice,   or   willfully   fails   to   comply   with   a 
       direction   issued   to   him   under   sub­section   (2A)   of   that   section,   he   shall   be 
       punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or 
       with fine equal to a sum calculated at a rate which shall not be less than four 
       rupees or more than ten rupees for every day during which the default continues, 
       or with both.] 

       [277. False statement in verification, etc. ­ If a person makes a statement in any 
       verification   under   this   Act   or   under   any   rule   made   thereunder,   or   delivers   an 
       account or statement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be 
       false, or does not believe to be rue, he shall be punishable, ­
            i. in a case where the amount of tax, which would have been evaded if the 
                 statement or account had been accepted as true, exceeds one hundred 
                 thousand rupees, with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be 
                 less than six months but which may extend to seven years and with fine;
            ii. in any other case, with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not 
                 be less than three months but which may extend to three years and with 
                 fine]


B) It is alleged in the complaint that the accused has willfully failed to produce the 

   relevant documents. Accused denied this fact in her statement stating that she 

   could not produce the relevant record before the assessing officer as same 

   were   not   in   her   possession.   This   fact   was   also   communicated   to   the 

   complainant   vide   reply   Ex.PW1/D1.   In   his   cross   examination,   PW1   also 

   admitted   that   accused   had   shown   her   inability   regarding   non­production   of 

   books of accounts as the same were not in her possession.   Thus, he was 

   duty   bound   to   inquire   the   matter   further   and   to   issue   notice   to   the   person 

   concerned to produce the documents. But he failed to do so. Thus,  it can be 

   safely   held   that   accused   can   be   held   responsible   for   non­production   of 

   relevant record intentionally and willfully.
</p>
<p id="p_21">ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                                                     6 of 11
            However, case u/s 277 of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">IT Act</a> is clearly made out against the accused 

   from   her   own   witness.   Witness   DW1   proved   the   bank   account   in   the   joint 

   name of accused and Smt. Laxmi Devi. He admitted in his cross examination 

   that amount in bank account no.18072 could be withdrawn by any of them. He 

   further admitted that money in joint account belong both of account holder. 

   Thus,   it   stands   proved   that   accused   made   out   a   false   statement   before 

   competent authority that she has no bank account in her name. Her defence 

   that   her   statement   was   qua   the   period   of   assessment   is   baseless   as   the 

   statement was recorded in relation to her source of income and tax evasion 

   and the bank account was in operation at the relevant period.


C) Before discussion the case on merit, it would be appropriate to see whether 

   the   present   complaint   is   filed   after   obtaining   a   proper   and   valid   sanction. 

   Learned   defence   counsel   vehemently   argued   that   present   complaint   is   not 

   maintainable as the authorization dated 18.01.01 is not a valid authorization in 

   the eyes of law. CIT had accorded sanction in a routine manner without going 

   through the entire records. Sanction was obtained by the complainant without 

   disclosing   true   fact.   It   is   further   argued   that   any   case   instituted   without   a 

   proper   sanction   must   fail   because   this   being   a   manifest   defect   in   the 

   prosecution, the entire proceedings are rendered void ab initio. In support of 

   claim   and   contentions,   reliance   has   been   placed   upon   the   judgments 

   mentioned   (supra)   in   the   table   at   sl.   no.   10   to   16.   It   is   also   argued   that 

   authorization dated 18.01.01 has not been proved on record by the witnesses 

   examined nor the prosecution has examined Mr. RK Singh, the then CIT, who 


ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                                   7 of 11
    accorded sanction. Even none of the original documents were produced by the 

   complainant on record. Mere bald allegation is not sufficient to prove the case 

   against the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
D) These plea of the accused appears to have force. In the complaint as well as 

   authorization letter and show cause notice, it has been mentioned that that the 

   assessment order was passed on 24.05.95. But no assessment order of such 

   date is on record. Even PW1 and PW2 has failed to depose on which date the 

   assessment   order   was   passed.   However,   from   bare   perusal   of   record,   it 

   appears   that   original   assessment   order   was   passed   on   24.03.95.   It   is 

   necessary for the prosecution to prove that a valid sanction had been granted 

   by the sanctioning authority after it was satisfied that a case of sanction had 

   been   made  out constituting   the  offence.  Reliance   may  be   placed   upon  the 

   judgments reported in "AIR 1979 SC 677 titled as <a href="/doc/1315447/" id="a_11">Mohd. Iqbal Ahmed vs. 

   State of Andhra Pradesh</a>". Relevant para of the judgments is re­produced for 

   ready reference:­

            "Incumbent   on   the   prosecution   to   prove   that   a   valid   sanction   had   been 
            granted by the sanctioning authority after it was satisfied that a case for 
            sanction had been made out constituting the offence. This should be done 
            in   two   ways:   either   (1)   by   producing   the   original   sanction   which   itself 
            contains the facts constituting the offence and the grounds of satisfaction or 
            (2)   by   adducing   evidence   aliunde   to   show   the   facts   placed   before   the 
            sanctioning   authority   and   the   satisfaction   arrived   at   by   it.   Any   case 
            instituted without a proper sanction must fail because this being a manifest 
            defect in the prosecution, the entire proceedings are rendered void ab initio. 
            What the court has to see is whether or not the sanction authority at the 
            time of giving sanction was aware of the facts constituting the offence and

            existence after the grant of sanction without wholly irrelevant. The grant of 
            sanction is not an idle formality or an acrimonious exercise but a solemn 
            and sacrosanct act which affords protection to the person against frivolous

             prosecutions   and   must   therefore,   be   strictly   complied   with   before   any 
            prosecution can be launched against the person concerned"


E) The present complaint has been filed by the complainant alleging that accused 

   willfully failed to produce the relevant records and concealed the true income 

   by   raising   inflation   of   purchases.   Accordingly,   considering   the   facts   and 

   circumstance, assessment order dated 24.05.95 was passed tax  demand of 

   Rs.8,06,193/­   was   raised.   As   per   complaint,   accused   challenged   the   tax 

   demand   so   raised   before   the   CIT.   CIT(A)­   XII   dismissed   the   said   appeal. 

   Thereafter,   accused   preferred   an   appeal   before   the   learned   ITAT   wherein 

   assessment   order   was   set   aside   by   the   learned   ITAT   vide   order   dated 

   28.01.2000, directing the assessing officer for passing fresh order after giving 

   reasonable opportunity to the assessee. Thereafter, at the fag end of the case, 

   complainant has filed copy of fresh assessment order which was passed on 

   28.03.02 assessing total income at Rs.8,90,351/­. 

</p><p id="p_23">           From the statement of PW1, it is clear that assessment order on the 

   basis of which present complaint was filed, was set aside by the learned ITAT. 

   In his cross examination, PW1 has clearly admitted that he was aware the 

   status of the assessment order at the time of filing of the present complaint. 

   He also admitted that the assessment order has been set aside by the learned 

   ITAT at the time of filing of the present complaint. There is no mention in the 

   authorization/sanction regarding setting aside of assessment order in dispute. 

   It appears from the cross examination of PW1, that at the time of obtaining 

   authorization/sanction, aforesaid fact was never brought to the notice of CIT 

   who accorded sanction for launching prosecution against the accused by the 


ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                                      9 of 11
    complainant for the reason best known to him. Had this fact was brought to the 

   notice   of the  concerned  CIT,  the  complainant  might  have   not  been  able  to 

   obtain sanction/authorization at that time in view of the order of learned ITAT. 

   Furthermore,   it   appears   from   the   record   that   while   obtaining   the   sanction, 

   either assessment order dated 24.03.95 and notice Ex.PW1/A were not put 

   before sanctioning authority or the sanction was accorded without application 

   of  mind   in  routine   manner.  Had   it not  been   so,  there   would   have  been   no 

   question  of error  in  date  of  assessment order in  sanction  order as  well  as 

   notice for payment. It appears that, the complainant was in a hurry to file the 

   present complaint after obtaining the sanction without disclosing the true facts. 

   Had the complainant had disclosed the true facts before the sanction authority 

   at   the   time   of   according   sanction,   the   fate   of   the   case   would   have   been 

   different.

<p id="p_24">
F) In   view   of   the   aforesaid   discussions,   it   is   clear   that   the   complainant   had 

   concealed the true fact before the court as well as before the concerned CIT 

   who accorded sanction and filed the present complaint after obtaining sanction 

   which appears to have been passed in a very mechanical manner. It is well 

   settled   law   that   if,  a   litigant   who   comes   to   the   court   and   withholds   a   vital 

   document or suppresses material facts in order to get an advantage in the 

   case can be summarily thrown out at any state of litigation. Reliance may be 

   placed on the judgment reported in "<a href="/doc/151053644/" id="a_12">Bharat Heavy Electrical Ltd. &amp; Ors vs 

   D.K. Sardana</a> 2010(2) LRC 194 (Del)". Relevant portion of the judgment is re­

   produced below:­


ITO vs Renu Kalra                                                                                 10 of 11
</p><p id="p_25">                8.   At   the   outset,   it   must   be   submitted   that   a   person   who   is   invoking   the 
               jurisdiction of the Court whether civil or criminal must come to the temple of 
               justice with clean hands. In the civil cases, the Hon'ble Supreme Court ion 
               case titled Chengalvaraya Naidu (dead) by LR's vs Jagannath (dead) by LR's 
               &amp; Ors. AIR 1994 SC 853 has categorically laid that fraud or concealment of 
               facts   by   a   party   at   whatever   stage   it   is   detected   will   vitiated   the   entire 
               proceedings. Similarly, on the criminal side also in case titled <a href="/doc/1716348/" id="a_13">MCD v. State of 
               Delhi &amp; Anr</a>. 2005 SCC (Crl.) 1322 while dealing with the question of release 
               of an accused under Section 4 of the Probation of Offender's Act, 1960 the 
               Apex Court has held that a litigant who comes to the  Court and withholds a 
               vital document or suppresses the material facts in order to get an advantage 
               in   the   case   can   be   summarily   thrown   out   at   any   stage.   It   was   in   this 
               background that the Apex Court observed that anybody who plays fraud on 
               the Court can be summarily thrown out and would not be granted any relief.


G) In   view  of  the  foregoing  discussions,  facts  and  circumstances  and  law  laid 

    down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and Hon'ble High Court, it is held that the 

    present complaint is not maintainable being filed without obtaining proper and 

    valid sanction. Consequently, complaint is dismissed. Accused is acquitted of 

    charges leveled against her. However, bail bonds of accused already on record 

    is extended in terms of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_14">section 437A</a> for a period of six months. Case property 

    be confiscated to the state and file be consigned to record room.
