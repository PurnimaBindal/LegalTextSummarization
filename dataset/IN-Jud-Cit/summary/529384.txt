The respondent, Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories, is a firm that carries on business at Ernakulam under the same name and style as the Trade Mark 'Navratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories'.
In October 1946, the founder of the firm, Dr Sarvothama Rao, applied for the registration of the words 'Navaratna Kalpa' as a Trade Mark for his medicinal preparations.
The appellant moved the Registrar of Trade Marks to remove the trade mark 'Navaratna' and the word 'Navaratna' from the respondent's mark, alleging that the defendant was passing off his goods as those of the plaintiff.
The plaintiff was granted a decree for an injunction confined to the trade mark 'Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories'.
Whether the respondent's claim to the exclusive use of the Trade Mark 'Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories' is valid.
The appeals are dismissed with costs - one set of hearing fee.
The mark 'Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories' had, by user, acquired distinctiveness in the sense of indicating the respondent and the respondent alone as the manufacturer of goods bearing that mark.
The appellant's mark was found to be deceptively similar to the respondent's mark.
The Court did not entertain the argument that this was a case of honest concurrent user within Section 10(2) of the Act as it was not raised in any of the lower courts.
