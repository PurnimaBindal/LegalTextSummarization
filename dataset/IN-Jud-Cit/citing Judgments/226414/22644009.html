BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J

1.           This is a suit for permanent injunction and damages for

disparagement and unfair trade practices.             The plaintiff and the

defendant are competitors. The plaintiff is aggrieved by the defendant's

advertisement on television, which allegedly disparages the plaintiff‟s

soap sold under the trade mark "DETTOL".                   The defendant's

advertisement is for promotion of its soap " LIFEBUOY".




CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                      Page No.1 of 56
 Reliefs sought by the plaintiff:

2.          The plaintiff has prayed that the defendant be restrained by a

permanent injunction from (i) issuing or telecasting the impugned

advertisement, or in any other manner disparaging the goodwill and

reputation of the plaintiff and its product sold under the trade mark

DETTOL, in any other advertisements and in all media whatsoever

including the electronic media; (2) using the depiction of the plaintiff's

soap or any other soap deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff's in its

advertisement or in any other manner disparaging the goodwill and

reputation of the plaintiff and its product sold under the trade mark

DETTOL; (3) using any other indicia whatsoever to associate

with/depict the plaintiff or its products in its advertisements issued in

any and all media whatsoever including the electronic media. The

plaintiff also seeks damages to the extent of Rs 20,00,050/- for

disparagement, denigration and tarnishment of its goodwill and

reputation by the defendant by its impugned advertisement.

Additionally, the plaintiff has also prayed for punitive and exemplary

damages against the defendant as well as for costs of the suit.



The Plaint:

3.          It is stated in the plaint that the plaintiff has been involved in

the manufacture of the famous antiseptic disinfectant under the trade

mark DETTOL, for over 70 years and that the mark DETTOL has

become synonymous with good hygiene and, today, it is a household

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                      Page No.2 of 56
 name and is the most widely used antiseptic disinfectant in the country.

It is stated in the plaint that the history of DETTOL dates back to the

year 1929 when the DETTOL antiseptic liquid was developed. It is

alleged, that as an antiseptic germ disinfectant, DETTOL has an

unparalleled reputation in the medical profession. It is also averred that

DETTOL has continuously evolved to meet modern day demands, and

now incorporates a range of innovative antiseptic, disinfectant and

cleaning products ranging from antiseptic liquid, hand wash and the

DETTOL toilet soap which has been manufactured and sold by the

plaintiff continuously since 1981.



4.          It is further stated in the plaint that the present action concerns

the alleged intentional and deliberate disparagement by the defendant of the

plaintiff's DETTOL toilet soap which is identified by the members of the

trade and public by its colour and its new modern, distinctive and unique

shape, a representation of which is as under:-




                   [Front view of DETTOL Original soap]

It is stated that on the front of the soap the trade mark "DETTOL" and the

sword devise is clearly visible.     The plaintiff contended that the consumers

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.3 of 56
 recognise the plaintiff's product by the colour and distinctive shape of the

soap.



5.          It is further alleged that the DETTOL toilet soap, when packed,

is also identified by its distinctive green coloured packaging.                 A

representation of the plaintiff's product packaging is as below:-




              [Photograph of the wrapper of Dettol Original soap]



6.          It is further stated in the plaint that in 1981 the DETTOL soap

was launched as an orange coloured bar and rectangular in shape without

any curves. The present shape with the curved edges and the curvature in

the middle was adopted by the plaintiff on or about May, 2006. The new

improved DETTOL soap has an all new modern shape with curved edges

and a distinctive curvature in the middle which helps consumers easily

identify and distinguish the product from other products. It is averred that

while there are other orange coloured soaps in the market, the plaintiff's soap

is the only one with the distinctive shape, as indicated above. It is also

stated that the new improved DETTOL soap has three variants available in


CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                    Page No.4 of 56
 the market. One being the said DETTOL Original and the two others being

DETTOL Skincare, a white soap, and DETTOL Cool, a blue soap. As per

the plaint, out of the three variants, the DETTOL Original bar of soap ,which

has an orange colour, is the most popular. According to the plaint, the sale

of DETTOL Original constitues 80% of the total DETTOL soap sales.



7.           The plaintiff has further stated that the packaging of the soap has

always been of the distinctive green and white colour combination and the

packaging has become synonymous with the famous DETTOL brand of the

plaintiff.   It is alleged that the purchasing public perceives the orange

coloured bar with its distinctive shape and the distinctive green and white

packaging to be synonymous with the DETTOL Original soap. It is alleged

that the plaintiff has been continuously and uninterruptedly marketing its

DETTOL products with the distinctive packaging consisting of the green

and white colour combination including sword device in India since the year

1933.



8.           The plaintiff has further stated in the plaint that it had recently

announced in a press release that it is contemplating to introduce new

variants of its flagship brand DETTOL and it launched a new ad campaign --

"Surakshit Parivar" -- to create awareness of the practice of hygiene at the

family level. The plaintiff has allocated a budged of about Rs 5 crores for

the aforementioned programme. It is also stated that by virtue of extensive

sales and sales promotion activities, the orange coloured DETTOL soap, its

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.5 of 56
 new curved shape along with the distinctive green and white packaging is

associated exclusively with the Plaintiff.



9.          It is alleged that the plaintiff was shocked when it was recently

brought to its attention that the defendant has introduced an advertisement

on television, which intentionally and deliberately disparages the soap of the

plaintiff sold under the trade mark DETTOL and the unique and distinctive

packaging described above. The defendant's said advertisement is for its

LIFEBUOY soap. The plaintiff alleges that a bare viewing of the said

advertisement would be sufficient to convince this Court of the malicious

intention of the defendant to increase the market share of its LIFEBUOY

soap by tarnishing the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff's soap i.e.

DETTOL Original Soap.



10.         It is alleged that the soap which has been disparaged in the

impugned advertisement is virtually identical to the plaintiff's product. The

contours and the curvature in the middle on the toilet soap in the defendant's

advertisement is virtually identical to the contours of the plaintiff's DETTOL

Original soap. The only difference being that the name of the plaintiff's

product and the logo are not shown in the advertisement. The colour of the

soap in the defendant's advertisement is also virtually identical to that of the

DETTOL Original soap of the plaintiff. The packaging of the toilet soap

used in the defendant's advertisement is also similar to the packaging of the

plaintiff's said soap. It is alleged that from the above, it is apparent that the

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                    Page No.6 of 56
 soap featuring in the defendant's advertisement is designed to give an

impression to the buyers that the offending soap is the plaintiff's DETTOL

Original soap. The advertisement then, allegedly, proceeds to disparage the

soap in the following manner:-

(i)         The advertisement begins with a couple returning home after

getting wet in the rain. The wife then proceeds to take a new soap to go and

have a bath. The green coloured packaging, the orange coloured soap and

the distinctive DETTOL shape is clearly visible in the advertisement. The

intention of this scene is to convey to the audience that the offending soap

pertains to an established soap i.e., DETTOL Original soap presently being

used by the family.

(ii)        The next frame shows the husband, a medical doctor, and the

children telling the lady of the house not to use the soap and the vocals state:

        "Oh God bachaa lena naadaan ko aql dena....Hum sab ko
        bachaa lena".

It is alleged that the use of a doctor protagonist is once again relevant as

DETTOL is an established brand in the medical profession.

(iii)         The next frame shows the doctor husband explaining to the

wife the reason as to why she should not use the offending soap and, instead,

should use the Defendant's LIFEBUOY soap by stating that normal

antiseptic soaps make the skin dry leading to cracks in the skin thereby

permitting the germs to enter the cracks in the skin while the defendant's

soap fights germs and keeps the skin protected. According to the plaintiff

this scene is clearly intended to give out the message that the Plaintiff's soap


CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.7 of 56
 is not effective against fighting germs whereas the Defendant's soap is

effective against fighting germs. The words used in the advertisement are:-

       "Dua ki zarurat padegi is dawa ke saath. Aam antiseptic
       sabun twacha ko rukha kar dete hai jis se dararon mein kitanu
       ghus jaate hain...isi liye naya Lifebuoy skin guard jo kare
       kitanuon per waar aur banaye suraksha ki bhi deevar."

According to the plaintiff it is relevant to mention that as DETTOL is used

in respect of an extremely well known brand of antiseptic liquid, the use of

the term "dawa" (medicine) is clearly intended to draw the attention of the

viewer to the Plaintiff's product.

(iv)        In the next frame the lady is then shown to go and have a bath

with the Defendant's soap and come out very satisfied with the same.

According to the plaintiff, this falsely indicates that the defendant's soap is

effective against fighting germs while the plaintiff's DETTOL soap is not.



11.         It is further alleged by the plaintiff that the defendant's said

advertisement is nothing but a slanderous attempt of the defendant to

increase the market share of its LIFEBUOY soap by defaming and

disparaging the worth and reputation of the plaintiff's product. It is also

alleged that the said advertisement outreaches the limits of allowed

competitive advertising and blatantly denigrates the reputation and goodwill

of the plaintiff's well established and leading brand. The said advertisement

not only shows that the defendant's product is good but also very clearly

depicts that the plaintiff's product is completely worthless. Consequently,

the said advertisement amounts to disparaging, denigrating and defaming the


CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                  Page No.8 of 56
 products of the plaintiff. It is also alleged that the use of the soap bar

including its unique curved shape and the distinctive packaging which is

virtually identical to that of the plaintiff's by the defendant is resulting in

dilution and debasement of the hard earned reputation and goodwill of the

plaintiff's world-known and widely used products.



12.         The plaintiff has further averred that the defendant had also filed

a caveat dated 16.7.2007 which clearly indicates the defendant's mala fide

intentions as against the product of the plaintiff inasmuch the defendant was

aware that the soap depicted in its advertisement is the plaintiff's soap and

also knew that the plaintiff would initiate action against it and hence they

filed a caveat. It is alleged that the cause of action first accrued to the

plaintiff in or around July 2007, when they first came to know of the

impugned advertisement of the defendant and that the cause of action is a

continuing one.     The said advertisement is being telecast on various

television channels in Delhi and is being watched by thousands of people in

Delhi. The present suit has been filed for the reliefs indicated above in these

circumstances.



The Written Statement:

13.         The defendant in its written statement raised preliminary

objections. The first objection was that the jurisdiction of this Court is

specifically excluded under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908

(hereinafter referred to as the 'CPC') in respect of the present suit, being a

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                  Page No.9 of 56
 Suit for Permanent Injunction and Damages for Disparagement and Unfair

Trade Practices, which is specifically covered under the provisions of the

Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred

to as the 'MRTP Act') and the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_1">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986.



14.         It has also been alleged by the defendant that the plaintiff's suit is

misconceived as no cause of action against the defendant has accrued in

favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant inasmuch as the

advertisement, in question, refers to ordinary antiseptic soaps and the

plaintiff's soap is neither an antiseptic soap, nor an ordinary (unbranded)

soap. A reference was also made to a decision of this Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1678823/" id="a_2">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Limited v. Naga Limited &amp; Others</a>: 2003 (26)

PTC 535 (Del.), wherein it was allegedly held that the plaintiff's soap is not

an antiseptic soap. The defendant has also taken the objection that the

plaintiff's suit deserves to be dismissed as not maintainable as the plaintiff

does not have a monopoly over the colour or over the shape of the soap and

cannot claim exclusivity over the colour, shape or packaging of the soap. It

has also been alleged that the defendant further believes that the shape,

contours and curvatures of the plaintiff's orange coloured soap DETTOL is

not registered under the Design's Act to give the plaintiff an exclusive right

to use the same.     The defendant has also alleged that the plaintiff has

approached this Court with unclean hands and is guilty of suppression of

material facts.



CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                    Page No.10 of 56
 15.         Apart from the said preliminary objections, the defendant has

taken the stand that it is engaged in the marketing of several toilet soaps

including the toilet soaps being sold and marketed under the brand name

"LIFEBUOY" and that its product, LIFEBUOY soap, through an extensive

marketing network across the country and its intrinsic quality, enjoys

considerable goodwill and reputation among the Indian consumers. It is

stated that LIFEBUOY is a global brand, which was launched in the United

Kingdom in 1894 as a product for personal hygiene and that it is India's

oldest toilet soap brand and has been synonymous with health and hygiene

in India since 1895. It is alleged by the defendant that the said product sold

under the brand name LIFEBUOY for over 110 years has acquired

substantial goodwill in the market and, in fact, has become a household

name.    It is alleged that the defendant's soap has been associated with

hygiene and protection against germs long before the plaintiff was

incorporated or even started manufacturing or marketing their soap.



16.         With regard to the allegations of disparagement, the defendant

submitted that the intent of the defendant's advertisement is not to disparage

the product of the plaintiff but rather aims at educating the consumers and

public at large to understand the difference between toilet soaps containing

glycerine, which have a moisturizing effect on the skin and give a long term

benefit, on the one hand and ordinary antiseptic soaps in the market, on the

other, which may not contain glycerine and do not give to the consumers the

benefit of moisturizing the skin and removing the possibility of formation of

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.11 of 56
 cracks which is a breeding ground for germs. It is further stated that the

defendant's claims about its soap being better than any other ordinary

antiseptic soap is based on the laboratory test conducted by it.



17.         The defendant submitted that the said TV advertisement has to be

seen in its totality and cannot be seen in an isolated and unnatural manner

frame by frame. It is further contended on behalf of the defendant that the

intent, manner and story line and message of the defendant's advertisement

is that its soap is better than ordinary antiseptic soaps because it is rich in

glycerine and vitamin E.    It is further stated that the plaintiff's soap, being a

Rs 200 crore brand, cannot be termed as an ordinary soap and in any event,

the plaintiff's soap is not an antiseptic soap. In the entire advertisement,

there is no reference whatsoever to the trademark DETTOL or the sword

device and, therefore, there is no reference to the plaintiff's product.



18.         In the written statement, the defendant has further stated that the

soap appearing in the defendant's advertisement is not the plaintiff's soap,

inter alia, for the following reasons:-

       (a) The colour of the soap shown in defendant's advertisement

       is yellow in comparison to the plaintiff's orange soap;

       (b) The soap shown in defendant's advertisement is taken out

       of a pale green single-colour packaging, whereas the plaintiff's

       DETTOL TOTAL is sold in green and white and its other

       variants are sold in blue and white packaging;

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                    Page No.12 of 56
        (c) There are many other soaps in the market with curvatures

       and contours similar to the plaintiff's soap.

       (d) The brand name DETTOL and/or the Sword device are

       embossed on all the plaintiff's products but the same are

       admittedly missing from the soap shown in the defendant's

       advertisement.



19.         The defendant has also stated that without prejudice to the above,

even assuming, without admitting, that the soap shown in the defendant's

advertisement was that of the plaintiff, still it is settled law that a tradesman

is entitled to declare his goods to be the best in the world, even though the

declaration may be untrue. He can also say that his goods are better than his

competitors; even though such statement may be untrue.            And, for the

purpose of saying that his goods are the best in the world or his goods are

better than his competitors he can even spell out the advantages of his goods

over the goods of others. It is alleged that the plaintiff itself has been

showing its soap to be better than that of the defendant's in its various

advertisements, both in India and abroad. The written statement contains

further detailed statements countering the allegations made in the plaint.

However, the sum and substance of the defendant's case is clear from what

has been noticed above.




CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.13 of 56
 Documents &amp; Witnesses:

20.          The plaintiff has filed several documents being Ext. PW1/1 to

PW1/19 and PW1/DX1. The defendant has filed Ext. DW1/1 to DW1/18

and DW2/1 to DW2/9. The video clip of the advertisement has been filed in

a CD and is marked as Ext. PW1/2. The plaintiff had produced one witness

- Mr Mohit Marwah, Brand Manager (Dettol) of the plaintiff company as

PW1. The defendant has produced three witnesses - (1) Mr Anuj Kumar

Rustagi, Global Marketing Manager, Lifebuoy Soaps (DW1); (2) Dr Rajan

Raghavachari, Regional Senior Product Development Manager of the

defendant (DW2) and (3) Dr Hemangi Jerajani, Dermatologist (DW3). The

evidence of these witnesses were in the form of affidavits in the first

instance and they were subjected to cross-examination by the opposing

counsel.



The Issues:

The following issues have been framed by virtue of the order dated

17.8.2007:-

       "1.    Whether the depiction in the advertisement of the

              plaintiff? (OPP)

              denigrates the soap of the plaintiff? (OPP)

       3.     Whether the impugned advertisement seeks only to
              promote the superiority of the defendant LIFEBUOY
              soap over an ordinary antiseptic soap? (OPD)

       4.     Whether the plaintiff is guilty of suppression of material

        5.     Whether the impugned advertisement constitutes an
              attack on the goodwill and reputation of the Dettol brand
              of the plaintiff? (OPP)

       6.     Whether the present suit is barred on account of the

              reputation? If so, the extent thereof? (OPP)

       8.     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to punitive and
              exemplary damages? If so, the extent thereof ? (OPP)

       Issue No.1: Whether the depiction in the advertisement of the
                   defendant     of a soap refers to the Dettol soap of the
                   plaintiff? (OPP)


21.         The video clip (Ext. PW1/2) of the advertisement in question, as

indicated in the form of a story board, shows:-



1.    A man and his wife returning
      home on a rainy day. The wife
      exclaims "Kya baarish hai"
      (what rain). The man places
      his white coat and stethoscope
      which indicates that he is a
      doctor. He goes and sits with
      his children (boy and girl) on
      the sofa. The children are
      watching a cricket match on
      television.




CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                Page No.15 of 56
 2.    The next frames show that his
      wife plans to take a bath
      saying "chalo main naha leti
      hoon" (come, let me take a
      bath). She is then shown
      taking out an orange bar of
      soap from a green wrapper.




3.    On seeing the orange soap in
      his wife's hand, the husband
      has a shocked look on his face
      and says "Oh God, bachaa
      lena" (Oh God, Save her).



4.    The next frames show the
      husband and children pointing
      at the wife and singing a song
      in chorus "Naadaan ko aql
      dena, ham sab ko bachaa
      lena......" ( show reason to the
      naive, save us all .....).

5.    The wife has a surprised look
      on her face and asks "Kya kar
      rahe ho" (what are you
      doing?).




CS(OS) 1359/2007                         Page No.16 of 56
 6.    The next frames show the
      husband displaying the orange
      soap in his raised right hand
      and looking at his wife and
      saying "Dua ki zarurat padegi
      iss dawaa ke saath" (prayers
      would be required with this
      medicine).

7.    This is followed by a cut to a
      bathing shot where a woman
      is shown using the said orange
      bar of soap. In this cut, there
      is a male voice-over stating:
      "Aam antiseptic sabun twacha
      ko rukha kar dete hain.."
      (Ordinary antiseptic soaps
      make the skin dry..).

8.    Then there is a close-up of the
      upper-arm under a magnifying
      glass which reveals skin with
      cracks and green germs
      lodged in the cracks. At this
      juncture the male voice-over
      states: "..Jis se dararon me
      kitanu ghus jate hain" (.. as a
      result of which, germs get into
      the cracks). Simultaneously,
      the following words appear on
      the bottom left of the screen:-

      "Aam      antiseptic    sabun"
      (ordinary antiseptic soap)

9.    Then there is a cut to a water
      shot, where we see a bar of
      the red LIFEBUOY soap
      emerging out of the water. On
      the top left hand corner of the
      screen, the words "Glycerine"
      and "vitamin E" appear and
      the male voice-over states "Isi
      liye naya Lifebuoy Skin
      Guard" (that is why, new
      Lifebuoy Skin Guard).


CS(OS) 1359/2007                        Page No.17 of 56
 10.   Then there is a cut again
      showing a part of the arm
      under a magnifying glass and
      the green germs are seen
      getting washed away. The
      male voice-over states that :
      ".. jo kare kitanuon pe waar"
      (.. which attacks the germs).

11.   The next frames show a layer
      of glycerine flowing from left
      to right under the magnifying
      glass and the voice-over
      states: ".. aur banaye
      suraksha ki bhi deevar" (..
      and also builds a protective
      wall).

12.   The clip then proceeds to a
      new cut showing the wife,
      apparently after having had a
      bath, coming into the living
      room where the husband and
      children are watching the
      cricket match on television.
      On seeing her they, once
      again break into the same
      song "Bachaa lena" (Save
      us).

13.   The wife stops them and,
      referring to the cricket match
      being shown on TV, says "Aa
      hah, doctor saheb dua inke
      liye bachaa lena" (Aa hah,
      doctor saheb, save the prayers
      for them).




CS(OS) 1359/2007                       Page No.18 of 56
 14.   The next frames show that the
      wife joins her husband and
      children at the sofa and says:
      "Hame koi dar nahin" (we
      have no fear).




15.   The next shot shows the
      LIFEBUOY Skinguard bar of
      soap and its package and the
      LIFEBUOY logo zooms onto
      the package. At this juncture
      the     male      voice-over
      announces: "Naya Lifebuoy
      Skin Guard" (new Lifebuoy
      Skin Guard).

16.   This is followed by a cut to
      the Hindustan Lever Limited
      logo and the advertisement
      ends there.




22.         The question which needs resolution is: whether the orange soap

shown in the advertisement could be said to have a reference to the

DETTOL Original soap of the plaintiff. Ext. PW1/11 are some photographs

extracted from the video clip of the said advertisement.




CS(OS) 1359/2007                                              Page No.19 of 56
         [photographs from Ex. PW1/11 showing the orange soap bar]



They clearly indicate the orange colour of the soap bar , the contours on the

soap, the overall shape of the soap. Ext. PW1/8 is a sample of the DETTOL

soap in the green coloured packaging. The new shape of the DETTOL

Original toilet soap with the curved edges and the curvature in the middle is

clearly displayed on the product packaging, which is further indicative of the

importance given to the shape by the plaintiff in its marketing of the product.

The packaging (Ext. PW1/8) also establishes the fact that although white is

also used, green is the pre-dominant colour. Although, the brand name, logo

or the sword device does not appear in the orange bar of soap shown in the

advertisement (Ext. PW1/2), there can be no misgiving that the bar of soap

which has been shown in the said advertisement is of a colour similar to that

of the plaintiff's DETTOL soap. The contours, curvature as well as the

overall shape of the orange bar of soap in the advertisement itself, are

virtually the same as that of the contours, curvature and overall shape of the

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.20 of 56
 plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original soap. Moreover, the clear impression given in

the advertisement is that the said orange bar of soap has been taken out from

a green wrapper/ packaging. It must also be noted that the design of the

plaintiff‟s soap has been registered by the plaintiff as indicated by Ext.

PW1/DX-1. While it is true that there may be other orange coloured soaps

and other soaps sold in the pre-dominantly green packaging and other soaps

which have an oval shape, it is also true that it is only the plaintiff's soap

which has a combination of all the three elements, i.e., orange colour,

curved oval shape and pre-dominantly green packaging. Apart from this, it

is only the plaintiff's soap which has contours in the manner indicated in the

bar of soap in the said advertisement. No evidence has been produced by

the defendant to show that there is any ordinary antiseptic soap with the

same combination of the aforesaid elements of colour, shape, design and

packaging. I have absolutely no doubt that the orange bar of soap shown in

the advertisement refers to the plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap.



23.         It is true that the plaintiff's soap - DETTOL Original - is not an

antiseptic soap whereas the soap shown in the advertisement has been

referred to as "an ordinary antiseptic soap". An argument was advanced on

the part of the defendant that because of this, the soap shown in the

advertisement did not and could not refer to the plaintiff's soap. The learned

counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the reference to an antiseptic soap in

the said advertisement is, in fact, a further pointer to the plaintiff's product,

although, the plaintiff's soap - DETTOL Original - is not an antiseptic

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.21 of 56
 soap. According to him, this is so because of the well known fact that the

plaintiff's antiseptic liquid product has been utilised for years in homes as

well as in hospitals for various cuts and wounds and other antiseptic

purposes.    The public at large, therefore, carry an impression, right or

wrong, in their minds that all DETTOL products are antiseptic.              The

defendant, being aware of this, has specifically shown an antiseptic soap so

that the viewers of the advertisement shall immediately be directed towards

the plaintiff's DETTOL products.       This, along with the other features

mentioned above, clearly establishes the link between the soap shown in the

advertisement and the plaintiff's soap. I agree with these submissions.



24.         It has been contended on behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff

has not produced any evidence of consumers to indicate that the orange bar

of soap in the said advertisement appears to be the plaintiff's DETTOL

Original soap. In response the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted

that producing such evidence would be counter-productive and is not

necessary. He submitted that the plaintiff could produce witnesses stating

that the orange bar of soap shown in the advertisement had reference to the

plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap.       Similarly, the defendant could also

produce witnesses to state the contrary. Ultimately, it would be for the court

to make a judgment from the perspective of an average person with

imperfect recollection, a test which has been well established, particularly in

passing off cases. Though slander of goods and disparaging advertisements

stand on a slightly different footing to passing off cases, I find myself to be

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.22 of 56
 in agreement with the submissions made by the learned counsel for the

plaintiff. For, ultimately, it is a question of perception and the perception

has to be determined from the stand point of an average person man with

imperfect recollection but, with a corollary, which shall stated be shortly.

One could normally expect that there would be a difference in perception

between two distinct classes of persons --       (1) Persons who are using

DETTOL Original soap and (2) persons who do not use that soap. A person

belonging to the latter category may not be aware of the orange coloured bar

of soap of the plaintiff with its distinctive shape, curvature and contours. He

may also not be aware of the packaging employed by the plaintiff.

Therefore, such a person may not link the bar of soap shown in the

advertisement with the plaintiff's product when he sees the advertisement or

when he comes upon the plaintiff‟s product in a shop. Such a person, in all

likelihood, would      perceive the orange bar of soap shown in the

advertisement as being some unbranded bar of soap. On the other hand, a

person belonging to the former category, being a user of the plaintiff's

DETTOL Original soap, would immediately recognise the bar of soap

shown in the advertisement as referring to the plaintiff's DETTOL Original

soap. This is because, such a person is familiar with the plaintiff's product.

He is "intimately" aware of the look and feel of the soap because he uses it

everyday. He knows its colour, shape, size and contours. The moment, he

sees the bar of soap in the advertisement, he would immediately correlate

the colour, shape, size and contours including the colour of the wrapper/

packaging with that of the soap that he uses everyday, that is, the plaintiff's

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.23 of 56
 DETTOL Original soap. Moreover, it is not as a matter of co-incidence that

all these features of colour, shape, curvature and colour of the packaging

have come together. It has been done deliberately so that it is obvious to

users of the plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap that it is the very soap that

they use everyday which is shown in the advertisement.



25.         Since the advertisement avowedly seeks to attract consumers to

the LIFEBUOY Skinguard soap and away from other computing soaps, it is

obvious that the advertisement targets those persons/consumers who are

currently not using the defendant's product. It is also obvious that persons

who use the plaintiff's products fall within that target group. It is, therefore,

important that the advertisement is looked at from the perspective of

members of that target group i.e., users of the DETTOL Original soap. The

hypothetical average person (with imperfect recollection) must be picked

from this target group of users of the product sought to be slandered or

disparaged. And, this is the corollary spoken of earlier.



26.         The difference in approach in a passing off action and one for

disparagement must also be highlighted.         In a case of passing off, the

question invariably is whether the trade mark or trade dress employed by A

for his product is so deceptively similar to the established mark or trade

dress of B‟s product that A‟s product could be confused by or passed off to

consumers as B‟s product? Here the comparison is of rival products having a

similar trade mark, get-up or trade dress. Familiarity with the established

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.24 of 56
 mark, trade dress or get-up is presumed. Because, it is this familiarity that

the person intending to pass off his goods as those of the famous or more

popular, exploits. In the case of disparagement, the one who disparages

another‟s product, does not seek to make his product similar to the

disparaged product, but to distinguish it from the disparaged product. The

object of disparagement is to make the disparaged product appear to be as

near or similar to the competitor‟s product. The comparisons, therefore, in

cases of passing off and in cases of disparagement are different.

Consequently, the comparison must be from the perspective of an average

person with imperfect recollection but, that person must be picked from the

category of users of the product allegedly sought to be disparaged or

slandered.



27.          Considered from the standpoint of an average man with imperfect

recollection who is also a user of the DETTOL Original soap, the

inescapable conclusion would be that the soap shown in the advertisement

refers to the plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap. Consequently Issue No 1 is

decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.



       Issue No.2: Whether the advertisement of the defendant
                   disparages or denigrates the soap of the plaintiff?
                   (OPP)

       Issue No.3: Whether the impugned advertisement seeks only to
                   promote the superiority of the defendant
                   LIFEBUOY soap over an ordinary antiseptic
                   soap? (OPD)

 The Law

28.           Before I examine the facts, it would be instructive to notice the

law on the subject of comparative advertising. In Reckitt &amp; Colman of

India Ltd. v. M.P. Ramchandran &amp; Another : 1999 PTC (19) 741, a

learned single Judge of the High Court of Calcutta had considered the

concept of negative campaigning. The learned Judge after considering

several English decisions including        White v. Mellin: 1895 AC 154;

Bubbuck v. Wilkinson: 1899 (1) OB 86 ; De Beers Abrasive v.

International General Electric Co.: 1975 (2) All ER 599 observed as

under:-

      "From the law discussed above it appears to me that the law on
      subject is as follows:

       I)      A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in
               the world, even though the declaration is untrue.

       II)     He can also say that his goods are better than his
               competitors', even though such statement is untrue.

       III)     For the purpose of saying that his goods are the best in
               the world or his goods are better than his competitors' he
               can even compare the advantages of his goods over the
               goods of others.

       IV)     He however, cannot, while saying that his goods are
               better than his competitors', say that his competitors'
               goods are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods
               of his competitors. In other words he defames his
               competitors and their goods, which is not permissible.

       V)      If there is no defamation to the goods or to the
               manufacturer of such goods no action lies, but if there is
               such defamation an action lies and if an action lies for
               recovery of damages for defamation, then the Court is
               also competent to grant an order of injunction restraining
               repetition of such defamation."

 29.         Although, the decision of a learned single Judge in the case of

<a href="/doc/1037711/" id="a_4">Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. v. Kiwi T.T.K. Ltd</a>: 1996 PTC (16) 393

(Del.) was in an interlocutory application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2

CPC, the aforesaid five principles laid down by the Calcutta High Court in

Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. v. M.P. Ramachandran &amp; Another (supra)

have been followed as the law on the subject. The learned single Judge of

this Court observed as under:-

      "12. The settled law on the subject appears to be that a
      manufacturer is entitled to make a statement that his goods are
      the best and also make some statements for puffing of his goods
      and the same will not give a cause of action to other traders or
      manufacturers of similar goods to institute proceedings as there
      is no disparagement or defamation to the goods of the
      manufacturer so doing. However, a manufacturer is not entitled
      to say that his competitor`s goods are bad so as to puff and
      promote his goods. It, therefore, appears that if an action lies
      for defamation an injunction may be granted..."


30.         <a href="/doc/924003/" id="a_5">In Pepsi Co. Inc. and Others v. Hindustan Coca Cola Ltd &amp;

Another</a>: 2003 (27) PTC 305 (Del) (DB), a Division Bench of this Court

held that comparative advertising which discredits or denigrates the trade

mark or trade name of the competitor cannot be permitted.               While

considering what is meant by disparagement, the Division Bench noted as

under:-

       "What is disparagement. The New International Websters'
       Comprehensive Dictionary defines disparage/disparagement to
       mean, "to speak of slightingly, undervalue, to bring discredit or
       dishonor upon, the act of deprecating, derogation, a condition of
       low estimation or valuation, a reproach, disgrace, an unjust
       classing or comparison with that which is of less worth, and
       degradation." The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines disparage
       as under, to bring dis-credit on, slightingly of and depreciate."


CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                Page No.27 of 56
 The Division Bench further observed:

         "To decide the question of disparagement we have to keep the
         following factors in mind namely; (i) Intent of commercial (ii)
         Manner of the commercial (iii) Storyline of the commercial and
         the message sought to be conveyed by the commercial. Out of
         the above, "manner of the commercial", is very important. If
         the manner is ridiculing or the condemning product of the
         competitor then it amounts to disparaging but if the manner is
         only to show one's product better or best without derogating
         other's product then that is not actionable."


Summing up the law the Division Bench held:-

         "It is now a settled law that mere puffing of goods is not
         actionable. Tradesman can say his goods are best or better. But
         by comparison the tradesman cannot slander nor defame the
         goods of the competitor nor can call it bad or inferior. It has
         been so held in the following cases:

             (i) <a href="/doc/226414/" id="a_6">Hindustan Lever v. Colgate Palmolive (I) Ltd</a>,
                   1998 (1) SCC 720.
             (ii) Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. v. M.P.
                   Ramchandran &amp; Anr., 1999 PTC (1) 741.
             (iii) <a href="/doc/1037711/" id="a_7">Reckitt &amp; Colman of India v. Kiwi TTK Ltd</a>.,
                   1996 PTC (16) 393."


31.          <a href="/doc/1507971/" id="a_8">In Dabur India Limited v. Colgate Palmolive India Ltd</a>: 2004

(29) PTC 401 (Del), a learned single Judge of this Court took the following

view:-

         "19. I am further of the view that generic disparagement of a
         rival product without specifically identifying or pin pointing the
         rival product is equally objectionable. Clever advertising can
         indeed hit a rival product without specifically referring to it. No
         one can disparage a class or genre of a product within which a
         complaining plaintiff falls and raise a defence that the plaintiff
         has not been specifically identified. In this context the plaintiff
         has rightly rejected the offer of the defendant to drop the
         container from its advertisement so as to avoid the averred
         identification of the plaintiff's product."




CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                      Page No.28 of 56
 32.         The learned counsel for the defendant had placed reliance on

<a href="/doc/845286/" id="a_9">Imperial Tobacco Co. v. Albert Bonnan</a>: AIR 1928 Calcutta 1 (DB),

wherein it was observed:-

       "Now, to succeed in an action for slander of goods, the plaintiff
       must allege and prove (1) that the statement complained of was
       made of and concerning his goods; (2) that it was false, (3) that it
       was published maliciously i.e. With the intention of injuring him
       and (4) that he has suffered special damage thereby. A trader is
       entitled to commend his own goods and state that they are better
       than the goods of another and if he does so, no action will lie
       against him, whatever damage may ensue from such statement.
       See White v. Mellin [1895] A.C.154.
             It is otherwise where a trader does not limit himself to a
       comparison of his goods with those manufactured by another
       trader and a mere statement that they are inferior in quality to his
       own, but goes further and makes an untrue statement of fact about
       his rival's goods, for example, where he states that they are rotten
       or unmerchantable. In a case like this, an action on the case will
       lie, provided it can be proved that such statement was published
       maliciously and that special damage has ensued: see Lyne v.
       Nicholls[1906] 23T.L.R 86. It is not malice if the object of the
       trader is to push his own business. To make the act malicious it
       must be done with the direct object of injuring the other person's
       business. Therefore, the mere fact that it would injure that other
       person's business is no evidence of malice: see Dunlop Pneumatic
       Tyre Co. v. Maison Talbot [1904]20 T.L.R 579."

33.         Two recent English decisions; one of 2000 and another of 2002

need to be noticed. In Jupiter Unit Trust Managers Trust Ltd v. Johnson

Fry Asset Managers: plc (2000) Unreported 19 April, QBD Morland J.

observed as under:-

       "22. In my judgment when considering comparative
       advertising in relation to a claim for malicious falsehood the
       test that the Court should apply whether in relation to slander
       of goods or slander of a financial product is whether the
       financial service provider in puffing his own product has
       overstepped the permissible limit of denigration or
       disparagement of his rival's product so that a reasonable man
       would take the claim seriously."



CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                    Page No.29 of 56
 In DSG Retail Ltd. v. Comet Group PLC (2002) EWHC 116 (QBD), while

considering the question as to where the line is to be drawn between mere

puffery and actionable statements, it was noticed that this question had been

addressed by Walton J in De Beers Abrasive Products Ltd &amp; Others v.

International General Electric Co Ltd: (1975) 1 WLR 972, as under:

            "What precisely is the law on this point? It is a blinding
      glimpse of the obvious to say that there must be a dividing line
      between statements that are actionable and those which are not;
      and the sole question upon a dry point of law such as we are
      discussing here is: where does that line lie? On the one hand, it
      appears to me that the law is that any trader is entitled to puff
      his own goods, even though such puff must, as a matter of pure
      logic, involve the denigration of his rival's goods. Thus in the
      well-known case of the three adjoining tailors who put notices
      in their respective windows reading: "The best tailor in the
      world", "The best tailor in this town", and "The best tailor in
      this street", none of the three committed an actionable wrong.

            This is, I think, a proposition which extends to a much
      wider field than the slander of goods; for example I think it
      extends to other vague commendatory statements about goods
      or services on offer. Principal among its applications has been
      the case of auctioneers, who, within limits, have always been
      allowed to use language which has been strictly perhaps not
      literally true; thus for example to take note of one instance, in
      Hope v. Walter [1900] 1 Ch 257 Lindley MR stated, at page
      258: "I do not attach any importance to the word `eligible': it is
      the ordinary auctioneer's language". In other words, in the kind
      of situation where one expects, as a matter of ordinary common
      experience, a person to use a certain amount of hyperbole in the
      description of goods, property or services, the courts will do
      what any ordinary reasonable man would do, namely, take it
      with a large pinch of salt.

           Where, however, the situation is not that the trader is
      puffing his own goods, but turns to denigrate those of his rival,
      then, in my opinion, the situation is not so clear cut. Obviously
      the statement: "My goods are better than X's" is only a more
      dramatic presentation of what is implicit in the statement: "My
      goods are the best in the world". Accordingly, I do not think
      such a statement would be actionable. At the other end of the
      scale, if what is said is: "My goods are better than X's", because

       X's are absolute rubbish", then it is established by dicta of Lord
      Shand in the House of Lords in White v. Mellin [1895] AC
      154, 171, which were accepted by Mr Walton as stating the law,
      this statement would be actionable.
            Between these two kinds of statements there is obviously
      still an extremely wide field; and it appears to me that, in order
      to draw the line, one must apply this test, namely, whether a
      reasonable man would take the claim being made as being a
      serious claim or not."



34.         Finally,   McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition:

Fourth Edition, Volume 4 at 27:38 explains "Puffing" to be exaggerated

advertising, blustering, and boasting upon which no reasonable buyer would

rely and is not actionable.     It was also observed that "Puffing" may also

consist of a general claim of superiority over comparable goods that is so

vague that it will be understood as merely the seller's expression of opinion.

It was further noted that an exaggerated advertising claim which is placed

with an intent to influence the consumer's buying decision cannot be

dismissed as mere puffing.

            These two decisions, and what is stated in McCarthy, stress the

point that (a) between clear-cut cases of permissible comparative advertising

and impermissible "rubbishing" of a rival‟s product there may yet be a wide

field of cases and (b) the dividing line in such cases would have to drawn

based on the test whether a reasonable man would take the claim of the

alleged slanderer seriously or take it with the proverbial „large pinch of salt‟

and dismiss it as mere puffery. If it is the former then, it is a case of

disparagement and if it is the latter then, it is a case of mere puffery which is

not actionable.

CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.31 of 56
 Discussion re: The Facts</pre><p id="p_1"> of this case

</p><p id="p_2">35.         The video clip of the TV advertisement (Ext. PW1/2) and the

story board (Ext. PW1/3) have been discussed in detail under Issue No.1.

The question here is whether the advertisement disparages or denigrates the

soap of the plaintiff and also whether it only seeks to project the superiority

of the defendant's LIFEBUOY soap over an ordinary antiseptic soap? As

discussed under Issue No. 1, the advertisement begins with the scene

showing a man and his wife returning home. It is raining heavily outside.

The man is a doctor of medicine. This is immediately indicated by the fact

that he is seen carrying his white coat and stethoscope as also the fact that

his wife, refers to him as doctor sahib later on in the advertisement.

Thereafter, when the wife proceeds to bathe with the so called "ordinary

antiseptic soap", he and his children mock and ridicule her by singing "Oh

God, save her", "Naadaan ko aql dena, ham sab ko bachaa lena......" (

show reason to the naive, save us all .....). He further rubbishes the orange

coloured bar of soap with the words -- "Dua ki zarurat padegi iss dawaa ke

saath" (prayers would be required with this medicine).          The clip then

proceeds to show a person having a bath with the said "ordinary antiseptic

soap". The bare skin of the upper arm of the person is shown under a

magnifying glass as having developed cracks in which green coloured germs

are lodged. The voice-over also indicates the same. It is obvious that the

advertisement displays the said so called "ordinary antiseptic soap" in bad

light and as something harmful. A soap which only the naïve would use and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.32 of 56</span>
 for using which prayers would be needed to save the user. Thereafter, the

advertisement proceeds with the introduction of the defendant's LIFEBUOY

soap and the manner in which it spreads a protective wall of glycerine

thereby removing the cracks in the skin and dissipating the germs.



</p><p id="p_3">36.         The advertisement can be viewed in two parts. One part is

where the orange coloured soap is shown as being harmful and used by

people who are naïve and without any wisdom and who could be saved only

through prayers. The other part is where the defendant's product is shown as

having the qualities of providing a protective wall against dry cracked skin

and as an eliminator of germs. There can be no grievance in respect of the

second part of the advertisement, where the qualities of the defendant's soap

are sought to be demonstrated: whether those qualities exist or not is not an

issue. That part, even if untrue, would be mere puffery. However, the first

part of the advertisement, where the orange bar of soap has been slighted

and shown in bad light and in fact, as something which is harmful, cannot

but be construed as disparagement and denigration of the orange bar of soap

shown in the advertisement. It is one thing to say that a person's product is

the best or that his product is better than somebody else‟s product, but, it is

entirely a different matter to say that his product is good whereas another's

product is bad and harmful. Puffing up of one's product is permissible in

law but slighting or rubbishing or otherwise denigrating or disparaging

another's product is not. From the standpoint of a reasonable person, the

advertisement, in question, certainly disparages and denigrates the orange

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.33 of 56</span>
 bar of soap shown therein which I have held, under Issue No.1, to refer to

the plaintiff's DETTOL Original soap.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">37.         From this discussion, it is apparent that the advertisement

disparages the plaintiff‟s soap and it is not an advertisement which seeks

merely or only to promote the superiority of the defendant's LIFEBUOY

soap over an ordinary antiseptic soap. As I have already pointed out, if it

were a case of mere promotion of superiority of the defendant's product,

alone, the plaintiff would not have had a case as that would have only

entailed a permissible "better" or "best" statement.     The advertisement

comprises of two part; one which denigrates and disparages the product of

the plaintiff and the other which promotes the purported superiority of

defendant's LIFEBUOY soap. The part that disparages does so because it

indulges in the "good versus bad" comparison.       The "good" being the

defendant‟s LIFEBUOY Skinguard and the "bad" being the orange coloured

bar of soap which has been identified, as discussed under Issue No.1, as the

plaintiff‟s DETTOL Original soap.

</p><p id="p_12">39.         It has been contended on behalf of the defendant that the upon a

reading of the plaint, it would be apparent that the object of the plaintiff is to

give an impression that the DETTOL toilet soap is an antiseptic soap, which

is false to the knowledge of the plaintiff. Apart from other paragraphs,

paragraph 7 of the para-wise reply in the written statement was referred to in

the course of arguments. In that paragraph, the defendant has submitted that

the plaintiff is misleading the court into believing that its DETTOL toilet

soap is an antiseptic soap. It was submitted that the emphasis is on the

DETTOL brand, which incorporates a range of innovative products ranging

from the antiseptic liquid to DETTOL Liquid Hand Wash and the famous

DETTOL toilet soap, thereby giving an impression that the antiseptic

properties are also present in DETTOL toilet soap. This, according to the

defendant, is totally misleading and false. In paragraph 12 of the para-wise

reply of the written statement, it is further submitted that the plaintiff is

trying to confuse the court with its DETTOL Liquid Antiseptic and is

passing off its soap as an antiseptic soap.        The reference to DETTOL

Products (not Dettol Soap) is, according to the defendant, yet            another

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                    Page No.35 of 56</span>
 attempt on the part of the plaintiff to mislead the Court with averments made

in respect of other products which include antiseptic products and medicinal

products so as to distract and divert the attention from the true fact that

DETTOL soap is not an antiseptic soap. In paragraph 17 of the written

statement it is further stated that the plaintiff is clearly seeking to promote

the confusion in the minds of the consumers that the DETTOL soap is an

antiseptic soap and consequently, any TV advertisement directed against

ordinary antiseptic soaps is perceived on the basis of the consumers wrong

perception, to be disparaging to the plaintiff, which is totally incorrect and

denied. It is alleged that the plaintiff has in a round about manner given an

impression in the plaint that DETTOL soap is an antiseptic soap.



</p><p id="p_13">40.         Reference was also made to a decision of this Court in the case of

<a href="/doc/1678823/" id="a_10">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Limited v. Naga Limited &amp; Others</a>: 104 (2003)

DLT 490, wherein a learned Single Judge of this Court observed as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "On a reading of the plaint I find the statement significant that
       the "consumers perceive Dettol soap as strong and effective in
       maintaining personal hygiene and regard it as an efficient
       antiseptic soap that kills harmful germs and bacteria and
       ensures good health and hygiene.... It is submitted that the
       Dettol Soap has earned the consumers' confidence because it
       has been tried and tested by the consumers inducing a belief in
       them that Dettol soap has all the properties that an antiseptic
       soap for personal hygiene must have.... The public perception
       is that Dettol soap shares the same medicinal and curative
       qualities as the dettol liquid. It matters little whether this
       misunderstanding has been contrived by the manufacturer or
       has developed in the consumers mind independently. However,
       in the present case it is the Plaintiff's own averment that this
       belief has been induced by it and nevertheless it is sanguine
       enough to expect discretion to be exercised in its favour. If any
       party, such as the Defendant, helps in correcting the error, it

        commits no illegality. The tortious injunction, which is the
       backbone of the present action, is predicated on falsehood, and
       in the present circumstances, the falsehood can be laid at the
       door of the Plaintiff and not of the Defendant. Once this
       conclusion is arrived at, it is not possible to grant any

<p id="p_14">41.         The    defendant referred to the following documents filed on

behalf of the plaintiff namely Ext.PW1/4 (Chartered Accountant's Certificate

certifying the sales figures and the marketing expenses for the Dettol

Antiseptic Liquid from the year 2005 to 2007); Ext. PW1/5 ( the 50 ml

packaging of the DETTOL Antiseptic liquid); PW1/6 (the A.C. Nielsen

report showing the 2006 market share of DETTOL Liquid); Ext. PW1/7 (the

IMRB report dated 23.8.2007 concluding that 85% of the consumers of

DETTOL Liquid believe that the said product is recommended by Medical

Professionals). The learned counsel for the defendant contended that these

documents, which relate to the antiseptic liquid, were filed by the plaintiff

to create an impression that the DETTOL toilet soap also had antiseptic

qualities. The cross-examination of PW1 with regard to the aforesaid Ext.

PW1/4, PW1/6 and PW1/7 was also referred to. Specifically, it was pointed

out that the said witness had stated that the word "Dettol Liquid" mentioned

in paragraph 6 of his affidavit by way of evidence referred to "Dettol

Liquid" and not "Dettol Liquid Soap". It was also stated by the said witness

that Dettol Liquid and Liquid Soap are two different products and while

Dettol Liquid is antiseptic, Dettol Liquid Soap is used mainly for hand wash

and is not antiseptic. The witness also stated that the antiseptic liquid

market referred to in Ext. PW1/6 does not include the toilet soap market.

 Importantly, the said witness stated that Dettol soap was not an antiseptic

soap. Similarly, Dettol Liquid soap was also not antiseptic and that the

plaintiff does not produce any antiseptic soap under the brand name

DETTOL.

<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">42.         On the basis of the aforesaid, it was contended on behalf of the

defendant that although, the plaintiff's DETTOL Toilet Soap was not an

antiseptic soap, the tenor of the plaint and the documents filed by the

plaintiff seeks to create an impression that the plaintiff's DETTOL Toilet

Soap was also an antiseptic soap and, therefore, the antiseptic soap referred

to in the advertisement had a direct connection with the plaintiff's soap

Dettol Original Soap.       According to the defendant, this amounts to

suppression and, therefore, the plaintiff would not be entitled to any

equitable remedy including the remedy of injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">43.         As against these submissions, the learned counsel for the plaintiff

submitted that the decision in the case of Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd

(supra) relates to an entirely different advertising campaign of the plaintiff

and that too, against a different defendant and, therefore, has been decided

on a different set of facts which has no relevance to the present proceedings.

It was also submitted that the plaintiff has been careful in ensuring that the

distinction between the Dettol Liquid and Dettol Toilet Soap is not lost sight

of. The learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the description of the

DETTOL Original Soap as a toilet soap can be discerned from paragraphs 7,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.38 of 56</span>
 8, 9, 19 (i) and 19 (iii) of the plaint. It was contended that while the plaint

describes how the DETTOL brand had been extended from an antiseptic

liquid to toilet soaps, nowhere is the claim made that the Dettol toilet soap

had any antiseptic qualities.
</p>
<p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">44.         I am inclined to agree with the submissions made on behalf of the

plaintiff. Nowhere in the plaint has a claim been made that the plaintiff's

Dettol Original Soap, which is the toilet soap in question, is an antiseptic

soap. As noted in Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. (supra), there is a general

pubic perception that DETTOL toilet soap shares the same medicinal and

curative qualities as the DETTOL Liquid.        But, for the purpose of the

present suit, what is important is: whether the plaintiff has made any

averments in the plaint indicating or suggesting that the DETTOL Original

soap is an antiseptic soap? The plaintiff has made statements explaining the

development of its brand name through time.           Initially, the plaintiff‟s

product was the DETTOL Liquid which was used and is used as an

antiseptic. Under the mark/brand name DETTOL, the plaintiff diversified

its product range to include liquid hand washes and toilet soaps, which were

not antiseptic products. The plaintiff has, no doubt, highlighted the goodwill

and extensive reach of its brand DETTOL created through its primary

product Dettol Liquid. However, at the same time, the plaintiff has clearly

stated, as would be apparent from paragraph 7 of the plaint that in terms of

product development, DETTOL has continuously evolved to meet modern

day demands, and now incorporates a range of innovative antiseptic,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                  Page No.39 of 56</span>
 disinfectant and cleaning products ranging from the antiseptic Liquid

through to DETTOL Liquid Hand wash and the famous DETTOL toilet soap

which has been manufactured and sold by the plaintiff continuously since

the year 1981. In paragraph 8 of the plaint, it is stated that "the present

action concerns the intentional and deliberate disparagement by the

defendant of the plaintiff's product "DETTOL", a toilet soap which is

identified by the members of the trade and public by the colour of the soap

bar and its new modern, distinctive and unique shape.......". The plaintiff

has placed the packaging of the DETTOL toilet soap on record which also

does not indicate that the soap is an antiseptic soap.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">45.         Considering the averments made in the plaint in this light, I am

of the view that the plaintiff is not guilty of the alleged suppression of

material facts. While, there may be a general public perception that the

DETTOL soap shares the same qualities as the DETTOL Liquid, what is

material is that the plaintiff has not sought to give this impression through its

pleadings in the present suit.       The distinction between the DETTOL

Antiseptic Liquid and its new cleaning product range of soaps and hand

wash has been made, as noted above. Nowhere has the plaintiff claimed that

its DETTOL Original Soap is an antiseptic soap. Consequently, this issue is

decided against the defendant and in favour of the plaintiff.

taken in paragraph 1 of the written statement which reads as under:-

<p id="p_25">The learned counsel referred to the provisions of Section 36A(1)(x) of the

MRTP Act which defines Unfair Trade Practice to mean a trade practice

</p><p id="p_32"> 50.         The learned counsel for the plaintiff replied to this argument by

submitting that there is no bar to the jurisdiction of this Court for

entertaining the present suit. No such bar has been stipulated in the MRTP

Act either expressly or impliedly. He also referred to the provisions of

Section 9 CPC which stipulates that the courts have jurisdiction to try all

suits of civil nature excepting suits of which cognisance is either expressly

or impliedly barred. The learned counsel also referred to Section 4 of the

MRTP Act, which clearly states that the application of other laws are not

barred. <a href="/doc/733045/" id="a_22">Section 4</a> (1) provides that "[s]ave as otherwise provided in sub-

Section (2) or elsewhere in this Act, the provisions of this Act shall be in

addition to, and not in derogation of, any other law for the time being in

force." Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/733045/" id="a_23">Section 4</a> relates to the <a href="/doc/462219/" id="a_24">Reserve Bank of India

Act</a>, 1934, the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_25">Banking Regulation Act</a>, 1949, the <a href="/doc/381465/" id="a_26">State Bank of India

(Subsidiary Banks) Act</a>, 1955 and <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_27">Insurance Act</a>, 1938, none of these are in

issue in the present case.      The learned counsel for the plaintiff further

pointed out to the provisions of Section 12B of the MRTP Act which

stipulates that the power of the Commission to award compensation is

without prejudice to the right of the concerned Government, trader or class

of traders or consumer to institute a suit for the recovery of any

compensation for the loss or damage caused as a result of a monopolistic or

restrictive or unfair trade practice.

</p><p id="p_34"> 51.         It was further contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff,

with reference to a decision of a learned single Judge of this Court in the

case of CITICORP &amp; Another v. Todi Investors &amp; Another: 2006 (33)

PTC 631 (Del), that -- (1) the established law is that under Section 9 CPC,

the jurisdiction of civil courts can only be ousted by an express or implied

bar; (2) it is well established that where a right pre-existing in common law

is recognised by the statute and a new statutory remedy for its enforcement

is provided, without expressly excluding the Civil Courts‟ jurisdiction, then

both the common law remedy and the statutory remedy might become

concurrent remedies, leaving open an element of election; and, (3) it is trite

law that an alternative statute must provide for the determination of all the

rights and liabilities of the parties for there to be an ouster of the jurisdiction

of civil courts. It was submitted that there is no express or implied bar in

the MRTP Act with regard to the institution of a suit such as the present one.

The common law remedy of false advertising was available even prior to the

enactment of the MRTP Act and the act does not take away such remedy. It

was also contended that the MRTP Act does not determine all the rights and

liabilities of the parties which are in issue in the present case. The common

law remedies that are sought in the present suit are far wider than what the

MRTP Commission can grant. It was also contended that the MRTP Act is

not a statute which seeks to protect the rights of one competitor against the

other and is designed more for redressing the grievances of consumers or

the public at large. It was contended that <a href="/doc/1065504/" id="a_28">ITC v. Shri Krishna Moktan</a>

(supra), a decision cited by the learned counsel for the defendant, related to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                     Page No.45 of 56</span>
 a complaint of a consumer for an unfair trade practice, and, therefore, the

said decision would not cover the situation which arises in the present case.

With regard to the decision in the case of Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd.

(supra), the learned counsel for the plaintiff contended that <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_29">Section 41</a> (h) of

the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_30">Specific Relief Act</a>, 1963 only deals with injunctions not being granted

and that too if an "equally efficacious" relief could "certainly" be obtained

by any other usual proceedings and these words, according to the learned

counsel for the plaintiff, do not deal with the availability of an alternative

forum and to that extent, it was submitted, the said decision has misread the

statute by adding the words "available in an alternative forum".



</p><p id="p_35">52.         Considering the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for

the parties, it is apparent that the defendant has not raised any serious

contention with regard to the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_31">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986. In any event,

a complaint under that Act can only be qua a "consumer dispute" and that,

too, by a consumer or a consumer association or the government. It does not

contemplate a complaint by a competitor. Furthermore, <a href="/doc/1202608/" id="a_32">section 3</a> of the

Consumer Protection Act, 1986 also makes it clear that it shall not be in

derogation of but in addition to the provisions of any other law for the time

being in force. Thus, the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_33">Consumer Protection Act</a>, 1986 does not stand in

the way of the plaintiff from seeking remedies by way of this suit.



</p><p id="p_36">53.         As pointed out above, even the submissions made by the learned

counsel for the defendant on the basis of the provisions of the MRTP Act,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.46 of 56</span>
 had been advanced more as an issue disentitling the plaintiff from the relief

of injunction than as a jurisdictional one.      The learned counsel for the

defendant was candid in this regard, perhaps, being aware of the fact that

the MRTP Act does not set up any bar, either express or implied, to the

institution of the present suit. The provisions of Section 9 CPC are clear and

the decision of this Court in the case of Citicorp &amp; Another (supra) is also

clear.   The plaintiff's right to seek the common law remedy in the civil

courts has not been taken away by the enactment of the MRTP Act. The

provisions of <a href="/doc/733045/" id="a_34">Section 4</a> as well as Section 12B of the MRTP Act put the case

beyond any doubt that the MRTP Act does not in any way bar the institution

of a suit such as the present one.
</p>
<p id="p_37">

</p><p id="p_38">54.         As regards the arguments purportedly based on <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_35">Section 41</a> (h) of

the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_36">Specific Relief Act</a>, 1963, it must be noted that it only deals with

injunctions. The present suit concerns itself not only with injunction but

also damages and punitive damages. Apart from this, <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_37">Section 41</a> (h) carries

several important expressions. They being:        "equally efficacious relief";

"can certainly be obtained"; and "by any other usual mode of proceedings."

The remedies under the MRTP Act are certainly not as efficacious a relief

as an injunction granted by a court. Section 36D of the MRTP Act, as

indicated above, empowers the Commission to inquire into any unfair trade

practice which may come before it for inquiry and, if, after such inquiry, it is

of the opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, or to the

interest of any consumer or consumers generally, then the Commission may

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.47 of 56</span>
 by order direct, inter alia, that the practice shall be discontinued or shall not

be repeated. It is clear that the Commission has to examine the case of an

unfair trade practice from the stand-point of prejudice to public interest or to

the interest of any consumer or consumers generally. It does not examine or

inquire into an unfair trade practice from the stand-point of competitor

which is purely a private interest. Therefore, the scope of an inquiry into an

unfair trade practice before the MRTP Commission is entirely different from

the scope of consideration of an unfair trade practice in a civil court in a suit

instituted by a competitor       against another competitor with regard to

disparaging advertisement. I do not see how the directions which may be

passed under Section 36D of the MRTP Act can be regarded as an equally

efficacious relief.
</p>
<p id="p_39">

</p><p id="p_40">55.         The second expression contained in <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_38">Section 41</a> (h) of the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_39">Specific

Relief Act</a>, 1963 is also of great significance. The expression is:- "certainly

be obtained". Thus, not only must the relief be equally efficacious but it

must also be "certainly " obtainable. If there is any uncertainty about the

obtaining of such relief then <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_40">Section 41</a> (h) would not come in the way of

the injunction being granted. Lastly, the expression "by any other usual

mode of proceeding" does not, as rightly contended by the plaintiff, refer to

an alternative forum.
</p>
<p id="p_41">

</p><p id="p_42">56.         For all these reasons, it is clear that the present suit is not barred

on account of any of the provisions of the MRTP Act or the Consumer

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                    Page No.48 of 56</span>
 <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_41">Protection Act</a>, 1986. The provisions of these Acts read with <a href="/doc/1835310/" id="a_42">section 41(h)</a>

of the Specific relief Act, 1963 also do not constitute a bar to the grant of

any of the reliefs prayed for in this suit.        This issue stands decided

accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_43">

</p><p id="p_44">       Issue No.7: Whether the plaintiff is entitled to any damages for

       Issue No.9: Relief.
</p>
<p id="p_46">

</p><p id="p_47">57.         These issues are taken up together as they all pertain to the

entitlement of the plaintiff to the reliefs prayed for in the plaint. Insofar as

the relief of injunction is concerned, it was contended on behalf of the

defendant that the nature of the orders sought by the plaintiff are overly wide

and would amount to a gagging order and ought not to be granted in the

form prayed for. It was contended that, first of all, the defendant has already

ceased to telecast the said advertisement. Secondly, the prayer seeking an

order restraining the defendant from taking out any other advertisement and

in any media whatsoever including the electronic media would amount to a

gagging order, which is not permissible. Thirdly, the prayer seeking the

restraining of the defendant from using any other indicia whatsoever to

associate with/depict the plaintiff or its products in its advertisements issued

in any media whatsoever including the electronic media would run counter

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                  Page No.49 of 56</span>
 to the principles of law which permit comparative advertisements without

entailing any denigration or disparagement.
</p>
<p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">58.         It was also contended that the settled legal position for grant of

an injunction, assuming a case of malicious falsehood or slander of goods

has been made out, is that the relief available to a successful claimant in

malicious falsehood is damages (or an inquiry as to damages) and an

injunction to restrain the repetition of the statement complained of or an

equivalent statement, i.e., statements which have been found to be false. It

was also contended on the strength of observations noted in Kerly's Law of

Trade Marks and Trade Names, 13th Edition, that the relief (and,

particularly costs) may be refused where one or both parties are conducting

the proceedings for the purpose of publicity rather than in pursuit of genuine

grievances. In this background, it was contended that the only injunction

order, if at all, that could be granted is, with regard to restraining the

defendant from repeating the publication of the said advertisement,

something, which the defendant has already ceased to do. It was further

contended that the present suit was only for the purposes of publicity and,

therefore, the injunction even to that extent ought to be refused.



</p><p id="p_50">59.         As regards the compensatory relief of damages, the learned

counsel for the defendant contended that insofar as the loss of goodwill and

reputation is concerned, the tort of malicious falsehood requires proof of

special damage, i.e., the plaintiff must establish a direct casual connection

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                     Page No.50 of 56</span>
 between the impugned advertisement and loss caused to him.                It was

contended that the plaintiff must show that the advertisement has resulted in

damage to him, in order to satisfy the requirement of special damage. In the

present case, it was contended, the plaintiff has failed to establish any loss of

goodwill or reputation. It was for the plaintiff to prove damages suffered by

him, for which no evidence whatsoever has been led and which has

admittedly not been proved and, therefore, the plaintiff' would not be

entitled to any damages or compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_51">

</p><p id="p_52">60.         As regards the prayer for exemplary/punitive damages, it was

contended on behalf of the defendant that the law in this regard has been

summarized in <a href="/doc/1672252/" id="a_43">Organo Chemical Industries and Another v. Union of India

&amp; Ors</a>: (1979) 4 SCC 573 as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "For instance, `exemplary damages, are damages on an increased
      scale, awarded to the plaintiff over and above what will barely
      compensate him for his property loss, where the wrong done to
      him was aggravated by circumstances of violence, oppression,
      malice, fraud, or wanton and wicked conduct on the part of the
      defendant, and are intended to solace the plaintiff for mental
      anguish, laceration of his feelings, shame, degradation, or other
      aggravations of the original wrong, or else to punish the defendant
      for his evil behavior or to make an example of him, for which
      reason they are also called "punitive" damages or "vindictive"
      damages, and (vulgarly) "smart-money".

<p id="p_53">The learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the present case does

not fit within the four corners of the test necessary to qualify for the grant of

punitive damages.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.51 of 56</span>
</p><p id="p_55"> 61.         The learned counsel for the plaintiff, on the other hand, submitted

that the plaintiff was entitled to all the reliefs claimed by it.       It was

contended that the defendant in its written statement has admitted that

plaintiff's soap is a Rs 200 crore brand and, therefore, any denigration

caused will be caused to at least a Rs 200 crore brand. Ext. PW1/19, which

is a comparative chart of the channels in which advertisements of both

products appeared, in the month of July, 2007 and part of August, 2007, was

referred to by the learned counsel for the plaintiff to submit that the

defendant has targeted all channels on which the plaintiff advertises. It was

further contended that Ext. DW1/12 to DW1/14 are advertisements of the

plaintiff. In each advertisement a mother is portrayed as encouraging her

child to bathe with DETTOL soap.          The defendant's advertisement has

denigrated and undermined this entire advertisement campaign which,

admittedly, was run on various TV channels and viewed by consumers and

the public at large on almost a daily basis. It was contended that the

defendant's advertisement has seriously damaged the entire campaign of the

plaintiff by showing the children now mocking and ridiculing their mother

for using DETTOL soap.
</p>
<p id="p_56">

</p><p id="p_57">62.         It was also contended that the reputation of good quality for its

toilet soap and the brand DETTOL which the plaintiff painstakingly

developed over the past many years has been destroyed by the mischievous

and malicious advertisement campaign of the defendant. With reference to

Ext. DW1/17, the learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the sales of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                 Page No.52 of 56</span>
 the defendant's soap shown in the advertisement have increased during that

period. According to the learned counsel for the plaintiff, a large part of this

is attributable to the advertisement in issue. A reference was also made to

the affidavit by way of evidence filed by PW1, and in particular, paragraph

26 thereof wherein it is stated that the plaintiff does not have the exact sales

figures of the defendant but has reasons to believe that the sale of the

defendant has increased substantially and the entire increase in sales of the

entire LIFEBUOY category of goods can be attributed to the negative

publicity given to the plaintiff's product.       It is further stated that it is

apparent that customers have shifted their loyalty from the plaintiff's product

to the defendant's product owing to the misleading and disparaging

advertisement introduced by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_58">

</p><p id="p_59">63.         With regard to the punitive damages, the learned counsel for the

plaintiff placed reliance on a decision of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1994429/" id="a_44">Microsoft

Corporation v. Deepak Raval</a>, decided on 16.6.2003 in CS (OS) 529/2003

as also on the earlier decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1152738/" id="a_45">Time Incorporated v. Lokesh

Srivastava</a>: 2005 (30) PTC 3 (Del.).         The     trend for grant of punitive

damages and exemplary damages was set by the latter decision with a view

to curb the tendency to violate the law and infringe the rights of others.

Both the said decisions were in respect of infringement of copyrights. On

the basis of the aforesaid, the learned counsel for the plaintiff pressed for the

prayers as prayed for in the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_60">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.53 of 56</span>
</p><p id="p_61"> 64.         Since issue Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 have already been decided in favour

of the plaintiff and against the defendant, it is obvious that the plaintiff is

entitled to relief. What is the exact nature of the relief to be granted to the

plaintiff is the question at hand. I agree with the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the defendant that a blanket injunction amounting to a

virtual gagging order cannot be passed.        The defendant cannot also be

restrained from bringing out comparative advertisements.              The only

grievance of the plaintiff which needs to be addressed is the disparagement

and denigration of its products and goodwill. Consequently, the injunction

that the plaintiff is entitled to would be to restrain the defendant from issuing

or telecasting the impugned advertisement or in any other manner

disparaging the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff and its product sold

under the trade mark DETTOL. It is clarified that it would be open to the

defendant to employ comparative advertising comparing its products with

those of the plaintiff without, of course, indulging in any disparagement or

denigration of the plaintiff's products.
</p>
<p id="p_62">

</p><p id="p_63">65.         As regards the question of award of damages by way of

compensatory relief, I agree with the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the

said advertisement has caused some loss/damage to the plaintiff. There is

indication that the plaintiff's consumers have shifted to the defendant's

product which has been advertised. However, no evidence of the extent of

the loss or damage that has been caused has been produced by the plaintiff.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                   Page No.54 of 56</span>
 Therefore, quantification of the extent of damage and loss has become well

nigh impossible.
</p>
<p id="p_64">

</p><p id="p_65">66.         Since the findings returned by me are that the said disparaging

advertisement was a deliberate act on the part of the defendant aimed at

reducing the sales of the plaintiff's product and thereby increasing its own

sale, through the device of slander of goods/disparaging and/or denigrating

advertising, the plaintiff would be entitled to punitive damages in the same

manner as was awarded in Time Incorporated (supra). Cases of slander of

goods, malicious falsehood and disparaging advertising have to be decided

on the crucible of fairness. There is no impediment to a trader employing

any means possible, provided such means are fair, to increase his sales, even

at the cost of its competitors. But the law does not permit any person to use

unfair means or practices to gain and profit to the detriment of his

competitors.       Such unfair means or practices include disparaging

advertisements/slander of goods. In the fiercely competitive world that we

live in, businesses compete with each other on various fronts including

quality of goods. The differences in quality of the goods are sought to be

made known to the public through advertising.        While providing such

information, the law permits a businessman to puff up his product and show

it in a better light than that of his competitors. However, as we have seen

above, the law does not permit a manufacturer or a trader to advertise in

such a manner that it slanders the products of its competitors, virtually

rubbishing the same, while promoting his own product. As the competition

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">CS(OS) 1359/2007                                                Page No.55 of 56</span>
 gets fierce, price differences get reduced and businesses tend to play for a

larger market share by employing practices such as slandering of

goods/disparaging advertising which are unfair business practices and ought

to be curbed. Since the question is of fairness versus unfairness, when this

Court has found that the defendant has been deliberately unfair in its said

advertising campaign, it is reason enough for this Court to impose punitive

damages so as to discourage such a sharp practice and to put to an end to this

growing tendency. Consequently, I am of the view that the plaintiff is

entitled to punitive damages from the defendant, which I quantify as Rs

5,00,000/-.
</p>
<p id="p_66">

</p><p id="p_67">67.           In view of the forgoing discussion, there shall be a decree of

disparaging the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff and its product sold
