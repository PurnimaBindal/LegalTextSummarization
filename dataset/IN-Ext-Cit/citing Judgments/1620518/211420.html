This Writ Petition is filed by one A.  Joseph Louis against  District  Welfare
Fund  Committee  represented  by its PresidentDistrict Collector, Trichy-1, N.
Balasubramanian, Trichy-1 and State of Tamil Nadu represented by Commissioner,  
Land Administration, Chennai for a  Writ  of  Mandamus,  directing  the  first

</p>
<p id="p_2">2.  First, the Writ Petition came before the First Bench consisting of Hon'ble
The Chief Justice  and  D.    Murugesan,  J.   The Division Bench based on the
averments in the affidavit and counter affidavit and  after  finding  a  prima
facie  opinion that the first respondent-Committee did appear to be performing
public functions, expressed their inability to  follow  the  earlier  Division
Bench decision  of  this  Court  in W.P.Nos.  1043 and 1896/2002 and 23534 and
26501/2001 dated 26-2-2002 holding that the Writ Petition  against  the  first
respondent is not maintainable and referred the matter to this Larger Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.   The  text  of  the  Reference  made  to  the  Larger  Bench is reproduced
hereunder:
</p>
<p id="p_4">"12.  <a href="/doc/1132738/" id="a_2">In Management of GE Power  Controls  India  (Pvt)  Ltd.,  &amp;  another  v.
Workmen of GE  Power  Controls India Pvt.  Ltd., &amp; others</a> (2 005 1 L.W.  126),
it has been held that ordinarily no writ lies against a body, which is not  an
instrumentality of  the  State, unless it is performing public functions.  The
entire case law on this point  has  been  considered  in  great  detail  (vide
<a href="/doc/157180567/" id="a_3">General Manager, Kisan  Sahkari  Chini  Mills Ltd.  v.  Satrughan Nishad</a> (2003
(8) SCC 639).
</p>
<p id="p_5">13.  In our opinion, though the  petitioner  may  not  able  to  lay  adequate
factual  foundation  in paragraph-8 of its affidavit that the first respondent
is an instrumentality of the State, yet we are prima facie of the opinion that
the first respondent does appear to be  performing  public  functions,  as  is
evident  from  the factual allegations in the writ petition and in the counter
affidavit of the first respondent.  In fact, in paragraph-11  of  the  counter
affidavit  of  the  first  respondent,  it  is  stated  "District Welfare Fund
Committee is using every one of the resources only for the upliftment  of  the
poor and downtrodden.  The funds are spent only for the poor and needy".
</p>
<p id="p_6">14.   In  our  opinion,  the  work  of  upliftment  of poor and downtrodden is
certainly a public function in a Welfare State, as it is the duty of the State
to uplift the poor and downtrodden, in view of the mandate  in  the  Directive
Principles of  State policy contained in Part-IV of the Constitution.  In view
of the above, we are of the opinion that the decision of the Division Bench of
this Court in W.  P.Nos.  1043 and 1896 of 2002 and 23534 and  26501  of  2001
dated 26-02-2 002  (A.V.  Sundaram &amp; three others Vs.  The District Collector,
Trichy and another) holding that no writ lies  against  the  first  respondent
requires to be reconsidered by a Larger Bench of this Court."
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.   Before  considering  the above Reference in detail, brief facts which are
required for answering the above Reference are stated hereunder:
It is the case of the petitioner  that  a  very  valuable  piece  of  property
comprising  of  a  vacant  land  of  an  extent of 2.5 acres and a constructed
building area of 34200 sq.ft.  known as  the  Kalaiarangam  in  the  heart  of
Trichy belonged  to  the  State.    The said land was under the administrative
control  of  the   then   Municipality   of   Trichy   (now   Corporation   of
Tiruchirapalli).   The details regarding formation and activities of the first
respondent-committee have been stated in the affidavit filed at  the  time  of
filing  of  th  e writ petition as well as additional affidavit dated 7-2-2005
filed pursuant to the order dated  24-1-2005  of  the  Division  Bench.    The
following details  are  available  in  both the affidavits.  In 1962 one Gulam
Mohamed Basha, I.A.S., then District Collector of Trichy, organised a District
Cattle Fair and generated a surplus of Rs.642/-.  Making the  said  amount  as
corpus, the District Collector along with Thiru Ka.P.V.  Viswanathan, renowned
Tamil  scholar  started  an  informal  and unregistered association of persons
called Trichy District Welfare Fund Committee.  The very  next  year  a  State
level  cattle  fair  was  organised in Trichy which generated a further sum of
Rs.1,161.56 and in the same year, the Trichy Fire Department conducted a  fire
fighting  demonstration  which  generated  a further sum of Rs.8,513.70 all of
which was donated to the Committee. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.  In 1964, K.  Chokalingam, I.A.S., District Collector  brought  the  famous
drama  troupe  TKS  Nataka  Sabha  to Trichy and raised a sum of Rs.1,00,033/-
which was also donated to the Committee.  In 1968,  K.    Haribhaskar  I.A.S.,
District Collector organised a huge dance performance by which he raised a sum
of  Rs.25  lakhs  which  was  entirely donated to the State Government for the
conduct of the World Tamil Conference.  Since the said conference itself had a
surplus, the entire sum of Rs.25  lakhs  was  returned  in  the  name  of  the
Committee for  the  purpose of constituting a medical college.  Due to various
reasons, a medical college could not be started and instead, an idea to  start
an  Agricultural  University was mooted for which purpose the Committee gave a
donation to the then Chief Minister a sum of Rs.14 lakhs to be used as  corpus
for establishing  the  University.   When this idea also did not fructify, the
said amount of Rs.14 lakhs was returned back to the Committee. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.  In 1974, the then District Collector, M.  Vaidyalingam, I.A.S.,  organised
a  programme for raising funds for setting up the Navalar Nedunchezian College
and raised Rs.4,50,000/-, but since the college was not started,  this  amount
was like  wise  retained  in the name of the Committee.  It was felt that huge
amounts have been collected which needed to be utilised for some  purpose  and
since  the  educational  institutions were not materialising, it was felt that
some permanent building could be constructed by the Committee.   As  suggested  
by  the  then  District  Revenue Officer, Trichy, the Government have issued a
memo dated 15-6-1974 giving permission to the Committee to enter upon  certain
extents of  land  for  the purpose of putting up an auditorium.  On 6-8-1975 a
society was formally registered under the name  and  style  of  "The  District
Welfare Fund Committee".    Between  1975  and 1976 the said M.  Vaidyalingam, 
District Collector organised one more public  function  for  establishing  the
Rajaji  Sanitorium  and collected Rs.15 lakhs which amount was also given over
to the Committee as the Sanitorium was not built.  Another sum of  Rs.4  lakhs
was  also  given  to the Committee by the District Collector from his District
funds for the purpose of the building of an auditorium.  By 1976, the building
was completed and the "Kalaiarangam" was inaugurated with a cinema theatre and  
an auditorium for conducting conferences and meetings.
</p>

<p id="p_10">7.  By 1986, when  the  society  was  celebrating  its  Silver  Jubilee,  over
Rs.1,22,58,174.89  have  been  collected  from  public and substantial amounts
expended on giving welfare to the poor  and  the  needy  of  Trichy  including
construction  of  permanent  premises  for  road  side  vendors and food stall
operators.  The lands on which the  Kalaiarangam  was  constructed  which  the
society  had entered upon in 1974 under a memo was finally assigned absolutely
in its favour by the State Government-vide G.O.Ms.No.  290 Revenue  Department
dated  13-02-1982 wherein specific reference is made to the earlier enter upon
permission as also a clear stipulation that the assignment was being made  for
the express  purpose  of  the  construction of the Kalaiarangam.  A total of 1
.4988 Hec.  of prime land in the heart of Trichy was given to the society  for
the above purpose for a nominal sum of Rs.4,83,900/- with 9% interest from the
date of  taking  possession  in  1974.  The Government Order refers to various
internal  communications  between  the  State  Government  and  the   District
Collector and  the  District  Revenue  Officer and the Additional P.A.  to the
District Collector recommending  the  assignment.    The  aforesaid  3  senior
District  Officials  are the Exofficio President, Vice President and Secretary
of the Society.  The above facts  would  clearly  demonstrate  that  the  very
origin,  administration  and maintenance of the society are deeply governed by
the District Administration and can never be  considered  or  equated  to  any
other private  society  or  association.  The bye laws of the society provides
that there can only be 33 members to the society at any point of time of which
22 shall be ex-officio Government servants of whom the  three  referred  above
hold the key Administrative posts.
</p>


<p id="p_11">8.   The  very  aims and objects of the society as well as its source of funds
(largely collected from the public  through  public  functions  organised  for
various  specific purposes which never took place) and the fact that the funds
of the society are being  applied  only  for  public  charitable  and  welfare
purposes  in the District of Trichy, it cannot be stated that these activities
are not public duties.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.  With reference to the averments stated in the affidavit filed at the  time
of  the  writ  petition,  the  first  respondentCommittee  has filed a counter
affidavit wherein it is stated that the writ  petition  is  not  maintainable.
The  Division  Bench  of  this  Court had already held on 26-2-2002 in W.P.No.
23534 and 26501 of 2001 and W.P.No.  1043 and 1896 of 2002 that the Distric  t
Welfare  Fund  Committee  (1st respondent herein) is not an instrumentality of
the State and hence not amenable to writ jurisdiction.  As  far  as  the  said
committee  is concerned, the award of lease to the second respondent is purely
contractual and beyond the paramount interest of  the  committee  by  securing
just  returns  for  its property through dependable and solvent lessee nothing
else matters.  The property was transferred to the  society  by  means  of  an
assignment issued  under G.O.  760/Rev/L2 dated 11-5-90 for a consideration of
Rs.4,84,203/-.  The amount was remitted by the society on 28-06-90.  The funds
were accumulated over a period of time by judicious conduct of  the  committee
in conducting various cultural programmes and collecting donations through the
public.   The  District  Welfare  Fund  Committee  is  using  every one of its
resources only for the upliftment of the poor and downtrodden.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10.  With reference to the same affidavit, the second respondent has  filed  a
counter  stating  that  the  writ  petition  is  not  maintainable  since  the
respondents against whom the relief was sought for is  not  amenable  to  writ
jurisdiction under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_4">Article  226</a>  of  the  Constitution  of  India.  The other
averments relate to merits of the case which we are not concerned.
</p>

<p id="p_14">11.  For the additional affidavit dated 7-2-2005 giving more  information  and
materials, respondents 1 and 2 have not filed counter affidavit.  In the light
of  the  materials,  facts  and  figures,  let  us  consider whether the first
respondent committee is an instrumentality of  the  State  or  performing  any
public  function  and  whether a Writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India lies against the said Committee and also besides  whether  the  decision
rendered in 2005 1 L.W.  126 ( cited supra) and order dated 26-02-2002 in Writ
Petition Nos.    1043  and  1896 of 2002 and 23534 and 26501 of 2001 have been
correctly decided.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.  Part III of the Constitution deals with Fundamental Rights.   <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_6">Article  12</a>
defines "State" as under:
</p>
<p id="p_16">"12.   Definition.-  In this part, unless the context otherwise requires, "the
State" includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government  and
the  Legislature  of  each  of  the  States and all local or other authorities
within the territory of India or  under  the  control  of  the  Government  of
India."
</p>
<p id="p_17">It  is  also  relevant  to  refer  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_7">Article  32</a>  which  speaks  about  right to
Constitutional Remedies:
</p>
<p id="p_18">"32.  Remedies for enforcement of rights conferred  by  this  Part.-  (1)  The
right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement
of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed.
</p>
<p id="p_19">(2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs,
including  writs  in  the  nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo
warranto and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement  of
any of the rights conferred by this Part."
</p>
<p id="p_20"><a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> enables High Courts to issue certain writs:
</p>

<p id="p_21">"226.   Power  of  High  Courts  to  issue certain writs.- (1) Notwithstanding
anything in <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_9">article  32</a>,  every  High  Court  shall  have  powers,  throughout
territories  in  relation  to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any
person or authority, including in appropriate cases,  any  Government,  within
those  territories  directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature
of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari,  or  any
of  them,  for  the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and
for any other purpose."
</p>
<p id="p_22">13.  The powers of the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_10">Article 32</a>  and  High  Court  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_11">Article  226</a>  have  been  considered  by  the Supreme Court in large number of
decisions.  In the case of <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_12">Shri Anadi Mukta Sadgiri S.M.V.S.J.M.S.   Trust  v.
V.R.  Rudani</a>,  reported  in  A.I.R.  1989 Supreme Court page 1607, the Supreme
Court considered the writ jurisdiction of the  High  Court  exercisable  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a>  of  the Constitution of India.  The following conclusion of Their
Lordships are relevant:  (paras 19 and 21)

"19.  The term "authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a>, in the context, must receive a
liberal meaning unlike the term in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_15">Article 12.</a>  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_16">Article 12</a>  is  relevant  only
for  the  purpose  of  enforcement  of  fundamental  rights  under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_17">Article 32.</a>
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> confers power on the High Court to issue writs for enforcement  of
the fundamental  rights  as  well  as  non-fundamental rights.  The words "Any
person or authority" used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_19">Article 226</a> are, therefore, not  to  be  confined
only to  statutory  authorities  and instrumentalities of the State.  They may
cover any other person or body performing public duty.  The form of  the  body
concerned is  not  very  much relevant.  What is relevant is the nature of the
duty imposed on the body.  The duty must be judged in the  light  of  positive
obligation owed  by  the person or authority to the affected party.  No matter
by what means the duty is imposed.  If a positive obligation  exists  mandamus
cannot be denied.
</p>
<p id="p_23">21.   Here again we may point out that mandamus cannot be denied on the ground 
that the duty to be enforced is not imposed by the statute.  Commenting on the
development of this law, professor De Smith states:   "To  be  enforceable  by
mandamus a public duty does not necessarily have to be one imposed by statute. 
It may be sufficient for the duty to have been imposed by charter, common law,
custom or  even  contract." (Judicial Review of Administrative Act 4th Ed.  p.
</p><p id="p_24">540).  We share this view.  The judicial control over the fast expanding  maze
of  bodies  affecting  the  rights  of  the  people  should  not  be  put into
water-tight compartment.  It should remain flexible to meet  the  requirements
of variable  circumstances.    Mandamus  is  a  very wide remedy which must be
easily available 'to reach injustice wherever it is  found'.    Technicalities
should not come in the way of granting that relief under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_20">Article 226...."</a>
</p>
<p id="p_25">14.   While  considering  the maintainability of the writ petition filed under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_21">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India against Board of Control  for  Cricket
in India  (BCCI),  the  Supreme Court in Writ Petition (C) No.  541/<a href="/doc/1404189/" id="a_22">2004 [M/S.
Zee Telefilms Ltd., and another v.  Union of India and others</a>]- 2005 (1) SCALE
p.  666 considered the term "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_23">Article 12</a> and also  considered  the
scope and interference under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_24">Article 32</a> by the Supreme Court and under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article
226</a> by the High Court.  The main question for consideration before the Supreme
Court was whether the 'Board' (BCCI) fell within the definition of the 'State'
as contemplated  under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_26">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.  It was the argument of
the Board that it did not come under the term " other authorities",  hence  it
is not  a State for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_27">Article 12.</a>  After considering the decision
in <a href="/doc/435970/" id="a_28">Sabhajit Tewary vs.  U.O.I.  &amp; Others</a> [(1975) 3 SCR 616] and <a href="/doc/974148/" id="a_29">Sukhdev  Singh
and others  vs.    Bhagatram  Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and another</a> [1975 3 SCR 
619], the Court held:(para 16)

"16.  The distinction to be noticed between  the  two  judgments  referred  to
hereinabove namely Sukhdev Singh &amp; Ors and Sabhajit Tewary (supra), is that in
the  former  the  Court  held that bodies which were creatures of the statutes
having important State functions and where  State  had  pervasive  control  of
activities  of  those  bodies  would  be  State for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_30">Article 12.</a>
While in Sabhajit Tewary's case the Court held a  body  which  was  registered

under  a  statute  and  not  performing  important  State  functions  and  not
functioning under the pervasive control of the Government would not be a State
for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_31">Article 12."</a>
</p>
<p id="p_26">15.   After  referring  to  the  decisions  in  Ramana  Dayaram   Shetty   Vs.
International Airport Authority of India &amp; Others [AIR 197 9 SC 1628 :  1979 3
SCR 1014]  and  Pradeep Kumar Biswas Vs.  Indian Institute of Chemical Biology 
and others [2002 5 SCC 111), Their Lordships concluded thus:
</p>
<p id="p_27">"24.  To these facts if we apply the principles laid down by seven Judge Bench
in Pradeep Kumar Biswas (supra), it would be clear that the facts  established
do  not  cumulatively  show  that  the  Board  is financially, functionally or
administratively dominated by or is under the control of the Government.  Thus
the little control that the Government may be said to have on the Board is not
pervasive in nature.  Such limited control is purely  regulatory  control  and
nothing more.
</p>
<p id="p_28">25.   Assuming  for  argument  sake  that some of the functions do partake the
nature of public duties or State actions they being in a very limited area  of
the  activities of the Board would not fall within the parameters laid down by
this Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas's case.  Even otherwise assuming that there
is some element of public duty  involved  in  the  discharge  of  the  Board's
functions  even then as per the judgment of this Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas
(supra) that by itself would not suffice for bringing the Board within the net
of "other authorities" for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_32">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_29">xx xx
</p><p id="p_30">29......Assuming that the above mentioned functions of the Board do amount  to
public  duties  or  State  functions,  the  question for our consideration is:
would this be sufficient to hold the Board to be a State for  the  purpose  of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_33">Article 12.</a>   While considering this aspect of the argument of the petitioner,
it should be borne in mind that the State/Union has not chosen  the  Board  to
perform  these  duties  nor  has  it legally authorised the Board to carry out
these functions under any law or agreement.    It  has  chosen  to  leave  the
activities  of  cricket to be controlled by private bodies out of such bodies'
own volition (self arrogated).  In such circumstances when the actions of  the
Board  are not actions as an authorised representative of the State, can it be
said that the Board is discharging State functions?    The  answer  should  be
no.....
</p><p id="p_31">30....But this control over the activities of the Board cannot be construed as
an administrative  control.    At best this is purely regulatory in nature and
the same according to this Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas's case (supra) is not
a factor indicating a pervasive State control of the Board.
</p>
<p id="p_32">31.  Be that as it may, it cannot be denied that the Board does discharge some
duties  like  the  selection  of  an  Indian  cricket  team,  controlling  the
activities of  the  players and others involved in the game of cricket.  These
activities can be said to be akin to public duties or State functions  and  if
there is any violation of any constitutional or statutory obligation or rights
of  other  citizens,  the  aggrieved  party  may not have a relief by way of a
petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_34">Article 32.</a>  But that does not mean that the violator  of  such
right would  go  scot-free  merely because it or he is not a State.  Under the
Indian jurisprudence there is always a just remedy for violation of a right of
a citizen.  Though the remedy under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_35">Article 32</a> is not available, an  aggrieved
party  can  always  seek a remedy under the ordinary course of law by way of a
writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a> of the Constitution which is much  wider  than
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_37">Article 32."</a>
</p>
<p id="p_33">16.  <a href="/doc/157180567/" id="a_38">In General Manager, Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Ltd., v.  Satrughan Nishad</a>,
reported  in  (2003)  8  Supreme  Court  Cases  639,  the Supreme Court had an
occasion to consider "other authority" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_39">Article 12.</a>  In  that  case,  the
appellant-Mill   is  a  cooperative  society  registered  as  under  the  U.P.
Cooperative Societies Act,  1965.    The  contesting  respondents  filed  writ
applications  in the High Court alleging therein that they had worked on Class
III and IV posts in the Mill for a period ranging from 5 to  12  years.    The
services  of surplus workmen were dispensed with without giving any notice and
paying retrenchment compensation as required under Section  6-N  of  the  U.P.
Industrial  Disputes  Act,  1947 in spite of the fact that they had worked for
more than 240 days which necessitated filing of writ applications in the  High
Court.   The  said  writ  petitions were contested by the Mill on the grounds,
inter alia, that the Mill, which is  a  cooperative  society,  was  neither  a
'State'  nor  an 'instrumentality' or 'agency of the State' within the meaning
of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_40">Article 12</a> of the Constitution; hence the writ  jurisdiction  of  the  High
Court could  not  be  invoked.    The  learned  Single Judge of the High Court
over-ruled the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the Mill came to  the
conclusion  that  the Mill which is a Society within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_41">Article 12</a>
of the Constitution as it was an instrumentality of the State  and  there  was
infraction of the provisions of Section 6-N of the Act.  Accordingly, the writ
applications were  allowed.   The said order has been affirmed by the Division
Bench on appeals being preferred by the Mill, hence the  Mill  has  approached
the Supreme  Court  by  way of special leave.  An argument was advanced before
the Supreme Court stating that the contesting respondents could not have  been
allowed  to  invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court as the Mill, which
is a registered cooperative society, was  not  State  within  the  meaning  of
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_42">Article  12</a>  of  the  Constitution as it was neither an instrumentality nor an
agency of the Government of  Uttar  Pradesh.    On  the  other  hand,  counsel
appearing  on behalf of the contesting respondents submitted that the Mill was
an instrumentality of the Government, as such it was an authority  within  the
meaning of  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_43">Article  12</a>  of the Constitution.  The following discussion of the
Supreme Court are relevant:-
</p>
<p id="p_34">"6.  The point raised is no longer res integra as the  same  is  concluded  by
decisions of this  Court.    In  the  case  of  <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_44">Ajay  Hasia  v.   Khalid Mujib
Sehravardi</a> [(1981) 1 SCC 722], a  Constitution  Bench  of  this  Court,  while
approving  the  tests  laid  down  in  the  case  of  <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_45">Ramana Dayaram Shetty v.
International Airport Authority of India</a> (1979 )  3  SCC  489  as  to  when  a
corporation  can be said to be an instrumentality or agency of the Government,
observed at pp.736-37 which runs thus:  (SCC para 9)

"9.  The tests for determination as to when a corporation can be said to be an
instrumentality or agency of  Government  may  now  be  culled  out  from  the
judgment in  the International Airport Authority case (1979) 3 SCC 489.  These
tests are not conclusive or clinching, but they are merely indicative  indicia
which  have  to  be  used  with  care and caution, because while stressing the
necessity  of  a  wide  meaning  to  be  placed  on  the   expression   'other
authorities', it must be realised that it should not be stretched so far as to
bring in every autonomous body which has some nexus with the Government within  
the sweep  of  the  expression.    A  wide  enlargement of the meaning must be
tempered by a wise limitation.  We may summarise the relevant  tests  gathered
from the decision in the International Airport Authority case as follows:
(1)  One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the corporation is
held by Government, it would  go  a  long  way  towards  indicating  that  the
Corporation is  an  instrumentality or agency of Government.  (SCC p.507, para
</p><p id="p_35">14)
(2) Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to  meet  almost
entire  expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the
corporation being impregnated with governmental character.  (SCC  p.508,  para
</p><p id="p_36">15)
(3)  It  may  also  be  a  relevant  factor....whether  the corporation enjoys
monopoly status which is State-conferred or Stateprotected.  (SCC p.508,  para
</p><p id="p_37">15)
(4)  Existence  of  deep  and pervasive State control may afford an indication
that the corporation is a State agency or instrumentality.  (SCC  p.508,  para
</p><p id="p_38">15)
(5)  If  the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely
related  to  governmental  functions,  it  would  be  a  relevant  factor   in
classifying  the  corporation  as  an instrumentality or agency of Government.
(SCC p.509, para 16)
(6)  'Specifically,  if  a  department  of  Government  is  transferred  to  a
corporation,  it would be a strong factor supportive of this inference' of the
corporation being an instrumentality or agency of Government.  (SC p.510, para
</p><p id="p_39">18)

If on a  consideration  of  these  relevant  factors  it  is  found  that  the
corporation  is  an  instrumentality  or  agency  of  Government, it would, as
pointed out in the International Airport Authority case (1979) 3 SCC  489,  be
an 'authority' and, therefore, 'State' within the meaning of the expression in
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_46">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_40">7.  In  the  case  of  <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_47">Pradeep  Kumar  Biswas v.  Indian Institute of Chemical
Biology</a> [(2002) 5 SCC 111:2002 SCC (L&amp;S) 633, a Bench of Seven Judges of  this 
Court,  in  para  27  of  its  judgment  has noted and quoted with approval in
extenso the aforesaid tests propounded in International Airport Authority case
[(1979) 3 SCC 489] and approved in the case of Ajay Hasia [(1981) 1  SCC  722]
for  determining as to when a corporation can be said to be an instrumentality
or agency of the Government so as to come within the meaning of the expression
" authority" in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_48">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.  There the Bench  referred  to
the case  of  Chander  Mohan  Khanna v.  NCERT [(1991) 4 SCC 578] where, after 
considering the memorandum of association and the rules, this  Court  came  to
the  conclusion  that  NCERT was largely an autonomous body and its activities
were not wholly related to governmental functions and the  government  control
was  confined  only  to  the  proper  utilisation  of the grants and since its
funding was not entirely from government resources, the case did  not  satisfy
the requirements  of the State under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_49">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.  Further,
reference was also made in that case to the decision of this Court  in  <a href="/doc/1944115/" id="a_50">Mysore
Paper Mills Ltd.    v.   Mysore Paper Mills Officers' Association</a> where it was
held that the company was an authority within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_51">Article 12</a> of the
Constitution as it was substantially financed and  financially  controlled  by
the Government, managed by a Board of Directors nominated and removable at the  
instance  of  the  Government  and  carrying  on important functions of public
interest under the control of the Government."
</p>
<p id="p_41">After saying so, Their Lordships have further held that:
</p>
<p id="p_42">"8.  From the decisions referred to above, it would be clear that the form  in
which  the  body  is  constituted,  namely,  whether  it  is  a  society  or a
cooperative society or a company, is not decisive.  The  real  status  of  the
body  with  respect to the control of Government would have to be looked into.
The various tests, as indicated above, would have to be applied and considered
cumulatively.   There  can  be  no  hard-and-fast  formula  and  in  different
facts/situations,  different  factors  may  be  found  to  be overwhelming and
indicating  that  the  body  is  an  authority  under  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_52">Article   12</a>   of   the
Constitution."
</p>
<p id="p_43">Considering  the  ratio  of  the  nominees  of  the  State  Government and the
Management of the committee, Their Lordships have held:  (para 8)

"8........Under the bye-laws, the  State  Government  can  neither  issue  any
direction  to  the  Mill nor determine its policy as it is an autonomous body.
The State has no control at all in the functioning of the  Mill  much  less  a
deep and pervasive one....."
</p>
<p id="p_44">At  the  end, an argument was advanced on behalf of the contesting respondents
that even if the Mill is not the authority within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_53">Article 12</a> of
the Constitution, writ application can  be  entertained  as  mandamus  can  be
issued  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_54">Article 226</a> of the Constitution against any person or authority
which would include any private person or body.  On the  other  hand,  learned
counsel  appearing  on  behalf of the appellant submitted that mandamus can be
issued against a private person or body only if the infraction alleged  is  in
performance of public duty.  Finally the Court held thus:  (para 9)

"9.....Reference in this connection may be made to the decisions of this Court
in  <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_55">Shri  Anadi  Mukta  Sadguru  Shree  Muktajee  Vandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti 
Mahotsav Samarak Trust v.  V.R.  Rudani</a> [(1989) 2 SCC 691] in which this Court
examined the various aspects and distinction between an authority and a person
and after analysis of the decisions  referred  in  that  regard  came  to  the
conclusion  that  it  is  only  in the circumstances when the authority or the
person performs a public function or discharges a public duty that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_56">Article 226</a>
of the Constitution can be invoked.  In the cases of <a href="/doc/1624453/" id="a_57">K.  Krishnamacharyulu  v.
Sri  Venkateswara  Hindu  College  of  Engineering</a>  [(1997) 3 SCC 571} and <a href="/doc/1620518/" id="a_58">VST
Industries Ltd.  v.  Workers' Union</a> [(2001) 1 SCC 298] the same principle  has
been reiterated.  Further, in the case of VST Industries Ltd., it was observed
that  manufacture  and sale of cigarettes by a private person will not involve
any public function.  This being the position in that case,  this  Court  held
that  the  High  Court  has  no jurisdiction to entertain an application under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_59">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  In the present case, the Mill is engaged  in
the  manufacture  and  sale  of  sugar  which,  on the same analogy, would not
involve any public function.  Thus, we have no difficulty in holding that  the
jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_60">Article 226</a> of the Constitution could not
have been invoked."
</p>
<p id="p_45">17.  <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_61">In  Federal  Bank Ltd., v.  Sager Thomas</a> [2003 (4) CTC 418], the question
that arose for consideration was, whether Federal Bank which is a private bank
is a State or its agency or instrumentality within the meaning of  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_62">Article  12</a>
of  the  Constitution  of India and whether writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_63">Article 226</a> is
maintainable.  After referring all the earlier authorities, the Supreme  Court
has held:  ( para 18)

"18.   From the decisions referred to above, the position that emerges is that
a writ petition under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_64">Article  226</a>  of  the  Constitution  of  India  may  be
maintainable against (i) the State (Govt.); ( ii) Authority; (iii) a statutory
body;  (iv)  an instrumentality or agency of the State; (v) a company which is
financed and owned by the State; (vi) a  private  body  run  substantially  on
State  funding;  (vii)  a  private  body  discharging  public duty or positive
obligation of public nature; (viii) a person or  a  body  under  liability  to
discharge  any  function  under  any  Statute,  to compel it to perform such a
statutory function."
</p>
<p id="p_46">Ultimately the Court held that:  (para 33)

"33.......A private body or a person may be amenable to writ jurisdiction only
where it may become necessary to compel such body or  association  to  enforce 
any  statutory  obligations  or  such  obligations  of  public  nature casting
positive obligation upon it.  We don't find such conditions are  fulfilled  in
respect  of  a  private  company carrying on a commercial activity of banking.
Merely regulatory provisions to ensure such activity  carried  on  by  private
bodies  work  within  a  discipline,  do  not  confer any such status upon the
company nor puts any such obligation upon it which  may  be  enforced  through
issue of  a  writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_65">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  Present is a case of
disciplinary action being taken against its employee by  the  appellant  Bank.
Respondent's service  with the bank stands terminated.  The action of the Bank
was challenged by the respondent by filing a writ petition under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_66">Article  226</a>
of the  Constitution  of  India.   The respondent is not trying to enforce any
statutory duty on the part of the Bank.  That being the position,  the  appeal
deserves to be allowed."
</p>
<p id="p_47">18.   The next decision cited by learned counsel for 1 st respondent is in the
case of <a href="/doc/1703259/" id="a_67">G.  Bassi Reddy v.  International Crops Research  Institute</a>,  reported
in AIR  2003  Supreme  Court  1764.    The  appellants  in  that decision were
employees of International Crops Research Institute ('ICRISAT' in short)/first
respondent therein.   Their  services  were  terminated.    They  filed   Writ
Petitions  before the High Court of Karnataka against ICRISAT and the Union of
India.  The Writ Petitions were dismissed on the ground that ICRISAT  was  not
amenable  to writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_68">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, and that
a writ could not be issued to ICRISAT.  Against the ruling of the High  Court,
the petitioners  therein  moved  to  Supreme Court.  After considering earlier
decisions  and  scope  for  issuance  of  writ  under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_69">Article  22  6</a>  of  the
Constitution by the High Court, Their Lordships have held:  (paras 25 to 29)

"25.   A writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_70">Article 226</a> lies only when the petitioner establishes that
his or her fundamental right or some other  legal  right  has  been  infringed
(<a href="/doc/690534/" id="a_71">Calcutta Gas Co.   v.    State  of  W.B</a>., AIR 11 62 SC 1044, 1047-1048).  The
claim as made by the appellant in his writ petition is founded on  Arts.    14
and 16.    The  claim would not be maintainable against ICRISAT unless ICRISAT
were a 'State' or authority within the meaning  of  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_72">Art.12.</a>    The  tests  for
determining whether an organization is either, has been recently considered by
a Constitution  Bench  of  this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_73">Pradeep  Kumar  Biswas  v.  Indian
Institute of Chemical Biology and others</a> (2002) 5 SCC 111 at p.134 in which we
said:
</p><p id="p_48">"The question in each case would be-whether in the  light  of  the  cumulative
facts   as   established,   the   body   is   financially,   functionally  and
administratively dominated by or under the control of the  Government.    Such
control must  be particular to the body in question and must be pervasive.  If
this is found then the body is a State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_74">Article 12.</a>  On the other  hand,
when  the  control is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it
would not serve to make the body a State".
</p>
<p id="p_49">26.  The facts which have been narrated earlier clearly show that ICRISAT does
not fulfil any of these tests.  It was not set up by  the  Government  and  it
gives  its  services voluntarily to a large number of countries besides India.
It is not controlled by not is it accountable to the Government.   The  Indian
Government's financial  contribution to ICRISAT is minimal.  Its participation
in ICRISAT's administration is limited to 3 out of  15  members.    It  cannot
therefore  be  said  that  ICRISAT is a State or other authority as defined in
<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_75">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_50">27.  It is true that a writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_76">Article 226</a> also lies against a 'person' for
'any other purpose'.  The power of the High Court to issue such a writ to "any
person" can only mean the power to issue such a writ to any  person  to  whom,
according to wellestablished principles, a writ lay.  That a writ may issue to
an  appropriate  person  for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by
Part III is clear enough from the language used.  But the words "and  for  any
other purpose" must mean "for any other purpose for which any one of the writs
mentioned would according to well established principles issue.
</p>
<p id="p_51">28.  A writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_77">Article 226</a> can lie against a " person" if it is a statutory
body  or  performs  a public function or discharges a public or statutory duty
(<a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_78">Praga Tools Corporation v.  C.V.  Imanual</a>,  (1969)  1  SCC  585;  <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_79">Andi  Mukta
Sadguru Trust v.  V.R.   Rudani</a>, (1989 ) 2 SCC 691, 698; VST Ind.Ltd.  v.  VST
Ind.  Workers' Union and another (2001) 1 SCC 298.  ICRISAT has not  been  set
up by  a  statute nor are its activities statutorily controlled.  Although, it
is not easy to define what a  public  function  or  public  duty  is,  it  can
reasonably  be  said  that such functions are similar to or closely related to
those performable by the  State  in  its  sovereign  capacity.    The  primary
activity  of  ICRISAT  is  to  conduct research and training programmes in the
sphere of agriculture purely on a voluntary  basis.    A  service  voluntarily
undertaken cannot  be  said  to  be a public duty.  Besides ICRISAT has a role
which extends beyond the territorial boundaries of India  and  its  activities
are designed  to  benefit  people  from  all over the world.  While the Indian
public may be the beneficiary of the activities of the institute, it certainly
cannot be said that the ICRISAT owes a duty to the Indian  public  to  provide
research and training  facilities.    <a href="/doc/1080534/" id="a_80">In  Praga  Tools  Corporation  v.   C.V.
Imanual</a>, AIR 1960 SC 1306, this Court construed <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_81">Article 226</a> to hold  that  the
High  Court  could  issue a writ of mandamus "to secure the performance of the
duty or statutory duty" in the performance of which the one who applies for it
has a sufficient legal interest".  The Court also held that:
</p>
<p id="p_52">"..........an  application  for  mandamus  will  not  lie  for  an  order   of
reinstatement to an office which is essentially of a private character nor can
such an application be maintained to secure performance of obligations owed by
a company towards its workmen or to resolve any private dispute (<a href="/doc/501766/" id="a_82">See Sohan Lal
v.  Union of India</a>, 1957 SCR 738).
</p>
<p id="p_53">29.   We  are  therefore  of  the  view  that  the High Court was right in its
conclusion that the writ  petition  of  the  appellant  was  not  maintainable
against ICRISAT."
</p>
<p id="p_54">19.  <a href="/doc/1762739/" id="a_83">In Virendra  Kumar  Srivatsava  v.   U.P.  Rajya Karmachari Kalyan Nigam</a>,
reported in (2005) 1 Supreme Court Cases 149, the sole point  that  arose  for
decision before  the  Supreme Court was, whether U.P.  Rajya Karmachari Kalyan 
Nigam (Corporation) was covered by the definition of 'State' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_84">Article  12</a>
of  the  Constitution  and was amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_85">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.  In  that  case  the  services  of  the
petitioner  had been terminated from the post of salesman in one of the stores
of the Corporation, against which he had approached the High Court, Allahabad.
A preliminary objection was raised by the Corporation to  the  maintainability
of  the  writ petition on the ground that the Corporation does not fall in the
definition of "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_86">Article  12</a>  of  the  Constitution.    Relying  on
decisions  of  the  Lucknow Bench of the same Court in the case of Vijay Kumar
Verma v.  U.P.  Govt.  Employees Welfare Corporation [W.P.No.   8246  (SS)  of
1992,  decided on 13-4-1993], the writ petition filed by the petitioner in the
High Court was dismissed as not maintainable, against which the petitioner has
preferred the appeal to the  Supreme  Court.    After  analysing  the  factual
materials and various factors, ultimately Their Lordships have concluded thus:
( para 27)

"27.   On detailed examination of the administrative, financial and functional
control of the Corporation, we have no manner of doubt that it is nothing  but
an  "instrumentality" and agency of the State" and the control of the State is
not only "regulatory" but it is "deep and pervasive" in the sense that  it  is
formed with the object of catering to the needs of the government employees as
a supplement  to  their  salaries  and other perks.  The top executives of the
government department  ex  officio  are  members  and  office-bearers  of  the
Corporation.    The   Corporation   is   fully   supported   financially   and
administratively by  the  State  and  its  authorities.      Even   day-to-day
functioning  of  the  Corporation is watched, supervised and controlled by the
various departmental authorities of the State particularly the  Department  of
Food and  Civil  Supplies.   The multiple test indicated to be applied both by
the majority and minority view in Pradeep Kumar Biswas [(2002) 5 SCC  111]  is
fully  satisfied in the present case for recording a conclusion by us that the
Corporation is covered as an " agency and instrumentality of the State" in the
definition of "State" under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_87">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.  It is, therefore,
amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_88">Article 226</a>  of  the
Constitution."
</p>
<p id="p_55">20.  <a href="/doc/471272/" id="a_89">In  Pradeep  Kumar  Biswas  v.    Indian  Institute  of Chemical Biology</a>,
reported in (2002) 5 Supreme Court Cases 111, the Constitution  Bench  of  the
Supreme  Court reconsidered the decision taken in Sabhajit Tewary (1975) 1 SCC 
</p><p id="p_56">485.  Out of 7 Hon'ble Judges, the majority view of 5  Hon'ble  Judges  is  as
follows:  (para 40)

"40.  The picture that ultimately emerges is that the tests formulated in Ajay
Hasia [(1981)  1  SCC  722:    1981  SCC  (L&amp;S)  258]  are  not a rigid set of
principles so that if a body  falls  within  any  one  of  them  it  must,  ex
hypothesi, be  considered to be a State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_90">Article 12.</a>  The
question in each case would be  whether in the light of the cumulative  facts
as  established,  the  body  is financially, functionally and administratively
dominated by or under the control of the Government.   Such  control  must  be
particular to  the  body  in question and must be pervasive.  If this is found
then the body is a State within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_91">Article 12.</a>   On  the  other  hand,  when  the
control  is merely regulatory whether under statute or otherwise, it would not
serve to make the body a State."
</p>
<p id="p_57">By applying various tests enunciated in  the  above  mentioned  decisions  and
considering  the  facts  relating  to  Council  of  Scientific  and Industrial
Research (CSIR), the Supreme Court found that the  same  is  well  within  the
range of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_92">Article 12.</a>  It is to be noted that CSIR was set up by the Department
of  Commerce,  Government  of  India  with  the  broad  objective of promoting
industrial growth in the country.  On 14-11-1 941, a Resolution was passed  by
the Legislative Assembly and accepted by the Government of India.  The objects
which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  memorandum  of  association  of CSIR
demonstrate that CSIR was set up in  the  national  interest  to  further  the
economic welfare of the society by fostering planned industrial development in
the country.    CSIR  was and continues to be a non-profit-making organization
and according to clause 4 of CSIR's memorandum of association, all its  income
and  property,  however derived shall be applied only towards the promotion of
those objects subject nevertheless in  respect  of  the  expenditure  to  such
limitations as  the  Government  of  India  may from time to time impose.  The
details regarding management and control show the dominant role played by  the
Government of  India  in  the  Governing  Body  of CSIR is evident.  The Prime
Minister shall be the ex officio President of CSIR.   The  Governing  Body  is
required  to  administer,  direct  and  control  the  affairs and funds of the
Society and shall, under Rule 43, have authority to exercise all the powers of
the Society subject nevertheless in respect of expenditure to such limitations
as the Government of India may from time to time impose.  This is evident that
the financial control lies with the  Government.    After  analysing  all  the
relevant aspects, as the majority view, the Supreme Court ruled that CSIR is a
State within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_93">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_58">21.  In  Chander  Mohan  Khanna  v.   N.C.E.R.T., reported in (1991) 4 Supreme
Court Cases 578, the question that was considered was,  whether  the  National
Council  of  Educational,  Research  and Training (NCERT)is 'State' as defined
under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_94">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.  The NCERT is a society registered under
the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_95">Societies Registration Act</a>.    After  verifying  its  object,  programmes,
activities,  funding,  and  considering  the  fact that the Government has got
limited control only to proper utilisation of the grant, the Court  ultimately
concluded  that  NCERT  is largely an autonomous body and does not fall within
the definition of 'State' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_96">Article 12.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_59">22.  The picture that emerges from the above caselaws is in the following:
</p><p id="p_60">(i) In the case of U.P.  Rajya Karamchari Kalyan Nigam [(2005) 1 SCC 149]:
The same was established by the State Government and wholly  financed  by  the 
Government  to  carry  on  and  promote activities aimed at the welfare of the
employees of State Government.  All  office  bearers  of  Governing  Body  are
Government servants.  The only Government employees can be inducted as members    
of  the  Corporation  and  that  too  with  the previous approval of the State
Government.  The Rules of Corporation can be amended, varied or  deleted  only
with prior  approval  of the State Government.  Upon winding up, the assets to
be distributed in  the  manner  determined  by  the  State  Government.    The
Corporation  comes under ' State' and is amenable to writ jurisdiction of High
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_97">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>

<p id="p_61">(ii) In the case of Board of Control for Cricket in India ( B.C.C.I) (2005 (1)
SCALE 666):  
</p><p id="p_62">it is recognised by  Government  of  India  as  the  apex  National  body  for
regulating the  game  of  cricket  in  India.  It selects players to represent
India in matches.  It makes Rules governing activities of cricket players  and
umpires.   It  is the sole authority for organizing major cricketing events in
India.  The Government of India accepts recommendations of BCCI in  regard  to
awarding 'Arjuna  Awards'  to  cricketers.    It enjoys monopoly status in the
field of cricket.  The majority view of the Supreme Court is that the BCCI  is
not a 'State' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_98">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_63">(iii) In the case of N.C.E.R.T.  [(1991) 4 SCC 578]:
</p><p id="p_64">The same was set up as a society with 7 Government officers subscribing to the
memorandum of  association.  The object of the council is to assist and advise
the Ministry of Education  and  Social  Welfare  in  the  field  of  education
particularly school  education.  The income and property to be applied towards
promotion of objects only.  The expenditure on grants subject  to  limitations
was placed  by  the Government of India.  The Government could review the work
and take action to give effect to reports.   The  Governing  council  consists
mainly of  Government  officials  but  also  includes  educationalists.    The
N.C.E.R.T is not a 'State' under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_99">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_65">(iv) In the case of Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Ltd., ('Mill' in short)[(2003) 8
S.C.C.  639:
</p><p id="p_66">It is a cooperative society.  50 per cent of its  shares  are  held  by  State
Government.   Membership to this Mill is open to cane growers, other societies
etc.  Its committee of management has 15 members, out of which 5 are nominated  
by the State Government.  The State Government cannot issue any  direction  to

the Mill  or determine its policy.  The manufacture and sale of sugar does not
involve any public function.  Hence, the Mill is  not  a  'State'  within  the
meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_100">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_67">23.  <a href="/doc/276908/" id="a_101">In  Karuppan  v.   The Patron of Chennai Rifle Club, Chennai</a>, reported in
(2004) 1 M.L.J.  153, a Division Bench of this Court,  after  considering  the
formation, object and the activities of Chennai Rifle Club and after analysing
various  case  laws  on  the point, held that a writ would not lie against the
Chennai Rifle Club and the said authority will not come within the purview  of
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_102">Article 226.</a>    In  that  case, the Commissioner of Police is the President of
Rifle Club.   Still  the  Division  Bench  found  that  the  club  is  not  an
instrumentality of the State and has not discharged any public duty.  The said
decision will apply in all fours to the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_68">24.   Now  we  shall  consider the involvement of Government officials such as
District Collector, District Revenue Officer, Revenue Divisional Officer etc.,
as ex officio office bearers of the 2nd respondent Society.  As per Rule 8 (1)
</p><p id="p_69">(a)of Tamil Nadu Government  Servants'  Conduct  Rules,  1973,  no  Government
servant  shall  be  permitted  to engage himself directly or indirectly in any
trade or business or undertake any employment without previous sanction of the
Government.  However, without such sanction, Government servant can  undertake 
honorary work of a social or charitable nature or occasional work of literary,
artistic  or  scientific  character, or participate in sports activities as an
amateur, subject to the condition that his  official  duties  do  not  thereby
suffer.   As per Rule 2, no Government servant shall, except with the previous
sanction of the Government,  take  part  in  the  registration,  promotion  or
management  of any bank or company registered under the <a href="/doc/444965/" id="a_103">Banking Companies Act</a>,    
1949 or the <a href="/doc/257409/" id="a_104">Indian Companies Act</a>, 1913, or the  <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_105">Companies  Act</a>,  1956  or  any
other law  for the time being in force.  Proviso enables a Government servant,
subject to sub-rules (7) to (10), to take part in the registration,  promotion
or  management of a Co-operative Society registered or deemed to be registered
under the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, 1961, or any  other  law  for
the  time  being  in  force or of a literary, scientific or charitable society
registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_106">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860 or any other law for the
time being in force.  However, the duty of  a  Government  servant  shall  not
thereby suffer.    The  above  provision  makes  it  clear that the Government
servants who are associated with the +committee are doing so purely in private
capacity.  Rule 8 of the Tamil Nadu Government Servants Conduct Rules  permits
the  government  servants to be members of charitable bodies and hold honorary
posts without the prior sanction of the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_70">25.  After a careful analysis of the above discussion, we are of the view that
whether a body is a 'State' as defined under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_107">Article 12</a>  of  the  Constitution
will  have  to  be determined by applying the tests laid down in Pradeep Kumar
Biswas's case [(2002) 5 SCC 11 1].  The multiple test  laid  down  therein  is
whether  in  the  light  of  cumulative  facts  as  established  the  body  is
financially, functionally and  administratively  dominated  by  or  under  the
control of  the  Government.    When  the control is merely regulatory whether
under statute or otherwise, it would not serve to make  the  body  a  'State'.
The control must  be deep and pervasive.  In Zee Telefilms Vs.  Union of India
(20 05 (1)  SCALE  666)  the  Honourable  Supreme  Court  in  the  penultimate
paragraph  of  the  judgment of the majority has been pleased to hold that the
decision in Sukhdev Singh's case [(1975) 3 SCR 619] expanding  the  definition
of  the term "other authorities" to include bodies other than statutory bodies
was given in the context of the situation  prevailing  at  that  time.    They
further  held  that  in  view  of  the  present  socio-economic  policy of the
Government where the State is distancing itself from commercial activities and
concentrating on governance, it has been held that there is  no  necessity  to
further  expand the scope of the term "other authorities" occurring in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_108">Article
12</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_71">26.  In cases where the body has been held to be an  authority  under  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_109">Article
12</a>,  the Government invariably has had the power to control the functioning of
the body by issuing directions,  controlling  expenditure  etc.    In  Pradeep
Biswas's  case  (supra),  the  Council  of  Scientific and Industrial Research
(CSIR) was held to be a State  on  the  basis  that  it  was  set  up  by  the
Department  of  Commerce,  Government of India, to carry on activities earlier
done by Department of Commerce.  It was set up in  the  national  interest  to
further  the  economic  welfare  of  society  by  fostering planned industrial
development.  The Prime Minister is its ex officio President.    Its  Director
General is appointed by the Government of India.  The power to frame, amend or
repeal  bye-laws  can  be  done only with the sanction of Government of India.
All decisions can be reviewed by the Prime Minister and his orders are binding
on governing body, As far as the employees of CSIR are concerned, the  Central
Civil  Services  (Classification,  Control  and  Appeal) Rules and the Central
Civil Services (Conduct) Rules are applicable to them.    The  scales  of  pay
applicable  to all the employees of CSIR are those prescribed by Government of
India for similar personnel.  CSIR cannot lay down or  change  the  terms  and
conditions  of service of its employees and any alteration in the bye-laws can
be carried out only with the approval of the Government  of  India.    Initial
capital  as  well as 70 per cent of the funds have been provided by Government
of India.  The Government of India can impose limitation on expenditure.   The
accounts  of  CSIR  are  required to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor
General and placed before the Parliament.  In the event  of  dissolution,  the
assets of the CSIR shall have to be dealt with in the manner determined by the
Government. 
</p>
<p id="p_72">27.   In  the case of first respondent- District Welfare Fund Committee, there
is no functional, financial, or administrative control by the Government.  The
Government servants who are associated with the Committee are doing so  purely 
in private capacity.  The first respondent is a Society and "Mandram" building
is the  private  property  of  the  Society.    The Society is not getting any
financial aid from the State and there is no pervasive control  by  the  State
over the Society.    It  is  not  discharging  any  public  duty.   Though the
successive District Collectors by  involving  themselves  collected  necessary
funds  by  conducting  Dramas  and  Cultural Programmes, originally either for
formation of a medical college or an agricultural college,  the  fact  remains
that  the funds were diverted to the corps of the Society, which paved way for
the formation of "Kalaiarangam".  Admittedly, money has not  been  contributed
by the Government.  Likewise, the Government officials are part of the Society
as ex-officio and not under orders and permission of the Government.  As ruled
in  AIR 2003 SC 1764 (supra), although, it is not easy to define what a public
function or public duty is, it can reasonably be said that such functions  are
similar  to  or  closely  related  to  those  performable  by the State in its
sovereign capacity.  We are satisfied that the Committee is not discharging or
conducting State functions and the Government has no  pervasive  control  much
less regulatory  control  over  the  Society.  As said earlier, the funds were
accumulated through various cultural programmes and financed from the  public.
The  land was assigned to the Society by the Government for a consideration of
Rs.4,84,203/-.  The  property  possessed  is  the  'Kalaiarangam'  and  office
complex.   The  rent  derived  from the above properties is the main source of
income  to  the  Society  and  there  is  no  financial  assistance  from  the
Government.    The  accounts  are  being  audited  by  a  qualified  Chartered
Accountant.  No power was given to the Government to issue  directions.    The
Membership  of  the  Society  is  restricted  to  33 of whom 22 are Government
officers who are ex-officio members, and  11  are  drawn  from  among  reputed
social workers,  educationalists,  professionals  etc.   Upon dissolution, the
assets of the Society are transferable to other  associations  with  identical
objects.   The  first  respondent-Society  thus  cannot  be  construed  as  an
instrumentality of the State or other authority as defined in  <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_110">Article  12</a>  of
the Constitution.    When  the  body  is a private body but performs statutory
functions or discharges public duties, a writ would lie.  No  writ  would  lie
when the  rights  purportedly infringed are merely private rights.  The action
complained of  in  the  writ  petition  relates  to  grant  of  lease  of  the
"Kalaiarangam" by  way  of  Tender.    There is no statutory or public duty or
function involved and the right of the first respondent to grant  a  lease  is
purely private.    As  the  first  respondent  Society  is not an authority as
defined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_111">Article 12</a> and as the action complained of is  that  of  a  private
body  exercising private functions, we hold that the writ petition will not be
maintainable.
</p>

<p id="p_73">28.  In the light of our discussion, we hold that the first respondent Society
is not an 'Authority' or 'State' as defined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_112">Article 12</a> of the  Constitution
of India.    It  is  also  not  a  "Body  or instrumentality" as could be made
amenable to writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_113">Article  226</a>  of  Constitution  of  India;
hence  the  Writ Petition filed against it is not maintainable and the same is
dismissed.  No costs.  We approve the  Division  Bench  decision  rendered  in
W.P.Nos.   1043 and 1 896 of 2002 and 23534 and 26501 of 2001 dated 26-02-2002  
(A.V.  Sundaram and three others Vs.    The  District  Collector,  Trichy  and
another).  The  Reference is answered accordingly.  The connected W.P.M.P., is
closed.
