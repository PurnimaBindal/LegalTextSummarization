            I.A. No. 6865/2020
           Preface: -
</p><p id="p_3">           1.         The plaintiffs before me are seeking an injunction against the defendant
           from manufacturing, importing, marketing, advertising, promoting, selling
           and/or using plaintiff no. 1/RB Health (US) LLC's registered design i.e. design
           no. 271671, falling in class 28-02, in relation to a soap bar [hereafter referred to
           as the "subject design registration"].
</p>
<p id="p_4">           1.1.       There is the usual extrapolation of this prayer, which is, that an injunction
           is sought against the defendant in making use of any other design that combines
           RB Health (US) LLC's registered design in connection with the aforementioned
           activities.
</p>
<p id="p_5">           1.2.       Besides this, the plaintiffs also seek an injunction against the use of their
           tagline "be 100 % sure" and/or qua the trade dress/packaging as also the colour
           of the soap bar manufactured and/or sold by the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_6">           1.3.       Along with the aforementioned reliefs, consequential reliefs for
           surrendering offending material, such as advertising leaflets, labels, pamphlets,
           etcetera and stock bearing the subject design registration, whether packed or
           unpacked, are also sought.
</p>
<p id="p_7">           1.4.       Before I proceed further, I may indicate that plaintiff no. 1/RB Health
           (US) LLC would, hereafter, be referred to as "RB (US)". Likewise, plaintiff no.
           2/Reckitt Benckiser (India) Pvt. Ltd. would be referred to as "RB (India)" while
           the defendant/Dabur India Limited would be referred to as "Dabur".
           Collectively, though, wherever the context requires, RB (US) and RB (India)
           will be referred to as plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_8">           2.         These interim reliefs are sought in aid of the suit, in which, a panoply of
           final reliefs are sought such as permanent injunction, rendition of accounts,
           damages, as also the relief for delivering up the offending goods.

            2.1.        However, what is at the heart of the matter, at least at this stage, are two
           aspects.
</p>
<p id="p_10">               i.      First, as to whether or not Dabur has raised a credible challenge to the
                       validity of the RB (US)'s registered design?
             ii.       Second, as to whether Dabur, in using the offending trade dress, which
                       includes the taglines, the colour of the packaging, the colour of the soap
                       bar etcetera, has attempted to pass off the goods manufactured by it as
                       those originating from the plaintiffs' stables, so to speak?
</p>
<p id="p_11">           Background facts: -
</p>
<p id="p_12">           3.          Before I deal with the legal nitty-gritties, the following broad facts need
           to be noticed.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                      i.   RB (US) and RB (India) claim to be part of a multi-national going by
                           the name Reckiit Benckiser PLC. It is averred that as a group they are
                           into manufacture and sale of health and hygiene products which are
                           sold under well-known brands such as "Dettol", "Harpic", "Lizol".
                           While RB (US) is a company registered under the laws of State of
                           Delaware, USA and, as indicated above, is the owner of the subject
                           design registration, the authority to use the same, it is stated, has been
                           vested in RB (India).
</p><p id="p_14">                     ii.   It is claimed that RB (India) is also inter alia in the business of
                           manufacturing health care, home care and hygiene products. It is also
                           averred that RB (India), amongst other products, manufactures Dettol
                           soap bar.
</p><p id="p_15">                    iii.   Although, there is a reference to several registered designs, there are
                           two sets of registrations which are relevant for the purpose of this
                           case. The first set of registrations, which are relevant, are the design
                           registrations for soap bar bearing numbers 229435 and 229436 falling
           I.A.

                           in class 28-02. These registrations, it is claimed, were obtained by the
                          plaintiffs' group company on 21.05.2010, having a reciprocity date of
                          23.11.2009. The second design registration, which is relevant, is the
                          subject registration which was obtained, as adverted to hereinabove,
                          by RB (US) on 24.04.2015. The subject design registration [i.e.
                          271671] has a reciprocity date of 04.11.2014 and, as noticed above,
                          falls in class 28-02.
</p>
<p id="p_17">           4.         Intermingled with these facts, are assertions by the plaintiffs, that the
           Dettol antiseptic liquid was first marketed in United Kingdom in 1933. The
           attempt, perhaps, is to link the liquid soap with the soap bar. It is also asserted
           that the sword device was adopted by the plaintiffs, insofar as India was
           concerned, in 1999-2000.
</p>
<p id="p_18">           4.1.       There is also an assertion to the effect that the plaintiffs adopted the
           tagline "be 100% sure" in 2003 and, likewise, the other tagline i.e. "everyday
           protection against wide range of unseen germs" in 2010. It is also averred by the
           plaintiffs that they adopted and started using the packaging for their soap
           product which contains an overlapping plus sign in 2010. There is also a
           reference to the fact that in 2014 the plaintiffs commenced the use of another
           tagline i.e. "protection from 100 illness causing germs".
</p>
<p id="p_19">           4.2.       It appears that the purpose behind making a reference in the plaint to the
           dates when the aforementioned taglines and packaging were adopted is to
           bolster their claim that Dabur is guilty of committing the tort of passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_20">           5.         It is in this background that the plaintiffs have approached this Court with
           the instant action and sought interim reliefs given the fact that Dabur has
           introduced a soap bar with the "offending shape and configuration", under the
           brand name "SANITIZE", on 30.07.2020.

            5.1.       The suit came up for hearing before the Court for the first time on
           14.08.2020 when Mr. Hemant Singh entered appearance on behalf of Dabur.
           The plaintiffs were represented by Mr. Chander M. Lall, senior advocate. On
           that date, one of the issues which came to fore was whether or not there were
           known designs in public domain which were similar to the subject design
           registration.
</p>
<p id="p_23">           5.2.       Mr. Hemant Singh had, on that date, screen-shared the following two
           design registrations concerning Hindustan Unilever Limited [HUL].
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">           S. No.          Design Registration Number                       Class

           1.              233189                                           28-02

           2.              233190                                           28-02


</pre><p id="p_24">           5.3.       Given the fact that Mr. Hemant Singh had alluded to the possibility of
           other known designs being in public domain [i.e. published] which were,
           according to him, similar to the subject design registration, a direction was
           issued to the Controller of Design to furnish certified/uncertified copies of such
           design registrations, if an application, in that behalf, was moved by either party.
           Besides the aforesaid direction, the usual directions of issuing summons in the
           suit and notice in the captioned application were also issued.
</p>
<p id="p_25">           5.4.       Thus, having regard to the urgency expressed by the plaintiffs, Dabur
           filed a short affidavit-in-reply to the captioned application.
</p>
<p id="p_26">           5.5.       The arguments in the captioned application were heard, thereafter, on
           various dates and the judgement was finally reserved on 26.08.2020.
</p>
<p id="p_27">           Submissions on behalf of the plaintiffs: -
</p>
<p id="p_28">           6.         On behalf of the plaintiffs, Mr. Lall made the following broad
           submissions under the following two heads.

            Infringement of design registrations obtained by the plaintiffs: -
</p>
<p id="p_31">               i.     A comparison of the subject design registration and the Dabur's product
                      (i.e. the soap bar) would show that Dabur's soap bar, if not identically
                      shaped and configured, as the subject design registration, is an obvious
                      and fraudulent imitation of the same. Consequently, Dabur is guilty of
                      infringement or, more bluntly put, piracy, as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_1">Section 22</a>
                      of The Design Act, 2000 [in short "<a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_2">Designs Act</a>"].
             ii.      Once a prima facie case of infringement is established, ordinarily, an
                      injunction should follow. The rationale being that design rights have a
                      limited statutory timespan of 15 years. [See: <a href="/doc/1111824/" id="a_3">Telemecanique &amp; Contols
                      (I) Ltd. vs. Schneider Electric Industries SA</a>, 2002 (24) PTC 632 (Del)]
            iii.      The stand of Dabur that the subject design registration is not significantly
                      distinguishable from the known design or combination of known designs,
                      as the plaintiffs are the owner of the 2009 design is flawed. [See: <a href="/doc/357948/" id="a_4">Section
                      6(4)(b)</a> of the Designs Act.] This provision permits similar designs to be
                      registered albeit by the same proprietor. Thus, the subject design
                      registration cannot be invalidated only because it has features which are
                      common with the 2009 design. The fact that RB (US) and RB (India) are
                      part of the Reckitt Benkiser group of companies is sufficient to fulfil the
                      requirement of common proprietor as provided in <a href="/doc/236686/" id="a_5">Section 6(4)</a> of the
                      Designs Act.
</p><p id="p_32">             iv.      Dabur's reliance on the 2010 design registrations of HUL is futile for two
                      reasons.
</p><p id="p_33">                          a) First, these designs were registered after the plaintiffs had obtained
                             the 2009 design registration.
</p><p id="p_34">                          b) Second, the HUL registration of 2010 claim rights only in the
                             colour or combination of colours applied to its product and not in
                             its shape and configuration.

               v.      Dabur's reliance on third-party registrations made outside India prior to
                      2009 cannot help its cause for the following reasons:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                          a) Firstly, the designs registrations relied upon are not similar to the
                             2009 design or the subject design registration of the plaintiffs.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                          b) Secondly, the registrations made outside the country is not a

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                          c) Thirdly, the design registrations relied upon do not constitute prior
                             publication.

                                A. In support of this submission, it was argued that World
                                     Intellectual Property Organisation [WIPO] search report
                                     filed by Dabur does not disclose when the said organisation
                                     published the searches placed on record by Dabur along with
                                     its affidavit-in-reply. Countries publish only one view of the
                                     design registration for the purposes of search being carried
                                     out by the public at large which does not assist in reaching a
                                     conclusion as to whether or not that particular design is
                                     similar to any other design.

           7.5.       The fact that there are other entities which manufacture and sell soap bars
           that bear the shape and configuration similar to the 2009 design and the subject

            iii.      The subject design registration is invalid as it is neither novel nor original
                      in view of the aforementioned prior designs. In this behalf, reliance was

                      cancellation of registration available under <a href="/doc/187077/" id="a_18">Section 19</a> of the Designs Act
                      can be invoked, as defence, in an action for design infringement. In this
                      context, reference was made to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1643916/" id="a_19">Section 22</a> (3) of the

                      registered in 2015 bearing a priority date of 04.11.2014.
             vi.      The test of novelty is that the suit design must be substantially different in
                      its visual appeal and effect when compared to an earlier known design. In
                      other words, the suit design should not be merely a trade variant of an
                      earlier known design. [See: Baldev Singh vs. Shiram Footware, 1997
                      (17) PTC 268]
           vii.       The fact that the subject design registration is invalid is demonstrable, if
                      regard is had to the 2009 registration. In this behalf, reference was made
                      to the averments made in paragraph 32 of the plaint. In this context, it

                       fail for the reason that the two designs are owned by separate juridical
                      entities. In other words, since the proprietor/owner of the 2009 design and
                      the subject design registration are not common, the saving provision,
                      which is, subsection (4) of <a href="/doc/682228/" id="a_21">Section 6</a> of the Designs Act would not help
                      the cause of the plaintiffs. Therefore, the logical corollary should be that
                      the subject design registration is declared invalid on the ground of lack of
                      novelty and/or originality when compared to the known design which, in
                      this case, apart from other designs that are in public domain, is the 2009

                      there is a credible challenge put forth with regard to its validity on the
                      ground of lack of novelty. The subject design registration not being
                      "substantially different" from earlier known designs, as is sought to be
                      demonstrated by reference to other registered designs published both in

            [which is, the colour green]; the colour of the soap bar [which is orange in
           colour]; and the use of generic and descriptive phrases or taglines. None of
           these features can be made subject matter of proprietary rights. There are only a
           limited number of colours available in the universe and, especially, in the sphere
           of soap bars which are promoted as disinfectants.
</p>
<p id="p_56">           9.1.       Likewise, the plaintiffs cannot, in law, claim proprietorship of generic or
           descriptive trademarks and taglines as they are common to the trade as also the
           English language.
</p>
<p id="p_57">           9.2.       Marks which are descriptive cannot be monopolised and, therefore, no
           passing off action will lie against its use. [<a href="/doc/39264970/" id="a_28">Marico Ltd. vs. Agro Tech</a>, 2010
           SCC OnLine Del 3806]

           9.3.       Since the taglines or descriptive marks are not registered, therefore, no
           case of infringement can be made out by the plaintiffs. The mere fact that the
           label is registered does not give rights in the descriptive marks. In this behalf,
           reference was made to <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_29">Section 17</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 [in short

<p id="p_58">           9.4.       An action for passing off would be maintainable only if the trademark
           used by the defendant or the overall get-up and trade dress is similar to the
           plaintiffs' trademark or trade dress. The deception, must lead to confusion with
           regard to the origin of the goods. Thus, an allegation of passing off cannot be
           sustained where the defendant's product can easily be distinguished. The
           present matter is one such case.

<p id="p_59">           9.5.       When the competing packaging and products are examined, it is clear that

           9.6.       Dabur itself has been using the green colour for its packaging in respect
           of soap bars manufactured and sold by it in the international market.
           Furthermore, the plaintiffs themselves have been using different colours for
           packaging their Dettol-brand soap bars and, therefore, the claim of exclusivity
           qua the green-colour is flawed.

<p id="p_62">           9.7.       The plaintiffs have failed to establish that the packaging used by them

           9.9.       The plaintiffs have failed to make out a prima facie for grant of
           injunction. Dabur has been in the business of manufacture and sale of soap bars

           comparative chart of various design registrations. Secondly, the get-

<p id="p_69">           11.        The first table, which sets out prior publications of known designs, to my
           mind, prima facie establishes that there is a serious and credible challenge that
           the subject design registration is new or original. The principle feature of the
           subject design registration is the rounded corners and the two "dimples" on
           either side of the soap bars. The prior designs which were published by Unilever
           on 28.02.1989 and 31.01.1995 are similar to the subject design registration [as
           is apparent to an instructed eye]. The main features of the soap bars i.e. rounded
           corners and dimpled sides are apparent in both the subject design registration as
           also the aforementioned prior publications.

<p id="p_72">           11.2. The argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs that the WIPO search
           report does not disclose the date of publication is, on the face of it, incorrect.
</p>
<p id="p_73">           11.3. Document - 2 filed with Dabur's short-affidavit-in-reply, which is, the
           extract from WIPO search report adverts to the date of the publication.
</p>
<p id="p_74">           11.4. The submission of Mr. Lall that registrations of the known and similar
           designs made outside the country would not ipso facto lead to cancellation of
           designs registered in India under <a href="/doc/841246/" id="a_34">Section 19(1)(a)</a> of the Designs Act unless
           such designs are registered in India as per the statutory protocol provided, in
           that behalf, is correct.
</p>
<p id="p_75">           11.5. That being said, a design which is registered abroad can be protected, in
           India, provided an application for that purpose is made with the concerned
           authorities in India within a period of six (6) months from the date when the
           protection is sought qua the design in the United Kingdom or other convention
           countries or group of countries which are members of inter-governmental
           organisation. The applicant can be either the person who initially applied for
           protection of the design either alone or jointly with any other person. In such an
           eventuality, the applicant would be entitled to claim that the registration under
           the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_35">Designs Act</a> is prior to other applicants and shall, thus, have the same
           priority date as the date of the application where it was first preferred [i.e. the

            12.1. The ocular impression should be the same as one would experience of the
           design-in-issue if it were to be applied to a physical object. If such a situation
           obtains, as it does, in this case, in my view, then, it would fall within the
           purview of <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_37">Section 4(b)</a> of the Designs Act.
</p>
<p id="p_79">           12.2. In other words, the prior publication [in this case of Unilever] would
           fulfil the indicia of being in 'tangible form' or use prior to the date of filing. In
           the instant case, as noticed above, the Unilever designs were published on
           28.02.1989 and 31.01.1995. These designs give the same visual impression
           which one would obtain when applied to the concerned article i.e. a soap bar.
           [See: <a href="/doc/3849421/" id="a_38">Reckitt Benkiser India Ltd. vs. Wyeth Ltd</a>., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 1096]

</p><p id="p_80">           13.        Therefore, the argument advanced by Mr. Lall that the extracts from the
           WIPO search do not come within the scope of <a href="/doc/854491/" id="a_39">Section 4(b)</a> of the Designs Act
           is untenable and, hence, rejected. The said provision, when read with <a href="/doc/1245787/" id="a_40">Section
           19(1)(b)</a>, and juxtaposed with the circumstances brought to fore in this case, at
           least at this stage, presents a credible challenge to the validity of the subject
           design registration.
</p>
<p id="p_81">           14.        At this juncture, I may also indicate that on behalf of Dabur, Mr. Singh
           had submitted that the assertions made in paragraph 32 of the plaint would,
           without more, establish that the subject design registration is neither new nor
           novel. The relevant extract from paragraph 32 of the plaint is set forth hereafter.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                      "32. On the aspect of shape comparison, it is submitted that for purposes of
                      passing off, the test is of an ordinary and unwary customer with imperfect
                      recollection, i.e. the test is of a man who may have seen the Plaintiff's product at one
                      given point of time and has a faint recollection of the former. To such a person, the
                      Defendant's soap would be considered deceptively and confusingly similar to
                      Plaintiff's 2010 shape as well as the 2015 shape. An unwary customer would largely
                      be attracted by the overall outer shape of the two products with the unusual
                      dimple/dip on both sides. It is submitted that none of the other soaps have this feature.
                      Most soaps available in the market are either rectangular or rectangular with
                      round/oval edges. None of the leading soaps in the market have the unique dimple/dip
                      on both sides."

           14.1. Mr. Lall, when confronted with this assertion in the plaint, sought refuge
           in the provisions of <a href="/doc/357948/" id="a_41">Section 6(4)(b)</a> of the Designs Act. Based on the said
           provision, Mr. Lall argued that the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_42">Designs Act</a> permits similar designs to be
           registered by the same proprietor. It was contended that the similarity of the
           subject design registration with the 2009 design would not invalidate the
           former.
</p>
<p id="p_84">           15.        In my view, this argument would hold well if the proprietor of the subject
           design registration and the 2009 design were the same person/entity. The
           proprietor of the subject design registration is RB (US) while the proprietor of
           2009 design is Reckitt Benckiser (Overseas) Health Limited.
</p>
<p id="p_85">           15.1. A design is a tangible asset, which, in law, can have only one proprietor
           as, in law, like any other asset, it would bear a value. None of the judgements
           cited by Mr. Lall rail against this proposition. The argument that the two
           designs are owned by a group of concerns which fall under the same corporate
           umbrella is not good enough to fall within the framework of <a href="/doc/357948/" id="a_43">Section 6(4)(b)</a> of
           the designs Act.
</p>
<p id="p_86">           16.        Therefore, to my mind, this aspect as well presents a credible challenge
           insofar as the plaintiffs seek to invoke their statutory rights under the <a href="/doc/931654/" id="a_44">Designs

           forth hereafter.
</p>
<p id="p_90">               i.     First, the plaintiff must be able to establish that it has the necessary
                      goodwill and reputation in the goods sold or services offered to the
                      consumers at large which in turn should be interlinked with the get-up in
                      which they are proffered.
</p>
<p id="p_91">             ii.      Second, the plaintiff must be able to demonstrate that the defendant's
                      misrepresentation qua the goods or services offered by him have led
                      consumers to believe that they originate from the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_92">            iii.      Third, that the action of the defendant has resulted in damage or is likely
                      to result in damage on account of the misrepresentation of the defendant
                      with regard to the origin of the goods and services.
</p>
<p id="p_93">           17.1. The aforesaid principles were reiterated in Consorzio Del Prosciutto Di
           Parma vs. Asda Stores Limited and Others, [2001] UKHL 7; and <a href="/doc/19997394/" id="a_45">Harrods
           Limited vs. Harrodian School Limited</a>, 1996 RPC 697.
</p>
<p id="p_94">           17.2. It is pertinent to note, while applying the first indicia set out hereinabove,
           the difference between reputation and goodwill has to be borne in mind. While
           goodwill is inextricably linked to territory, reputation may extend beyond the
           geographical area where business is carried out. [See: Kerley Law of
           Trademarks and Tradenames, 15th edition, paragraph 18-025, page 580]

           17.3. Therefore, in a case, where a plaintiff institutes a passing off action, it is
           incumbent upon him to demonstrate that he has inter alia goodwill in the
           jurisdiction over which the concerned Court has sway.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                      "39. Consequently, this brings me to the submission of the plaintiffs that the
                      defendant's use of the infringed mark constitutes passing off. In this connection, let me
                      reiterate the well known parameters of what constitutes passing off. Passing off as is
                      ubiquitously held in most jurisdictions subject to usual turn of phrase or change of
                      phraseology, a tort of false representation, whether intentional or unintentional
                      whereby, one person attempts to sell his goods or services as those manufactured or
                      rendered by another which is "calculated" to damage the goodwill of that other
                      person. Thus, the necessary ingredients which a plaintiff in an action of passing off is
                      required to prove, is the:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                      (i) employment of deception. Mere confusion will not suffice;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                      (ii) intent is not a necessary as long as the unwary consumer is deceived; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                      (iii) the act of the tort should injure the goodwill not just his reputation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                      The cause of action for passing off are premised on the "classical trinity" form or the
                      extended form. A "classical form" of passing off is one where a person seeks to trade
                      his goods as those originating from another; thus injuring such person's individual
                      business and goodwill. Extended form of passing off is one where court's seek to
                      protect "shared goodwill" accruing in favour of a class of traders; for example, on
                      account of geographical connotations, [see J. Bollinger SA v. Costa Brava Wine Co
                      Ltd., (1960) R.P.C. 16 (in short the 'Champagne case'), Vine Products Ltd. v.
                      Mackenzie &amp; Co Ltd., (1969) R.P.C. 1 (in short the 'Sherry case'), Erven Warnink v.
                      J. Townend &amp; Sons, (1980) R.P.C. 31 (HL) (in short the 'Advocaat case') and Reckitt
                      Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden, (1990) R.P.C. 341 H.L]

                      39.1. In my view, the defendant cannot be said to have committed the tort of passing
                      off if the test set out above are applied to the facts obtaining in the instant case. The
                      defendant's trade mark "Bells Whip Topping" when looked at in the setting in which
                      the mark is affixed, which has a picture of a cake on the cover, leaves no doubt in my
                      mind that there is not even a slightest attempt to deceive by the defendant. The
                      defendant on the packaging has prominently alluded to the fact that the product is
                      being sold by it as 'Bell's' non-dairy 'Whip Topping'. Therefore, merely because it
                      uses on its packaging a colour scheme comprising of red, blue and white colours
                      would not, to my mind, be sufficient to constitute a tort of passing off."

           that Dabur has committed the tort of passing off is, broadly, pivoted on the
           following three grounds.

           smell of the soap bar - there is enough and more material to show that there are
           several soap bars in the market with similar features if not identical features.
</p>
<p id="p_103">           18.2. Likewise, insofar as the second and third aspects are concerned, which
           pertain to, the use of taglines and indications by Dabur that are similar to those
           taglines and indications used by the plaintiffs - it is required to be noticed that
           neither the taglines nor the indications/signs are registered with the trademark
           authority. Since the competing products, like others products in the market, are
           hygiene-products, the taglines and indications/signs used by the plaintiffs
           appear to be "customary" in the "current language" of the trade for the purpose
           of designating hygiene-products which includes soap bars. [See: Merz &amp; Kreel
           GmbH &amp; Co., Case C-517/99, European Court of Justice (2001)]

           18.3. That being said, one cannot quibble with the proposition that taglines or
           indications/signs, over a period of time, by their constant use, can get embedded
           in the minds of the customer so as to remind them of the origin of the goods.
</p>
<p id="p_104">           18.4. In other words, the taglines and indications/signs can, over a period of
           time, acquire a secondary meaning and/or significance whereby goods and
           services offered by the plaintiff can be distinguished from those of its
           competitors. This aspect, however, is a matter which falls in the realm of
           evidence. The evidence placed before the Court should be such which

            demonstrates distinctiveness. [See: <a href="/doc/172757974/" id="a_47">Rich Products Corporation &amp; Anr. vs. Indo
           Nippon Food Ltd</a>., 2010 SCC OnLine Del 734]

           18.5. The use of such taglines and indications/signs is not enough to establish
           distinctiveness. Therefore, financial figures placed on record with regard to
           sales turnover and advertising spend may point in the direction of the use of
           taglines and indications/signs but that, by itself, may not be enough to establish
           distinctiveness. [See: British Sugar PLC vs. James Robertson &amp; Sons, 1996
           RPC 281] The plaintiffs have not placed on record any surveys of customers,
           which would, at least prima facie, establish the distinctiveness of their taglines
           or indications/signs. I must add a caveat here that even surveys have to be
           looked at carefully, albeit, at the stage of trial as their outcome would be
           dependent on the sample and the quality of the questions put to the consumers.
</p>
<p id="p_106">           19.        It would be relevant to note that, at this juncture, there is no tangible
           material placed before me by the plaintiffs which would persuade me to hold
           that the taglines and indications/signs and other features referred to hereinabove
           remind the consumer of the plaintiffs' product.
</p>
<p id="p_107">           19.1. Besides this, as alluded to hereinabove, passing off action is a tort of
           deceit and when one looks at the get-up adopted by Dabur, it is clear, at least at
           this stage, that it does not intend to misrepresent that the soap bar manufactured
           by it originates from the plaintiffs. The packaging boldly bears the mark
           "Dabur". The background colour is dark green as against the packaging of the
           plaintiffs which has a combination of white and light green. Dabur's packaging



           bears a cross and a shield                     whereas that of the plaintiffs' bears a
           plus + sign.

            19.2. To my mind, even if the test of "imperfect memory" is applied [which, in
           any case, cannot be pressed too far], it does not have me conclude, at least at
           this stage, that Dabur's product could be confused with that of the plaintiffs'.
</p>
<p id="p_110">           19.3. Clearly when a consumer buys defendant's product, it cannot miss the
           word mark "Dabur".
</p>
<p id="p_111">           20.        In my opinion, the cumulative effect of the packaging adopted by Dabur
           is one which seeks to distinguish its product from that of the plaintiffs'. It needs
           to be emphasized that insofar as the shape and configuration is concerned, the
           same is not apparent to the consumer till such time the packaging is removed.
</p>
<p id="p_112">           21.        It has to be borne in mind that when a Court adjudicates upon an
           infringement or a passing off action, it is required to take into account, not only
           the rights of the plaintiff and the defendant, but also the interests of the public at
           large. While the plaintiff is interested in preserving and protecting the
           investment made by her/him in the mark so that she/he can derive maximum
           gains, the defendant asserts a countervailing right, which is, to attract maximum
           number of consumers. The public, on the other hand, seek creation of an
           environment which is conducive to a healthy competition amongst
           manufacturers and sellers.
</p>
<p id="p_113">           22.        I may also indicate that in a passing off action, while precedents are good
           for the purposes of alluding to the established principles, most cases turn on the
           facts obtaining in the matter. The following observations in the Jiff Lemon's
           case bring this aspect to the forefront, which practitioners and courts, need to
           bear in mind.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                      "Although your Lordships were referred in the course of the argument to a large
                      number of reported cases, this is not a branch of the law in which reference to other
                      cases is of any real assistance except analogically. ..."
