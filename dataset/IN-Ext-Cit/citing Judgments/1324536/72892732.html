</pre><p id="p_5">     Succinctly stated, the facts of the case are that

PW.1- Nahar Singh gave oral information (Ex.P/1) at Police

Station- Rawatbhata, alleging therein that I and Kailash

were sitting at the Tea Stall of Shankar at Jawara Kallan

Bus stand on 30.12.2005. While they were sitting at the

tea stall, accused appellants, namely, Jagdish, Babulal,

Devilal came there and they were armed with sword and

axes in their hands. Accused, Jagdish gave sword blow on

his hand, due to which he received injury upon his finger

of right hand. At that time, Kailash Meena, who was sitting
                              (4 of 27)
                                                      [CRLA-96/2009]

at tea stall, intervened, then all the accused persons

inflicted number of injuries to Kailash by sword and axe

and ran away from the place of occurrence, the aforesaid

incident was seen by the witnesses, namely, Prithviraj,

Gashi,   Devilal    and   Kalu.   According   to    complainant,

deceased Kailash he was cultivating the land of one Raju

Singh as labour from last some days.
</p>
<p id="p_6">     Upon     the    aforesaid     information     (Ex.P/1)    FIR

No.257/2005 was registered at Police Station Rawatbhata

under <a href="/doc/1599401/" id="a_22">Sections 341</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_23">323</a> and <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_24">307</a> of IPC and investigation

was commenced.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     During the course of investigation, police inspected

the site and prepared site plan, recorded the statements of

witnesses, so also, the injured persons were taken to the

hospital for treatment. The injured Nahar Singh (PW.1)

was examined by the doctor and injury report prepared by

the doctor was obtained for the purposes of investigation.

During treatment, Kailash Meena, died, therefore, police

added offence u/s 302 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_25">IPC</a> in the investigation. The

postmortem of the dead body of deceased, Kailash Meena,

was conducted by Dr. Rakesh Verma (PW.26), and

thereafter dead body of Kailash was handed over to the

family members of the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     In the investigation, the accused appellants were

arrested by the police and weapon of offences i.e. sword

and axes were recovered upon their information u/s 27 of

the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_26">Evidence Act</a>. The investigation resulted into the
                             (5 of 27)
                                                           [CRLA-96/2009]

submission of charge sheet against the accused appellants

in the court of Judicial Magistrate, Rawatbhata, for the

offences u/s 302, 307, 326, 341/34 and 4/25 of the Arms.

Act, from where the case was committed to the court of

learned Addl. Sessions Judge No.2, Chittorgarh, camp

Begun but later transferred to the court of Addl. Sessions

Judge (FT), Chittorgarh for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_9">     In the trial, after providing opportunity of hearing to

the accused appellants, charges were framed against the

accused appellants for the offences u/s 302, 307, 326,

341/34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a> and <a href="/doc/1555874/" id="a_28">Section 4</a>/<a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_29">25</a> of the Arms Act, but they

denied the charges and prayed for trial.

</p><p id="p_10">     During trial, statements of 26 prosecution witnesses

were recorded and 32 documents, so also articles were

also exhibited from the prosecution side. After recording

evidence    of   prosecution,   statements        of    the   accused

appellants were recorded u/s 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_30">Cr.P.C</a>., in which they

denied the allegations of prosecution witnesses levelled

against    them,    however,    no      defence        evidence    was

produced.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     The learned trial court after evaluating the entire

evidence led by the parties vide its judgment dated

19.12.2008 convicted the accused appellants for the

offences, mentioned herein above. The said judgment is

under challenge in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     At the threshold, learned counsel appearing on behalf

of appellants submitted that the appellants are not
                                (6 of 27)
                                                        [CRLA-96/2009]

challenging the incident but their challenge is to the extent

of finding for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_31">Section 302</a> of IPC on the

ground that as per complaint filed by the complainant,

Nahar Singh (PW.1) , there was no dispute or enmity of

accused appellants with deceased Kailash Meena. All the

appellant came on the spot for quarrel and to cause

injuries to him, when first injury was inflicted by sword by

the accused appellants on the person of Nahar Singh, he

raised his hand to protect his head, therefore, injury was

caused upon his finger. At that time all of sudden, Kailash

Meena, who was also sitting at the Tea Stall near Nahar

Singh, immediately came there for rescue, at that time,

accused appellants, namely, Devilal and Jagdish inflicted

injury   by   sword   upon     the     head   of   Kailash   Meena.

Thereafter all the accused inflicted number of injuries to

Kailash Meena and ran away from the place of occurrence.

It is also argued that upon the place of incident, Prithviraj

Gashi, Devilal and Kalu were also present, but they did not

come for rescue. Meaning thereby, the main ingredient

which is motive/intention for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_32">Section 302</a> of

IPC is missing in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     According to learned counsel for the appellants even

if the entire prosecution evidence is accepted, then also, it

is not a case for conviction for the offences under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_33">Section

302</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_34">302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_35">34</a> of IPC. As per prosecution case, all the

accused appellants came with deadly weapon to cause

injuries to complainant, Nahar Singh, however, when they
                               (7 of 27)
                                                      [CRLA-96/2009]

caused injury to Nahar Singh, the deceased, Kailash

Meena came there and intervened, therefore, injuries were

inflicted upon his body, but there was no evidence to

prove the fact that there was any enmity between the

accused appellants and Kailash Meena to cause death of

Kailash Meena.
</p>
<p id="p_14">        The accused appellants are behind the bars since

2005 and even if the entire prosecution evidence is

accepted, then also, the finding of conviction recorded by

the learned trial court for offences under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_36">Section 302</a> and

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_37">302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_38">34</a> of IPC is not sustainable in law because the main

ingredient      of motive/intention to     commit    murder, is

missing in this case, therefore, finding of guilt must be

altered to the offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_39">Section 304</a> Part I of IPC. In

support    of    his   arguments,     learned   counsel   for   the

appellants drew our attention towards the following cases

laws:
</p>
<p id="p_15">  1. Pulicherla Nagarju Vs. State of A.P. reported in

        (2006) 11 SCC 444.
</p>

        (2) Cr.L.R. (Raj.) 668.
</p>

        (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 316.

<p id="p_18">  4. Murlidhar Shivram Patekar &amp; Anr. Vs. State of

        Maharashtra reported in 2014 (4) Crimes 233

        (SC).
</p><p id="p_19">                              (8 of 27)
                                                        [CRLA-96/2009]

      Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor vehemently

argued that there is no force in the arguments of learned

counsel for the accused appellant that as per evidence of

this case no offence u/s 302 of 302/34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_40">IPC</a> is made out

because all the three appellants were having swords and

axe   in   their   hands,   came     at   the   tea   stall,   where

complainant, Nahar Singh (PW.1) and Kailash Meena

(deceased) and other persons were sitting. At that time

first of all accused appellant, namely, Jagdish inflicted

injury upon Nahar Singh, the complainant raised his hand

to protect his head, therefore, injury was caused upon the

finger of his right hand. The deceased, Kailash Meena, who

was also sitting at the tea stall on seeing the accused

appellants assaulting complainant intervened to rescue

Nahar Singh, therefore, all the accused appellants caused

injuries to him by swords and axe, and on account of those

injuries suffered by him, Kailash Meena died during

treatment at Hospital. At the time of incident, one

Prithviraj, Devilal, Kalu Bheel and Ghasi were present but

none of them intervened due to fear but they supported

the prosecution case.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      Learned Public Prosecutor further submit that the

above incident has been proved by the prosecution on the

basis of statements of injured eye witness PW.1 Nahar

Singh (author of FIR), PW.8, Kalu Lal, PW.16, Tulsi Ram,

PW.19 Devilal, PW.20 Prithviraj and PW.21 Ghasilal, the

witnesses categorically stated on oath before the court
                             (9 of 27)
                                                    [CRLA-96/2009]

that they were sitting at the tea stall of Shanker Meena on

30.12.2005 situated at Village Jawara Kallan Bus stand,

where Jagdish, Devilal and Babulal came with weapons

there and assaulted Nahar Singh by swords. When

deceased, Kailash Meena, who was also sitting there, tried

to save Nahar Singh, he too was assaulted by the accused

appellants in the said incident. Due to injuries caused to

the person of Kailash Meena, he died, therefore, finding of

conviction is based upon reliable and trustworthy evidence

on record.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the accused

appellants are    not   disputing the      incident, therefore,

obviously it is a case in which the accused appellants are

admitting that prosecution has proved the occurrence

beyond reasonable doubt. He further argued that although

no   evidence     came    on      record    with   regard      to

motive/intention for the incident in question, but this Court

cannot lose sight of the fact that all the three accused

persons came on the spot with sword and axe and they

inflicted number of injuries to deceased, Kailash Meena,

for no reasons, therefore, it cannot be said that it is a case

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, more so it

is a case of murder.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     While inviting our attention towards the postmortem

report (Ex.P/32) dated 30.12.2005 it is submitted that Dr.

Rakesh Verma (PW.26) stated before the court that during

postmortem 17 injuries were found upon the body of
                                 (10 of 27)
                                                              [CRLA-96/2009]

deceased, and out of 17 injuries, injuries caused upon the

head of the deceased was the cause of death. Therefore,

intention can be gathered from the fact that number of

injuries were caused to deceased, Kailash Meena. He thus

submitted that instant appeal may kindly be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_23">     After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, it is

obvious from the arguments of learned counsel for the

appellants that the appellants are not disputing the

incident but they are challenging the finding of conviction

</p><p id="p_25">     The statements of Nahar Singh (PW.1) were recorded

during trial in which he has reiterated the allegations

levelled by him in his complaint (Ex.P/1) upon which FIR

was registered. The other witnesses categorically proved

the incident, which took place on 30.12.2015 at Tea Stall

of Shanker, situated at Jawara Kallan Bus stand. It is also

admitted case that all the articles including two swords

and axe were sent for chemical examination to the FSL

and in the FSL report (Ex.P/19) no blood was found upon

the axe and one sword, whereas blood of „A‟ group was

upon found one sword recovered from the accused

appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_26">     We have minutely scanned the entire evidence to

ascertain the motive behind the incident. As per contention

of Nahar Singh (PW.1), the accused appellants came on

the spot with deadly weapon and caused injury to him but

Kailash Meena, who was sitting behind him at the teal

stall, intervened to save him, therefore, number of the
                                    (12 of 27)
                                                                 [CRLA-96/2009]

injuries were caused to him in the presence of other

witnesses. There is no evidence on record with regard to

enmity or previous quarrel of the accused appellants with

deceased, Kailash Meena. More so, the author of FIR

Nahar Singh (PW.1) nowhere stated in the FIR that there

was any dispute or enmity in between deceased, Kailash

Meena      and     the    accused       appellants.      None      of   other

witnesses disclosed any fact with regard to enmity in

between Kailash Meena and the accused appellant but all

the witnesses accepted that all three accused appellants

came on the spot and caused injury upon Nahar Singh, at

that time, Kailash Meena immediately came for rescue.

PW.1 Nahar Singh specifically stated in his statement

before the court that, "30-12-2005         dks tkoja k dyka xkoa esa "kd

that there was no quarrel or enmity for which the accused

appellants came on the spot to cause injuries to Nahar

Singh. Therefore, it is obvious there was no motive or

intention of the accused appellants to cause death of
                                    (13 of 27)
                                                                [CRLA-96/2009]

Kailash Meena, therefore, obviously it is a case of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder.

<p id="p_27">         In the case of Pulicherla Nagarju Vs. State of A.P.

reported in (2006) 11 SCC 444, the Hon‟ble Apex Court

enumerated some of the circumstances, relevant to finding

out whether there was any intention to cause death on the

part of the accused. The Hon‟ble Apex Court observed as

infra:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 "29 Therefore, the court should proceed to
         decide the pivotal question of intention, with
         care and caution, as that will decide whether the
         case falls under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_43">Section 302</a> or 304 Part I or
         304 Part II. Many petty or insignificant matters -
         plucking of a fruit, straying of a cattle, quarrel of
         children, utterance of a rude word or even an
         objectionable glance, may lead to altercations
         and group clashes culminating in deaths. Usual
         motives       lik e   revenge,         greed,    jealousy    or
         suspicion may be totally absent in such cases.
         There may be no intention. There may be no
         pre-meditation. In fact, there may not even be
         criminality. At the other end of the spectrum,
         there may be cases of murder where the
         accused attempts to avoid the penalty for
         murder by attempting to put forth a case that
         there was no intention to cause death. It is for
         the courts to ensure that the cases of murder
         punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_44">Section 302</a>, are not converted
         into offences punishable under Section 304 Part
         I/II,    or    cases    of    culpable          homicide    not
         amounting to murder, are treated as murder
         punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_45">Section 302</a>. The intention to
         cause death can be gathered generally from a

     combination of a few or several of the following,
     among other, circumstances : (i) nature of the
     weapon used; (ii) whether the weapon was
     carried by the accused or was picked up from the
     spot; (iii) whether the blow is aimed at a vital
     part of the body; (iv) the amount of force
     employed in causing injury; (v) whether the act
     was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden
     fight or free for all fight; (vi) whether the
     incident occurs by chance or whether there was
     any pre- meditation; (vii) whether there was any
     prior enmity or whether the deceased was a
     stranger; (viii) whether there was any grave and
     sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for such
     provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of
     passion; (x) whether the person inflicting the
     injury has taken undue advantage or has acted
     in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi) whether the
     accused dealt a single blow or several blows. The
     above list of circumstances is, of course, not
     exhaustive and there may be several other
     special   circumstances         with     reference      to
     individual cases which may throw light on the

reported in (2010) 3 SCC (Cri) 316, wherein injured

suffered 20 injuries in the incident, the Hon‟ble Apex Court

held that conviction u/s 304 Part I of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_46">IPC</a> by the High

Court does not require any interference. In the said case,

the trial acquitted the appellant therein, for the charges

by the Sate of Tamil Nadu, High Court reevaluated the

relevant paragraphs 18 to 22 of the said judgment of

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           "18. The deceased had received 20 incised
      injuries caused on various parts of the body in
      general and on vital parts of the body in
      particular. The deceased was killed mercilessly
      by inflicting twenty incised injuries and mostly
      on the vital parts of the body. Even if we accept
      the version of the High Court that the accused
      had the right of private defence, in the facts and
      circumstances of the case, but he had exceeded
      his right so he was convicted under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_53">section

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">           19. On examination of the injuries on the
      accused it is clearly borne out that those injuries
      are very minor and superficial in nature whereas
      twenty incised injuries inflicted on the deceased
      were of very serious nature and character. The
      Sessions Court has gravely erred in acquitting
      the accused on the face of the testimony of the
      witnesses in the case.

     Similarly, why PW2, nephew of the deceased
     would save the real assailant and falsely name

</p><p id="p_33">     In the case of Surinder Kumar (supra), this
Court has held as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_34">        "7. To invoke this Exception four
  requirements must be satisfied, namely,
</p><p id="p_35">        (i) it was a sudden fight; (ii) there was
  no premeditation; (iii) the act was done in a
  heat of passion; and (iv)The assailant had
  not taken any undue advantage or acted in
  a cruel manner. The cause of the quarrel is
  not relevant nor is it relevant who offered
  the provocation or started the assault. The
  number of wounds caused during the
  occurrence is not a decisive factor but what
  is important is that the occurrence must
  have been sudden and unpremeditated and
  the offender must have acted in a fit of
  anger. Of course, the offender must not
  have taken any undue advantage or acted
  in a cruel manner. Where, on a sudden
  quarrel, a person in the heat of the moment
  picks up a weapon which is handy and
  causes injuries, one of which proves fatal,
  he would be entitled to the benefit of this
  Exception provided he has not acted
  cruelly."
</p><p id="p_36">                                (emphasis supplied)



     Further in the        case of Arumugam v.
</p><p id="p_37">State,[2] in support of the proposition of law
that under what circumstances Exception 4
to <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_62">Section 300</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_63">IPC</a> can be invoked if death is
caused, it has been explained as under:-

</p><p id="p_38">        "18. The help of Exception 4 can be
  invoked if death is caused (a) without
  premeditation; (b) in a sudden fight; (c)
  without the offender‟s having taken undue
  advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
  manner; and (d) the fight must have been
  with the person killed. To bring a case
  within Exception 4 all the ingredients
  mentioned in it must be found. It is to be
  noted that the „fight‟ occurring in Exception
  4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_64">Section 300</a> IPC is not defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_65"> the
  Penal Code</a>, 1860. It takes two to make a
  fight. Heat of passion requires that there
  must be no time for the passions to cool

                                           [CRLA-96/2009]

  down and in this case, the parties had
  worked themselves into a fury on account of
  the verbal altercation in the beginning. A
  fight is a combat between two and more
  persons whether with or without weapons.
  It is not possible to enunciate any general
  rule as to what shall be deemed to be a
  sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and
  whether a quarrel is sudden or not must
  necessarily depend upon the proved facts of
  each case. For the application of Exception
  4, it is not sufficient to show that there was
  a sudden quarrel and there was no
  premeditation. It must further be shown
  that the offender has not taken undue
  advantage or acted in cruel or unusual
  manner. The expression „undue advantage‟
  as used in the provision means „unfair
  advantage‟."

<p id="p_39">
     Further in the case of <a href="/doc/1324536/" id="a_66">Satish Narayan
Sawant v. State of Goa</a>,[3] this Court has held
as under:
</p>
<p id="p_40">        " 24.      .......<a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_67">Section 300</a> IPC further
  provides for the Exceptions which will
  constitute culpable homicide not amounting
  to    murder     and    punishable       under
  <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_68">Section 304</a>. When and if there is intent and
  knowledge then the same would be a case
  of Section 304 Part I and if it is only a case
  of knowledge and not the intention to cause
  murder and bodily injury, then the same
  would be a case of Section 304 Part II.


</p><p id="p_41">        28. .........Records clearly establish that
  there was indeed a scuffle between the
  parties with regard to the availability of
  electricity in a particular room and during
  the course of scuffle the appellant also
  received an injury which was simple in
  nature and that there was heated exchange
  of words and scuffle between the parties
  before the actual incident of stabbing took
  place. There is, therefore, provocation and
  the incident happened at the spur of the
  moment. That being the factual position, we
  are of the considered view that the present
  case cannot be said to be a case under
  <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_69">Section 302</a> IPC but it is a case falling under
  Section304 Part II <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_70">IPC</a>. It is trite law that
  Section 304 Part II comes into play when
                          (19 of 27)
                                                      [CRLA-96/2009]

     the death is caused by doing an act with
     knowledge that it is likely to cause death
     but there is no intention on the part of the
     accused either to cause death or to cause
     such bodily injury as is likely to cause
     death." Thus, if there is intent and
     knowledge then the same would be a case
     of Section 304 Part I and if it is only a case
     of knowledge and not intention to cause
     murder and bodily injury then the same
     would fall under Section 304 Part II. We are
     inclined to the view that in the facts and
     circumstances of the present case, it cannot
     be said that the appellants/accused had any
     intention of causing the death of the
     deceased when they committed the act in
     question. The incident took place out of
     grave and sudden provocation and hence
     the accused are entitled to the benefit of
     Section 300 Exception 4 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_71">IPC</a>."
</p>
<p id="p_42">
       Thus, in entirety, considering the factual
scenario of the case on hand, the legal evidence
on record and in the background of legal
principles laid down by this Court in the cases
referred to supra, the inevitable conclusion is
that the act of the accused-appellants was not a
cruel act and the accused did not take undue
advantage of the deceased. The scuffle took
place in the heat of passion and all the

     In the present case, the counsel for the appellants is

not challenge the incident and their prayer is to alter the

conviction recorded against the accused appellants for the

offences u/s 302 and 302/34 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_77">IPC</a> to offence u/s 304

appellants came on the spot with a view to cause injuries

to him but upon intervention by Kailash Meena, they

inflicted number of injuries to Kailash Meena and out of 17

injuries caused by all the three appellants, two injuries

which were caused upon the head of deceased, were

sufficient to cause death.</blockquote><p id="p_44">

</p><p id="p_45">     We have perused the FIR as well as statements of

PW.1, Nahar Singh and other               eye   witnesses. Upon

consideration of facts stated by them, there is no dispute

that there was no enmity or any quarrel of accused

appellants with deceased, Kailash Meena. As per PW.1-

Nahar Singh, all the accused appellants came on the spot

for quarrelling with him and to cause injuries. According to

PW.1 Nahar Singh, appellants came there and when

accused Jagdish inflicted injury by sword, upon his head,

which was resisted by the complainant by raising his hand,

due to which he received injuries upon his right hand‟s

fingers. It is also undisputed that deceased, Kailash

Meena, who was sitting at the Tea Stall intervened for

protection of Nahar Singh, at that time, all the three

accused appellants inflicted injuries to him. It is also one

of the important fact that as per statement of PW.1- Nahar

Singh, there was no previous enmity or quarrel of

appellants    with    deceased,         Kailash    Meena.        More     so,

deceased, Kailash Meena was doing labour work on the

agricultural field of complainant, Nahar Singh. Therefore, it

is obvious that there was no enmity of the accused

appellants with deceased, Kailash Meena but all of sudden

when they were causing injuries to Nahar Singh, deceased

Kailash     Meena,    intervened          to   rescue        Nahar   Singh,

therefore, they caused injuries to him, which resulted into

his death.
</p>
<p id="p_46">       As per statement of PW.26, Dr. Rakesh Verma, out of

17 injuries two injuries which were caused on the head of

deceased, were opined to be sufficient to cause death but

upon consideration of evidence in the light of aforesaid

judgments, it is obvious that without there being any

intention of motive, injuries were caused to the deceased.

Therefore, it cannot be said that finding of learned trial

court holding the accused appellants guilty for offence

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_79">Section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_80">302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_81">34</a> of IPC is sustainable in law.

</p><p id="p_49">     In the case of Ankush Shivaji Gaikwad Vs. State

of Maharashtra reported in (2013) 6 SCC 770, the

Hon‟ble Supreme Court while considering <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_86">Section 357A</a> of

Cr.P.C.,   gave    following       directions    for        granting

compensation to the victim. The Hon‟ble Apex Court gave

direction that it is the mandatory duty of the Court to

apply its mind to the question in every criminal case

so   as    to   provide   compensation          or     to    refuse

compensation. The relevant paragraph 66 of the said

judgment reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">           "66. To sum up: While the award or refusal
     of compensation in a particular case may be
     within the Court's discretion, there exists a
     mandatory duty on the Court to apply its mind to
     the question in every criminal case. Application
     of mind to the question is best disclosed by
     recording     reasons      for     awarding/refusing
     compensation. It is axiomatic that for any
     exercise involving application of mind, the Court
     ought to have the necessary material which it
     would evaluate to arrive at a fair and reasonable
     conclusion. It is also beyond dispute that the
     occasion to consider the question of award of
     compensation would logically arise only after the
     court records a conviction of the accused.
     Capacity of the accused to pay which constitutes
     an important aspect of any order under <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_87">Section
     357</a> Cr.P.C. would involve a certain enquiry
     albeit summary unless of course the facts as
     emerging in the course of the trial are so clear
     that the court considers it unnecessary to do so.

     Such an enquiry can precede an order on
     sentence to enable the court to take a view, both
     on the question of sentence and compensation
     that it may in its wisdom decide to award to the
     victim or his/her family."</blockquote><p id="p_50">


</p><p id="p_51">     In the case of Suresh &amp; Anr. Vs. State of

Haryana reported in (2015) 2 SCC 227, the Hon‟ble

Supreme Court gave following verdict and held that it

is duty of the court, on              taking cognizance of a

criminal offence, to ascertain whether there is tangible

material to show commission of crime, whether the

victim is identifiable and whether the victim of crime

needs immediate financial relief. On being satisfied on

an application or its own motion court ought to direct

for granting of interim compensation subject to final

compensation being determined later. The relevant

paragraphs 15 to 18 of the said judgment reads as

under: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                "15. We are informed that 25 out of 29
     S t at e     Governments      have   notified   victim
     compensation schemes. The schemes specify
     maximum limit of compensation and subject to
     maximum limit, the discretion to decide the
     quantum has been left with the State/District
     legal authorities. It has been brought to our
     notice that even though almost a period of five
     years has expired since the enactment of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_88">Section
     357A</a>, the award of compensation has not
     become a rule and interim compensation, which

is very important, is not being granted by the
Courts. It has also been pointed out that the
upper limit of compensation fixed by some of the
States is arbitrarily low and is not in keeping
with the object of the legislation.</blockquote><p id="p_52">

</p><p id="p_53">     16. We are of the view that it is the duty of
the Courts, on taking cognizance of a criminal
offence, to ascertain whether there is tangible
material to show commission of crime, whether
the victim is identifiable and whether the victim
of crime needs immediate financial relief. On
being satisfied on an application or on its own
motion, the Court ought to direct grant of
interim    compensation,           subject   to     final
compensation being determined later. Such duty
continues at every stage of a criminal case
where compensation ought to be given and has
not been given, irrespective of the application by
the victim. At the stage of final hearing it is
obligatory on the part of the Court to advert to
the provision and record a finding whether a
case for grant of compensation has been made
out and, if so, who is entitled to compensation
and how much. Award of such compensation can
be interim. Gravity of offence and need of victim
are some of the guiding factors to be kept in
mind, apart from such other factors as may be
found relevant in the facts and circumstances of
an individual case.

<p id="p_54">     17. We are also of the view that there is
need to consider upward revision in the scale for
compensation and pending such consideration to
adopt the scale notified by the State of Kerala in
its scheme, unless the scale awarded by any
other State or Union Territory is higher. The
States of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh,

     In the case of Parivartan Kendra Vs. Union of

India &amp; Ors. reported in (2016) 3 SCC 571, the

Hon‟ble Apex Court again considered the question of

granting compensation to the victim for rehabilitation.

The relevant paragraphs 18 and 19 of the said

judgment read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">          "18. On perusal of various contentions and
     evidence, we find it imperative to mention that
     even after this Court having passed an order
     dated 06.02.2013 directing the Union of India
     and States to implement compensation payable
     to acid attack victims by creation of a separate
     fund, only 17 States have been notified of the
     Victim Compensation Schemes (VCS). Out of
     which 7 states and 4 Union territories have not
     initiated the VSC. Even in those States where the
     Scheme has been implemented               a   meager
     compensation ranging between Rs.25,000/- to
     Rs. 2 lakhs is provided for medical care. And
     many     States     have         not   provided      any
     compensation      for rehabilitation at all. In the
     present case, the Govt. of Bihar has fixed a
     pitiable amount of Rs.25,000/- for the victims of
     acid attack.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">           19. The Guidelines issued by orders in the
     Laxmi's case are proper, except with respect to
     the compensation amount. We just need to
     ensure that these guidelines are implemented
     properly. Keeping in view the impact of acid
     attack on the victim on his social, economical
     and personal life, we need to enhance the
     amount of compensation. We cannot be oblivious
     of the fact that the victim of acid attack requires
     permanent treatment for the damaged skin. The
     mere amount of Rs. 3 lakhs will not be of any
     help to such a victim. We are conscious of the
     fact that enhancement of the compensation
     amount will be an additional burden on the
     State. But prevention of such a crime is the
     responsibility of the State and the liability to pay
     the enhanced compensation will be of the State.

     two ways:-
