<p id="p_2">2.     The plaintiff has filed the present suit seeking a permanent
injunction against the defendants on their use of the trade mark

 infringement of copyright and design with regard to similar shape of
part of the articles.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     Alongwith the suit, plaintiff filed an application being I.A.
No.13880/2012 under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC. The suit as well as
the interim application were listed before Court on 1st August, 2012
when an ex-parte order was passed restraining the defendants from
using the trademark, PARALITE or any other trademark deceptively
similar to the plaintiff's trademark, PARACHUTE and PARACHUTE
LITE in relation to edible coconut oil and also restraining defendants
from using packaging that is deceptively similar to that of the
plaintiff's packaging in respect of edible coconut oil sold under the
trademark, PARACHUTE.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     The interim order was passed on 1st August, 2012 i.e. two
years ago. The matter is at the stage of evidence. Learned counsel
for the defendants is insisting for hearing of the applications though
suggestion was given to expedite the evidence and hearing of the
main suit itself. As he is not agreeable, the Court is left with no option
but to hear the interim applications.

<p id="p_5">5.     The plaintiff is seeking an injunction against the defendants -

      from infringing the registered copyright A64997/2003 by

</p><p id="p_8">6.      The plaintiff claims that the plaintiff became the owner inter alia
of the trade mark PARACHUTE in respect of coconut oils, edible oils
etc. in the year 2000 when it bought the same vide a Deed of
Assignment dated 31st May, 2000 from Bombay Oil Industrial Pvt.
Ltd. The mark PARACHUTE had been adopted in the year 1948 and
was extensively and uninterruptedly in use in respect of coconut oil
and an undisputed market leader in this segment in the year of the
assignment.
</p><p id="p_9">7.      The trade mark PARACHUTE of the plaintiff was first registered
on 31st July, 1978 as part of a composite mark under number 339152

June, 2013. The second design registration No. 180785 of the
plaintiff for the mouth cap of the container is valid upto 15th
November, 2014.
</p><p id="p_14">11.    The plaintiff has detailed the sales and promotional figures for
the mark PARACHUTE for the years 2001-2011in its plaint.
</p><p id="p_15">12.    It is averred in the plaint that the plaintiff became aware of use
of the mark PARALITE from the Trade Mark Journal 1424 of 16th
September, 2009, where application No.1479090 of the defendants
for registration of the mark PARALITE was advertised. The plaintiff
opposed the said application of the defendants on 8th December,
2009. The opposition filed by the defendants is pending. The
defendants were served a copy of the opposition by the Trade Marks
Registry vide a letter dated 23rd March, 2012.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(OS) No.2304/2012                                       Page 6 of 41</span>
<p id="p_17"> 13.    Upon service, the defendants filed the written statement and
reply to the interim application. They also filed an application under
Order 39 Rule 4 CPC seeking discharge and/or variation of the ex-
parte injunction order dated 1st August, 2012 on various grounds. The
said grounds are briefly listed below:
</p><p id="p_18">(i)   The ex-parte order was obtained by the plaintiff by making
      misrepresentation as it was stated in the plaint that the notice of
      opposition was served upon the defendants in the year 2009
      itself and no counter statement had been filed by the defendants
      to contest the said proceedings. But the correct position is that a
      counter statement was filed within the time prescribed. The
      plaintiff thus being guilty of concealment of material facts is not
      entitled to enjoy the fruits of an ex-parte ad-interim injunction.
</p><p id="p_19">(ii) While seeking ex-parte injunction, an impression was given by
      the plaintiff that the features of a device of coconut tree as also a
      device of two halves of an open coconut and the blue bottle were
      registered as a copyright in favour of the plaintiff but neither a
      device of tree nor two halves of an open coconut nor a blue



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS) No.2304/2012                                             Page 7 of 41</span>
      coloured label was registered as a copyright in favour of the
     plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_20">(iii) Many manufacturers engaged in the trade relating to coconut oil
     both in the edible as well as hair oil segments have been using a
     blue coloured bottle/container with a device of coconut tree and
     two halves of an open coconut on the packaging.           The blue
     coloured bottles/containers have become publici juris in respect
     of the containers/bottles for packing coconut oil both in edible oil
     as well as hair oil segments and the same is a feature which is
     "common to trade" and no exclusivity could be claimed by the
     plaintiff in any manner whatsoever either under the concept of
     trade dress for the purposes of passing off or even in the
     concept of a subsisting copyright claim in respect thereof as the
     plaintiff could not claim that such a feature was original work
     emanating from the plaintiff or its predecessor. The plaintiff
     cannot seek exclusivity in respect of coconut tree and two halves
     of the coconut. Even the Registrar of Trade Marks had also put
     disclaimers on the Trademark registrations of the plaintiff on "a
     device of coconut tree as also a device of two halves of an
     open coconut" which happens to be a bonafide description of
     the product itself and each and every manufacturer in the trade
     has a bonafide right to use such description in accordance with
     <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_1">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to
     as the "Act"). The Registrar of Trademarks has also put a
     disclaimer as to the non exclusivity to various parts appearing in
     some registrations claimed by the plaintiff on the "device of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS) No.2304/2012                                          Page 8 of 41</span>
      coconut tree" as also the word "lite" and all other descriptive
     matters appearing in such label registrations. The said facts
     were not disclosed by the plaintiff while seeking the ex-parte
     order of injunction.
</p><p id="p_21">(iv) That no exclusive rights in the word "lite" could be claimed as the
     same refers to the character of the product in as much as the
     same       signifies   that   "light"   nature   of   the   oil.   Several
     manufacturers in the trade are using the suffix "LITE" in relation
     their coconut oil as also in relation to various other edible oils.
</p><p id="p_22">(v) That the plaintiff also failed to disclose to this Court that even the
     prefix PARA in relation to coconut oil has become "publici juris"
     and common to trade by virtue of a substantial number of
     manufacturers using such names with the prefix PARA regularly
     in the course of their business. The details of such marks are
     mentioned in para 10 of the application under Order 39 Rule 4
     CPC. The word PARA is not merely common to trade but is also
     common to register in view of the huge number of registrations in
     name of various third parties pending before the Registrar of
     Trademarks. The details of the same are mentioned in para 11
     of the defendants' application under Order 39 Rule 4 of CPC.
</p><p id="p_23">(vi) Application under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 of CPC is also liable to
     be dismissed in view of the fact that the plaintiff itself has made
     an admission in plaint as to the cause of action arising in the
     matter in the year 2009 when the plaintiff came to know of the
     activities of the defendant but has taken over three long years to
     approach the Court. Such knowledge has been specifically


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) No.2304/2012                                                Page 9 of 41</span>
       admitted in the cross examination of PW-1 also. The plaintiff
      having failed to take appropriate injunctive remedy swiftly
      against the defendants and having allowed the defendants to
      grow their business is not entitled to continuance of interim
      injunction on the ground of inordinate delay in approaching this
      Court. The balance of convenience is also in favour of the
      defendants.
</p><p id="p_24">14.    Various decisions are referred by the learned counsel for the
defendants during the course of hearing as well as in the written
submissions.
</p><p id="p_25">15.    From the entire record and submissions addressed from both
sides, this Court is of the view that the following points are necessary
to be considered for the purpose of deciding the pending
applications:
</p><p id="p_26">(i)   Whether the trademark used by defendants i.e. Paralite is
      deceptively similar to plaintiff's registered trademark
      Parachute/Parachute lite?
</p><p id="p_27">(ii) Whether the word PARA is common to the trade and what
      is the effect of disclaimer imposed by the Trademark
      Registry on a device of coconut tree, a device of two
      halves of an open coconut and the word PARA?
</p><p id="p_28">(iii) Whether the colour scheme used by the defendants is
      common to trade and no monopoly can be claimed by the
      plaintiff under the law of copyright and passing off?
</p><p id="p_29">(iv) The delay, if any, on part of the plaintiff for bringing the
      action before this Court.
</p>

<p id="p_30"> (v) Whether the plaintiff is guilty of suppression of material
      facts?
</p><p id="p_31">Test of infringement
</p><p id="p_32">16.    It is to be examined as to whether the trademark used by the
defendants i.e. PARALITE is deceptively similar to the trademarks of
the plaintiffs i.e. PARACHUTE and PARACHUTE LITE or not. The
products in question are hair oil /edible oil. The case of the plaintiff is
that PARALITE is         deceptively similar to      PARACHUTE and
PARACHUTE LITE.

deception or to cause any association with the registered trade mark.
</p><p id="p_36">19.    It is settled law that in order to prove the case for infringement
of trade mark, the plaintiff has to show that the essential features of
the registered trade mark which has been adopted by the defendant
has been taken out from the plaintiff's registered trademark. Only the
marks are to be compared by the Court and in case the registration is
granted in favour of the plaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason
of the said registration.
</p><p id="p_37">       In order to understand what is a mark, one has to read the
definition      of    the   "mark"   and    the    "trademark"       under
<a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_6">Sections 2(1)(m)</a> and <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_7">2(zb)</a> of the Act together. In <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_8">Section 2(1)(m)</a>,
the meaning of the "mark" includes the name and word and/or any
combination thereof. Similarly, as per <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_9">Section 2(zb)</a>, "trademark"
means, if the same is used in relation to goods or services for the
purposes of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course
of trade between the goods or services, as the case may be, and
some person having the right as proprietor to use the mark. In the
present matter, this Court is also dealing with the case of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">CS(OS) No.2304/2012                                         Page 14 of 41</span>
 infringement of trademark. The plaintiff No. 1 is admittedly the
registered proprietor of the trademark.
</p><p id="p_38">20.    The test of comparison of the marks side by side is not a sound
one since a purchaser will seldom have the two marks actually before
him when he makes his purchase. The eye is not an accurate
recorder of visual detail and marks are remembered by general
impression or by some significant detail rather than by any
photographic recollection of the whole. While judging the question as
to whether the defendants have infringed the trade mark by
colourable imitation of the mark or not, the Court has to consider the
overall impression of the mark in the minds of general public and not
by merely comparing the dissimilarities in the two marks.
</p><p id="p_39">21.    In order to establish infringement, the main ingredients of
<a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_10">Section 29</a> of the Act are that the plaintiff's mark must be registered
under the Act; the defendant's mark is identical with or deceptively
similar to the registered trade mark; and the defendant's use of the
mark is in the course of trade in respect of the goods covered by the
registered trade mark. The rival marks are to be compared as a
whole. Where two rival marks are identical, it is not necessary for the
plaintiff to prove further that the use of defendant's trademark is likely
to deceive and cause confusion as the registration shows the title of
the registered proprietor and the things speak for themselves. In an
infringement action, once a mark is used as indicating commercial
origin by the defendant, no amount of added matter intended to show
the true origin of the goods can effect the question. If Court finds that

even then no further proof is necessary.

vaguely acquainted. While approving the above tests for comparison
of the two word-marks, the Supreme Court held in F. Hoffmann-La

        no sufficient similarity to cause confusion. The true test is

      deceive or cause confusion, it is not sufficient merely to
      compare it with the trade mark which is already registered

      is the distinguishing or essential feature of the trade mark
      already registered and what is the main feature or the main
      idea underlying that trade mark, and if it is found that the
      trade mark whose registration is sought contains the same
      distinguishing or essential feature or conveys the same idea,
      then ordinarily the Registrar would be right if he came to the
      conclusion that the trade mark should not be registered. The
      real question is as to how a purchaser, who must be looked

      to a particular trade mark, what association he would form by
      looking at the trade mark, and in what respect he would
      connect the trade mark with the goods which he would be
      purchasing. It is impossible to accept that a man looking at a
      trade mark would take in every single feature of the trade
      mark. The question would be, what would he normally retain
      in his mind after looking at the trade mark? What would be

</p><p id="p_53">24.    The defendants have alleged that PARA is common to trade
and publici juris, however, the defendants have not provided any
cogent evidence in order to show the third party user. Though in para
10 of the defendants' application being I.A. No.18643/2012, the
defendants have listed 11 products of third parties, however, they
have failed to show that any of the said parties have any significant
presence. The defendants have not given any date since when these
products are available in the market and the extent of their
availability. The photographs of the products referred by the
defendants PARANUT, PARACARE, PARABRITE and PARALIFE
have not been produced. The defendants have not given the
particulars of the manufacturer of the goods sold under the
trademarks PARABRITE and PARALIFE. With respect to the mark
PARAFIT, the plaintiff has already initiated legal proceedings against
the manufacturer in this Court being C.S. (O.S.) No. 2902 of 2012.

not able to establish that the third parties are actually using the

come out of record to show that any third party has actually used the
main PARA to their products. A mere plea, thus raised is not enough

       will be examined believing the same to be true. In my view,
       the same would be immaterial. Firstly, nothing has been

       presence. Secondly, it is now well settled in Honda (supra) in
       turn relying upon Indian Shaving Products Ltd. Vs Gift Pack
       that merely because the plaintiff who is otherwise found
       entitled to the interim injunction is shown to have not taken
       any step against other infringers is no ground to deny relief to
       the plaintiff. It cannot also be said that the plaintiff's
       trademark has lost its distinctiveness for the said reason. The
       reply affidavit of the plaintiff lists the orders of the Trade Mark
       Registry from 1964 to 2000, where plaintiff's mark has been
       protected inter alia for reason of having great reputation. It
       also shows that the plaintiff has been enforcing its rights.
       Though the list filed by defendant No. 1 in this regard is long
       but a perusal thereof shows a number of applicants to have
       abandoned or withdrawn their applications. This is a vast

        inasmuch as some are using Airmarshal, Perfect Marshal,

        who is using the trade mark Sonamarshal only. The plaintiff,

      or deceived on account of this trade mark. This contention of
      the learned counsel for the defendant is also without force. In
      this connection it is sufficient to say that under the law it is the
      right of two parties before the court which has to be
      determined and the court has not to examine the right of
      other parties. If some other manufacturers are using or
      suffixing the word Marshal on their diesel engines, it is of no
      consequence. Furthermore, if the plaintiff has not taken any
      action against several other infringements, this does not
      mean that the plaintiff has abandoned its trade mark and

<p id="p_60">       In view of the above legal position, there is no force in the
submission of the defendants that the word 'PARA' is a common
mark used in the trade and the plaintiff is not entitled to exclusive
protection of the mark.

<p id="p_61">27.    It is pertinent to mention here that the defendant No.1 himself
filed an application under number 1479090 for registration of the

<p id="p_62">28.    The other argument of the learned counsel for the defendants
that the word PARA is common to register as huge number of

force as the plaintiff has filed opposition against 21 out of the 96
applications mentioned in the table given by the defendants. Further,
lot of the applications have still not been advertised for opposition. <a href="/doc/15654482/" id="a_18">In

      such a registration does not confer any exclusive statutory
     right on the proprietor to use any particular word or name
     contained therein, apart from the mark as a whole. Reliance
     in support of this proposition was placed on the observations
     in the <a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_23">Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit

     the Registrar by <a href="/doc/900486/" id="a_24">Section 13</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1940.
     This aspect is not at all relevant for the present controversy
     because the plaintiff can succeed in an action for
     'infringement' if he proves that an essential particular of his
     trade mark has been copied: See Taw Manufacturer Coy.

PARACHUTE/PARACHUTE LITE is compared as a whole with the
trade mark of the defendants, PARALITE adopted by the defendants
is deceptively similar mark as that of the plaintiff as it appears that the
first part PARA is taken by the defendants from the registered trade
mark PARACHUTE and the remaining portion of the mark LITE is
taken     by     defendants   from   another   registered    trade     mark

      it is clear that the defendant is guilty of infringement of

      in most of the cases the copyright has been claimed by the
      plaintiff on the article itself. It is also pertinent to mention that
      the subject matter of the colour combination, get-up and
      layout are not only covered in the subject matter of copyright
      but also covered under the common law remedy i.e. law of
      passing off. Even in the New Trade Mark Act 1999 the
      definition of the mark is given in Section 2(m) which says that
      "Mark" include a device, brand, style, label, ticket, name,
      signature, word, letter, numeral, shape of goods, packaging
      or combination of colours or any combination thereof. As per

       essential features of plaintiffs' containers have been

       The only difference is that instead of white parallelogram
       shapes on top and base borders there are white triangles and
       on the white parallelograms instead of numeral "1001" in grey

      that if a thing fetches a price, it can always be copied and
     therefore, it needs adequate protection. It is well settled that
     although under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_29">Copyright Act</a>, 1957, there is a provision
     of registration, under <a href="/doc/526211/" id="a_30">Section 44</a> of the Act. It is not in doubt
     that the said procedure is an enabling provision and
     registration is not compulsory for the purpose of enforcing
     copyright. <a href="/doc/526211/" id="a_31">Section 44</a> of the Act provides for registration of
     work in which copyright exists but in order to claim copyright
     registration is not necessary. This is because registration is
     only to raise a presumption that the person shown in the
     certificate of registration is the author. This presumption is not
     conclusive, but no further proof is necessary unless there is a
     proof rebutting the contents of the said certificate. Under
     <a href="/doc/593677/" id="a_32">Section 48</a> of the Registration Act, therefore, the act of
     registration is ex-facie prima facie evidence of the particulars
     incorporated in the certificate. There is no provision under the
     Act which deprives the author of the rights on account of non
     registration of the copyright. There is nothing in the Act to
     suggest that the registration is condition precedent to the
     subsistent of the copyright or acquisition of copyrights or
     ownership thereof or for relief of infringement of copyright.
     The sine-qua non of existence of a copyright is expenditure of
     skill, labour and capital on any work expanded by a
     person/author and unless the original work is produced in
     court to prima facie show that the work has originated from
     author, no relief can be granted. In other words, copyright
     exists even without it being registered for the purpose of its
     enforcement. The nature of copyright is also meant to be
     borne in mind. It subsists in any material form in which ideas
     are translated. Copyright is a incorporeal right. It does not lie
     in any idea, but it lies in the expression in which the idea is
     expressed. The work of an author therefore, becomes the
     subject matter of the copyright. In essence the copyright is a
     negative right of preventing copying of physical material in
     the field of art, literature etc. Once an idea is written down,
     the writing becomes the subject matter of copyright. With
     globalisation and advancement of technology, even computer
     programmes come within the copyright. Any work conveying

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">     "The truth of the matter is I think as follows. In some cases

     added for some other reason. If it has been added so as to
     denote the origin of the goods, and the evidence shows that
     in practice it does so, it can properly be said that it is being
     used as a mark in the trade mark sense. The answer is no
     doubt one of degree and will depend on the evidence. It
     would be highly unlikely that colour in a lipstick could ever
     become distinctive of one manufacturer because in such a
     case colour is an essential element in and part of the article
     itself. It is for that reason that the customer buys it. Colour in a
     passenger motor car would normally be in a similar but not so
     conclusive a position, but I see no reason why a trader, as
     some do, should not paint his delivery vans or racing cars in
     specific distinct colours to indicate the origin of the car or of
     the goods it normally carries as emanating from him. With
     drugs, on the other hand, the position is the opposite of the
     lipstick. Colour is of no importance to the article as a drug and
     it may, if sufficiently, distinctive, be an exceedingly effective
     indication of origin.

may become a property to be protected by the Courts. It was held
that a competitor initiating sale of goods or services in the same
name or by imitating that name causes injury to the business of one

play are and ought to be the basic policy in the world of business and
when a person adopts or intends to adopt a name which already
belongs to someone else, it results in confusion, has the propensity
of diverting the customers and clients of someone else to himself and
thereby resulting in injury. It was held that the principles which apply

     whether the latter person does so fraudulently or otherwise.
     The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are, and
     ought to be, the basic policies in the world of business.
     Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to adopt a name
     in connection with his business or services which already
     belongs to someone else it results in confusion and has

disproved by placing the two marks side by side and demonstrating
how small is the chance of error in any customer who places his
order for goods with both the marks clearly before him, for orders
are not placed, or are often not placed, under such conditions. It is
more useful to observe that in most persons the eye is not an
accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks are remembered

any photographic recollection of the whole. In the decision titled as
De Cordova v. Vick Chemical Co. (supra), the plaintiffs were the

This ought to have warned the defendants that the plaintiff is not
allowing the use of mark.

Courts in various matters. Some of them are as under:

<p id="p_88">(i)     In the case of <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_37">Midas Hygiene Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. Sudhir
Bhatia and Others</a>, 2004 (28) PTC 121 (SC), it was observed as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">       "5. The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of
       infringement either of Trade Mark or of Copyright normally
       an injunction must follow. Mere delay in bringing action is not
       sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases. The
       grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima facie
       appears that the adoption of the Mark was itself dishonest."
</blockquote><p id="p_89">(ii)    In the case of <a href="/doc/1208848/" id="a_38">Swaran Singh vs. Usha Industries (India) and
Anr</a>. AIR 1986 Delhi 343 (DB), it was observed as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">       "7. There is then the question of delay. Learned counsel for
       the respondents had urged that the delay is fatal to the
       grant of an injunction. We are not so satisfied. A delay in
         the matter of seeking an injunction may be aground for
       refusing an injunction in certain circumstances. In the present
       case, we are dealing with a statutory right based on the
       provisions of the trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_39">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958. An
       exclusive right is granted by the registration to the holder of a
       registered trade mark. We do not think statutory rights can be
       lost by delay. The effect of a registered mark is so clearly
       defined in the statute as to be not capable of being
       misunderstood. Even if there is some delay, the exclusive
       right cannot be lost. The registered mark cannot be reduced
       to a nullity....."

<p id="p_90"> (iii)    In the case of Hindustan Pencils Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M/s. India
Stationery Products Co. AIR 1990 Delhi 19, it was observed as
under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">        "31. ........ It was observed by Romer, J. in the matter of an
        application brought by J.R.Parkingnon and Co. Ltd., (1946)
        63 RPC 171 at page 181 that "in my judgment, the
        circumstances which attend the adoption of a trade mark in
        the first instance are of considerable importance when one
        comes to consider whether the use of that mark has or has
        not been a honest user. If the user in its inception was tainted
        it would be difficult in most cases to purify it subsequently". It
        was further noted by the learned Judge in that case that he
        could not regard the discreditable origin of the user as
        cleansed by the subsequent history."

        known trade mark, the defendant, at least, immediately on
        applying for registration and on opposition being filed by the
        plaintiff became aware of the perils in such use. Thus, use
        by the defendant of the mark is for short time only and use
        during the period of opposition is of no avail......

        such defence is available only when some positive act of
        encouragement is shown on the part of the plaintiff. Not only
        no such positive act shown in the present case but the
        opposition filed by the plaintiff to the application for
        registration of the defendant ought to have warned the

<p id="p_92"> 38.    I agree with the argument of the learned counsel for the plaintiff
that at the time of filing of the suit the plaintiff was not aware of the
filing of the counter statement by the defendants as the same had
neither been served nor had it been uploaded on the website of the
Trade Marks office. The arguments of the learned counsel for the
defendants are without any force and the same are rejected. The
delay in this matter is immaterial once it is held that the defendants
are guilty of infringement of trade mark, copyright and passing off, the
delay of certain period can be overlooked because of continuous
cause of action.
</p><p id="p_93">Disclaimer
</p><p id="p_94">39.    It has been averred by the learned counsel for the defendants
that the plaintiff has failed to inform the Court that there are
disclaimers on the device of coconut tree, word lite, two halves of
coconut and blue coloured bottle in their registrations. On the other
hand, the learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the whole of the
mark including the disclaimed portion is to be considered to
determine the question of confusion/deception and at the time of filing
of the suit, the registration certificate was produced.

       go into the market place, and the public generally has no
      notice of them. The matter which is disclaimed is not
      necessarily disregarded when question of possible confusion
      or deception of the public, as distinct from the extent of a
      proprietors exclusive rights, are to be determined. In that
      case, the whole of the mark including the disclaimed portion
      was     considered    to   determine     the   question   of
      confusion/deception."
</blockquote><p id="p_96">40.    The scope and effect of disclaimer has been explained by the
Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_43">Registrar of Trade Marks v. Ashok
Chandra Rakhit Ltd</a>, AIR 1955 SC 558 wherein it was held that as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">      "The real purpose of requiring a disclaimer is to define the
      rights of the proprietor under the registration so as to
      minimise, even if it cannot wholly eliminate, the possibility of
      extravagant and unauthorised claims being made on the
      score of registration of the trade mark. The disclaimer is only
      for the purposes of the Act. It does not affect the rights of the
      proprietor except such as arise out of registration."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_97">41.    In view of the above and as per the settled law, as the two
trademarks of parties have to be compared as whole, the argument of
the defendant has no force. It is admitted position that there is no
disclaimer on the trademark PARACHUTE. Even otherwise, the
disclaimer part is protectable under the law of passing off by virtue of
the proviso to <a href="/doc/1587254/" id="a_44">Section 17</a> of the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_45">Merchandise Marks Act</a>,
1958. Thus, arguments of the learned counsel for the defendants in
this regard are rejected.

<p id="p_98">42.    In view of the above, the plaintiff has made a strong prima facie
case. Balance of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff and

 against the defendants. In case the interim order will not continue,
the plaintiff will face irreparable loss and injury. Even otherwise, the
evidence of the plaintiff is being recorded, the interim order passed
on 1st August, 2012 is continued for more than two years.
</p>
<p id="p_99">43.    Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case,
the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC
being IA No.13880/2012 is allowed. The interim order granted on 1st
August, 2012 is made absolute during the pendency of the suit.
Consequently, application filed by the defendants under Order 39
Rule 4 CPC being I.A. No.18643/2012 is dismissed. As regards I.A.
No. 22186/2012 (under Order 39 Rule 2A CPC), the same will be
considered at the time of final hearing of the suit.
