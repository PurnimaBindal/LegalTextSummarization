HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
AHMADI,	 J.- The Director of Civil Defence, West Bengal,  by
Order No. 4729-HCD dated 24-7-1965 appointed the  petitioner
on  a  temporary  basis on the post  of	 Staff	Officer-cum-
Instructor in the Directorate of Civil Defence, West  Bengal
in  the	 scale	of Rs 175-325 plus  usual  allowances.	 The
petitioner claims to be a member of the Civil Defence Corps.
On this premise he contends that his case is governed by the
<a href="/doc/272958/" id="a_1">Civil  Defence Act</a>, 1968 (Act No. 27 of	 1968),	 hereinafter
called 'the Act'.  The said Act was brought into force	with
effect from 10-7-1968.	It may be advantageous to notice the
relevant provisions of the said Act at this stage.
</p><p id="p_2">2.<a href="/doc/272958/" id="a_2">The Act</a> was enacted to make provision for civil defence
and  for  matters connected therewith.	It  extends  to	 the
whole  of India.  The expression "Civil Defence	 Corps"	 has
been  defined to mean the corps formed wholly or  mainly  to
meet  the needs of civil defence, including an	organisation
deemed	to be a corps under <a href="/doc/815652/" id="a_3">Section 4(1)</a>.  That	 sub-section
provides for the constitution of a Civil Defence Corps.	  It
reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "4.  (1) The State Government may	 constitute,
	      for  any	area  within the State,	 a  body  of
	      persons  to be called the Civil Defence  Corps
	      (hereinafter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">500</span>
	      referred to as the 'Corps') and may appoint  a
	      person,  not being, in its opinion, below	 the
	      rank of a District Magistrate (to be known  as
	      the 'Controller') to command such Corps:
	      Provided that if there is in existence in	 any
	      area  in	a  State,  immediately	before	 the
	      commencement  of	this Act in  that  area,  an
	      organisation  which,  in the  opinion  of	 the
	      State  Government, may be entrusted  with	 the
	      functions	 of the Corps, the State  Government
	      may, instead of constituting a separate  Corps
	      for such area, call upon that organisation  to
	      take  over or discharge the functions  of	 the
	      Corps   in  that	area,  and  thereupon	such
	      organisation shall be deemed, for the purposes
	      of this Act, to be the Corps for the area.
	      (2)The   State  Government  may,	for   the
	      purpose of coordinating the activities of	 the
	      Controllers   within  the	 State,	 appoint   a
	      Director of Civil Defence and every Controller
	      shall comply with the directions given by such
	      Director."
</blockquote><p id="p_3">3.<a href="/doc/1687359/" id="a_4">Section  5</a>  empowers the State  Government  to  appoint
members	 and  officers	of the Corps.	Sub-section  (2)  of
<a href="/doc/1687359/" id="a_5">Section	 5</a>  provides  that every person appointed  to  be  a
member	of  the	 Corps	shall  be  given  a  certificate  of
membership.   <a href="/doc/1895486/" id="a_6">Section  6</a>  provides for the  dismissal  of  a
member	of Civil Defence Corps while <a href="/doc/921533/" id="a_7">Section 7</a> provides	 for
an  appeal  to the State Government against  an	 order	made
under  <a href="/doc/1895486/" id="a_8">Section	6</a>.  <a href="/doc/575445/" id="a_9">Section 8</a> enumerates  the  functions  of
members	 of the Corps while <a href="/doc/1492872/" id="a_10">Section 9</a> empowers	the  Central
Government  to	make  regulations.  As	the  petitioner	 has
sought directions in regard to the making of regulations  we
may  reproduce	the section for ready reference.   It  reads
thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "9.   (1)	 The  Central  Government  may,	  by
	      notification make regulations for carrying out
	      the purposes of this Chapter.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      (2)In particular, and without prejudice  to
	      the  generality of the foregoing	power,	such
	      regulations may
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      (a)   prescribe  the functions of the  members
	      of the Corps and regulate the manner in  which
	      they may be called out for service;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      (b)   regulate the organisation,	appointment,
	      conditions     of	    service,	 discipline,
	      accoutrement and clothing of members of any or
	      all of the Corps;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      (c)   prescribe  the form of  certificates  of
	      membership of any or all of the Corps."
</blockquote><p id="p_4">4.  Lastly  <a href="/doc/396542/" id="a_11">Section 20</a> provides that every rule	 made  under
<a href="/doc/1468473/" id="a_12">Section	 3</a> and every regulation made under <a href="/doc/1492872/" id="a_13">Section 9</a> by	 the
Central	 Government  shall  be laid  before  each  House  of
Parliament while in session for thirty days.  Admittedly the
Central	 Government  has  made rules in	 exercise  of  power
conferred by <a href="/doc/1468473/" id="a_14">Section 3</a> called the Civil Defence Rules, 1968.
So  also  in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/188650106/" id="a_15">Section 9</a>	the  Central
Government   made  regulations	called	the  Civil   Defence
Regulations,  1968.   Regulation 4 lays down the  manner  of
applying for appointment to the Corps and Regulation 7
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">501</span>
prescribes   the  form	of  certificate	 to  be	  given	  on
appointment.   Regulation  8  sets  out	 the  conditions  of
service as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      "8.   Conditions of Service.- (1) The  members
	      of  the  Corps  shall ordinarily	serve  in  a
	      voluntary and honorary capacity:
	      Provided	that  the State Government  may,  by
	      order, authorise payment of duty allowance (at
	      such  scales as may be prescribed by  it	from
	      time to time in consultation with the  Central
	      Government)  to  a member of  the	 Corps	when
	      called on duty.</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">	      (2)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained	  in
	      clause (1), the Central Government may declare
	      any  appointment or class of  appointments  as
	      paid appointments.  A person appointed on	 the
	      basis  of	 payment shall be entitled  to	such
	      conditions  of service as regards	 pay,  leave
			    and other benefits as the State Government may
,
	      by order, prescribe."
</p><p id="p_6">Regulation  13 provides for maintenance of  service  records
whereas	 Regulation  14 provides for  resignation  from	 the
Corps.	These, in brief, are the relevant legal	 provisions.
It  will thus be seen that the rules and regulations can  be
made by the Central Government only.
</p><p id="p_7">5.  We	may now briefly state the  petitioner's	 case.	 The
Civil Defence Organisation was set up in India in 1965 under
the  Defence  of India Act and was later  converted  into  a
Civil  Defence	Corps  under the <a href="/doc/272958/" id="a_16">Civil	Defence	 Act</a>,  1968.
Accordingly  the Civil Defence Organisation of	West  Bengal
was  converted	into a Civil Defence Corps  by	notification
dated 10-7-1968 and thereupon the petitioner became a member
of  the	 said Corps.  He also claims to	 be  the  Secretary-
General	 of  the  Civil Defence Officers'  Guild,  India,  a
society	  registered   under  the  West	  Bengal   Societies
Registration Act, 1961.	 The petitioner points out that	 the
Central	 Government  in compliance with	 the  Calcutta	High
Court's	 Order in Civil Rule No. 6221 (W) of 1983 took	over
complete control of the Mobile Civil Emergency Force  (MCEF)
with effect from 1-4-1992 under office order dated 26-2-1992
whereby existing employees of MCEF, Calcutta became  holders
of  civil posts under the Government of India and  delivered
all  the benefits admissible to such employees.	  Since	 the
petitioner  and others did not receive the same	 benefit  as
they were not covered under the said order there was hostile
discrimination	between two groups of the same	organisation
in  total violation of the equality clause in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article 14</a>  of
the  Constitution.   According to the petitioner  since	 the
<a href="/doc/272958/" id="a_18">Civil Defence Act</a>, 1968, is a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_19">Central Act</a> and extends to the
whole of India including West Bengal, it is incumbent on the
Central	  Government   to  regulate  the   recruitment	 and
conditions  of	service of persons appointed  in  the  Civil
Defence	  organisation	all  over  the	country	 by   making
appropriate  provisions in the rules or regulations so	that
every  employee	 is  governed by a uniform  set	 of  service
conditions.   Since  the State Governments are	laying	down
service	 conditions dehors the rules and  regulations  under
the Act there is total lack of uniformity which has resulted
in  the	 petitioner being discriminated in matters  of	pay,
promotion, transfer, etc.  Being aware that it has no  power
to frame regulations, the State of West
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">502</span>
Bengal resorted to obtaining undertakings from employees who
desired to avail of the benefit of its regulations and those
who  were  not prepared to furnish  such  undertakings	were
denied	the  benefits which introduced two sets	 of  service
conditions  for employees working in the same  organisation.
It is said that members of the guild like the petitioner are
being victimised for their refusal to sign the	undertaking.
Thus  the  situation  is that employees	 governed  by  State
regulations  on	 the  strength of undertakings	stand  on  a
different  footing from those who have refused to give	such
undertakings and both these classes taken together stand  on
a   different  footing	from  MCEF  employees	within	 the
organisation  governed	by Central  Government	regulations.
This,  contends	 the  petitioner, is  clearly  violative  of
Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution.  The petitioner,
therefore, seeks in the main the following two reliefs:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      "(A) Issue an appropriate writ upon Respondent
	      1	 to  frame service rules  governing  service
	      condition	 of members of Civil  Defence  Corps
	      under  the  <a href="/doc/272958/" id="a_20">Civil Defence Act</a>  and  take	over
	      administrative,	financial  and	 operational
	      control	of   Civil   Defence   from    State
	      Government.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">	      (B)   Issue of an appropriate writ prohibiting
	      the respondents from subjecting the petitioner
	      and  members  of the guild to  any  rules	 and
	      regulations outside the provisions of  <a href="/doc/532176/" id="a_21">Section
	      9(2)(b)</a> of Civil Defence Act."
</blockquote><p id="p_8">6.In  the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the  Union
of India it is averred that under the regulations made under
<a href="/doc/532176/" id="a_22">Section 9(2)(b)</a>, a member of the Civil Defence Corps has  to
apply  in Forms A and B for enrolment and on being  enrolled
he  would  receive  a certificate in Form C  and  a  service
record would be maintained in Form D. The petitioner  should
have  produced some such documentary evidence to  prove	 his
say that he was a member of the Corps.	On the contrary	 the
petitioner  is	a  full-time  paid  employee  of  the  State
Government  appointed  under notification  dated  28-2-1973.
Thus  he is an employee of the State Government governed  by
the  State  service conditions.	 Therefore,  the  petitioner
cannot claim to be governed by rules and regulations made by
the  Central  Government.  While conceding  that  the  State
Government cannot make rules and regulations under the	Act,
it  is	alleged	 that  he would	 be  governed  by  executive
directions  of the State Government issued in  this  behalf.
Therefore, he cannot secure the reliefs sought.
</p><p id="p_9">7.The  State of West Bengal also denies the  petitioner's
claim  that he is a member of the Civil Defence	 Corps.	  On
the  contrary  it contends that the petitioner is  in  State
service	 covered by the rules of the State  Government.	  He
cannot,	 therefore,  invoke <a href="/doc/396542/" id="a_23">Section 20</a> of the  Act.   It  is
lastly	said  that the petitioner can base no  case  on	 the
administrative	set  up	 of  MCEF nor  can  he	complain  of
discrimination on that basis.  The petitioner's petition is,
therefore, liable to be dismissed.
</p><p id="p_10">8.In   his  rejoinder  to  the	aforesaid  counters   the
petitioner  has reiterated his stand and contended that	 the
factum of his suspension on the allegation
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">503</span>
that he made baseless allegations in his letter of  7-5-1991
in  his capacity as the office-bearer of the guild  and	 the
failure	 of  the Government to enquire into the	 matter	 has
been deliberately suppressed.  It is also not stated that in
the  writ petition filed by the petitioner  questioning	 the
suspension,  the State Government had made a statement	that
the  action was in exercise of the employer's general  power
to  refuse  to take work and had, therefore, agreed  to	 pay
full  wages  during  suspension.   Therefore,  contends	 the
petitioner,  it is evident from the counters that  the	only
point  surviving for adjudication is whether he is  entitled
to  the	 benefits  under the Act  as  a	 full-time  salaried
officer.
</p><p id="p_11">9.From	the abridged facts it is evident that  rules  and
regulations  can be framed by the Central  Government  alone
under  the  provisions of the Act.  Such  regulations  under
<a href="/doc/532176/" id="a_24">Section	 9(2)(b)</a>  can  inter alia relate  to  conditions  of
service.   But	there is no dispute that the  Act  could  be
brought into force by different States from different dates,
so however, that such date shall not be earlier to the	date
on which the Defence of India Act, 1962 would expire.	Even
according to the petitioner the Act was brought into  effect
from 10-7-1968.	 However, the Order No. 4729-HCD dated 24-7-
1965  appointing  the petitioner to the	 temporary  post  of
Staff  Officer-cum-Instructor  in the Directorate  of  Civil
Defence, West Bengal, being earlier to 10-7-1968, there	 can
be no doubt that the petitioner's appointment was dehors the
Act.   <a href="/doc/815652/" id="a_25">Section	4(1)</a> provides for the  constitution  of	 the
Civil  Defence Corps by the State concerned but the  proviso
to  that sub-section says that if in any State there  is  in
existence  an  organisation  which  can	 be  entrusted	 the
functions of the Corps, the State Government may instead  of
constituting   a   separate  Corps,  call  upon	  the	said
organisation to take over and discharge the functions of the
Corps whereupon such organisation shall be deemed to be	 the
Corps  for  the	 area.	 <a href="/doc/642271/" id="a_26">Section  4(2)</a>	empowers  the  State
Government  to	appoint	 a  Director  of  Civil	 Defence  to
coordinate  the	 activities of the  Controllers	 within	 the
State.	Under <a href="/doc/486965/" id="a_27">Section 5(1)</a> it is the State Government  which
is  empowered  to appoint members of the  Corps.   Thus	 the
constitution of the Civil Defence Corps, the appointment  of
the  Controller and the appointments of members/officers  of
the Corps is with the State Government.	 <a href="/doc/1568334/" id="a_28">Section 17</a> provides
for   the   delegation	 of  the   powers   of	 the   State
Government/Controller to an officer of the State  Government
of the rank specified in the said provision.  Even so, it is
indeed	true that the rules and regulations have to be	made
by  the Central Government in view of the clear language  of
<a href="/doc/1468473/" id="a_29">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1492872/" id="a_30">9</a> of the Act.  The regulations may inter alia
regulate the conditions of service of members of any or	 all
the  Corps.  Regulation 8 of the Civil Defence	Regulations,
1968,  extracted earlier, bear on the service conditions  of
the  members  of  the Corps.  On a  plain  reading  of	this
regulation  it becomes immediately obvious that	 members  of
the Corps are expected to render service in a voluntary	 and
honorary capacity but if the State Government so desires  it
may authorise payment of duty allowance in consultation with
the  Central Government to a member of the Corps  called  on
duty.	Clause (2) which begins with a non  obstante  clause
empowers the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">504</span>
Central	 Government to declare any appointment or  class  of
appointments  as paid appointments whereupon  the  incumbent
shall  be entitled to the conditions of service	 as  regards
pay,  leave,  etc., as the State Government  may  by  order,
prescribe.  Here again the power of prescribing the  service
conditions  as	to pay, leave, etc., rests  with  the  State
Government  and not the Central Government.  Therefore,	 the
petitioner's  contention that the service conditions  as  to
pay,  leave,  etc.,  cannot  be	 stipulated  by	 the   State
Government  is	clearly	 misconceived.	 That  function	 has
clearly	 been entrusted to the State Government on  a  plain
reading	 of Regulation 8 extracted hereinabove.	 If that  be
so, and we think it is so, no writ can issue (assuming there
is  jurisdiction  to  issue  such a  writ)  to	the  Central
Government  as	prayed in prayer (A) nor can  a	 prohibitory
order of the type prayed in prayer (B) issue to the State of
West  Bengal.	We  are	 afraid	 the  petitioner  has	been
labouring under a misconception that it is only the  Central
Government and not the State Government which can  prescribe
the  salary,  allowances, leave, etc., in  view	 of  <a href="/doc/1026064/" id="a_31">Section
9(2)</a>,	but  in	 so  thinking  he  has	totally	  overlooked
Regulation 8. We say so because in his petition,  affidavits
as  well  as  written submissions, no emphasis	is  laid  on
Regulation  8. The Central Government's action in  complying
with  court's orders in relation to MCEF can never  offer  a
ground for contending that there has been discrimination and
a  violation  of the equality clause in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_32">Article	 14</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_12">10.For the above reasons we are convinced that the present
petition is wholly misconceived and the petitioner cannot be
granted	 either or both of the reliefs claimed by him.	 His
petition, therefore, fails and is dismissed.  Having  regard
to  the	 fact that the petitioner is in	 dire  circumstances
since  he  is under suspension, we order to bear  their	 own
costs.	Rule discharged.  No order on IA.

building  for its reallotment in his favour, which of  those
two  applications  require priority in the matter  of  their
disposal  by  the  District  Magistrate	 concerned,  is	 the
question arising for our consideration in this appeal.
</p><p id="p_15">3.  As it would be advantageous to refer to the facts  which
have given rise to the said question, brief mention of those
facts could be made before its consideration.
</p><p id="p_16">4.Shri	Swaroop Narain Srivastava, the appellant in  this
appeal,	 is the landlord of House No. 395/3 1,	Raj  Bhawan,
Kashmiri  Mohalla,  Lucknow  'the disputed  house'.   By  an
allotment order made under the Act, that disputed house	 had
been allotted in favour of one Sita Ram Shakya and he became
its tenant.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">506</span>
<p id="p_17">5.Since	 Sita  Ram  Shakya, the tenant	of  the	 disputed
house,	died  on 18-5-1973, Respondent 2, the  wife  of	 the
deceased, Respondents 3 and 4, the sons of the deceased	 and
Dr  R.R.P.  Singh, another son of the deceased,	 became	 the
joint  tenants	of the disputed house as the  heirs  of	 the
deceased  living  with him.  However, when one of  the	said
tenants	 of  the  disputed  house Dr  R.R.P.  Singh,  by  an
allotment  order made under the Act in his favour  on  30-3-
1975,  got  allotted another house in the same	locality,  a
question arose whether the disputed house had fallen  vacant
by  operation of sub-sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/1444328/" id="a_35">Section  12</a>  of
the Act.  That question ultimately came up for consideration
before	a  Full	 Bench	of the Allahabad  High	Court  on  a
reference  made	 to it in a writ petition before  that	High
Court.	 It was held by its order dated 12-3-1981  that	 the
disputed house had fallen vacant under sub-sections (3)	 and
(4) of <a href="/doc/1444328/" id="a_36">Section 12</a> of the Act, when one of the joint  tenants
of  the disputed house was allotted a  separate	 residential
house in the same locality under the provisions of the	Act.
Subsequently, the writ petition which had been filed in	 the
High   Court  disputing	 the  decision	of  the	  revisional
authority  that	 the disputed house had fallen	vacant,	 was
dismissed  by an order made by the High Court on  23-4-1981.
As  a result of the dismissal of the said writ petition,  an
application  which  had	 been made by  the  appellant  under
<a href="/doc/1985594/" id="a_37">Section	 16(1)(b)</a>  of the Act for release  of  the  disputed
house  in his favour and an application which had been	made
under <a href="/doc/1985594/" id="a_38">Section 16(1)(a)</a> of the Act by Respondents 2 to 4	 for
reallotment  of the disputed house in their favour  came  up
for consideration before the Additional District  Magistrate
(City) Lucknow in Case No. 62/193 of 1982.  That  Additional
District Magistrate considered the said application made  by
the   appellant	 for  release  of  the	disputed  house	  in
preference to the other application made by Respondents 2 to
4 for reallotment of the disputed house in their favour	 and
granted the application made by the appellant for release of
the disputed house in his favour, as in his view, when there
was  an application for release of the vacant building	made
by  the landlord and when there was an application  made  by
the  former tenants for reallotment of the vacant  building,
the consideration of the application of the landlord had  to
be  done on a preferential basis.  On such consideration  of
the  application for release of the disputed house  made  by
the  appellant, the Additional District Magistrate found  on
the basis of evidence placed before him that the  appellant-
landlord  required the disputed house for his bona fide	 use
and  occupation.  Consequently, he made a release  order  in
respect of the disputed house in favour of the appellant  on
24-8-1982.    However,	he  allowed  one  month's  time	  to
Respondents 2 to 4 to vacate the disputed premises so as  to
enable	the appellant to occupy it.  The litigation did	 not
come  to  an end there.	 Respondents 2 to 4  questioned	 the
correctness   of  the  order  of  the  Additional   District
Magistrate  by	filing a Revision Petition RR.	No.  111  of
1982 in the Court of the District Judge, Lucknow.  The	lvth
Additional District Judge, Lucknow, who heard that  revision
petition allowed it by setting aside the order of Additional
District  Magistrate, Lucknow dated 24-8-1982 and  remitting
the  case to Additional District Magistrate (City),  Lucknow
with a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> 507</span>
direction to him to decide the reallotment application	made
by Respondents 2 to 4 in preference to the application	made
by  the appellant for release of the disputed house  in	 his
favour.	  When	the appellant filed a writ petition  WP	 No.
6189 of 1982 against the said order of the court of the Ivth
Additional District Judge in the High Court of Judicature at
Allahabad,  that  High	Court dismissed	 the  writ  petition
upholding the impugned order of the Ivth Additional District
Judge,	Lucknow.   The said orders of  the  Ivth  Additional
District  Judge, Lucknow and of the High Court are  appealed
against	 by the appellant in the present appeal	 by  special
leave.
</p><p id="p_18">6.The  disputed house, a residential building,	of  which
the appellant was the landlord, had fallen vacant under sub-
sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/1444328/" id="a_39">Section 12</a> of the Act, as is held by
the  Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in its  judgment
dated  12-3-1981.  This aspect of the case was not  disputed
before	us. Therefore, the only question which requires	 our
consideration in this appeal is whether the application	 for
release of the vacant disputed house was rightly decided  by
the  Additional	 District Magistrate in	 preference  to	 the
application  for reallotment of that vacant  disputed  house
made  by Respondents 2 to 4, or whether the application	 for
reallotment of the vacant disputed house made by Respondents
2 to 4 alone required to be considered on preferential basis
as  is	held by the district court in  a  revision  petition
before it and the High Court in the writ petition before it.
The  district  court and the High Court as seen	 from  their
judgments  have	 taken	the view that  the  application	 for
reallotment  made  by  Respondents 2  to  4  required  prior
consideration  and disposal as against the  application	 for
release	 made by the appellant because proviso (b)  of	sub-
rule (6) of Rule 20 when enabled Respondents 2 to 4 to	seek
reallotment  of the disputed house which had  fallen  vacant
according to sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1444328/" id="a_40">Section 12</a> of the Act,	that
application  for reallotment of the disputed house  made  by
Respondents   2	 to  4	required  to  be  considered  on   a
preferential  basis.  According to them,  such	preferential
consideration of reallotment application made by Respondents
2 to 4 would be necessary to obviate the hardship which they
may  have  to  suffer in the event of  the  vacant  disputed
house,	is not allotted in their favour.  In our  view,	 the
district  court as well as the High Court had fallen into  a
grave  error  in  thinking that the hardship  to  which	 the
former	tenants could be put could be obviated in the  event
the  building  which  had become vacant on  account  of	 its
falling vacant under sub-sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/1444328/" id="a_41">Section  12</a>
of  the	 Act  is allotted to them,  when  such	view  cannot
receive	 support  either from the provisions of the  Act  or
from  the provisions of the U.P. Urban	Buildings  (Letting,
Rent  and Eviction) Rules, 1972 ('the Rules'.  All that	 has
happened  is  when  sub-rule (6) of Rule  10  of  the  Rules
prohibited the making of the application by certain persons,
proviso (2) thereto enables persons like Respondents 2 to  4
who must be deemed to have vacated the residential  building
to make an application for reallotment of such building.  If
that  be  so,  permissibility to  make	an  application	 for
reallotment by 7 Respondents 2 to 4, cannot entitle them for
prior  consideration and disposal of their  application	 for
reallotment by the District Magistrate in preference to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">508</span>
the  application  for  release made  by	 the  landlord,	 the
appellant  or any other applications of the persons who	 are
given preferential claim for allotment of a vacant  building
under the provisions of the Act and the Rules.	 Sub-section
(1)  of	 <a href="/doc/1985594/" id="a_42">Section 16</a> of the Act which permits the  filing  of
applications before the District Magistrate by the  landlord
for release of the building fallen vacant and by others	 for
reallotment of such building insofar as is material reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	      "16.    Allotment	  and  release	 of   vacant

	      specified	 in  the  order	 (to  be  called  an
	      allotment order); or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">	      (b)   release  the whole or any part  of	such
	      building, or any land appurtenant thereto,  in

	      to  in  sub-section  (4) of  <a href="/doc/1444328/" id="a_43">Section  12</a>,	 the
	      District Magistrate shall give an	 opportunity
	      to the landlord or the tenant, as the case may
	      be,  of showing that the said section  is	 not
	      attracted	 to his case before making an  order
	      under clause (a)-"
</blockquote><p id="p_19">Requirement  of the proviso is admittedly fulfilled  because
of the holding of the Full Bench of the High Court that	 the
disputed house had fallen vacant.
</p><p id="p_20">7.When Rule 10 of the Rules which provides for	allotment
procedure   is	seen,  nowhere	it  is	provided   that	  an
application  for  allotment of a vacant building  should  be
considered in preference to the application made for release
of the vacant building by the landlord.	 On the other  hand,
Rule  13 which provides the procedure for  consideration  of
the application made for release of a vacant building by the
landlord,  by  its  sub-rule (4)  requires  that  landlord's
application  for  release under the rules shall, as  far  as
possible,  be decided within one month from the date of	 its
presentation  and  no  allotment in respect  of	 a  building
covered by an application in that rule shall be made  unless
such application has been rejected.  Thus, when sub-rule (4)
of Rule 13 expressly states that unless an application	made
by  the	 landlord  for	release	 of  a	vacant	building  is
rejected,  no  allotment of the vacant building	 covered  by
that  application  could  be  made,  it	 in  terms  requires
consideration  of  the	application for	 release  of  vacant
building  at  the  first instance  in  preference  to  other
application for allotment.  Therefore, it must be held	that
the  rule requires the consideration of the application	 for
release	 made  by  the landlord in  respect  of	 the  vacant
building and decision thereon in preference to consideration
of  any other application for allotment or reallotment	made
in  respect of that vacant building.  If that be our  answer
to  the	 question  under consideration	the  orders  of	 the
district  court and the High Court appealed against in	this
appeal	become	unsustainable and require to  be  interfered
with.

<p id="p_23">MADRAS	CITY WINE MERCHANTS ASSN. V. STATE OF  T.  N.(Mohan,

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
 MOHAN, J.- Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_24">2.   The first appellant in CA No. 4981 of 1994 arising	 out
of  SLP	 (C) No. 9854 of 1993 is an  Association  registered
under  the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_44">Societies Registration Act</a>.	The members  of	 the
Association have been granted licences to carry on  business
in  the	 retail	 vending  of  Indian-made  foreign   spirits
(hereinafter referred to as 'I.M.F.S.').
</p><p id="p_25">3.   The second appellant is a licensee of I.M.F.S. Shop No.
336 at No. 7, Thyagaraja Road, Madras-17 for the year  1992-
</p><p id="p_26">93.
</p><p id="p_27">4.   The respondent, the Government of Tamil Nadu framed the
Tamil  Nadu Liquor (Licence and Permit) Rules, 1981.   Under
these  Rules, Indianmade foreign spirit and  foreign  liquor
was  to be sold only by persons who are granted licence	 for
personal  consumption.	In the year 1989, the Government  of
Tamil  Nadu  decided to grant the privilege  of	 selling  by
retail	of I.M.F.S. and beer through auction/tender  system.
Accordingly, the Government framed Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail
Vending)  Rules,  1989 by GOMs No.  506	 Home  (Prohibition)
dated 15-4-1989.  In the auction, the successful bidder	 was
granted	 the  licence to carry on the  business	 of  vending
I.M.F.S.  in retail in their respective shops.	The  licence
was  valid for a period of one year.  Under the said  rules,
it  was	 provided  for	a renewal of  the  licence  for	 two
successive years on the licensee offering to pay 15% and 10%
respectively  more  than the privilege amount at  which	 the
sale was confirmed in his favour during the previous  years.
Rule  13 contained all these clauses.  Under Rule  14(3),  a
provision  was	made  that  it was  open  to  the  licensing
authority  to refuse the renewal by an order  recording	 the
reasons	 for  refusal.	However, before	 such  refusal,	 the
licensing  authority  was  obligated to	 give  a  reasonable
opportunity to the licensee of being heard.
</p><p id="p_28">5.   The  successful bidders obtained licences for the	year
1989-90 and carried on the business.  Most of them  obtained
renewal for the subsequent excise year 1991-92.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">514</span>
<p id="p_29">6.The Government issued orders in GOMs No. 90 Prohibition
dated  21-4-1992  to the effect that fresh  auction  may  be
conducted  for	all the liquor retail  vending	shops  whose
licence	 period	 expires on or before 31-5-1992 as  well  as
those whose licence period expires on or after 31-5-1992  by
restricting the period of licence to 31-5-1992 and refunding
the  proportionate  portion of the privilege  amount.	This
course was adopted in order to facilitate the Government  to
evolve	fresh  scheme of upset price for auctioning  of	 the
liquor retail vending shops in the State.
</p><p id="p_30">7.The  notification also provided that the licence to  be
issued for the year 1992-93 shall be renewed for the  second
and  third years after collecting increased privilege  fees.
The  prescription  relating to increased fees  was  provided
under  Rule 14(1) and (2) of the 1989 Rules made  under	 the
Tamil  Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937.  An ordinance was  passed
terminating the validity of licences which enured beyond 31-
5-1992	with the expiry of the said  period.   Subsequently,
<a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_45">Tamil  Nadu Act</a> 42 of 1992 came into force with effect	from
12-5-1992.   By	 this Act Section 23(b) of  the	 Tamil	Nadu
Prohibition  Act, 1937 was substituted.	 In accordance	with
GOMs No. 90 Prohibition dated 21-4-1992, auctions came to be
conducted.  The successful bidders were issued the licences.
At that stage, the Government received representations	from
these  dealers	for  the establishment of a  bar  within  or
adjoining licence premises.  The Government forwarded  these
representations	 to  the  Commissioner	of  Prohibition	 and
Excise and obtained necessary recommendations.	 Thereafter,
the  Government	 framed rules by GOMs No.  99,	Prohibition,
dated  26-5-1992 known as Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail  Vending
in  Bar) Rules, 1992.  Those rules permitted to open  a	 bar
within or adjoining licence premises.  These rules came into
force  on 1-6-1992.  Rule 3 provides for grant of  privilege
by  issue of licence to a person holding a  licence  granted
under Rule 13 of the 1989 Rules for retail vending of liquor
in  the	 bar.	The rules stated retail	 vending  of  liquor
includes  the vending of liquor in open bottles, glasses  or
pegs  for  consumption in the bar.  Rule  4  required  every
person holding a licence granted under Rule 13 of 1989 Rules
and who intends to obtain the privilege of retail vending of
liquor	in  the	 bar  shall  make  an  application  in	 the
prescribed form to the licensing authority for the grant  of
privilege and issue of licence for retail vending of  liquor
in  the	 bar.  Every licensee of retail	 I.M.F.S.  shop	 was
entitled to apply for and obtain a bar licence on payment of
a  licence  fee	 and the privilege amount  ranging  from  Rs
18,750	to  Rs 75,000 depending upon the area in  which	 the
shop was located.
</p><p id="p_31">8.The  case of the appellant is, in order to  obtain  the
privilege of vending I.M.F.S. in retail for the excise	year
1992-93,  the  members of  the	first  appellant-Association
increased  their offer.	 This huge offer was to enable	them
to  have a bar attached and thereby increased the volume  of
sale of liquor.	 On obtaining licences under retail  vending
rules,	the  members  of  the  appellant-Association   spent
considerable  sums  of	money for  acquiring  the  adjoining
premises to locate the bar in accordance with the Bar Rules.
They
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">515</span>
were carrying on business in accordance with the rules	with
the fond hope of making good the investment and also earn  a
profit during the period to come.
</p><p id="p_32">9.   It	 appears  that	the  Government	  received   various
complaints.   The drinking in the Bars led to law and  order
problem.   Therefore, by impugned GOMs No.  44,	 Prohibition
and  Excise  dated 3-3-1993, the Tamil Nadu  Liquor  (Retail
Vending in Bar) Rules, 1992 were rescinded with effect	from
1-6-1993.  The said GO was challenged before the High  Court
of  Madras  in WP No. 7776 of 1993.  The writ  petition	 was
dismissed  on the ground that the court could not  interfere
with the policy decisions taken by the State.  Aggrieved  by
the same, Writ Appeal No. 658 of 1993 was preferred.  By the
impugned  judgment  dated  13-6-1993, the  writ	 appeal	 was
dismissed  holding that the policy of the Government is	 one
step marching towards the total prohibition.  The appellants
could not base their case on legitimate expectation, nor was
there  any  violation  of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_46">Article 14</a>  of  the  Constitution.
Thus, the present civil appeals.
</p><p id="p_33">10.   Ramanathapuram   District	  Liquor   Retail   Sellers'

1993  under  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_47">Article  32</a>  of  the  Constitution	 of   India,

</p><p id="p_34">11.  Mr K. Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel, appearing	 for
the appellants in Civil Appeal No. 4981 of 1994 arising	 out
of  SLP (C) No. 9854 of 1993 submits that change  of  policy
must pass muster of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_48">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.
When the State Government has permitted the sale of  liquor,
the  change  of policy can be tested on	 the  touchstone  of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_49">Article	 14</a> of the Constitution of India.  In Supreme  Court
<a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_50">Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India</a> 1 (SCC p.  703),
this  Court  has taken the view that  due  consideration  of
every legitimate expectation in the decision-making  process
is  a requirement of the rule of non-arbitrariness.   Again,
in  Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.p.2 this  Court
has  taken the view, a change in policy should not  be	done
arbitrarily.
</p><p id="p_35">12.  In	 support of this submission, reliance is  placed  on
Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 1(1), 4th Edn., para 81  at
page 15 1.
</p><p id="p_36">13.  In	 this  background of law, the facts  require  to  be
analysed.   By	GOMs No. 90, Prohibition  and  Excise  dated
21-4-1992  retail  selling of liquor  was  permitted.	Such
licence-holders were entitled to renewal as well.  On  their
representations	 the Bars came to be permitted.	  Thereafter
GOMs No. 99 dated 26-5-1992 came to be passed enabling these
licence-holders	 to open Bars.	It is noteworthy that  under
both the sets of rules a provision is made for renewal.	  It
was  in	 the hope that bar licence will be renewed  for	 the
subsequent  years as well, each licensee spent huge  amounts
in opening the Bars.  In such a case, the plea of legitimate
expectation  certainly	will  come  to	the  rescue  of	 the
appellants.   No doubt, the State can change its policy	 but
it  cannot be done arbitrarily as held in the  above  cases.
Raising a hope in the
1  (1993) 4 SCC 441, 703

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">516</span>
retail	vendors	 that  they would be  allowed  to  carry  on
vending in Bars, renewal being a matter of course,  suddenly
to deny that privilege is arbitrary.
</p><p id="p_37">14. A privilege once accrued cannot be taken away.  This  is
a  clear  implication  of Section 8(3)	of  the	 Tamil	Nadu
General Clauses Act.  More so, in a case like this where the
rules	are   prospective  in  nature  such   a	  legitimate
expectation  cannot be denied.	Section 4 of the Tamil	Nadu
General	 Clauses Act does not, in any way, militate  against
the  operation of <a href="/doc/575445/" id="a_51">Section 8</a>. If retail vending of liquor  is
permitted there cannot be anything wrong in selling the same
liquor in the bar.
</p><p id="p_38">15.  Lastly,  the learned counsel cites	 <a href="/doc/734502/" id="a_52">R.  Vijayakumar  v.
Commissioner  of  Excise3</a> and submits that  even  in  policy
matters <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_53">Article 14</a> of the Constitution will apply.
</p><p id="p_39">16.Mr  R.K.  Garg,  learned  counsel,  appearing  for  the
appellants in CA No. 4982 of 1994 arising out of SLP (C) No.
9957 of 1993 submits as follows.
</p><p id="p_40">17.<a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_54">The Prohibition Act</a> provides for complete  prohibition.
However, the Government has reserved to itself the power  to
grant  exemption  in order to augment  financial  resources.
The Government of Tamil Nadu in the year 1992-93 decided  as
a  policy to provide for bar licence attached to the  retail
shops  in  order to augment revenue on	auctions  of  retail
shops.	 This  change  in policy  was  notified	 before	 the
auction	 for  the year 1992-93 stating only  retail  venders
will  be eligible for bar licences.  Out of  the  successful
retail	shop  vendors 300 and odd applied  and	secured	 bar
licence in accordance with the definite condition of auction
held  in 1992-93 that licence for bar attached to  the	shop
will  be  granted  after application was  received  and	 the
prescribed  fee was paid.  The State of Tamil Nadu  has,  by
this  integrated new policy, escalated the bid	amounts,  in
addition  earned  bar licence fees.  Thus, it  is  submitted
that  the rules relating to retail vending of IMFL  and	 the
rules for sale of liquor in Bars attached to the shop formed
a single integrated scheme.  Such a trade was to go on for a
period	of  3 years with automatic yearly renewal  on  terms
specified  without  fresh auction.   The  Government  cannot
destroy	 the integrated character of trade.  This  arbitrary
action has resulted in unjust enrichment on the part of	 the
Government  and	 breach	 of faith bordering  on	 fraud.	  No
demonstrable basis was disclosed for such an action.
</p><p id="p_41">18.The	Government illegally and arbitrarily delinked  the
retail	sale  from  sale in the Bars.	Such  an  integrated
policy	could  not be so changed as to impose  unjust  back-
breaking  burden's on the retail vendors.  This	 amounts  to
destruction  of fair play.  It is also violative of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_55">Article

</p><p id="p_42">19.The	impugned  notification dated 3-3-1993  has  to	be

on unfounded apprehensions relating to law and order.
</p><p id="p_48">21.  It	 is  violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_56">Article  14</a>  of  the	Constitution

</p><p id="p_51">23. Mr G.L. Sanghi, learned counsel, appearing for the State
of Tamil Nadu traces the history relating to prohibition  in
Tamil  Nadu.   On 16-7-1991, the present  Government,  as  a
first  step  towards  implementation  of  total	 prohibition
policy	in  the	 State,	 brought  complete  prohibition	  in
relation  to  manufacturing and trading of  country  liquor.
This  was  done because the State took note of	the  serious
social	evil  uprooting the family life of  very  many	poor
people in the State.  Thereafter GOMs 90 dated 21-4-1992 was
passed enabling auction of liquor retail vending shops.	  At
that point of time retail vending shops were not allowed  to
have  bar attached to the licence shops.  They were to	sell
the  liquor only in bottles.  In the earlier year the  total
number of retail vending shops was 3049 whereas in the	year
1992-93	 the number of shops increased to 4216.	  There	 was
also an increase in the revenue from 32 crores to 98 crores.
This  increase was due to the commercial expectation of	 the
bidders and the heavy competition among them.
</p><p id="p_52">24.The	Government  also  thought it fit  that	such  shop
owners	who  have  licence might be  allowed  to  have	Bars
attached to the shops.	It was in this view the bar  licence
was granted to those persons who held the licence for  shops
under Tamil Nadu (Liquor Retail Vending) Rules, 1989.  The

Government   received  various	representations	 that	such
running of Bars attached to retail vending shops had  become
nuisance  to  the  public  particularly	 to  the  womenfolk.
Therefore, the Governor of Tamil Nadu in his speech made  in
the  Legislative Assembly on 4-2-1993 announced	 the  policy
decision  of the Government to abolish Bars.  It  was  under
these  circumstances, GOMs No. 44 dated 3-3-1993 came to  be
passed	discontinuing both the grant and the renewal of	 bar
licences.  This GO was unsuccessfully challenged before	 the
High  Court.  It is submitted that only under the  authority
of rules the vendor was empowered to sell liquor.  There are
two  different	sets of rules one of the year  1988  dealing
with the retail vending of IMFS; 1992 Rules dealing with bar
licences.  There is no question of these two different	sets
of rules becoming an integrated scheme.	 That being so,	 the
principle  of Nandlal case4 cannot apply.  In the case of  a
statutory  rule, no question of arbitrariness  would  arise.
It  is always open to a State to change its policy.  If	 the
contention of the appellants is accepted it would amount  to
fettering  the	State from repealing a law.  This  Court  in
<a href="/doc/1795267/" id="a_58">Ghaziabad  Development	Authority v. Delhi  Auto  &amp;  General
Finance	  Pvt.	 Ltd</a>.6	 has   clearly	 pointed   out	 the
inapplicability	 of the doctrine of legitimate	expectation.
The same is the position here.
</p><p id="p_53">25.As  regards	the principle that the	Government  cannot
claim any immunity from the doctrine of promissory  estoppel
and  there  is	no  obligation to  act	fairly	and  justly,
reliance  is placed on <a href="/doc/517737/" id="a_59">Vasantkumar Radhakisan Vora v.  Board
of Trustees of the Port of Bombay7</a>.
</p><p id="p_54">26.The	 next  submission  of  the  learned  counsel   is,
legislative  action  whether plenary or subordinate  is	 not
subject	 to  natural justice.  It has been so laid  down  in
<a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_60">Union of India v. Cynamide India Ltd</a>.8 To the same effect is
<a href="/doc/223504/" id="a_61">Indian	Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt.  Ltd. v.  Union  of
India9</a>.	  The principle that subordinate legislation  cannot
be questioned on the ground of violation of the principle of
natural justice, has been reiterated.  In the case of liquor
vending	 licences one can expect to have renewal on  payment
of 15 per cent or 10 per cent, as the case may be.  But in a
bar  licence  there  is no possibility	of  renewal  of	 the
privilege  because Rule 6(1)(c) states: "A privilege  amount
as  may	 be  fixed by the Government in	 this  behalf."	 If,
therefore, it is a privilege no question of right to renewal
arises.	 Lastly, it is submitted that no representation	 was
made.  Therefore, the question of promissory estoppel cannot
arise.
</p><p id="p_55">27.Mr  V.R. Reddy, learned Additional  Solicitor  General,
submits	 that there is no scope in this case for  contending
that  the principle of legitimate expectation  would  arise.
<a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_62">Union  of  India v. Hindustan Development Corpn</a>.  10  is  an
authority  for the proposition that this  principle  applies

</blockquote><p id="p_92">What  is important to be noted here is, under Rule 14(3)  of
the  said Rules the licensing authority is empowered  either
to  renew or not to renew the licence.	Therefore, there  is
</p><p id="p_93">-no  automatic renewal.	 These rules were approved on  15-4-
1989 by GOMs No. 506, Home, Prohibition and Excise dated 15-
4-1989.
</p><p id="p_94">36. The present Government assumed office in June 1991.	  On
16-7-1991  complete prohibition of manufacture and trade  in
country liquor was imposed.  Undoubtedly, this was a step in
furtherance of <a href="/doc/1551554/" id="a_78">Article 47</a> of the Constitution of India.	  On
21-4-1992, by GOMs No. 90 the Government ordered the auction
of  retail vending shops throughout the State.	The sale  of
liquor	was  to be in bottles.	At this stage,	no  bar	 was
allowed	 to  be	 attached  to the  licence  shop  of  retail
vending.   For the excise year 1992-93 the number  of  shops
increased  and	the  excise  revenue  also   correspondingly
increased.  As rightly urged by learned Additional Solicitor
General	 this increase was due to the total  prohibition  of
country	 liquor,  namely, toddy and arrack.   The  retailers
made a representation that they could be allowed to have bar
attached to the shops.	It was in these circumstances,	GOMs
No.  99, Prohibition and Excise Department  dated  26-5-1992
came to be passed.  It must be made clear at this stage that
these Rules called Tamil Nadu Liquor (Retail Vending in Bar)
Rules,	1992 deal only with the bar regulating the issue  of
licence and the privilege of retail vending of liquor in the
bar.   The  Rules came into force on 1-6-1992.	 Under	Rule
4(a)  it  is only a person holding a licence  granted  under
Rule  13  of  Retail Vending Rules, 1989  who  can  make  an
application for the grant of privilege and issue of  licence
for  retail vending of liquor in the bar.
</p><p id="p_95">37. The privilege amount varied from place to place from  Rs
18,750 to Rs 75,000.
</p><p id="p_96">38. The period of licence was coterminous with the period of
licence	 issued	 for vending liquor.  Rule  6  dealing	with
renewal	 of licence is important.  Clauses (1), (2) and	 (4)
of Rule 6 are quoted hereunder:

the privilege amount may be fixed by the State Government in
that  behalf.  Further there is power to refuse renewal;  of
course,	 for  valid reasons subject to right of	 appeal	 and
revision under Rules 16 and 17.	 On 4-2-1993 the Governor of
Tamil Nadu made the following address:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	      "Prohibition as a key issue of State Policy is
	      a	  constitutional   directive.	  Honourable
	      Members  of  the	House  are  aware  that	 the
	      Government, under the leadership of the  Chief
	      Minister,	 Dr J. Jayalalitha,  implemented  as
	      its  first  decision the	abolition  of  cheap
	      liquor shops throughout the State, in  keeping
	      with  its	 announced  policy  of	prohibition,
	      although	this  involved	an  annual  loss  of
	      revenue  of Rs 390 crores.  The drive  against
	      bootlegging and illicit liquor was intensified
	      with   the   formation  of   the	 Prohibition
	      Enforcement Wing.	 The Chief Minister's  drive
	      against	erring	officials  resulted   in   a
	      noticeable  reduction  in	 the  incidence	  of
	      illicit	liquor.	   A   massive	 multi-media
	      propaganda  offensive  against  the  evils  of
	      liquor  has  also	 been  launched.   We	have
	      decided  to  give	 a  decisive  edge  to	 the
	      offensive	   against   illicit	liquor	  by
	      strengthening    further	  the	 Prohibition
	      Enforcement  Wing	 at a cost of Rs  7  crores.
	      With one enforcement unit in each Police	Sub-
	      Division,	  the  Enforcement  Wing  will	 act
	      effectively  against the	antisocial  elements
	      engaged  in  the illicit liquor  trade.	This
	      Government places the highest emphasis on	 the
	      welfare of the people, revenue  considerations
	      yielding	place  to consideration	 of  maximum
	      social  good.   Members  of  the	House	will
	      wholeheartedly  welcome  the decision  of	 the
	      Government  to withdraw the licences for	Bars
	      attached	to foreign spirit shops with  effect
	      from  the	 excise year commencing	 from  June,

short Bar Rules) form an integral scheme?
</blockquote><p id="p_99">41.  In	 view  of what is stated above,	 it  is	 clear	that
privilege  of  retail vending could only be  under  licence.
Such a licence is obtained after a successful bid.  The mere
success in the bid does not ensure the privilege.  Still, as
seen above, even after the confirmation of sale the auction-
purchaser will have to apply in Form No. VI to the licensing
authority for the grant of licence along with the  requisite
fee.  It is only after the licensing authority is  satisfied
as to the suitability of the auction procedure for the grant
of  licence,  such  a licence is  granted.   The  period  of
licence is one year.  No doubt, Rule 14 provides for renewal
on payment of 15 per cent than the privilege amount for	 the
first  renewal and 10 per cent more for the second  renewal.
Here  again,  there is no automatic renewal because  of	 the
power  contained under	  Rule 14(3) enabling the  licensing
authority  to  refuse.	 Thus,	the  Liquor  Vending   Rules
completely take care of vending providing for each detail.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">526</span>
<p id="p_100">42.The Bar Rules under Rule 4(a) lay down a  qualification
that  only a person holding a vending licence could  seek  a
bar  licence.  These rules also talk of renewal	 of  licence
under Rule 6. As seen above, such a renewal is not automatic
for two reasons:
</p><p id="p_101">(1)  The privilege amount is to be fixed by the State; and
(2)  under Rule 6(4) there is a power of refusal.
These are two sets of separate rules.  One which deals	with
retail	vending	 of  IMFS the other with  the  bar.   It  is
incorrect   to	contend	 that  both  these  Rules  form	  an
integrated  scheme.   Merely because for obtaining  the	 bar
licence,  one  must be a holder of retail  vending  licence,
they  cannot  become integrated scheme.	 Each set  of  rules
take care of different situations.  Therefore, we reject the
argument  of Mr R.K. Garg that they form integrated  scheme.
Nandlal case4 has no application since that was a case of an
integrated scheme which is not so here.
Question No. 2: Whether the appellants can claim the benefit
of the doctrine of legitimate exception?
</p><p id="p_102">43.  We	 will briefly deal with the doctrine  of  legitimate
expectation.   It is not necessary to refer to large  number
of  cases  excepting the following few.	  On  this  doctrine
Clive  Lewis in Judicial Remedies in Public Law at  page  97
states thus:
</p>	      "Decisions affecting legitimate expectations.-
<p id="p_103">	      In  the public law field, individuals may	 not
	      have strictly enforceable rights but they	 may
			    have     legitimate	    expectations.      Suc
h
	      expectations may stem either from a promise or
	      a	 representation	 made by a public  body,  or
	      from  a  previous practice of a  public  body.
	      The promise of a hearing before a decision  is
	      taken   may   give  rise	 to   a	  legitimate
	      expectation  that a hearing will be given.   A
	      past practice of consulting before a  decision
	      is  taken may give rise to an  expectation  of
	      consultation  before  any future	decision  is
	      taken.  A promise to confer, or past  practice
	      of conferring a substantive benefit, may	give
	      rise  to	an expectation that  the  individual
	      will  be given a bearing before a decision  is
	      taken  not to confer the benefit.	 The  actual
	      enjoyment of a benefit may create a legitimate
	      expectation  that	 the  benefit  will  not  be
	      removed  without the individual being given  a
	      hearing.	 On occasions, individuals  seek  to
	      enforce the promise or expectation itself,  by
	      claiming	that  the  substantive	benefit	  be
	      conferred.     Decisions	  affecting	such
	      legitimate   expectations	  are	subject	  to
	      judicial review."
</p><p id="p_104">	      44.  In  Council of Civil	 Service  Unions  v.
	      Minister for the Civil Service 5 it is  stated
	      thus: (All ER pp. 943-44).
</p><p id="p_105">	      "But even where a person claiming some benefit
	      or  privilege has no legal right to it,  as  a
	      matter   of  private  law,  he  may   have   a
	      legitimate   expectation	of   receiving	 the
	      benefit  or privilege, and, if so, the  courts
	      will  protect  his  expectation  by   judicial
	      review as a matter of public law.
</p><p id="p_106">	      This subject has been fully explained by	Lord
	      Diplock in O'Reilly v.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">527</span>
<p id="p_107">Mackman13  and	I need not repeat what he  has	so  recently
said.	Legitimate,  or reasonable,  expectation  may  arise
either	from an express promise given on behalf of a  public
authority or from the existence of a regular practice  which
the claimant can reasonably expect to continue.	 Examples of
the  former type of expectation are Liverpool  Taxi  Owners'
Assn., Re14 and A-G of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiul5. (I agree
with  Lord Diplock's view, expressed in the speech  in	this
appeal, that 'legitimate' is to be preferred to 'reasonable'
in  this  context.   I was responsible for  using  the	word
'reasonable' for the reason explained in Ng Yuen Shiu15, but
it  was intended only to be exegetical of 'legitimate'.)  An
example	 of  the  latter  in R.	 v.  Hull  Prison  Board  of
Visitors,  ex  p. St Germainl6, approved by  this  House  in
O'Reilly v. Mackman13."
</p><p id="p_108">45. In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 1(1), 4th Edn., para
81 at pages 151-52 it is stated thus:

	      "It  has	to be noticed that  the	 concept  of
	      legitimate  expectation in administrative	 law
	      has   now,  undoubtedly,	 gained	  sufficient
	      importance.   It	is stated  that	 'legitimate

	      list  of concepts fashioned by the courts	 for
	      the  review of administrative action and	this

	      unreasonableness, the fiduciary duty of  local
	      authorities  and	'in  future,  perhaps,	 the
	      principle	 of proportionality'.  A passage  in
	      Administrative  Law, 6th Edn., by H.W.R.	Wade
	      page 424 reads thus:
</p><p id="p_128">	      'These  are  revealing decisions.	  They	show

</p><p id="p_129">	      Unfairness  in  the form	of  unreasonableness
	      here comes close to unfairness in the form  of
	      violation of natural justice, and the doctrine
	      of legitimate expectation can operate in	both
	      contexts.	  It is obvious,  furthermore,	that
	      this  principle of substantive, as opposed  to
	      procedural, fairness may undermine some of the
	      established    rules   about   estoppel	 and
	      misleading  advice,  which  tend	to   operate
	      unfairly.	    Lord    Scarman    has    stated
	      emphatically that unfairness in the  purported
	      exercise of a power can amount to an abuse  or
	      excess  of  power, and this  seems  likely  to
	      develop into an important general doctrine.'
	      Another passage at page 522 in the above	book
	      reads thus:
</p><p id="p_130">	      "It was in fact for the purpose of restricting
	      the   right  to  be  heard  that	 'legitimate
	      expectation' was introduced into the law.	  It
	      made  its	 first appearance in  a	 case  where
	      alien  students of 'scientology' were  refused
	      extension of their entry permits as an act  of
	      policy   by  the	Home  Secretary,   who	 had
	      announced that no discretionary benefits would
	      be granted to this sect.	The Court of  Appeal
	      held  that they had no legitimate	 expectation
	      of extension beyond the permitted time, and so
	      no  right to a hearing, though  revocation  of
			    their permits within that time would have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">533</span>
	      been   contrary  to  legitimate	expectation.
	      Official statements of policy, therefore,	 may
	      cancel  legitimate expectation, just  as	they
	      may create it, as seen above.  In a  different
	      context where car-hire drivers had  habitually
	      offended	against airport bye-laws, with	many
	      convictions and unpaid fines, it was held that
	      they  had no legitimate expectation  of  being
	      heard  before  being  banned  by	the  airport
	      authority.
</p><p id="p_131">	      There  is	 some ambiguity in the	dicta  about
	      legitimate expectation, which may mean  either
	      expectation  of a fair hearing or	 expectation
	      of the licence or other benefit which is being
	      sought.  But the result is the same in  either
	      case;  absence of legitimate expectation	will
	      absolve the public authority from affording  a
	      hearing. (emphasis supplied)
	      Again,  at pages 56-57 it	 is  observed  thus:
	      (SCC p. 547, para 33)
	      "A case of legitimate expectation would  arise
	      when  a  body  by representation	or  by	past
	      practice aroused expectation which it would be
	      within  its powers to fulfil.  The  protection
	      is  limited  to  that extent  and	 a  judicial
	      review  can  be within those limits.   But  as
	      discussed	 above a person who bases his  claim
	      on the doctrine of legitimate expectation,  in
	      the first instance, must satisfy that there is
	      a foundation and thus has locus standi to make
	      such a claim.  In considering the same several
	      factors  which  give rise to  such  legitimate
	      expectation  must	 be present.   The  decision
	      taken  by	 the authority must be found  to  be
	      arbitrary,  unreasonable	and  not  taken	  in
	      public  interest.	  If  it is  a	question  of
	      policy,  even by way of change of old  policy,
	      the  courts cannot interfere with a  decision.
	      In  a given case whether there are such  facts
	      and circumstances giving rise to a  legitimate
	      expectation, it would primarily be a  question
	      of fact.	If these tests are satisfied and  if
	      the   court  is  satisfied  that	a  case	  of
	      legitimate  expectation is made out  then	 the
	      next question would be whether failure to give
	      an opportunity of hearing before the  decision
	      affecting	  such	legitimate  expectation	  is
	      taken, has resulted in failure of justice	 and
	      whether on that ground the decision should  be
	      quashed.	 If that be so then what  should  be
	      the relief is again a matter which depends  on
	      several				   factors."
</p><p id="p_132">	      (emphasis supplied)
	      Again at pages 57-58 it is observed thus: (SCC
	      pp. 548-49, para 35)
	      "Legitimate  expectations may come in  various
	      forms  and  owe their existence  to  different
	      kind  of circumstances and it is not  possible
	      to  give an exhaustive list in the context  of
	      vast  and fast expansion of  the	governmental
	      activities.   They  shift and change  so	fast
	      that  the start of our list would be  obsolete
	      before  we reached the middle.  By  and  large
	      they arise in cases of promotions which are in
	      normal course expected, though not  guaranteed
	      by  way  of  a statutory right,  in  cases  of
	      contracts,  distribution	of  largess  by	 the
	      Government and in somewhat similar situations.
	      For instance discretionary grant of  licences,
	      permits	or  the	 like,	carry  with   it   a
	      reasonable  expectation,	though not  a  legal
	      right  to	 renewal or non-revocation,  but  to
	      summarily	 disappoint that expectation may  be
	      seen  as unfair without the  expectant  person
	      being heard.  But
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">534</span>
there  again the court has to see whether it was done  as  a
policy	or in the public interest either by way of GO,	rule
or  by	way  of a legislation.	If that be  so,	 a  decision
denying a legitimate expectation based on such grounds	does
not  qualify  for interference unless in a given  case,	 the
decision  or  action  taken amounts to an  abuse  of  power.
Therefore  the limitation is extremely confined and  if	 the
according of natural justice does not condition the exercise
of the power, the concept of legitimate expectation can have
no role to play and the court must not usurp the  discretion
of  the	 public	 authority which is empowered  to  take	 the
decisions  under law and the court is expected to  apply  an
objective  standard which leaves to the	 deciding  authority
the  full range of choice which the legislature is  presumed
to have intended.  Even in a case where the decision is left
entirely to the discretion of the deciding authority without
any  such legal bounds and if the decision is  taken  fairly
and objectively, the court will not interfere on the  ground
of  procedural fairness to a person whose interest based  on
legitimate  expectation might be affected.  For instance  if
an  authority  who has full discretion to  grant  a  licence
prefers	 an existing licence-holder to a new applicant,	 the
decision  cannot  be  interfered  with	on  the	 ground	  of
legitimate  expectation	 entertained by	 the  new  applicant
applying   the	principles  of	natural	 justice.   It	 can
therefore  be  seen that legitimate expectation can  at	 the
most  be one of the grounds which may give rise to  judicial
review but the granting of relief is very much limited.	  It
would thus appear that there are stronger reasons as to	 why
the  legitimate	 expectation  should  not  be  substantively
protected than the reasons as to why it should be protected.
In  other words such a legal obligation exists whenever	 the
case  supporting  the same in terms of legal  principles  of
different  sorts, is stronger than the case against it.	  As
observed in Attorney General for New South Wales case45:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">	      'To strike down the exercise of administrative
	      power  solely  on the ground of  avoiding	 the
	      disappointment of the legitimate	expectations
	      of  an individual would be to set	 the  courts
	      adrift  on  a featureless sea  of	 pragmatism.</blockquote>
<p id="p_133">			    Moreover,	the   notion   of   a	 legitimat
e
	      expectation  (falling short of a legal  right)
	      is   too	 nebulous  to  form  a	 basis	 for
	      invalidating the exercise of a power when	 its
	      exercise otherwise accords with law.'
If  a  denial  of legitimate expectation  in  a	 given	case
amounts	 to  denial  of right guaranteed  or  is  arbitrary,
discriminatory,	 unfair or biased, gross abuse of  power  or
violation of principles of natural justice, the same can  be
questioned  on the well-known grounds attracting <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_98">Article  14</a>
but  a	claim based on mere legitimate	expectation  without
anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these
principles."

</p><p id="p_138">49. The licence under the Bar Rules of 1992 is for a  period
of one year.  That could be renewed, as seen above only on a
privilege  amount, as may be fixed by the State	 Government,
in  this  behalf.   This is unlike the case  of	 the  retail
vending	 licence  wherein  the renewal	is  contemplated  on
payment	 of  15 per cent more than the privilege  amount  at
which  the  sale  of  the privilege  was  confirmed  in	 the
previous  year.	  This	is  as	regards	 the  second   year.
Likewise, 10 per cent more than the privilege amount for the
third  year.  Therefore, the position is entirely  different
giving no room for any expectation.  At best, it could be  a
hope.	On this aspect we can usefully refer to Director  of
Public	Works v. Ho Po Sang46.	At (All ER) page 730 it	 was
observed thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">	      "It  was	submitted on behalf  of	 the  lessee
	      that, after the director had given notice [see

<p id="p_139">	      building	certificate,  some kind of  a  right
	      (even  though one that might be  defeated)  to
	      such  a certificate was then acquired  by	 the
	      lessee.	Their Lordships cannot	accept	this
	      view.   After the director gave notice of	 his
	      intention to issue a certificate, there  could
	      have  been  no  giving  of  it  until  certain
	      conditions  were	satisfied.  The	 lessee	 was
	      under  obligation to give notices as  required
	      by <a href="/doc/272958/" id="a_100">Section 3-B(1)</a>.  Had there been no  appeals
			    by tenants and subtenants and had the time	fo
r
	      appeals expired, the director would then	have
	      been in a position to give a certificate.	 Had
	      those been the circumstances then, inasmuch as
	      the director had indicated what his  intention
	      was, doubtless he would in fact have given his
	      certificate.  But the ordinance did not impose
	      an  obligation  on  the  director	 to  give  a
	      certificate  in accordance with  his  declared
	      intention;  it merely provided that  he  could
	      not  follow up his declared  intention  unless
	      and  until certain conditions were  satisfied.
	      Though,  in  the events  that  happened,	this
	      point does not call for decision, it would not
	      seem that, in any circumstances, any right  to
	      a	 certificate  could arise  at  least  until,
	      after  notices given, the time for appeals  by
	      tenants  and subtenants went by without  there
	      being  any appeal.  In a case, however,  where

	      giving of a re-building certificate no  longer
	      rested  with  the director.   In	the  present
	      case, the
46 (1961) 2 All ER 721
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">536</span>
	      position on 9-4-1957, was that the lessee	 did
	      not  and	could not know whether he  would  or
	      would not be given a re-building	certificate.
	      Had  there been no repeal, the  petitions	 and
	      cross-petition  would in due course have	been
	      taken  into consideration by the	Governor  in
	      Council.	Thereafter there would have been  an
	      exercise	of discretion.	The  Governor  would
	      have  directed  either that a  certificate  be
	      given or be not given, and the decision of the
	      Governor in Council would have been final.  In
	      these circumstances, their Lordships  conclude
	      that  it could not properly be said  that,  on
	      April 9, the lessee had an accrued right to be
	      given  a re-building certificate.	 It  follows
	      that  he	had  no	 accrued  right	 to   vacant
	      possession of the premises.  It was said	that
	      there  were accrued rights to  a	certificate,
	      and, consequently, to possession, subject only
	      to  the  risk  that  these  rights  might	  be
	      defeated,	 and it was said that in the  events
	      that  happened the rights were  not  defeated.
	      In their Lordships' view, such an approach  is
	      not  warranted by the facts.  On April 9,	 the
	      lessee  had no right.  He had no more  than  a
	      hope that the Governor in Council would give a
	      favourable decision.  So the first  submission
	      fails."
</p><p id="p_140">						      (emphasis
	      supplied)
</p><p id="p_141">50. It has already been seen that under Rule 4(a) of the Bar
Rules  the eligibility of such a licence is possession of  a
retail	vending licence.  The period of licence was for	 one
year ending by 31-5-1992.  The speech of the Governor  which
we have extracted above was made on 4-2-1993.  The  impugned
GO  had come to be passed on 3-3-1993.	The important  point
to  be	noted here is, long before the	bar  licensee  could
apply for renewal (Rule 6 talks of 30 days before the expiry
of  the licence) the policy decision has been taken  not  to
renew.
</p><p id="p_142">51. Having regard to what is stated above, it is clear	that
there was absolutely no promise of renewal at all.
</p><p id="p_143">52.  It was by a rule (subordinate legislation) in  exercise
of the powers conferred by Sections 17-C, 17-D, 21 and 54 of
the  Tamil  Nadu Prohibition Act, 1937	licences  under	 Bar
Rules came to be granted.  Those Rules have been repealed by
exercise  of the same powers under <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_102">Sections 17-C</a>,  <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_103">17-D</a>,  <a href="/doc/628266/" id="a_104">21</a>
and <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_105">54</a> of the Prohibition Act.	Therefore, this is a case of
legislation.  The doctrine of legitimate expectation  arises
only in the field of administrative decisions.	If the	plea
of  legitimate	expectation relates to	procedural  fairness
there is no possibility whatever of invoking the doctrine as
against the legislation.  However, Mr K. Parasaran,  learned
Senior	Counsel relies on Supreme Court	 <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_106">Advocates-on-Record
Assn.  v.  Union of India</a>.  At page 703 what  is  stated  is
this: (SCC para 478).
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_56">	      "Due   consideration   of	  every	  legitimate
	      expectation in the decisionmaking process is a
	      requirement  of the rule of  non-arbitrariness
	      and,  therefore,	this also is a	norm  to  be
	      observed	by  the Chief Justice  of  India  in
	      recommending   appointments  to  the   Supreme
	      Court.  Obviously, this factor applies only to
	      those considered suitable and at least equally
	      meritorious by the Chief Justice of India, for
	      appointment to the Supreme Court."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">537</span>
<p id="p_144">This principle of non-arbitrariness cannot apply to a change
of  policy by legislation.  Concerning the applicability  of
non-arbitrariness  and change of policy learned counsel	 has
cited <a href="/doc/734502/" id="a_107">R. Vijayakumar v. Commissioner of Excise3</a>.  That	case
dealt  with  discrimination between licensees.	 Hence,	 the
same  is  not  applicable.   As a  matter  of  fact  in	 the
affidavit  filed on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu  dated
8-7-1993 it is inter alia stated thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">	      "On complaints received from the public,	some
	      time  in February 1993 itself  the  Government
	      had decided not to renew the licences for	 bar
	      attached	to the retail vending  shops.	This
	      was  also announced in the  Governor's  speech
	      and made public on 4-2-1993.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">	      That on 3-3-1993 the Government by GOMs No. 44</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">	      announced	 that  as  a matter  of	 policy	 the
	      Government would not renew licences to the bar
	      attached	with  the vending shop	with  effect
	      from 1-6-1993."
</blockquote><p id="p_145">For  all these reasons, we have no hesitation in  coming  to
the  conclusion that the doctrine of legitimate	 expectation
cannot arise at all in this case.
</p><p id="p_146">53.  The effect of accepting the argument of the  appellants
would  be,  as	rightly urged by  Mr  G.L.  Sanghi,  learned
counsel	 appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu the power  of
the  State will be fettered not to repeal a particular	law,
however much public interest may require the repeal.
Question  No.  3:  Whether rescinding of the  Bar  Rules  is
arbitrary?
</p><p id="p_147">54.  It	 is  a settled principle  that	legislative  action,
plenary	 or subordinate, is not subject to natural  justice.
<a href="/doc/223504/" id="a_108">In Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt.  Ltd. v. Union of
India9</a> it is stated thus: (SCR pp. 347-48 : SCC p. 691, para

	      "	 That  subordinate  legislation	 cannot	  be

	      between  delegation of a legislative  function

	      reasonableness cannot be enquired into and the
	      investment  by statute to exercise  particular

</p><p id="p_150">55.  When  the	State  has  received  complaints  that	 the
consumption  of	 liquor in Bars resulted in  law  and  order
problems,  womenfolk  being harassed, certainly,  in  public
interest it could take a decision to repeal the grant of bar
licences.   There  is  nothing	unreasonable.	It  is	 not
necessary as Mr Garg contends that a committee ought to have
been  appointed and a report obtained before such a  repeal.
It  is	a  matter of policy which the  Government  alone  is
competent to formulate.	 The State Government knows how best
to augment its revenue.
</p><p id="p_151">56.  As we have seen above, if there is no promise or  right
of  renewal and if the policy decision has been taken  under
the  impugned  GO long before the licensee could  apply	 for
renewal what is the unfairness that could be complained of ?
In  our considered view, none.	From this point of view,  we
find  the ruling in <a href="/doc/517737/" id="a_115">Vasantkumar Radhakisan Vora v. Board  of
Trustees  of  the Port of Bombay7</a> is not applicable  to	 the

</p><p id="p_153">57. We have already noted that <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_117">Section 54</a> of the Prohibition
Act   is   a  rule-making  section.   The  rules   and	 the
notification  require  to  be  published  in  the   Official

if  enacted  in	 the  parent Act.  The	High  Court  on	 the
question  of  applicability of Section 8 of the	 Tamil	Nadu
General Clauses Act has stated thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_59">	      "Section	4 of the Tamil Nadu General  Clauses
	      Act  makes Chapter 11 applicable to all  <a href="/doc/195458/" id="a_118">Tamil
	      Nadu  Act</a>s after the commencement of the	said
	      Act  unless  a contrary intention	 appears  in
	      such  Acts.   Section  8	of  the	 Tamil	Nadu
	      General Clauses Act is subject to <a href="/doc/1934162/" id="a_119">Section 4</a> of
	      that  Act and the new enactment can  expressly
	      or   by  necessary  implication  exclude	 the

	      <a href="/doc/902105/" id="a_122">8</a>	 together,  there can be no  doubt  that  an
	      enactment	 which repeals an earlier  enactment
	      can  exclude any of the provisions of  Chapter
	      11 of the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act.	 The
	      impugned	GO  has	 rescinded  the	 Tamil	Nadu
	      Liquor  (Retail  Vending in Bar)	Rules,	1992
	      with  effect on and from 1-6-1993.  Hence	 the
	      repealed rules ceased to be in existence after
	      31-5-1993.   The	privilege  and	the  licence
	      granted to the petitioner were admittedly	 for
	      one  year	 ending with 31-5-1993.	  Under	 the
	      repealed rules they were obliged to apply	 for
	      renewal  and  the renewal was  not  automatic.</blockquote>
<p id="p_154">	      The   application	 for  renewal  had   to	  be
	      considered  under the rules by  the  concerned
	      authority	 and  appropriate orders  should  be
	      passed.  Once the rules are repealed, with the
	      expiry   of  31-5-1992,  there  could  be	  no
	      question	of considering any  application	 for
	      renewal for a period
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">539</span>
subsequent  to that date.  What all Section 8 of  the  Tamil
Nadu  General  Clauses	Act preserves or  protects  are	 the
rights acquired under the repealed Act.	 In other words, the
petitioner's licence for the period up to 31-5-1993 remained
undisturbed or unaffected by the impugned GO.  It is not  as
if the same right or privilege can operate beyond  31-5-1993
as  though  by	an  order  of  renewal.	  If  the  right  or
privileges cannot on its own force subsist when the impugned
GO comes into force the provisions of Section 8 of the Tamil
Nadu  General Clauses Act cannot give a fresh lease of	life
to  such  right	 or privilege or alter	the  period  of	 its
validity.  Hence, the contention based on the provisions  of
the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_123">General Clauses Act</a> has to fail,"
</p><p id="p_155">We are in entire agreement with this line of reasoning.
</p><p id="p_156">58.  In this connection, the reliance placed by	 the  teamed
Additional Solicitor General on <a href="/doc/752151/" id="a_124">Indira Sohanlal v. Custodian
of Evacuee Property, Delhi</a> 12 is fully justified.  At  (SCR)

	      applies  has to be treated as arising, and  to
	      be  dealt	 with,	under  the  new	 law  except
	      insofar  as certain consequences have  already
	      ensured  or acts have been completed prior  to
	      the  new Act, to which it is the old law	that
	      will apply."
</blockquote><p id="p_157">If,  therefore, as pointed out above, no right or  privilege
could operate beyond 31-5-1993, the benefit of Section 8  of
the Tamil Nadu General Clauses Act cannot be had.

<p id="p_171">3.  It is not disputed that the civil suit - in	 respect  of
agricultural land stoodabated under <a href="/doc/1731666/" id="a_140">Section 5(2)(a)</a> of the
Act.   The civil court is only proceeding in respect of	 the
property other than the agricultural land.  The question for
our consideration is whether in the facts and  circumstances
of  this  case	the  proceedings  before  the  consolidation
authorities should be stayed till the rights of the  parties
are finally adjudicated by the civil court.  The High  Court
has answered the question in the affirmative and against the
appellant.   This  appeal  by Sardar Singh  is	against	 the
judgment of the High Court.
</p><p id="p_172">4. On an application filed by Respondent 5 the Consolidation
Officer framed the following preliminary issue:
"Whether consolidation proceedings before the Consolidation
Officer	 will remain stayed as civil suit is pending  before
the civil court."
</p><p id="p_173">5.  The issue was decided against  Respondent 5 and  it	 was
held that the consolidation proceedings could not be stayed.
Appeal	filed  against the said order was dismissed  by	 the
Assistant  Settlement Officer and a further  revision  filed
before	the  Deputy  Director  of  Consolidation  was	also
dismissed on 27-11-1984.  Respondent 5 thereafter filed writ
petition  before the Allahabad High Court which was  allowed
and  the  proceedings before the  consolidation	 authorities
have been stayed till the final disposal of the civil  suit.
As  stated above this appeal by Sardar Singh is against	 the
judgment of the High Court.
</p><p id="p_174">6. The High Court allowed the writ petition on the following
reasoning:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">	      "In  the	instant case as the  litigation	 was
	      brought  before  this  court  in	testamentary
	      suits  and thereafter in special	appeals	 and
	      thereafter  civil	 suit  for  declaration	 was
	      filed  which was already pending	between	 the
	      parties  and  the evidence on  behalf  of	 the
	      plaintiff	 has  been led and the	evidence  on
	      behalf  of the defendant was  being  continued
	      meanwhile	 consolidation	operations  started.</blockquote>
<p id="p_175">	      There was possibility of conflicting judgments
	      if the plaintiff is held to be the heir in the
	      civil   suit  and	 not  as  an  heir  in	 the
	      consolidation proceedings.  Further the powers
	      under  <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_141">Section 48</a> of the Act are	much  wider,
	      even  propriety and incorrectness of an  order
	      can be gone into.	 In the circumstances of the
	      case  the orders passed by  the  Consolidation
	      Officer  and the Assistant Settlement  Officer
	      (Consolidation)  were  not  proper  under	 the
	      circumstances  of the case.... In the  instant
	      case the facts of the case are so unique and I
	      am  sure	that it is very rare  to  find	such
			    chequered litigation as earlier litigation	wa
s
	      fought  in  the High Court  and  thereafter  a
	      civil suit was filed and in the meanwhile	 the
	      consolidation operations commenced.  It is not
	      for  his	own  sake that	the  plaintiff	(the
	      petitioner) had made an application and got an
	      issue  framed on the point as to	whether	 the
	      consolidation proceedings may be stayed  under
	      the  facts and the circumstances of the  case,
	      rather   it  was	for  the  benefit   of	 the
	      contesting respondent also that they may first
	      devote   their  energy  fully  in	 the   civil
	      litigation  and thereafter  the  consolidation
	      authorities may decide the case in pursuance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">544</span>
	      of  the  order of the civil court.  It  is  on
	      account	 of   all    those    insurmountable
	      difficulties  that the application  was  moved
	      for   staying  the  proceedings	before	 the
	      consolidation authorities till the civil	suit
	      was decided.
</p><p id="p_176">	      In view of the discussions made hereinbefore I
	      am of the opinion that in view of the wide and
	      comprehensive  powers conferred on the  Deputy
	      Director	of  Consolidation his  decision	 was
	      manifestly   erroneous   in   law	  that	 the
	      proceedings    before    the     consolidation
	      authorities cannot be stayed.  Therefore,	 the
	      impugned	orders passed by  the  consolidation
	      authorities    being   manifestly	   erroneous
	      deserved	to  be quashed....  The	 proceedings
	      before  the Consolidation Officer between	 the
	      parties  in  case in 683/684 Sardar  Singh  v.
	      Administrators  are directed to remain  stayed
	      till  the	 civil suit between the	 parties  is
	      decided finally."
</p><p id="p_177">7.  It is no doubt correct that the issues, on the merit  of
the controversy between the parties, before the civil  court
and the consolidation authorities are by and large the same.
The  consolidation proceedings under the Act are in  respect
of  the	 agricultural  land  whereas  the  civil  court	  is
adjudicating  the  rights of the parties in respect  of	 the
property  other than the agricultural land.  We	 agree	with
the  High Court that there is possibility  of  contradictory
judgments  between  the civil court  and  the  consolidation
authorities.   On the other hand keeping in view the  nature
of   the  consolidation	 operations  the  staying   of	 the
consolidation  proceedings  in respect of part of  land	 may
have  an adverse effect on the consolidation  operations  in
the  whole of the area.	 The consolidation operations  under
the  Act include the determination of an area for  extension
of  abadi  including  the site	for  Harijans  and  landless
persons, area for other public purposes and the	 preparation
of  the scheme.	 We are of the view that  the  consolidation
operations under the Act would not be smoothly completed  if
the proceedings in respect of a part of the land are stayed.
Even  the  scheme  of  the  Act	 makes	it  clear  that	 the
authorities  under  the	 Act  have  no	power  to  stay	 the
consolidation  proceedings  once the  said  proceedings	 are
commenced  by way of a notification under <a href="/doc/1934162/" id="a_142">Section 4</a>  of	 the
Act.   We  are, therefore, of the view that the	 High  Court
fell into error in staying the consolidation proceedings  to
await the decision in the civil proceedings.
</p><p id="p_178">8.  We	are,  however, of the view  that  the  consolidation
authorities   must   have  an  opportunity  to	 take	into
consideration  the  findings  of  the  civil  courts.	 We,
therefore, direct that on the final conclusion of the 'civil
proceedings  the judgment of the civil court which  achieves
finality may be placed before the Director of  Consolidation
who  shall thereupon, if necessary, reopen  the	 proceedings
under  <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_143">Section	48</a> of the Act and pass a fresh	order  after
taking into consideration the findings of the civil court.
</p><p id="p_179">9.  We	allow the appeal in the above terms, set  aside	 the
judgment  of the High Court dated 7-5-1985 and	dismiss	 the
writ  petition filed by Respondent 5 before the High  Court.
No costs.

<p id="p_180">LAXMI DEVI v. SATYA NARAYAN (Mohan, J.)
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
MOHAN,	J.- The first respondent was charged for an  offence
under  <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_144">Section 494</a> IPC, Respondent 7 under <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_145">Section 494</a>	read
with  <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_146">Section 109</a> of IPC and Respondents 2 to 6 and 8 and  9
under <a href="/doc/790355/" id="a_147">Section 494</a> read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_148">Section 120-B</a> of IPC.  The trial
took  place before Judicial Magistrate No. 1,  Bikaner.	  It
was held that the prosecution had not proved through  proper
witnesses  'saptapadi'	to establish the  factum  of  second
marriage  of accused (Respondent 1).  The High	Court  found
that  it  was not a fit case for grant of leave	 to  appeal.
Thus, the present criminal appeal against the impugned order
dated 18-7-1978 was passed by High Court.
</p><p id="p_181">2. The only point urged before us is that though 'saptapadi'
a  fact	 has not been proved, there is	enough	evidence  to
establish   the	 factum	 of  second  marriage.	 There	 are
eyewitnesses who have seen the marriage.  That is enough  to
bring out the charge.  The principle relating to 'saptapadi'
taking	of  seven  steps before the sacred  fire  cannot  be
insisted  upon	if  as	of  fact  marriage  is	established.
Therefore, the courts below are wrong.
</p><p id="p_182">3.  The learned counsel for the respondents would urge	that
the  courts  below  have  correctly  appreciated  the  legal
position.  It is 'saptapadi' which establishes the factum of
marriage,  being  an essential ceremony.  Without  proof  of
such a ceremony, a case for bigamy cannot arise.
+From  the  Judgment and Order dated  18-7-1978	 of  the
Rajasthan  High Court in S.B. Cri.  Leave to Appeal No.	 107
of 1978
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">546</span>
</p><p id="p_183">4.  We	have  carefully	 gone  through	the  evidence.	 The
evidence  of PW 2 to PW 5 does not establish  the  essential
ceremony of marriage viz. saptapadi'.
</p><p id="p_184">	      5.   This	  Court	 in  <a href="/doc/1924788/" id="a_149">Kanwal  Ram   v.	H.P</a>.
</p><p id="p_185">	      Administration1 has held as under:
</p><p id="p_186">	      "It was contended for the appellants that this
	      evidence	was  not  enough to  show  that	 the
	      marriage	of Kubja and Kanwal Ram can be	said
	      to   have	 been  performed.   We	think	this
	      contention  is justified.	 <a href="/doc/1630427/" id="a_150">In Bhaurao  Shankar
	      Lokhande v. State of Maharashtra2</a>, this  Court
	      held that a marriage is not proved unless	 the
	      essential	  ceremonies   required	  for	 its
	      solemnisation   are   proved  to	 have	been
	      performed.  The evidence of the witness called
	      to prove the marriage ceremonies, showed	that
	      the   essential	ceremonies  had	  not	been
	      performed..  So that evidence  cannot  justify
	      the conviction.  The trial court also took the
	      same view.  The learned Judicial	Commissioner
	      does not seem to have taken a different view.
	      The  learned Judicial  Commissioner,  however,
	      thought that apart from the evidence about the
	      marriage	ceremonies earlier  mentioned  there
	      was  other  evidence  which  would  prove	 the
	      second  marriage.	  He  first  referred  to  a
	      statement by the appellant Kanwal Ram that  he
	      had sexual relationship with Kubja."
</p><p id="p_187">6.  The same principle is reiterated in <a href="/doc/80924/" id="a_151">Priya Bala Ghosh  v.
Suresh Chandra Ghosh3</a> as under: (SCC pp. 867-68, 872,  paras
10, 25)
	      "According  to  Mr  Majumdar,  when  once	 the
	      priest  has given evidence to the effect	that
	      the   marriage  between  the  respondent	 and
	      Sandhya  Rani has been performed,	 it  follows
	      that  all	 the essential ceremonies  that	 are
	      necessary to constitute a valid marriage	must
	      be  presumed to have been performed.   In	 any
	      event, when there is evidence to show that the
	      marriage	as  a  fact  has  taken	 place,	 the
	      presumption   is	that  it  has  taken   place
	      according	 to  law.   In	this  connection  Mr
	      Majumdar	 referred  us  to  various   English
	      decisions	 where	on  the	 basis	of   certain
	      evidence	 regarding  the	 taking	  place	  of
	      marriage between the parties a presumption has
	      been  drawn that the marriage must  have	been
	      solemnized according to law.  In our  opinion,
	      it  is  unnecessary to refer  to	those  cases
	      cited  by the learned counsel as the  position
	      is  concluded  against the  appellant  by	 the
	      decisions	 of  this  Court  on  both   points.
	      <a href="/doc/559904/" id="a_152">Section 5</a> of the Act lays down conditions	 for
	      a Hindu marriage.	 It will be seen that one of
	      the  conditions is that referred to in  clause
</p><p id="p_188">	      (i), namely, that neither of the parties has a
	      spouse  living  at the time of  the  marriage.
	      <a href="/doc/907204/" id="a_153">Section  7</a>  dealing with	the  ceremonies	 for
	      Hindu marriage is as follows:

2  AIR 1965 SC 1564 : (1965) 2 SCR 837 : (1965) 2 Cri LJ 544
3  (1971) 1 SCC 864 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 362: AIR 1971 SC 11 53
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">547</span>
	      '7.   Ceremonies for a Hindu marriage.- (1)  A
	      Hindu marriage may be solemnized in accordance
	      with  the	 customary rites and  ceremonies  of
	      either party thereto.
</p><p id="p_190">	      (2)Where such rites and  ceremonies include
	      the  Saptapadi (that is, the taking  of  seven
	      steps by the bridegroom and the bride  jointly
	      before the sacred fire), the marriage  becomes
	      complete and binding when the seventh step  is
	      taken.'
We  have pointed out that in the case before us	 both  sides
were agreed that according to the law prevalent amongst them
Homa and Saptapadi were essential rites to be performed	 for
solemnization  of  the	marriage and there  is	no  specific
evidence regarding the performance of these essential rites.
The  parties have also not proved that they are governed  by
any  custom under which these essential ceremonies need	 not
be performed.
</p><p id="p_191">To conclude, we have already referred to the fact that	both
the   learned  Sessions	 Judge	and  the  High	Court	have
categorically  found  that the Homa and	 Saptapadi  are	 the
essential  rites  for  a  marriage  according  to  the	 law
governing  the	parties and that there is no  evidence	that
these two essential ceremonies have been performed when	 the
respondent   is	 stated	 to  have  married  Sandhya   Rani."
(emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_192">7. The position is similar in this case.  In the absence  of
proof  of  such	 a ceremony the factum	of  second  marriage
cannot be held to have been made out.
</p><p id="p_193">8.  Though we have come to the above conclusion,  the  first
respondent is undoubtedly living with Bimla, Respondent 4 as
husband and wife.  Merely because the appellant is not in  a
position  to prove the factum of second marriage  punishable
under  <a href="/doc/508426/" id="a_154">Section	494</a> of the Indian Penal Code that  does	 not
mean the appellant should be left in the lurch.	  Exercising
our powers under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_155">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India we
think  appellant should be awarded compensation	 which	will
bring	some  solace  when  her	 life  is   dismally   dark.
Therefore,  we quantify the compensation at Rs 25,000  which
shall  be  paid	 by the first respondent  to  the  appellant
within eight weeks from today.
</p><p id="p_194">9. In the result, the criminal appeal is disposed of in	 the
above terms.
