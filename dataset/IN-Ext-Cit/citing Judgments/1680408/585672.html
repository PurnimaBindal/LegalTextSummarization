    workman at Sr.No.16 in the complaint from the date of complaint to 8-7-1995
    (when he was dismissed on a ground unconnected with the lis). Workman at Sr.No.
    17 in the complaint was directed to be given similar benefit of regularization as
    Gateman from the date of complaint till his appointment as Typist. Employer is
    aggrieved because workmen were granted these benefits and workmen are
    aggrieved by the order because it gives them the benefits from the date of complaint

    similar order passed on 24-8-1999 by the learned Member, Industrial Court,

    the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (hereinafter referred to as "APMC")
    constituted under the Maharashtra Agriculture Produce Marketing (Development
                            
    and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_1">Regulation) Act</a>, 1963.     Respondent Nos.2 to 21 were appointed by the
    Committee on an ad hoc and temporary basis as and when need arose between
    3-6-1978 and 12-8-1986, but against posts which were not sanctioned. As a fact, it
           

    cannot be disputed that they had completed 240 days of continuous service long
    before they filed complaints on 17-12-1991 before the Industrial Court. After posts
        



    were sanctioned, in 1991 the Committee offered appointments as Gateman to
    respondent Nos.2 to 21 on a regular basis. However, they declined to accept
    appointments claiming to have been working as Clerks, and filed the complaints.
</p>




<p id="p_5">    The Committee regularized the respondents in the posts of Gateman vide order
    dated 5-7-1996, which they declined and filed Writ Petition No.967 of 1997, in
    which they failed. They then accepted regularization with effect from 31-3-1997,





    and have been working as such since then.

<p id="p_6">    4.           After considering voluminous oral and documentary evidence
    tendered before him in the first complaint, the learned Member, Industrial Court,
    held that the workmen had not proved that they were appointed as Clerks or were
    performing the duties of Clerks. He, therefore, held most of them entitled to

    recorded in complaint of Kamnath Falke, who was ordered to be regularized with

    240 days of service cannot be claimed as a right for a number of reasons like (a) the
    APMC is State for the purposes of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_2">Article 12</a> of the Constitution and, therefore,




                                                 
    appointments to the posts under APMC would be subject to compliance to Articles
                              
    14 and 16 of the Constitution; (b) the APMC, as a body discharging sovereign or
    regulatory functions, is not an industry and, therefore, its workmen may not be
                             
    governed by industrial law as to regularization, but would be governed by APMC's
    own rules; (c) the APMC rules laid down a procedure for not only creating the
    posts, but also for the manner in which such posts could be filled in and this
           

    procedure is not shown to have been followed; (d) the respondent-workmen were
    appointed to posts, which were not sanctioned and, therefore, their entry itself was
        



    not legal, disentitling them to regularization in the light of pronouncement of the
    Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in Umadevi; and (e) though it is neither
    necessary nor permissible, the APMC did offer regularization to the respondents





    and actually regularized their services and thus there is no unfair labour practice.
    Since the APMC was not under any obligation to regularize services of the
    workmen, the Industrial Court could not have ordered regularization from the date





    the posts were created or in one case, the date of complaints.

    As far as the position that APMC is State for the purpose of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_3">Article 12</a> of the
    Constitution, there need not be any serious dispute and, therefore, the appointments
    to the posts under APMC would be subject to compliance to Articles 14 and 16 of

                  defence of the country, raising armed forces, making peace or war,
                  foreign affairs, power to acquire and retain territory. These are not
                  amenable to the jurisdiction of ordinary civil courts. The other
                  functions of the State including welfare activity of State could not be

                  governmental functions need not be "sovereign". State activities are
                  multifarious, from the primal sovereign power, which exclusively




                                                                                   
                  inalienably could be exercised by the sovereign alone, which is not
                  subject to challenge in any civil court to all the welfare activities,




                                                           
                  which would be undertaken by any private person. So merely if one
                  is an employee of statutory bodies would not take it outside the
                  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_12">Central Act</a>. If that be so then <a href="/doc/51403592/" id="a_13">Section 2(a)</a> of the Central Act read




                                                          
                  with Schedule I gives large number of statutory bodies which should
                  have been excluded, which is not. Even if a statute confers on any
                  statutory body, any function which could be construed to be




                                              
                  "sovereign" in nature would not mean every other functions under
                              
                  the same statute to be also sovereign. The court should examine the
                  statute to sever one from the other by comprehensively examining
                             
                  various provisions of that statute. In interpreting any statute to find
                  if it is "industry" or not we have to find its pith and substance. <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_14">The

                  peace and amity should be the objective in the functioning of all
     



                  enterprises. This is to the benefit of both the employer and employee.
                  Misuse of rights and obligations by either or stretching it beyond
                  permissible limits have to be dealt with within the framework of the

    not even be regal/ non-regal or sovereign/ non-sovereign functions.                    While
        



    exercising regal or sovereign functions, the State may be discharging the duties as
    the sovereign, but certainly not at the cost of a labourer. If say labourers are
    engaged in removing a road-blockage, could they be denied minimum wage, or





    humane conditions of work, like not more than eight hours of work, or right to
    compensation, should they suffer an injury ? For the labourer the function is merely
    removing debris. For him whether it is debris of a road blockade or a wall collapse,





    makes hardly any difference. If governance were to be carried out at the cost of a
    poor labourer, it will run into conflict with other welfare functions expected of the
    State by Part-IV of the Constitution, namely that citizens have adequate means of
    livelihood, that health and strength of workers are not abused (<a href="/doc/555882/" id="a_17">article 39</a>), securing

    First is whether it performs sovereign functions and, therefore, is not amenable to

    created under a statute similar to that applicable to the petitioner Agriculture
    Produce Market Committee in Maharashtra. The other dimensions, namely being




                                               
    State, whether the services under the Committee are subject to compliance to
                               
    Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution would, however, be still valid. It would not
    be permissible to conclude that the requirements of public employment, by giving
                              
    an opportunity to all eligible aspirants, could be done away with.

    more than six months would not entitle him to the status of a permanent employee.

    presumed under <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_39">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act to have been performed lawfully.
    The learned counsel submitted that in the absence of pleading and proof that the





    workmen had entered the service by the back-door, it would not be permissible to
    so infer, particularly in the context of the fact that it is not in dispute that the
    workmen concerned entered the service long ago between 3-6-1978 and 12-8-1986.

    services, the question as to the date from which they were entitled to regularization
    would become germane. The workmen claimed regularization from the date they





    completed 240 days of service. It may not be necessary to refer to the Standing
    Orders, because in the absence of any sanctioned posts, there could be no question
    of regularization of services of the workmen concerned. The posts came to be





    sanctioned on 17-12-1989.          The Industrial Court has in one case ordered
    regularization from 17-12-1989 and in other cases from 17-12-1991 when the
    complaints were filed. From the averments made by the APMC, it is clear that after
    the posts were sanctioned, the APMC had offered appointments to the respondents
    in the year 1991 on a regular basis. But the respondents declined claiming that they
    were working on the posts of Clerk. The fact would, however, remain that the

<p id="p_42">    30.          As far as regularization granted to one of the workmen, who is
    respondent in Writ Petition No.4156 of 1999, with effect from 17-12-1989, this
    would be liable to be set aside in view of the fact that it would have been




                                                          
    impracticable to expect the APMC to instantly order regularization upon creation of
    a post. It would have to ensure that the claims of any superior claimants are first
    considered and this would entail loss of some time. Therefore, even in this case, the




                                              
    regularization ought to have been granted with effect from 17-12-1991 as in the

    others</a>, reported at (2006) 12 SCC 494.        The Supreme Court brought out the
     



    distinction between regularization and conferment of permanence. In that case, the
    workmen had been engaged for temporary construction work on muster roll on
    daily wages.     On completion of two years of service, they had claimed





    regularization in terms of an arbitration award. The Supreme Court held that the
    High Court had failed to keep in mind the difference between the concept of grant
    of pay scale as distinct from the grant of permanency and, therefore, remitted the





    matter back to the High Court for a de novo trial.

                 regularisation of temporary or ad hoc employees but it is well settled
                 that a mere direction of the Supreme Court without laying down any
                 principle of law is not a precedent. It is only where the Supreme
                 Court lays down a principle of law that it will amount to a precedent.
                 Often the Supreme Court issues directions without laying down any
                 principle of law, in which case, it is not a precedent. For instance,




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:37:40 :::</span>

                 the Supreme Court often directs appointment of someone or
                 regularisation of temporary employee or payment of salary, etc.




                                                                                  
                 without laying down any principle of law. This is often done on
                 humanitarian considerations, but this will not operate as a precedent




                                                          
                 binding on the High Court. For instance, if the Supreme Court
                 directs regularisation of service of an employee who had put in 3
                 years' service, this does not mean that all employees who had put in 3




                                                         
                 years' service must be regularised. Hence, such a direction is not a
                 precedent. <a href="/doc/1370880/" id="a_45">In Municipal Committee, Amritsar v. Hazara Singh</a> the

    permanence in employment when those employed temporarily are not needed
    permanently or regularly. In para 43 of the judgment, the Court observed as under :
</p>



                                                                                  
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">                 "43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public




                                                          
                 employment is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule
                 of law is the core of our Constitution, a court would certainly be
                 disabled from passing an order upholding a violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_56">Article 14</a> or




                                                         
                 in ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with the
                 requirements of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_57">Article 14</a> read with <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_58">Article 16</a> of the Constitution.
                 Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public employment, this




                                             
                 Court while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold that unless
                             
                 the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a proper
                 competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any
                            
                 right on the appointee.     If it is a contractual appointment, the
                 appointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an
                 engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same
        

                 would come to an end when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary
                 employee could not claim to be made permanent on the expiry of his
     



                 term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely because a
                 temporary employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time
                 beyond the term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be





                 absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely on the
                 strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not
                 made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the





                 relevant rules.   It is not open to the court to prevent regular
                 recruitment at the instance of temporary employees whose period of
                 employment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the
                 very nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. The high
                 Courts acting under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_59">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, should not
                 ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularisation, or

                  permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made
                  regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme. Merely because




                                                                                     
                  an employee had continued under cover of an order of the court,
                  which we have described as "litigious employment" in the earlier




                                                             
                  part of the judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be
                  absorbed or made permanent in the service. In fact, in such cases,
                  the High Court may not be justified in issuing interim directions,




                                                            
                  since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it is found
                  entitled to relief, it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such a
                  manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas




                                               
                  an interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the
                               
                  regular procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of
                  paying an employee who is really not required. The courts must be
                              
                  careful in ensuring that they do not interfere unduly with the
                  economic arrangement of its affairs by the State or its
                  instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to facilitate the
        

                  bypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates."

<p id="p_53">    The Court noticed that a total embargo on casual or temporary employment was not
    possible, given the exigencies of administration. However, it rejected the argument
    that since one has been working for some time, it will not be just to discontinue





    him, even though he was aware of the nature of the employment when he first took
    it up. In para 53, the Court then clarified as under :

                 Union of India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities
                 should take steps to regularise as a one-time measure, the services of
                 such irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in

                 being now employed. The process must be set in motion within six
                 months from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if any
                            
                 already made, but not sub judice, need not be reopened based on this

<p id="p_54">    37.          It may be seen that the respondents are not a class of employees, who
    could be called litigious employees. They are not clinging to the post on the basis
    of any orders passed by any Court. They have been continued in service of the





    employer without any intervention of the Courts. Therefore, having been in service
    for a period of over twenty years now, their regularization, even in terms of what
    was held in para 53 of the judgment in Umadevi, would be proper.
