from Dr.B.R.Ambedkar Open University and he is a volunteer in

a Prisoner Reformation Program named &#x27;Unnathi&#x27; a Cognitive

Behavioural Skill Development Program run by retired Professor

Beena, Osmania University.      The convict prisoner was also

recommended by the jail authorities of Cherlapally to be a

trainer for Mahabubnagar District prisoners.         The convict

prisoner has to undergo dilation every four months for entire life

and he is also suffering from sciatica, back ache and severe

migraine. Learned counsel submits that the Director General of

Police of United Andhra Pradesh, vide letters dated 31.05.2010

and 29.09.2010 addressed to the Principal Secretary to

Government, Home Department, recommending the release of

the convict prisoner stating the convict prisoner is a changed

man and is in a state of repentance of his past and there may

not be any danger to the society or breach of peace if he is

released.    The State Human Rights Commission has also

directed the authorities concerned on 24.01.2011 to consider

the mercy petition of the convict prisoner immediately.       He

further submits that the petitioner&#x27;s husband had approached

this Court by filing W.P.No.20004 of 2011, wherein this Court

held that after considering the above reports from the concerned

officials, that the convict is at liberty to make an application

before the Government for grant of remission of punishment to

commute the sentence so as to enable the Government to

consider his case under <a href="/doc/873751/" id="a_20">Article 161</a> of the Constitution of India.

It is stated that the Additional Director General of Police

(Intelligence), Commissioner of Police, Collector of Ranga Reddy

District and Superintendent of Jail, Central Prison, Cherlaplly,

addressed letters and recommended the Director General of

Prisons and Inspector General of Prisons and Correctional

Services, for grant of pardon and the convict prisoner may be

released on mercy grounds.

<p id="p_10">            Learned counsel submits that Superintendent of

Jail, Central Prison, Cherlapally, Ranga Reddy District vide

letter dated 20.04.2012 had recommended to the Director

General of Prisons and Inspector General of Prisons and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 7</span>



Correctional Services,   Andhra Pradesh for grant of pardon to

the petitioner&#x27;s husband.      He submits that the Principal

Secretary to Government, Home, Legal Department, had written

to the Secretary to Government, Ministry of Home Affairs,

Government of India vide letter dated 16.04.2016 requesting to

consider for according necessary permission for granting

remission of life sentence to the convicted prisoner. He submits

that the Principal Secretary to Government, Home, Legal

Department,    Andhra     Pradesh    vide   proceedings    dated

01.12.2017 had given no objection to the Principal Secretary to

Government, Home, Legal Department, Telangana for granting

remission and releasing the petitioner&#x27;s husband from jail and

the same was communicated to the Central Government,

Ministry of Home Affairs. It has been specifically brought to the

notice of the authorities that husband of the petitioner is

completely changed man with good behaviour and completed

almost 27 years of imprisonment including remission period.

Learned counsel submits that the 1st respondent i.e. Union of

India and CBI has not responded to the letters written by the

Government of Telangana since last three years. He submits

that one of the prisoners named Khadir was released much
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                   8</span>



earlier to the petitioner. Even the wife of the deceased has given

consent to the convict through paper statement that she has no

objection if the petitioner is prematurely released. Learned

counsel submits that the petitioner has completed more than

actual years of incarceration and with remission around 28

years in jail. He submits that the respondents are not taking

any action and the petitioner is suffering with several health

issues.
</p>
<p id="p_11">3.            A counter-affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

CBI.      Learned Standing Counsel submits that infrastructure

and manpower of CBI is very limited and the case matter in

petition does not involve any complicated issues of law or

interstate ramifications. Hence, they have stated that they will

abide by the orders passed by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.            A counter-affidavit is also filed by the 1st respondent

Union of India. Sri R. Mangulal, learned Central Government

Standing Counsel submits that the petitioner has committed

heinous offence and he is a notorious criminal and belongs to

the erstwhile Peoples War Group (PWG), a naxalite group which

has been merged with Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) to form

CPI (Maoist). It is stated that CPI (Maoist) is one of the dreaded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                    9</span>



terrorist groups having influence in large parts of the country. It

is an unlawful association under the <a href="/doc/1389751/" id="a_21">Unlawful Activities

(Prevention) Act</a> and the petitioner&#x27;s husband has committed

most heinous crime in furtherance of the ideology of terrorist

group. If he is released prematurely, he will rejoin his group.

The   accused    was    rightly    convicted   and   awarded    life

imprisonment by the trial Court and there is no reason or

circumstance to reduce his life sentence as contemplated under

<a href="/doc/1275473/" id="a_22">Section 433(A)</a> of Cr.P.C. and if the sentence is reduced, it

would encourage others to commit such offences expecting

remission of sentence and it would set a bad precedent and

encourage such crimes in the society. CBI has also stated that it

is against the national / public interest to release life convicts

prematurely.    Further,   the    Central   Government   does   not

consider it a fit case for agreeing to the Telangana Government&#x27;s

proposal for remission under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_23">Section 433-A</a> read with <a href="/doc/1716629/" id="a_24">Section

435(1)</a> of Cr.P.C. and the same was not agreed to. According to

the learned counsel, the petitioner&#x27;s husband is not entitled for

remission.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.           A counter-affidavit has been filed on behalf of the

State Government stating that petitioner has completed 28
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                 10</span>



years (with remission) without any adverse remarks and

pursued   his   Degree   and   post   graduation   through   open

university while he is undergoing sentence. He appears to have

reformed himself with good behaviour and is regretting for his

association with Maoists as an underground cadre. He got

married while undergoing sentence with an intention to lead a

normal life in the society. Further, his wife pinned hopes on the

government for his premature release enabling them to lead the

rest of life peacefully and further, he is suffering from chronic

sciatica and frequent attack of migraine and other psychological

problems. It is stated that petitioner&#x27;s husband is under police

surveillance and there are no adverse remarks against him.

Since his imprisonment, many senior Maoist cadre including

Central Committee Members, State Committee members were

either arrested or surrendered. During their examination and

investigation, none of them indicated about his contacts with

the banned organization after his arrest and there has been no

mention about his clandestine links / activity in any of the

documents seized by the security forces during Exchange of Fire

and arrest of cadres in the last 20 years. These amply vindicate

the plea of the petitioner that the convicted prisoner has not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  11</span>



been maintaining any links with the CPI (Maoist), the banned

life-wing extremist organization. It is also stated that petitioner&#x27;s

husband was on parole 11 times but he had never tried to jump

bail nor overstayed. Jail authorities also certified his good

behaviour and reformed nature and there are no adverse

remarks against him. It is stated that on 16.04.2016, the

Principal Secretary, Home (Legal) Department, Government of

Telangana addressed a letter to the Secretary to Government,

Ministry of Home Affairs (Left Wing Extremist), Government of

India, New Delhi bringing to his notice that the Government of

Telangana has issued orders for grant of remission of sentences

to 251 prisoners in the State and it also proposed to consider

grant of remission of sentence to the        instant life convicted

prisoner in view of his good behaviour and several letters were

addressed to them. Learned Government Pleader submits that

they have issued G.O.Ms.No. 16, dated 17.01.2016 framing

guidelines for premature release of life convicts - grant of special

remission on the occasion of 26th January 2016 and life convicts

(male) convicted in murder of pubic servants while performing

duty on completion of 18 years of actual sentence including

remand period and 24 years of total sentence including
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                 12</span>



remission. Pursuant to the said G.O., a list of eligible prisoners

for premature release was prepared and in the said list, the

name of the petitioner&#x27;s husband was also included. As the case

in which he was involved was investigated by CBI, necessary

permission is required to be obtained from the Central

Government. Hence, they have addressed a letter to the Deputy

Inspector General of Police &amp; HOB, SCB, CBI to examine the

matter to grant necessary permission for his premature release.

They have specifically brought to the notice that there may not

be any danger to the society and breach of peace, if he is

released prematurely. In the counter, it is stated that the 5th

respondent CBI has filed a counter stating that they are willing

to abide by the directions issued by this Court.


</p><p id="p_14">6.          Petitioner&#x27;s   husband   has   been    convicted   and

languishing in jail from 1996. The counter-affidavit filed by the

government discloses that the petitioner&#x27;s husband was several

times on parole and he never jumped bail. His behaviour in jail

is also good and there are no adverse reports against him. The

jail authorities and the police department have given a clean

chit to the petitioner&#x27;s husband that he is exhibiting good
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                13</span>



conduct. Taking into consideration his track record in jail, they

felt that he is eligible as per the policy of the government for

premature release.    As the investigation was done by the CBI,

when they sought permission from them, according to the

counter filed by the State Government, no response is given to

them. A counter affidavit has been filed by the Central

Government wherein they mentioned about the heinous nature

of offence and what has been done and according to them, if the

petitioner&#x27;s husband is released prematurely, it would set a bad

precedent and people will commit offences with the hope that

they will get remission. The Central Government has not

mentioned anything about the conduct of the petitioner&#x27;s

husband and if he is released prematurely, how it is detrimental

to the interests of the society and how he is not entitled for

premature release. The reports of the State Government and

Prisons Department are that the petitioner&#x27;s husband is

reformed, the same was not considered by the Central

Government and they could not give any plausible reasons for

not releasing the petitioner&#x27;s husband prematurely. The State

Government while considering the Application under <a href="/doc/237247/" id="a_25">Section

433-A</a> Cr.P.C., basing on the conduct of the petitioner&#x27;s
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                    14</span>



husband, has taken a policy decision and when a letter is

addressed to the Central Government, they ought to have looked

into it in a proper perspective.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">7.           Instead   of   considering   the   fact   whether   the

petitioner&#x27;s husband is entitled for the remission as per the

report of the government wherein they have in detail has stated

about the conduct of the prisoner and how many years he has

been behind bars, the Central Government has rejected stating

that petitioner&#x27;s husband has committed a heinous offence and

he should not be released as it would set a very bad precedent.

This Court is not able to appreciate the manner in which this

issue is dealt with by the Central Government. The authorities

while exercising the power of remission must not look at the

same as a charity but as discharge of a legal duty which is

required to be performed upon fulfillment of certain conditions

as determined by the Authorities. Further, a prisoner is entitled

for remission based on his conduct. In this, it is not the case of

the Central Government that petitioner&#x27;s husband has failed to

fulfill the requisites for the purpose of remission.     They even

failed to examine in that line but focused on the nature of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                15</span>



offence.   At this stage, after 27 years in the prison when the

prisoner is seeking remission, those are not the parameters to

reject the request for remission. This kind of approach would

be against the principles of reformation and will push the

convict into a dark hole without there being a semblance of light

at the end of the tunnel. There is no dispute about the fact that

remission cannot be asked as of right or as a fundamental right.

The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court time and again observed that the State

while exercising its executive power of remission shall assess

each individual case bearing in mind the facts which are specific

to that case.   It can be looked at as a reward for the good

conduct exhibited by the convict. This Court is conscious of the

wide constitutional powers of the Executive in the cases of

remission which is upheld by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in several

cases.

<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">8.           Coming back to the facts and circumstances of the

case where the convict is languishing in jail from 01.12.1995,

he was on parole multiple times, who has exhibited the best

conduct over the years, suffering from health ailments and way

back in 2010 itself, letters were addressed by the Director

General of Police recommending the release of convict prisoner

as he is a changed man.                 In 2017 i.e. on 01.12.2017, the

Principal Secretary, Andhra Pradesh has given no objection for

granting remission.          The same could not be taken forward in

this case as CBI has done the investigation. <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_26">Section 435</a> reads

</p><p id="p_26">    9.            It is pertinent to mention that the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in

<a href="/doc/50602236/" id="a_29">Union of India v. V. Sriharan1</a> has observed that:-


173.11.           In the light of the above general principles, while
interpreting <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_30">Section 435(1)(a)</a> which mandates that any State
Government while acting as the &quot;appropriate Government&quot; for
exercising its powers under <a href="/doc/1464506/" id="a_31">Sections 432</a> and <a href="/doc/1275473/" id="a_32">433</a> of the Criminal
Procedure Code and consider for remission or commutation to
necessarily consult the Central Government. In this context the
requirement of the implication of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_33">Section 432(7)(a)</a> has to be kept in
mind, more particularly in the light of the prescription contained in
<a href="/doc/1619608/" id="a_34">Article 73(1)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_35">Article 162</a> read along with its proviso, which
asserts the status of the Central Government authorities as
possessing all-pervasive right to hold the Executive Power by virtue of
express conferment under the Constitution or under any law made by
Parliament though the State Legislature may also have the power to
make laws on those subjects.
</p>
<p id="p_27">173.13.           Cases, wherein, the investigation is held by the agencies
under the <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_36">Delhi Special Police Establishment Act</a>, 1946 or by any
other agency engaged to make investigation into an offence under the
<a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_37">Central Act</a> other than<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>, and where such
offence investigated assumes significance having regard to the
implication that it caused or likely to cause in the interest of the
Nation or in respect of national figures of very high status by resorting
to diabolic criminal conduct at the instance of any person, whether

such person belongs to this country or of any foreign origin, either
individually or representing any body of personnel or an organization
or a group, it must be stated that such situation should necessarily
be taken as the one coming within the category of internal or external
aggression or disturbance and thereby casting a duty on the Centre
as prescribed under <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_39">Article 355</a> of the Constitution to act in the
interest of the Nation as a whole and also ensure that the Government
of every State is carried in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution. Such situation cannot be held to be interfering with the
independent existence of the State concerned.

173.14.      Similar test should be applied where there is application
of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_40">Section 435(1)(b)</a> or (c). It can be visualized that where the property
of the Central Government referred to relates to the security borders
of this country or the property in the control and possession of the
Army or other security forces of the country or the warships or such
other properties or the personnel happen to be in the services of the
Centre holding very sensitive positions and in possession of very
many internal secrets or other vulnerable information and indulged in
conduct putting the interest of the Nation in peril, it cannot be said
that in such cases, the nature of &quot;consultation&quot; will be a mere
formality. It must be held that even in those cases the requirement of
&quot;consultation&quot; will assume greater significance and primacy to the
Centre.
</p>
<p id="p_28">173.12.       In a situation as the one arising in the above context, it
must be stated, that by virtue of such status available with the
Central Government possessing the Executive Power, having regard to
the pronouncement of the larger Constitution Bench decision of this
Court in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Assn. [Supreme Court
<a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_41">Advocates-on-Record Assn. v. Union of India</a>, (1993) 4 SCC 441]
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                      19</span>



and <a href="/doc/60799/" id="a_42">S.R. Bommai [S.R. Bommai v. Union of India</a>, (1994) 3 SCC 1] , the
Executive Power of the Centre should prevail over the State as
possessing higher constitutional power specifically adorned on the
Central Government under <a href="/doc/1619608/" id="a_43">Article 73(1)(a).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_29">174. It   must   also   be   noted   that   the   nature   of   requirement
contemplated and prescribed in <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_44">Sections 435(1)</a> and (2) is distinct and
different. As because the expression &quot;concurrence&quot; is used in sub-
section (2) it cannot be held that the expression &quot;consultation&quot; used in
sub-section (1) is lesser in force. As was pointed out by us in para
173.14., the situations arising under sub-sections (1)(a) to (c) will
have far more far-reaching consequences if allowed to be operated
upon without proper check. Therefore, even though the expression
used in sub-section (1) is &quot;consultation&quot;, in effect, the said
requirement is to be expressed far more strictly and with utmost care
and caution, as each one of the clauses (a) to (c) contained in the said
sub-section, if not properly applied in its context may result in serious
violation of constitutional mandate as has been set out in <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_45">Article 355</a>
of the Constitution. It is, therefore, imperative that it is always safe
and appropriate to hold that in those situations covered by clauses (a)
to (c) of <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_46">Section 435(1)</a> falling within the jurisdiction of the Central
Government, it will assume primacy and consequently the process of
&quot;consultation&quot; should in reality be held as the requirement of
&quot;concurrence&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_30">238.         Further, in certain cases investigation is transferred to
CBI under express orders of the superior court. There are number of
such examples and the cases could be of trans-border ramifications
such as Stamp Papers scam or Chit Fund scam where the offence
may have been committed in more than one States or it could be
cases where the role and conduct of the State Government concerned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                      20</span>



was such that in order to have transparency in the entirety of the
matter, the superior court deemed it proper to transfer the
investigation to CBI. It would not then be appropriate to allow the
same State Government to exercise power under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_47">Sections 432</a> and
<a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_48">433</a> on its own and in such matters, the opinion of the Central
Government must have a decisive status. In cases where the
investigation was so conducted by CBI or any such Central
investigating agency, the Central Government would be better
equipped and likely to be more correct in its view. Considering the
context of the provision, in our view comparatively greater weight
ought to be attached to the opinion of the Central Government which
through CBI or other Central investigating agency was in charge of
the investigation and had complete carriage of the proceedings.

<p id="p_32">
&quot;         29.     Mr. Sankaranarayanan has submitted a list of cases
wherein this Court, in the specific facts and circumstances of those
cases, has directed release of the prisoner convicted under <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_49">Section
302</a> simpliciter or along with other offences, taking note of the
prolonged period of incarceration, educational qualifications obtained
during the period of incarceration, conduct in jail as well as the

and has been incarcerated for 32 years, out of which he has spent 16
years on the death row and 29 years in solitary confinement. There
has been no complaint relating to his conduct in jail. On the two
occasions that the Appellant had been released on parole, there had
been no complaint regarding his conduct or breach of any condition of
release. Medical records, filed on behalf of the Appellant, show that he
is suffering from chronic ailments. Apart from his good behaviour in
jail, the Appellant has also educated himself and successfully
completed his +2 exams, an undergraduate degree, a postgraduate
degree, a diploma and eight certification courses. Given that his
petition under <a href="/doc/873751/" id="a_50">Article 161</a> remained pending for two and a half years
following the recommendation of the State Cabinet for remission of his
sentence and continues to remain pending for over a year since the
reference by the Governor, we do not consider it appropriate to
remand the matter for the Governor&#x27;s consideration. In the absence of
any    other   disqualification       and     in   the    exceptional   facts     and
circumstances of this case, in exercise of our power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_51">Article 142</a>
of the Constitution, we direct that the Appellant is deemed to have
served the sentence in connection with Crime No. 329 of 1991. The
Appellant, who is on bail, is set at liberty forthwith.

incarceration, his satisfactory conduct in jail as well as during parole,
chronic   ailments    from      his     medical      records,    his    educational
qualifications acquired during incarceration and the pendency of his
petition under <a href="/doc/873751/" id="a_52">Article 161</a> for two and a half years after the

the crime is not tantamount to stating that he is likely to abstain from
crime and lead a peaceable life if released from prison. Also having
regard to the long incarceration of 29 years (approx.) without
remission, we do not wish to drive the petitioner to a further
proceeding challenging the order dated 22.01.2018 when we find that
the order has been passed mechanically and without application of
mind to <a href="/doc/34705/" id="a_60">Section 2</a> of the U.P. Act.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_40">       20.    It seems to us that the petitioners&#x27; action of kidnapping
was nothing but a fanciful attempt to procure easy money, for which
they have learnt a painful life lesson. Given their age, their case ought
to be viewed through a prism of positivity. They retain the ability to
re-integrate with society and can spend many years leading a
peaceful, disciplined, and normal human life. Such a hopeful
expectation is further concretized by their conduct in jail. It is
revealed from the additional affidavit dated 05.09.2020 filed by Anita
@ Varnika (wife of Vikky) that during the course of his incarceration
in jail he has pursued as many as eight distance-learning courses,
which include (1) passing his Intermediate Examination, (il) learning
computer hardware, (iii) obtaining a degree in Bachelor of Arts; as well
as numerous certificates in (iv) food and nutrition, (v) human rights,
</p><p id="p_41">(vi) environmental studies. Vikky&#x27;s conduct shines as a bright light of
hope   and   redemption    for   many      other   incarcerated   prisoners.
Compounded by their roots and familial obligations, we believe it is
extremely unlikely that the petitioners would commit any act which
could shatter or shame their familial dreams.
</p>
<p id="p_42">       21.    In the present case, considering how the petitioners
have served nearly two decades of incarceration and have thus
suffered the consequences of their actions; a balance between
individual and societal welfare can be struck by granting the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                     24</span>



petitioners conditional premature release, subject to their continuing
good conduct. This would both ensure that liberty of the petitioners is
not curtailed, nor that there is any increased threat to society. Suffice
to say that this order is not irreversible and can always be recalled in
the event of any future misconduct or breach by the petitioners.
