                          The lis

                          1.    On 11th September, 2020, the Trademark Registry registered the
                          following trademark in favour of the plaintiff M/s Britannia Industries
                          Ltd., in respect of &quot;biscuits, bread, buns, rolls, bakery products, coffee,
                          tea, cocoa, sugar, rice, tapioca, sago, artificial coffee; flour and

                           The pillow pack, in which the plaintiff &quot;Nutri Choice Digestive&quot;
                          biscuits are packed and sold, looks like this :




                          3.    The plaintiff is aggrieved by the fact that the defendants M/s
                          ITC Ltd. are manufacturing and selling &quot;Sunfeast Farmlite 5-Seed
                          Digestive&quot; biscuits in packing which is, according to the plaintiff,
                          deceptively similar to the packing in which the plaintiff sells its &quot;Nutri
                          Choice Digestive&quot; biscuits.      By adopting such confusingly similar
                          packing, it is alleged that the defendants have infringed the registered
                          trademark of the plaintiff. The plaintiff also alleges that the defendants
                          are   passing    off    their   &quot;SUNFEAST         FARMLITE         5-SEED
                          DIGESTIVE&quot; biscuits as those of the plaintiff. The packing, in which
                          the defendants clear and sell their biscuits, looks like this:

                           4.    Accordingly, the plaintiff has sought an interim injunction,
                          restraining the defendants from manufacturing or selling biscuits in
                          the impugned packing, pending disposal of the present suit.

                          Proceedings thus far

                          5.    Summons were issued in the suit and notice was issued in the
                          present application, by this Court, on 16th December, 2020. On the
                          said date, this Court recorded the submission, of learned Counsel for
                          the defendants, that the defendants would not release the impugned
                          pack/trade dress in the market, though they would continue to
                          manufacture the same. This Court clarified, however, that the order
                          would not impact those packages of the defendants which were
                          already in the market.


                          6.    This order continues to remain in force till date, as it was
                          extended from time to time. As considerable stocks of the defendants&#x27;
                          products have accumulated, awaiting release into the market and sale,
                          the defendants sought modification of the aforesaid order, by
                          permitting the defendants to release, into the market, the goods already
                          manufactured by them.       Mr. Rajagopal, learned Counsel for the
                          defendants submitted that, while tendering the aforesaid statement in
                          Court on 16th December, 2020, he did not envisage accumulation of
                          such a huge stock of biscuits. Biscuits being a perishable commodity,
                          Mr. Rajagopal prayed that directions, for release of the biscuits
                          already manufactured, be issued by the Court.

                           7.     Instead of examining the prayer for modification of the
                          statement made by learned Counsel for the defendants on 16th
                          December, 2020, with consent of learned Counsel for both parties, the
                          present application, under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2, filed by the
                          plaintiff, was finally heard. The plaintiff was represented by Mr.
                          Sudhir Chandra and Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel and
                          the defendants were represented by Mr. Sajan Poovayya, learned
                          Senior Counsel assisted by Mr. Saikrishna Rajagopal.


                          The legal position

                          8.     Before adverting to the facts of the present case and contentions
                          advanced by learned Senior Counsel at the Bar, it would be
                          appropriate, in brief, to reconnoitre the legal position, insofar as
                          actions for infringement and passing off are concerned.


                          9.     This Court has had occasion, in the recent past, to study various
                          decisions in this regard, and attempt to cull out the principles
                          emanating therefrom, in its judgments in <a href="/doc/53358049/" id="a_1">FDC Ltd. v. Faraway Foods

                                   the nature of the goods, are all relevant considerations.
                                   Surrounding circumstances are also relevant.


                                   (ii)     The onus of proof is on the plaintiff who alleges passing

                                the register.


                                (iii)   &quot;Confusion&quot; refers to the state of mind of the customer
                                who, on seeing the mark, thinks that it differs from the mark on
                                the goods which he has previously bought, but is doubtful
                                whether that impression is not due to imperfect recollection.
                                The question is one of first impression.


                                (iv)    This is especially true in the matter of phonetic similarity.
                                A meticulous comparison of the words, syllable by syllable, is
                                to be avoided. The possibility of careless pronunciation and
                                speech, both on the part of the buyer walking into the shop, as
                                well as the shop assistant, is also required to be factored into
                                consideration.


                                (v)     The matter has to be examined from the point of view of
                                a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection. It
                                has to be seen as to how such a purchaser would react to the
                                trade mark, the association which he would form and how he
                                would connect the trade marks with the goods he would be
                                purchasing.

                                       (vi)     The Pianotist test16, postulated over a century ago, has
                                      repeatedly been endorsed by the Supreme Court, as the
                                      definitive test to be adopted while comparing rival trade marks.
                                      According to this test, the Court is required to judge the rival
                                      trade marks by their look and sound, and consider,
                                               (a)       the goods to which they are to be applied,
                                               (b)       the nature and kind of customer who would be
                                               likely to buy those goods,
                                               (c)       all surrounding circumstances and
                                               (d)       the consequences which would follow if each of
                                               the marks is used in the normal way as the trade mark for
                                               the goods of the respective owners.


                                      While doing so, the common part of the words forming the
                                      competing marks may not be decisive. The overall similarity of
                                      the composite words is required to be seen, having regard to the
                                      circumstance (if applicable) that both are on like goods of
                                      similar description. The test to be applied is whether, if the two
                                      marks are used in a normal and fair manner, there is likelihood
                                      of confusion or deception.


                                      (vii) The whole word/mark is to be considered. An ordinary
                                      man would not split a word or name, in a trade mark, into its
                                      components, but would go by the overall structural and phonetic
                                      similarity of the marks at the nature of the goods previously

                                 purchased, or of which he has been told and which he wants to
                                purchase. It has to be examined whether the totality of the trade
                                mark of the defendant is likely to cause deception/confusion or
                                mistake in the minds of the persons accustomed to the existing
                                trade mark of the plaintiff.


                                (viii) The resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic
                                idea represented by the plaintiff&#x27;s mark. The Court is, however,
                                required to apply both the phonetic and the visual tests. At
                                times, ocular similarity may be sufficient to find possibility of
                                confusion/deception, even if the marks are visually dissimilar,
                                though ocular similarity, by itself, may not, generally, be the
                                decisive test. Where, however, (i) in all other respects, the
                                marks of the plaintiff and defendant are different, (ii) the
                                word/words, in the marks, which are phonetically similar,
                                cannot be regarded as the dominant word, or essential feature, in
                                the marks, and (iii) the surrounding circumstances also belie any
                                possibility of confusion, it has been held that deceptive
                                similarity cannot be found to exist merely on the basis of
                                phonetic similarity or even identity. The matter, apparently, is
                                always one of fact. The Court would have to decide, on a
                                comparison of the two marks, and the parts thereof which are
                                phonetically similar, as to whether such phonetic similarity is
                                likely, considering all other circumstances, to confuse or
                                deceive a purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
                                recollection, always bearing in mind the nature of the goods,

                                 and the degree of circumspection which would be expected of
                                the purchasers who would purchase such goods.


                                (ix)   The Court is required to examine whether the essential
                                features of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark are to be found in the mark of the
                                defendant. Identification of the essential features is a question of
                                fact, left to the discretion of the Court.


                                (x)    No objective standards are possible, regarding the degree
                                of similarity which is likely to cause deception. It has to be seen
                                from the viewpoint of the purchasers of the goods.


                                (xi)   The test to be applied would depend on the facts of the
                                case. Precedents are valuable only to the extent they specify
                                tests for application, and not on facts.


                                (xii) On the issue of deceptive similarity, and especially with
                                respect to the aspect of phonetic similarity, English cases are
                                not of relevance. English cases are useful only to the extent they
                                aid in understanding the essential features of trade mark law.
                                The tests for deceptive similarity, which apply in other
                                jurisdictions, may not always apply in India.


                          10.   The first aspect to be examined, in any action for infringement
                          or passing off is, therefore, the aspect of deceptive similarity.
                          Infringement is a statutory tort, whereas passing off is a tort relatable

                           to common law. The circumstances in which a trademark is infringed
                          are to be found in Section 29 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 (&quot;the
                          Trademarks Act&quot;)17. Under Section 29, an action for infringement can
                          lie only at the instance of the proprietor of a registered trademark. The
                          circumstances in which infringement takes place are to be found in


                          17
                            &quot;29.     Infringement of registered trade marks.--
                          (1)        A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person
                          using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or deceptively
                          similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and
                          in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.
                          (2)        A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person
                          using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which because of--
                                     (a)       its identity with the registered trade mark and the similarity of the goods or services
                                     covered by such registered trade mark; or
                                     (b)       its similarity to the registered trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or
                                     services covered by such registered trade mark; or
                                     (c)       its identity with the registered trade mark and the identity of the goods or services
                                     covered by such registered trade mark, is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public, or
                                     which is likely to have an association with the registered trade mark.
                          (3)        In any case falling under clause (c) of sub-section (2), the court shall presume that it is likely to
                          cause confusion on the part of the public.
                          (4)        A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person
                          using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which--
                                     (a)       is identical with or similar to the registered trade mark; and
                                     (b)       is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade
                                     mark is registered; and
                                     (c)       the registered trade mark has a reputation in India and the use of the mark without due
                                     cause takes unfair advantage of or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the
                                     registered trade mark.
                          (5)        A registered trade mark is infringed by a person if he uses such registered trade mark, as his trade
                          name or part of his trade name, or name of his business concern or part of the name, of his business concern
                          dealing in goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.
                          (6)        For the purposes of this section, a person uses a registered mark, if, in particular, he--
                                     (a)       affixes it to goods or the packaging thereof;
                                     (b)       offers or exposes goods for sale, puts them on the market, or stocks them for those
                                     purposes under the registered trade mark, or offers or supplies services under the registered trade
                                     mark;
                                     (c)       imports or exports goods under the mark; or
                                     (d)       uses the registered trade mark on business papers or in advertising.
                          (7)        A registered trade mark is infringed by a person who applies such registered trade mark to a
                          material intended to be used for labelling or packaging goods, as a business paper, or for advertising goods or
                          services, provided such person, when he applied the mark, knew or had reason to believe that the application
                          of the mark was not duly authorised by the proprietor or a licensee.
                          (8)        A registered trade mark is infringed by any advertising of that trade mark if such advertising--
                                     (a)       takes unfair advantage of and is contrary to honest practices in industrial or commercial
                                     matters; or
                                     (b)       is detrimental to its distinctive character; or
                                     (c)       is against the reputation of the trade mark.
                          (9)        Where the distinctive elements of a registered trade mark consist of or include words, the trade
                          mark may be infringed by the spoken use of those words as well as by their visual representation and
                          reference in this section to the use of a mark shall be construed accordingly.&quot;

                                were marketing       their &quot;digestive&quot; biscuits including their
                                &quot;SUNFEAST&quot;, &quot;SUNFEAST FARMLITE&quot; and &quot;5-SEED

<p id="p_4">                                The plaintiff submits that these packs were not, in any manner,
                                infringing the plaintiff&#x27;s pack and, in fact, uses this fact as a
                                ground to contend that the defendants deliberately changed their
                                pack to deceptively resemble that of the plaintiff, to encash on
                                the plaintiff&#x27;s goodwill and reputation.

                                    one of the main contentions advanced by the defendants was
                                   that, as the plaintiff does not have any separate registration for
                                   the &quot;red and yellow&quot; colour - though colour combinations are
                                   individually registrable as &quot;marks&quot; within the meaning of
                                   Section 2(m) of the Trademarks Act20. The plaintiff has
                                   submitted, in response, that it was not claiming any
                                   infringement or passing off on the defendants&#x27; products because
                                   of the usage by the defendants of the red and yellow colour
                                   combination on its pack. The plaintiff has also acknowledged
                                   the fact that it has not registered the red and yellow colour
                                   combination as a registered trademark. Mr. Sudhir Chandra has
                                   clarified that the claim of the plaintiff is that the overall
                                   appearance of the defendants&#x27; pack is confusingly and
                                   deceptively similar to the pack of the plaintiff&#x27;s product, in
                                   respect of which it has been granted registration by the
                                   Trademark Registry.

</p><p id="p_7">                          12.      Confusing or deceptive similarity is the sine qua non for any
                          action, alleging infringement or passing off, to succeed.                                    In the
                          absence of confusing or deceptive similarity, other aspects cease to

                           13.2 It was submitted that the defendants had copied the essential
                          elements of distinction in the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark without any valid
                          reason. In this context, Mr. Sudhir Chandra relies on the fact that the
                          trade mark, of which infringement is being alleged, stands registered
                          in the plaintiff&#x27;s favour in respect of &quot;biscuits&quot; and would, therefore,
                          cover all categories of biscuits. In other words, submits Mr. Sudhir
                          Chandra, it would not be permissible for anyone to use any mark,
                          deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff, in respect of any kind of
                          biscuits. He has placed reliance, in this context, on Section 28 of the
                          Trademark Act, apart from Section 29. He submits that the manner in
                          which the defendants&#x27; pack infringes the registered trademark pack of
                          the plaintiff directly attracts Section 29(2)(b).
</p>

<p id="p_12">                          13.3 Mr. Sudhir Chandra also submits that, as the biscuits are
                          normally stocked together in stores, there is also a clear aspect of
                          &quot;initial interest confusion&quot;. He further submits that, as the plaintiff&#x27;s
                          and the defendants&#x27; biscuits are both digestive biscuits, the
                          constituents or ingredients of the biscuits are immaterial, in which
                          context Mr. Sudhir Chandra once again invites my attention to the
                          facts that registration has been granted to the plaintiff for &quot;biscuits&quot; as
                          an omnibus class. Mr. Sudhir Chandra relies on the judgment of the
                          Supreme Court in Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navaratna
                          Pharmaceutical Laboratories5, Parle Products (P) Ltd. v. J. P. &amp; Co.

                          the biscuits on the body of the biscuits was a common industry
                          practice and that, in fact, this feature would serve to discredit the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s allegation of deceptive similarity, as the brand name of the
                          defendant company as well as of defendants&#x27; biscuits are completely
                          different from those of the plaintiff. He further submits that
                          representing wheat and grains on the pack of digestive biscuits, is also
                          a matter of common practice, as these serve to emphasise the
                          nutritional value of the biscuits and represent their ingredients. In this
                          context, Mr. Poovayya points out that the defendants&#x27; pack also shows
                          seeds, raisins and almonds, which are not present on the pack of the
                          plaintiff. Mr. Poovayya also submits that the use of the word &quot;Hi
                          Fiber&quot; was, again,      a matter of common industry practice, as it
                          represented the high fiber content in the biscuits, again emphasising
                          their nutritional value. He points out, in this context, that the lettering
                          and the colour of the word &quot;Hi Fiber&quot; as contained on the impugned
                          pack of the defendants, is different from that of the plaintiff.

                           defendant is so similar to that of the plaintiff, as is likely to result in
                          deception or confusion.
</p>

<p id="p_23">                          15.    The definitive test, whether in the case of infringement or
                          passing off, is that of confusing or deceptive similarity. It is true that,
                          in examining this aspect, the court is not expected to ferret out points
                          of dissimilarity between two marks, as absolute identity between
                          marks is rarely, if ever, encountered, except where one makes
                          unauthorised use of the mark of another. The examination by the court
                          is, generally, required to be directed towards assessing whether there
                          is a deceptive extent of similarity between the marks irrespective of
                          their individual dissimilar features. It is for this reason that courts have
                          held that the approach should be one of emphasising the similarities,
                          rather than the dissimilarities, between the marks.
</p>

<p id="p_24">                          16.    Having said that, points of dissimilarity between rival marks
                          cannot be regarded as irrelevant.       They cannot be ignored.        The
                          perception, whether in the case of infringement or passing off, is to be
                          that of a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection -
                          not of an idiot, or an amnesiac. The average human mind has not been
                          particularly conditioned to observe only similarities, and overlook
                          dissimilarities.   Section 29(1) uses the word &quot;deceptive&quot;, whereas
                          Section 29(2) uses the expression &quot;cause confusion&quot;. Deception and
                          confusion are both states of mind, of which no physically tangible
                          evidence can ever be found. If similarities can cause deception or
                          confusion, dissimilarities, if sufficient, can also obviate any such

                           possibility. At the end of the day, the court is required to come to an
                          opinion as to whether a person of average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection is likely be deceived, or to confuse the defendants&#x27; marks
                          (in the case of infringement) or the defendants&#x27; product (in the case of
                          passing off) with that of the plaintiff. If, therefore, between the rival
                          marks, the points of dissimilarity are so stark that they shade or
                          overweigh the points of similarity, the court may legitimately arrive at
                          a conclusion that, irrespective of the points of similarity, no possibility
                          of confusion or deception exists.
</p>

<p id="p_25">                          17.   For this, one of the most important assessments that the court is
                          required to make is as to the features, of the rival marks, which are
                          most prominent. If there is stark dissimilarity in the prominent, or
                          essential, features of the rival marks, as would impress on the mind of
                          the person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, no
                          finding of confusing or deceptive similarity can be arrived at.

<p id="p_26">                          18.   The points of similarity, between the plaintiffs&#x27; pack and the
                          defendants&#x27; pack, as highlighted by Mr. Sudhir Chandra, cannot be
                          gainsaid. It is true that (i) both packs use a red and yellow combination
                          of colors, with yellow on the left and red on the right, (ii) both packs
                          use the words &quot;DIGESTIVE HI-FIBRE&quot;, below the brand name, (iii)

                          dissimilarity which, in my opinion, immediately impress themselves
                          on the mind, even of a person of average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection. These may be enumerated as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">                                (i)     The most important distinction between the two packs is
                                the brand. The plaintiff&#x27;s pack contains the brand &quot;NUTRI
                                CHOICE&quot; in large green prominent letters, on a white
                                background. As against this, the defendants&#x27; pack represents the
                                brand name &quot;FARMLITE&quot; in much more muted brown letters,
                                on a yellow background. While the word &quot;FARMLITE&quot; as used
                                on the defendants pack, does not immediately strike the eye, the
                                words &quot;NUTRI CHOICE&quot;, as used on the plaintiffs pack, are
                                large and prominent. In my opinion, even a person of average
                                intelligence and imperfect recollection is bound to notice the
                                absence, on the pack of the defendant of the words &quot;NUTRI
                                CHOICE&quot;, contained on the pack of the plaintiff. Viewed from
                                the &quot;passing off&quot; angle, once a person has initially bought the

                                comes across the defendants &quot;FARMLITE&quot; biscuits, I find it
                                difficult to believe that he would confuse the defendants&#x27; biscuit
                                with the biscuit of the plaintiff which he had earlier bought,
                                purchase the defendants&#x27; FARMLITE biscuit confusing it for

                                 seeds, Chia seeds and pumpkin seeds have become a matter of
                                daily routine in many households, especially with persons who
                                are health-conscious.       Multi grain bread, for example,
                                commands its own distinct clientele.             Health-conscious
                                households, who are prone to consumption of such seeds, would
                                certainly prefer the biscuits of the defendants to those of the
                                plaintiff. For them, the biscuits of the defendants would be
                                &quot;non-substitutable&quot;.    For the average consumer of digestive
                                biscuits, therefore, the biscuits of the defendant would have
                                their own distinct identity, separate from the biscuits of the
                                plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_29">                                (iv)   The defendants have also consciously underscored this
                                aspect of their biscuits by prominently displaying, on the
                                package, the words &quot;5-SEED DIGESTIVE&quot;, apart from a clear
                                pictorial representation of the five seeds contained in the
                                biscuits. The words &quot;5 SEED&quot; are absent on the plaintiff&#x27;s
                                pack. As per the submissions of Mr. Poovayya - which is not
                                controverted by learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs - the
                                defendants&#x27; biscuit is one of its kind, as it contains five distinct

                                seeds and sunflower seeds, none of which are contained in the
                                plaintiff&#x27;s biscuits. Clearly, therefore, the defendants&#x27; biscuit
                                has a unique identity, which is distinct and different from that of
                                the plaintiffs&#x27; biscuit. It is this identity - of being a &quot;five seed
                                biscuit&quot;, which is prominently reflected by the use of the words,

                                the words &quot;5 SEED&quot;, is in bright red letters on a white
                                background, confers the words additional prominence and
                                render them even more capable of being re-collected by the
                                average consumer. The use of the words &quot;5 SEED&quot;, are also
                                capable of acting as a distinctive feature, for the average
                                consumer to distinguish the product of the defendants from that
                                of the plaintiff, and avoid any possibility of confusion or
                                deception. To my mind, any presumption that a customer, who
                                comes across the defendants&#x27; biscuits, with the clear words &quot;5
                                SEED DIGESTIVE&quot; prominently displayed on the package,
                                with photographs of the 5 seeds, contained in the biscuits, in a
                                clear red band across the centre of the package, vertically from
                                top to bottom, the band outlined in gold, is likely to confuse the
                                defendants&#x27; biscuits with the &quot;NUTRI CHOICE&quot; biscuits of the
                                plaintiff, would be far-fetched and unrealistic.

                                companies      manufacturing      the    biscuits   are,     therefore,
                                prominently displayed on the pack both of the plaintiff as well
                                as of the defendants.       It is only, therefore, if the mythical
                                gentleman of average intelligence and imperfect recollection
                                does not recollect either the brand of the biscuit or the name of
                                the company manufacturing the biscuit, or even the prominent
                                features of the left side of the pack (as emphasized
                                hereinabove), that he is likely to confuse the &quot;FARMLITE 5
                                SEED DIGESTIVE&quot; biscuit of the defendant for the &quot;NUTRI
                                CHOICE DIGESTIVE&quot; biscuit of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_31">                          20.   The plaintiff has also enclosed photographs of the manner in

                          stacked in stores, side by side, to submit that they look deceptively
                          similar. Here, again, I am unable to agree with learned Senior Counsel
                          for the plaintiff. If the packs of the plaintiff and the defendants biscuits
                          are stored side by side, then, unless the customer is situated at so great
                          a distance that he can see only the colors of the packs, and not the
                          distinctive features thereof, he is unlikely to be confused between the
                          two. If, on the other hand, he has, before him, the defendants&#x27; product,
                          for the reasons already aforementioned, he is equally unlikely, in my
                          view, to be confused or deceived into mistaking the &quot;FARMLITE 5

</p>

<p id="p_32">                          21.   Apart from all this, the fact that the brand names of the plaintiff
                          and the defendants are prominently displayed on the packs is also, in
                          my view, of no little importance. The plaintiff&#x27;s and the defendants&#x27;
                          brands are both reputed and well-known, enjoying their own niche
                          clientele. I have already found the impugned pack of the defendant not
                          to be confusingly similar to that of the plaintiffs. No case of
                          infringement, therefore, exists, prima facie. When it comes to the
                          question of passing off, additionally, the fact that the &quot;SUNFEAST&quot;
                          logo of the defendant and the &quot;BRITANNIA&quot; logo of the plaintiffs are
                          clearly visible on the face of the rival packs, would also minimize the
                          possibility of a consumer mistakenly purchasing the product of the
                          defendant, assuming it to be that of the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_33">                          22.   In this context, I deem it appropriate to emphasize that, before
                          visualizing the consumer of &quot;average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection&quot;, it is necessary for the Court to be conscious of the
                          customer base to which the consumer belongs. It is true that the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s trade mark is registered for &quot;biscuits&quot; as an omnibus
                          category. Mr. Sudhir Chandra and Mr. Sandeep Sethi are, therefore,
                          correct in submitting (on the aspect of infringement, not passing off),
                          that the legislative proscription contained in <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_18">Section 29</a> of the Trade
                          Marks Act, against infringement, would apply to all biscuits, and not
                          digestive biscuits alone. For this purpose, learned Senior Counsel for

                          covers infringement by use of similar trade marks on identical goods.
                          Therefore, submit learned Senior Counsel, as the goods of the plaintiff
                          and defendants are the same, viz. biscuits (in respect of which the
                          plaintiff has an omnibus trade mark registration), mere similarity of
                          the impugned trade mark of the defendants with that of the plaintiff
                          would suffice. The difficulty in accepting this submission stems from
                          the simple statutory reality that <a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_20">Section 29(2)(b)</a> does not end with the
                          words &quot;by such registered trade mark&quot; but continues with the words

                          to have an association with the trade mark&quot;. In other words, for

<p id="p_41">                          23.     Considerable reliance was placed by learned Senior Counsel for
                          the plaintiff on the following passage from Parle Products21 (para 9 in
                          SCC):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                                  &quot;It is, therefore, clear that in order to come to the conclusion whether
                                  one mark is deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential
                                  features of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed
                                  side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and
                                  if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design
                                  from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if the
                                  impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered
                                  mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one
                                  to accept the other if offered to him. In this case we find that the
                                  packets are practically of the same size, the colour scheme of the two
                                  wrappers is almost the same; the design on both though not identical
                                  bears such a close resemblance that one can easily be mistaken for
                                  the other. The essential features of both are that there is a girl with
                                  one arm raised and carrying something in the other with a cow or
                                  cows near her and hens or chickens in the foreground. In the
                                  background there is a farm house with a fence. The word &quot;Gluco
                                  Biscuits&quot; in one and &quot;Glucose Biscuits&quot; on the other occupy a
                                  prominent place at the top with a good deal of similarity between the
                                  two writings. Anyone in our opinion who has a look at one of the
                                  packets today may easily mistake the other if shown on another day
                                  as being the same article which he had seen before. If one was not
                                  careful enough to note the peculiar features of the wrapper on the
                                  plaintiffs&#x27; goods, he might easily mistake the defendants&#x27; wrapper for

                          this, is that, to some extent, the colour combination on the packs of the
                          plaintiff and the defendants is the same.           In Parle Products21,
                          however, the Supreme Court found the colour scheme to be the same.

                          and carrying something in the other with a cow or cows near her and
                          hens or chickens in the foreground, with a fence in the background,
                          was the same essential feature in both packs (in fact, this stark
                          similarity may, even by itself, have been sufficient to justify the
                          finding of likelihood of confusion or deception), (ii) the rival brand
                          names were &quot;Gluco Biscuits&quot; and &quot;Glucose Biscuits&quot; (which are,
                          obviously, phonetically similar) and (iii) these brand names were
                          prominently displayed at the top of the pack with a good deal of
                          similarity between the two writings. None of these similarities - or
                          similarities akin in grade - can be said to exist, between the rival

                          sheaves of wheat below them - which, too, as Mr. Poovayya rightly
                          submitted, appears to be a practice in the case of digestive biscuits

                          confusion or deception. The judgement of the Supreme Court in Parle
                          Products21, therefore, if anything, emphasizes and underscores the
                          important of the necessity of similar features, beyond merely similarity
                          in pack size and colour scheme.

<p id="p_43">                          25.     It was sought to be contended, by learned Senior Counsel for
                          the plaintiff, that the defendants had, by copying its &quot;essential
                          features&quot;, infringed the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trade mark.            The
                          judgement in Parle Products21 effectively discredits this submission.
                          In the case where the trademark consists of the entire pack, such as the
                          present, identification of one, or the other features, as &quot;essential&quot;, is no
                          easy task. Significantly, even in Parle Products21, the Supreme Court
                          did not rest with the finding that, as the size of the packs and the
                          colour scheme thereon were the same in the rival marks, infringement,
                          or passing off, stood established, but went on to record findings
                          regarding actual copying of the essential features of the packs, viz. the
                          picture of the girl with one arm raised and carrying something in the
                          other with a cow or cows near her and hens or chickens in the
                          foreground, with a fence in the background, the words &quot;Gluco
                          Biscuits&quot; in one and &quot;Glucose Biscuits&quot; on the other, and both the
                          names being represented, in similar writings, towards the top of each
                          pack.    In the present case, such parallels are absent.       As already
                          pointed out, the names of the two biscuits, as also their brands, are
                          totally different. They are prominently displayed in different colours.
                          Both packs contain the photograph of the biscuit, it is true, but, once

                          prominently visible on the face of each, the allegation of copying of
                          essential features and of possibility of confusion or deception on that
                          score, would not sustain.          The sheaves of wheat, submits Mr
                          Poovayya, are not unique either to the plaintiff&#x27;s packs or the
                          defendants&#x27;, they are seen in other packs of digestive biscuits as well.
                          All said and done, therefore, it cannot be said, prima facie, that the
                          defendants&#x27; packs have copied the essential features of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                          pack and have, thereby, infringed the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark,
                          or that the defendants have sought to pass off their packs as those of
                          the plaintiff.

                          the mere word &quot;similar&quot;.          It uses, in sub-section (1), the words

                          respect to the intent of the person who seeks to confuse or deceive.
                          &quot;Deception&quot;, in common parlance, involves an element of mens rea,

                          The man of average intelligence and imperfect recollection cannot be
                          treated, for the purposes of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_24">Trade Marks Act</a>, as being easily
                          confused or deceived. It is for this reason that the legislature has,
                          consciously, used the word &quot;deceptively similar&quot; along with the word
                          &quot;identical&quot;. Applying the noscitur a sociis principle23, the similarity,
                          therefore, must be one which confuses, or deceives one into believing
                          either that the later product is the same as the earlier, or that they are
                          made by the same manufacturer, or that there is an association
                          between them. In a case such as Parle Products21, where as distinctive
                          a figure as a girl with arms raised, carrying something in the other
                          with a cow or cows near her and hens or chickens in the foreground,
                          with a fence in the background, is common to the two packs, at the
                          very least, an inference of association of the latter pack with the
                          former is inevitable.              Such prominently distinctive features - as
                          impress themselves in the mind&#x27;s eye, as it were, so as to create an
                          association at a later point of time - are, in my opinion, wanting in the
                          present case.
</p>

<p id="p_47">                          28.      The distinguishing features, in the present case, are, on the other
                          hand, just too many. They more than counterbalance the similarities,
                          and, prima facie, negate any possibility of confusion, much less
                          deception.

</p><p id="p_59">                           37.   When compared with the rival packs in CS (COMM) 553/2020,
                          the packs in CS(COMM) 554/2020 are, undoubtedly, more proximate
                          in appearance to each other. The question to be addressed is whether
                          this proximity is such as to result in the pack of the defendants
                          becoming confusingly similar to that of the plaintiff (in which case,
                          prima facie, infringement would be made out) and whether a customer
                          of average intelligence and imperfect recollection is likely to confuse
                          the product of the defendants to be that of the plaintiff, on seeing the
                          two packs of the defendants at different points of time (in which case
                          the tort of passing off is made out).

<p id="p_60">                          38.   The controversy, whether in CS (COMM) 553/2020 or CS
                          (COMM) 554/2020, has to be decided on the anvil of <a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_25">Section 29(2)(b)</a>
                          of the 1996 Act. Under this provision, &quot;a registered trademark is
                          infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a
                          person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a
                          mark which because of its similarity to the registered trademark and
                          the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by such
                          registered trademark, is likely to cause confusion on the part of the
                          public, or which is likely to have an association with the registered

                           packing of the plaintiff, on a white circular background, whereas, in
                          the case of the defendants, there was no green lettering on the package
                          at all and, rather, the brand &quot;FARMLITE&quot; was depicted in muted
                          brown letters on a yellow background, (ii) the fact that the defendants&#x27;
                          &quot;5 SEED&quot; biscuits were a specie sui generis, as compared to the
                          biscuits of the plaintiff, which were plain digestive biscuits, (iii) the
                          clear depiction of this factual distinction by the words &quot;5 SEED
                          DIGESTIVE&quot; in large red letters on a white circular background on
                          the pack of the defendants, whereas there was no such depiction on the
                          pack of the plaintiff, which did not contain the words &quot;5 SEED&quot;, (iv)
                          the depiction of the five seeds contained in the defendants&#x27; biscuits, in
                          a maroon semi-circular band running from the centre upper to the
                          lower edge of the pack with photographs of the seeds, one below the
                          other and (v) the words, &quot;SUNFEAST DIGESTIVE FARMLITE&quot;, as
                          engraved on the face of the defendants&#x27; biscuits, which was
                          prominently displayed on the pack, as compared to the words
                          &quot;BRITANNIA NUTRI CHOICE DIGESTIVE&quot;, which were engraved
                          on the face of the biscuits of the plaintiff, which was also prominently
                          visible on the pack of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_62">                          40.   The reasons why these distinguishing features persuaded me to
                          hold that no confusing similarity, between the packs of the plaintiff
                          and the packs of the defendants, existed in CS (COMM) 553/2020, is
                          apparent from the decision in the said case.

</p><p id="p_64">                           41.   When one compares the rival packs in CS (COMM) 553/2020,
                          with the packs in present case, it is apparent that the degree of
                          similarity, between the packs of the defendants and the pack of the
                          plaintiff, in this case, is greater than in CS (COMM) 553/2020. In the
                          present case, unlike CS (COMM) 553/2020, &quot;NUTRI CHOICE&quot;,
                          brand of the plaintiff and &quot;VEDA DIGESTIVE&quot;, brand of defendants,
                          are both shown in large green letters on a white background. Both the
                          biscuits have five distinct ingredients, with the plaintiff&#x27;s biscuits
                          being &quot;5 Grain&quot; biscuits whereas the defendants&#x27; biscuits contain five
                          Ayurvedic ingredients, i.e. Ashwagandha, Cardamom, Mulethi,

                          the defendant&#x27;s product for that of the plaintiff, by reason of the

</p><p id="p_74">                           44.   Mr. Poovayya, learned senior counsel for the defendant, has
                          drawn my attention to the fact that the &quot;VEDA&quot; category of biscuits is
                          a niche category, conceived by and indelibly identified with the
                          defendants. The &quot;VEDA&quot; class of biscuits, submits Mr. Poovayya, are
                          biscuits containing Ayurvedic ingredients, obviously keeping in mind
                          the health benefits of such ingredients. These biscuits, he submits,
                          cater to a very specific class of consumer.
</p>

<p id="p_75">                          45.   In my view, there is considerable weight in these submissions.
                          The pack of the defendants prominently highlights the unique category
                          to which the defendants&#x27; biscuits belong. Biscuits containing these
                          Ayurvedic ingredients are not often encountered in the market, and,
                          therefore, a customer of average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection, who has earlier consumed the plaintiff&#x27;s &quot;NUTRI
                          CHOICE&quot; biscuits, is in my view, is extremely unlikely to confuse the
                          defendant&#x27;s &quot;VEDA DIGESTIVE&quot;, biscuits containing five distinct
                          Ayurvedic ingredients, prominently displayed on the pack, for the
                          &quot;NUTRI CHOICE&quot;, biscuits of the plaintiff. Even more than in the
                          case of the defendants&#x27; &quot;5 SEED DIGESTIVE&quot; biscuits forming
                          subject matter of CS (COMM) 553/2020 are, therefore, the
                          defendants&#x27; &quot;VEDA DIGESTIVE&quot; biscuits, with these five Ayurvedic
                          ingredients, a specie sui generis.

<p id="p_76">                          46.   Passing off has to be viewed from the perspective of the
                          customer who wants to purchase the product. Is he, having earlier
                          bought the product of the plaintiff, likely, on later coming across the

                           product of the defendant, likely to confuse it as having been made by
                          the plaintiff? Are the packs so similar that the customer, of average
                          intelligence and imperfect recollection may, on later coming across the
                          defendants&#x27; pack, associate it with the plaintiff?
</p>
<p id="p_77">                          47.      A prospective customer may come across the product to be
                          purchased through one of three modes. He may either purchase it
                          online, or pick it from the shelf, or be handed it by the shop assistant.
                          Online, the two products are obviously totally different, and there is
                          virtually no likelihood that the customer would confuse the products.
                          Even as displayed on the shelf, as in the case of the packs forming
                          subject matter of CS (COMM) 553/2020, any customer, who is within
                          viewing distance of the details of the packs, is unlikely to confuse
                          them.     There is no reason to believe that a shop assistant, even
                          moderately familiar with the difference in the plaintiff&#x27;s and
                          defendants&#x27; products, will provide, to the customer who wants 5 grain
                          digestive biscuits, the defendants&#x27; product, containing the 5 Ayurvedic
                          ingredients prominently displayed. Even if he does, it is not possible,
                          prima facie, to believe that the customer would, on seeing the pack,
                          link it with the plaintiff, or its &quot;NUTRI CHOICE 5 GRAIN
                          DIGESTIVE&quot; biscuits. There is, on the other hand, every possibility
                          of such a customer, who is not looking for biscuits containing
                          Ayurvedic ingredients such as Aswagandha, Tulsi, and the like,
                          returning the defendants&#x27; biscuits to the shop assistant. Not everyone
                          can be presumed to be an aficionado of biscuits containing Ayurvedic
                          herbs.

                          such as this, gloss over the distinction between plain digestive biscuits

                          features, and markedly different, and unique, ingredients.           These
                          distinctive features stand prominently reflected on the packs. The
                          addition of these distinct ingredients are clearly intended at conveying,
                          to the public, the unique health features resulting as a consequence.
                          The Court cannot, therefore, readily presume the digestive biscuit
                          consumer, even if of average intelligence and imperfect recollection,
                          to be unaware of the difference between these categories of digestive
                          biscuits.   It is trite, in law, that, while examining the aspect of
                          deception or confusion, the Court has to identify the precise onsumer
                          base.    Digestive biscuit consumers constitute an entirely different
                          category of consumers, from consumers of ordinary biscuits. Whether
                          one applies the &quot;likelihood to cause confusion&quot; test in <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_26">Section 29(2)</a>,
                          or the &quot;deception&quot; test in <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_27">Section 29(1)</a>, one has to examine the
                          possibility of deception or confusion keeping this frank reality in
                          mind. The Court, in my view, would be falling into serious error if it
                          were to assume that digestive biscuit consumers are ignorant of the
                          difference between ordinary, 5-grain, 5-seed and Ayurvedic digestive
                          biscuits, or likely to confuse one for the other, on the basis of the rival
                          packs. The fact that the registration held by the plaintiffs is in respect
                          of biscuits per se, as an omnibus class, is entirely irrelevant in this

                           context, once, keeping the purveyors of such biscuits in mind, no
                          possibility of deception or confusion is found to exist.

<p id="p_80">                          49.    I am willing to go along with Mr. Jayant Mehta in his
                          submission that, in designing the impugned pack of &quot;VEDA
                          DIGESTIVE&quot; biscuits, the defendant may have made a conscious
                          attempt to &quot;copy&quot; the plaintiff&#x27;s packing. A conscious attempt at
                          copying, however, by itself does not constitute either infringement or
                          passing off. The matter has, in either case, to be examined from the
                          point of view of the customer of average intelligence and imperfect
                          recollection. Unless such a consumer is liable to get confused or
                          deceived, howsoever, questionable the intentions of the defendants
                          may be, no case of infringement or passing off can be said to exist.
</p>

<p id="p_81">                          50.    Though the defendants&#x27; packs in the present case are more
                          similar in appearance to the plaintiff&#x27;s packs, vis-a-vis the position
                          which obtained in CS (Comm) 553.2020, these added points of
                          similarity in the present case are also, in my view, insufficient to
                          render the pack of the defendants confusing or deceptively similar to
                          that of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_82">                          51.    Other salient points of the discussion in CS (Comm) 553/2020
                          apply, mutatis mutandis, to the present case as well. Parle Products21
                          cannot help the plaintiff in this case either.
</p>
<p id="p_83">                          52.    For this reason, I am of the opinion, that even in this case, it is
                          not possible to arrive at a prima facie finding in favour of the plaintiff
