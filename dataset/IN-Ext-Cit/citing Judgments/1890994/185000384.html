<p id="p_1">Dr. Ramesh Chandra Panda, Member (A) :
</p>

<p id="p_2">	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) engaged the Applicants on daily wages from September/October, 1996.  Their engagement was consequent to the circular issued by Education Department of MCD to identify Ministerial staff having knowledge of Computer operation.  Since no one came forward to handle/operate the Computers and there were no skilled incumbents in the Department of Education to undertake such computer operation works, the Applicants applied and were engaged to work on Computers on daily wage basis. They were used to operate computers and undertake data entries and were stated to have been engaged and paid on daily wage basis against the post of School Attendants.  It is the Applicants case that they were paid daily wages by the concerned competent authority against the post of School Attendants as it was their powers to engage the Attendants on daily wage basis only and the vacancies of post of School Attendants were available but they were promised to be regularized as Data Entry Operators (DEO).  They aver that they continuously worked in the Education Department of MCD without any break whatsoever.  	It is the case of the Applicants that they possess necessary qualification to be regularized in the post of Computer Operator/Data Entry Operators. Therefore, they have represented to be considered for regularization in the pay scale of Data Entry Operators (DEO) (Rs.4000-6000) as they have been working on those posts.  They also stated that their regularization as School Attendants in the pay scale of Rs.2440-3200 would be great injustice to them.  In this context, they brought on record various correspondence within the Respondent-MCD which reveal that there was recommendation for engaging the Applicants as DEO but the same was not complied with till date of filing their Writ Petition.	Having been aggrieved by the inaction of MCD, all the 8 Applicants have moved the Honble High Court of Delhi in Writ Petition (Civil) No.4483/1999 with the following main  prayers:-
</p><p id="p_3">(a)	to issue Rule Nisi on the Writ Petition and call for the respondents record relating to the employment of petitioners and after going into the legality and validity of their appointment/recruitment of the petitioner on Daily Wage basis instead of regularization, call upon them to Show Cause as to why the reliefs asked for herein be not granted to the Petitioners;
</p>
<p id="p_4">(b)	to issue a writ of mandamus, or any other writ order or direction against the Respondent MCD to treat the Petitioners as regular employees of Municipal Corporation of Delhi and that regular scales of pay with other allowances and benefits attached to the posts of Computer Operator/Data Entry Operator effective from the date of initial appointment be granted to them.  Further direct the respondent for payment of difference of regular pay in the scale of Rs.4000-100-6000+JA=CA after deducting Daily Wages paid to the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_5">(c)	to direct by Writ of mandamus that Respondents forthwith regularize the petitioners employment from the date of initial appointment and give petitioners all benefits that would have been admissible to them had petitioners been appointed on regular basis.  The petitioners be also awarded interest @18% p.a. on all the arrears of pay and allowances payable to him.

</p><p id="p_6">2.	The interim relief sought in CM 8555/1999 in WP (C) No.4483/1999 relating to the prayer to restrain the Respondents from terminating/discontinuing the Petitioners services and/to employ any other in their place was argued on 01.09.1999 and the Honble High Court ordered that till the next date no outsider would be appointed as daily wager to operate the computers replacing the Applicants and show cause notice was issued to the Respondents.  On 29.09.1999, the Honble High Court extended the interim order.  In the meantime the Petitioners moved CM No.152/2000 in WP(C)No.4483/1999 stating that MCD was not paying them wages and they were being harassed.  It was also submitted by them that Respondents had transferred them as School Attendant or Nursery Ayas vide MCD order dated 09.11.1999 (Page 82) and 11.11.1999 (Page 83).  They alleged that such transfer being punitive in nature  should be quashed and set aside.  As per the office order dated 09.11.1999, they were transferred from HQ to various zones and citing the directions of Honble High Court, the order directed the concerned  authorities to make payment of salaries to the petitioners.  The CMs No. 8555/1999 and 152/2000 in WP (C) 4483/1999 were heard by the Honble High Court and passed the following order on 22.01.2002 :
</p><p id="p_7">Learned counsel for respondent states that some vacancies are going to arise in the establishment after 31st March, 2002 and the petitioners can apply against the same.  Learned counsel for petitioner states that such an application on behalf of the petitioner should be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the petitioner in the present petition.
</p>
<p id="p_8">In view of the aforesaid, the petitioners can apply against the regular vacancies which are likely to arise after 31st March, 2002.  The respondents will consider the case of the petitioners according to their rules, subject to requisite qualification and services rendered by the petitioner with the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_9">	List for directions on 24th July, 2002.

</p><p id="p_10">3.	The Respondent MCD in the meantime filed a short counter reply on 27.09.1999 and stated that there was no post of the Computer Operators in the MCD, nor there was any Recruitment Regulations for the same.  Further, it was averred in the said affidavit that the Petitioners were appointed as Daily Wager School Attendant. Respondent enclosed a copy of the order dated 26.03.1997        (page-90) and the Attendance Sheet and wage payment copies. On 24.07.2002, after hearing the parties, the interim order was confirmed till the disposal of the Writ Petition and it was ordered that with regard to filling up of vacancies on a regular basis, the learned Counsel for the Respondent-MCD stated that the process would take a couple of months more and, therefore, it was directed that the MCD should endeavor to complete the process of filling up the regular vacancies expeditiously.  I take below the extract of the order dated 24.07.2002  of Honble High Court :-
</p><p id="p_11">Rule.
</p>
<p id="p_12">	Learned counsel for the Petitioners says that the Petitioners are computer operators but are being made to work as School Attendants.
</p>
<p id="p_13">	Learned counsel for the Respondent/M.C.D. states that he has no instructions in this regard.  If the submission of learned counsel for the Petitioners is correct, the matter may be looked into by the Respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_14">	With regard to filing up of vacancies on a regular basis, learned counsel for the Respondent/M.C.D. states that the process will take a couple of months more.  The M.C.D. should endeavour to complete the process of filling up the regular  vacancies expeditiously.

</p><p id="p_19">4.	While the case was pending in the Honble High Court, it was  notified by the Government of India that the service disputes pertaining to the MCD would be adjudicated by this Tribunal vide the Government of India Notification S.O.2580(E) dated 1.12.2008 under sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/796793/" id="a_1">Section 14</a> of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985.  Accordingly, on 4.03.2009, the Honble High Court of Delhi transferred the WP(C) No.4483/1999 to this Tribunal which was taken on record in the Tribunal as TA No.1052/2009.
</p>
<p id="p_20">5.	Consequent to the transfer of this case to the Tribunal, the Applicants filed an additional affidavit on 28.07.2009, which was considered by me on 17.08.2009. The additional affidavit filed by the learned Counsel for the Applicant revealed that most of the concurrences had already been obtained for creation of 14 posts of DEO and adjustment of the Applicants against those posts had been called for. However, the same was disputed by the learned Counsel for the Respondents and she sought time to file reply to the additional affidavit and  furnish the correct position in respect of regularization of the Applicants.  The Counsel for the Respondent filed the additional affidavit on 3.10.2009 to which the Counsel for the Applicant submitted the rejoinder on 15.10.2009.  The case was again taken up for hearing on 11.11.2009 wherein it was noted that the information furnished by the Counsel for Respondents in the additional affidavit revealed that there were no posts of DEO in MCD and also the Recruitment Regulations for appointment of DEO, which fact was disputed by the Counsel for the Applicant and, therefore, the Counsel for the Applicant was allowed two weeks time to file reply to the additional affidavit.   The case was again taken up on 19.01.2010, where the arguing counsel for the Applicant came later on after hearing where his proxy counsel and the counsel for the Respondents participated and the order was reserved.  In the interest of justice and allowing the counsel for Applicants to produce documents of (i) Recruitment Regulations for DEO and (ii) Creation of DEO posts; the case was adjourned for final hearing and was finally heard on 12.02.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_21">6.	Shri M. K. Bhardwaj, the Learned Counsel for the Applicant, contended that the Applicants were initially engaged in 1996 as Data Entry Operator (DEO) on daily wage basis, but they were regularized in 2005 as School Attendants.  He submitted that though the Education Department processed a proposal for creation of DEO posts in order to regularize their services but that did not fructify.  He drew my attention to the additional affidavit to state that 8 posts of DEO were created in MCD and the Government of Delhi Recruitment Rules for DEO were being followed in MCD.  He further submitted that the Applicants having been fully qualified and eligible for those posts as per the said Rules, the Respondents should be directed to regularize them as DEO.  Shri Bhardwaj also submitted that Respondents having not given correct information, attempted to misguide the Court. In the additional affidavit filed on 15.10.2009, it was stated that those 8 posts of DEO were still vacant, and in the affidavit filed on 28.1.2010 it was indicated that the daily wage service of one Sandeep Kumar similarly placed as the Applicants was regularized as DEO in September, 2002.  Shri Bhardwaj emphasized that the Respondents had given commitment before the Honble High Court of Delhi to regularize the Applicants as DEOs and interim directions had been continuing not to fill up those post until the disposal of the case.  He, therefore, argued that the OA is a fit case to be allowed and the Applicants are to be appointed as DEO. 
</p>
<p id="p_22">7.	Ms. Biji Rajesh for Shri Gaurang Kanth, the learned counsel for the Respondents highlighted about the action taken by the MCD to regularize the services of the Applicants.  She fairly stated that the Applicants were engaged as daily wager and the salary was paid to them as School Attendants but they were temporarily put to work on computers.  The Applicants, however, were regularized as School Attendants in the Pay Scale of Rs.2550-3200/- in the year 2005.  She contended that in the absence of Recruitment Rules and posts for Computer DEO in the Education Department  of the  MCD, it was not possible for the Respondent to regularize the Applicants as DEO.  She also drew my attention to the guidelines for Data Entry Services circulated vide letter dated 10.06.2004 (Annexure-R2) as a result of which the services of the data entry is availed by the MCD as per the Guidelines.  In response to the point raised by the counsel for the Applicants that the Education Department submitted a proposal to create certain posts of DEO, she clarified that the competent authority vide noting dated 21.08.2006 and dated 09.03.2007 decided that there was no need to create the posts of DEO and data entry works had been out sourced.  With regard to the contentions of the Counsel for the Applicants on the 8 DEO posts created in MCD and the Recruitment Rule of Government NCT of Delhi being followed for the same, Ms. Biji Rajesh clarified that those posts were created in Finance Department and not in the Education Department and the Recruitment Regulation of Government of NCTD would apply for those posts.  In this background Ms. Rajesh, therefore, argued that the TA should be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_23">8.	There is no dispute that the Applicants were engaged in 1996 by the Education Department of MCD on daily wage basis. The Applicants were selected for the post of DEO on daily wage basis. It is also not in dispute that their services were utilized for data entry in Head Quarter Computer Cell of MCD.  They, as per the Respondents letter dated 9.12.1998 (Page 34), were recommended to MCD Care Taker Department to issue them Identity Card as Computer Operators in MCD.  It is also not in dispute that they were paid as per the rate of daily wages School Attendants. It is admitted fact that Respondent-Education Department of MCD processed the proposal to create DEO posts to regularize the Applicants, but the Education Department could not succeed in its effort and were directed to outsource such data entry functions as per the MCD Guidelines.  As per the latest position explained during the hearing by the Counsels for both sides, I find that (i) there exist 8 posts of DEO in the office of the Financial Management and Budget as per the MCD Resolution No.573 of 19.01.2006 (Annexure-P1); (ii) the Respondent MCD has been following the Delhi Government Recruitment Rules for the DEO (Grade-A); (iii) no post of DEO has been created/sanctioned for the Education Department; (iv) it is revealed from the pleadings that the Department of Information Technology of MCD has issued Guidelines dated 10.6.2004 (Annexure-R2) for data entry service; (v) it is also noted that the Applicants were engaged for computer operations for a long period and were paid daily wages meant for School Attendants and (vi) it is found that all of them having moved the Honble High Court on 28.07.1999, the Respondent though promised/committed before the High Court to regularize them as DEO, got them transferred as School Attendant in 9.11.1999 and were regularized as School Attendants in the year 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_24">9.	Thus, the only issue that remains is on regularization or appointment of the Applicants as DEO.  Even though Respondent MCD created 8 post of DEO in Finance Department, the Respondents all along denied to have any post of DEO. Confronted with question from the Bench that DEO posts were created in MCD in January 2006, the Counsel for the Respondents argued that those were not meant for Education Department, nor she could inform about the vacancy position of the DEO.  The Counsel for Respondents definitely did not furnish the correct information on the availability of DEO in MCD.  Too many adjournments were granted to furnish the facts.  Though, I am not drawing adverse conclusion against the Respondents, but I note the non-responsive attitude before the Court.  However, taking note of the interim directions of the Honble High Court vide its order dated 1st September, 1999 and confirmed on 24.7.2002, I conclude that those 8 posts are still vacant.  The Applicants, though already regularized in the post of School Attendant, if eligible as per the Recruitment Rules for DEO of the Delhi Government adopted by the Respondent MCD, the Applicants would be entitled to be considered for those DEO posts along with similarly placed persons available in the MCD. 
</p>
<p id="p_25">10.	In the above setting and backdrop of the case, I feel, it is proper to analyse whether the doctrine of legitimate expectation gets attracted for adjudicating the issue in the OA. The counsel for the Applicant made an endeavour during the hearings stating that the Applicants were initially selected for the DEO posts on daily wages and were informed to be regularised in such posts. I find that they all worked as DEO though on daily wages for pretty long period, their  identity cards were got as computer operators, even the Department of Education processed a proposal for their regularisation as DEO. This in my opinion is the legitimate expectation triggered by various action of the Respondents to get the Applicants regularized as DEO. Let me analyse here the settled legal position on the doctrine of  legitimate expectation. As held by Honourable Supreme Court in Poonam Verma Vs. Delhi Development Authority[2007 STPL(LE) 39343 SC] that the "doctrine of Legitimate Expectation would apply only when a practice is found to be prevailing. It has a positive concept." The Counsel for the Applicant has brought to my notice that one Sandeep Kumar similarly placed as the Applicants was regularised in 2002 and this was not denied by the Respondents. Thus, it is proper to infer that such a practice exist in the MCD. I also find that in the case of such regularisation no  illegality will be committed. 
</p>
<p id="p_26">11.	Honourable Supreme Court considered the principle of legitimate expectationin in Sethi Auto Service Station Vs. Delhi Development Authority[2008 STPL(LE) 40815 SC] by scanning the following cases   <a href="/doc/952671/" id="a_2">Jitendra Kumar &amp; Ors. v. State of Haryana &amp; Anr</a>.

The State of Punjab</a> [1962 (Supp. 3) SCR 713] (relied upon) and relying on some of them as mentioned, passed a detailed judgment laying the law in the subject.
</p>
<p id="p_27">"27. An examination of the afore-noted few decisions shows that the golden thread running through all these decisions is that a case for applicability of the doctrine of legitimate expectation  now accepted in the subjective sense as part of our legal jurisprudence, arises when an administrative body by reason of a representation or by past practice or conduct aroused an expectation which it would be within its powers to fulfill unless some overriding public interest comes in the way. However, a person who bases his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectationin the first instance, has to satisfy that he has relied on the said representation and the denial of that expectation has worked to his detriment. The Court could interfere only if the decision taken by the authority was found to be arbitrary, unreasonable or in gross abuse of power or in violation of principles of natural justice and not taken in public interest. But a claim based on mere legitimate expectationwithout anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles. It is well settled that the concept of legitimate expectation has no role to play where the State action is as a public policy or in the public interest unless the action taken amounts to an abuse of power. The court must not usurp the discretion of the public authority which is empowered to take the decisions under law and the court is expected to apply an objective standard which leaves to the deciding authority the full range of choice which the legislature is presumed to have intended. Even in a case where the decision is left entirely to the discretion of the deciding authority without any such legal bounds and if the decision is taken fairly and objectively, the court will not interfere on the ground of procedural fairness to a person whose interest based on legitimate expectationmight be affected. Therefore, a legitimate expectation can at the most be one of the grounds which may give rise to judicial review but the granting of relief is very much limited."
</p>

<p id="p_28">12.	In Jitendra Kumar Vs. State of Haryana [2008-2- SCC-161] Honourable Supreme Court considered the Doctrine of legitimate expectation and and relying on its earlier judgment in <a href="/doc/771183/" id="a_11">Kuldeep Singh v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi</a> [(2006) 5 SCC 702] held that 
"legitimate expectation is not the same thing as an anticipation. It is distinct and different from a desire and hope. It is based on a right. [<a href="/doc/1926455/" id="a_12">See Chanchal Goyal (Dr.) v. State of Rajasthan</a> (2003) 3 SCC 485 and <a href="/doc/1964881/" id="a_13">Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corpn</a>. (1993) 3 SCC 499] It is grounded in the rule of law as requiring regularity, predictability and certainty with the Government's dealings with the public. We have no doubt that the doctrine of legitimate expectation operates both in procedural and substantive matters." 
</p>

<p id="p_29">13.	I am of the opinion that Doctrine of legitimate expectation is applicable in this case.  As late as 17th October, 2007 the Director (Education) of MCD submitted a note to the Addl. Commissioner (Estt.) which reveal the following:-
</p><p id="p_30">As has been mentioned by them in their representation, the applicants were taken on daily wage basis but on firm assumption of getting promoted as Data Entry Operators on regular basis.  One of them is in fact an MCD (from IGNOU).  Later on it seems the whole scheme was shelved and the poor applicants had no choice but to continue as school attendants on daily wages basis.  After representing to the department they sought justice from the court also but they are still running from pillar to post.  The qualifications they have and the years they have put in are enough grounds for promoting/absorbing/upgrading of their posts to any post equivalent to an LDC which involves computer work. The department is keen for a solution to help the applicants but does not have any cadre posts to upgrade them.

</p><p id="p_31">14.	Taking into consideration the above facts and circumstances of the case, relying on Honble Apex Court dicta on the Doctrine of legitimate expectations, and my analysis on the issue within, I come to the considered conclusion that the Applicants though already regularized as School Attendants and have become MCD employees, they have established the case in their support and are entitled to be considered for the existing vacant and future DEO posts in MCD.  Resultantly, I direct the Respondents to consider the Applicants for the available vacant posts of DEO including 8 posts belonging to Finance Department of MCD, subject to their eligibility as per Rules ibid,  in terms of my analysis, observation and directions within.
</p>
<p id="p_32">15.	The Original Application having merits is allowed in terms of the orders and directions in Para 14 above.  No costs.
