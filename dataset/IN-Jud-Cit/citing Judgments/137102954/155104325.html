 1.1 Along            with    the         suit,        the        plaintiff        filed

I.A.No.15969/2009           for        grant     of    ex-parte        ad-interim

injunction.     Vide order dated 9th December, 2009, the

summons in the suit and notice in the application were

issued to the defendant.                 However, ex-parte ad-interim

injunction was not granted to the plaintiff at that time.

1.2 On 29th April, 2010, the plaintiff gave up the claim for

violation of the copyright as well as passing off. In view

thereof, the plaintiff‟s claim is now restricted to the claim

for infringement of trademark only.

</p>
<p id="p_5">2.    Plaintiff's Case

2.1 The plaintiff is the proprietor of the registered

trademark "Lemon Tree" in classes 8,12,16,17 and 42.

The particulars of the seven registrations held by the

plaintiff are given in para 12 of the plaint and the

registration certificates have been placed on record as

Annexure „F‟. The plaintiff has also applied for registration


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                                        Page 2 of 39</span>
 in Classes 29, 30, 31, 32 and 35 which are pending with

the Trademark Registry.
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.2 The plaintiff conceived and adopted the trade mark

"Lemon Tree" in 2001 and started its use in October,

2002.    The plaintiff opened its first hotel in Gurgaon in

June, 2004.      The plaintiff has eleven operational hotels

under the name "Lemon Tree" in various states namely,

Haryana, Goa, Maharashtra, U.P., Kerala, Gujarat, Madhya

Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Eight more hotels of

the plaintiff are under construction.
</p>
<p id="p_7">2.3 The plaintiff claims to have invested more than

`5,000 crores in the hotel business. The financial reports

and audited accounts of the plaintiff have been placed on

record as Annexure „H‟.
</p>
<p id="p_8">2.4 The plaintiff claims its hotel chain to be the country‟s

first moderately priced, upscale, full service, business and

leisure hotels for catering to the needs of affluent and

middle class society. The plaintiff claims to have acquired

high reputation in the market widely recognized in the

country as well as abroad. The plaintiff further claims to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                 Page 3 of 39</span>
 have widely advertised in the media. The annual revenue

generated        and        the     expenditure      incurred       on

advertisements by the plaintiff for the years ending 31st

March, 2005 to 31st March, 2009 are given in para 18 of

the plaint.      In the year ending 31st March, 2005, the

plaintiff generated revenue of `2,38,31,842/- out of which

the plaintiff spent `2,00,051/- on advertisements.                 The

annual      revenue         of     the   plaintiff   increased       to

`56,24,55,700/- in the year ending 31st March, 2009 out of

which    the    plaintiff    has    spent   `26,34,238/-     on    the

advertisements. The copies of the audited reports of the

plaintiff for the years 2004-05 to 2008-09 are on record as

Annexure „H‟. The write ups of the plaintiff‟s hotels are on

record as Annexure-I.
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.5 On 17th September, 2009, the plaintiff came to know

that the defendant had started construction of residential

apartments under the name and style of "Lemon Tree

Apartments" at Madhapur, Hyderabad at a distance of

about 2 kms from their hotel at Hyderabad known as

Lemon Tree Hotel.           The brochure of the defendant is on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                         Page 4 of 39</span>
 record as Annexure-J. The plaintiff immediately thereafter

instituted the present suit seeking the injunction against

the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_10">2.6 The adoption and use of trademark "Lemon Tree" by

the defendant is not bonafide and innocent but malafide

and with the dishonest intention of encashing the goodwill

and reputation of the plaintiff.   The defendant had been

carrying on its construction business since the year 1997

in the name of M/s Vaishnavi Estates (P) Ltd.              The

defendant adopted the trademark "Lemon Tree" in 2009 in

respect of its project at a distance of 2 kms from the

plaintiff‟s hotel after the plaintiff‟s hotel at Madhapur,

Hyderabad came into existence in 2008. According to the

plaintiff, the defendant has no justification for adopting the

plaintiff‟s registered trademark "Lemon Tree".

2.7 The defendant‟s trademark "Lemon Tree" is identical

with the plaintiff‟s registered trademark.    It is submitted

that services of the defendant are also similar to the

services of the plaintiff.    The plaintiff is in the hotel

business whereas the defendant is in the business of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                  Page 5 of 39</span>
 construction of housing apartments and the activities are

similar and, therefore, the use of the trademark "Lemon

Tree" by the defendant amounts to infringement of

trademark under Section 29(2)(a) &amp; (b) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks

Act</a>, 1999.
</p>
<p id="p_11">2.8 Assuming though not admitting that the services of

the plaintiff and the defendant are not similar, the use of

the trademark "Lemon Tree" by the defendant amounts to

infringement of trademark even under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_2">Section 29(4)</a> of the

Trade Marks Act, 1999 as the plaintiff‟s registered

trademark "Lemon Tree" has reputation in India.

</p><p id="p_12">3.    Defence of the defendant

3.1 The defendant honestly and bonafidely adopted the

trademark "Lemon Tree Apartments" in the year 2008 in

relation to one of its housing projects launched in 2008-09

in Hyderabad.
</p>
<p id="p_13">3.2 The defendant‟s trademark has become distinctive of

the defendant‟s business.    The defendant has already

invested huge amount in the said business.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                Page 6 of 39</span>
 3.3 The defendant has given wide publicity to its project

under the said trademark. The defendant has invested

heavily in promotion, advertisement and publicity of the

housing projects.
</p>
<p id="p_14">3.4 The defendant is the proprietor of the trademark

"Lemon Tree Apartments" and has the exclusive rights to

use thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_15">3.5 The defendant‟s business and services are not

similar to the business/services of the plaintiff. Whereas

the plaintiff is carrying on the business of hotels and

hospitality, the defendant is involved in housing projects.

The plaintiff‟s business activities are covered in Class 42

whereas the defendant‟s business/activities are covered in

Class 36. The customers/users of both the business and

activities are different and different classes of consumers

are the end users of the two services.
</p>
<p id="p_16">3.6 There is no scope of the defendant passing off his

goods and business as that of the plaintiff.

3.7 The plaintiff is not holding any trademark registration

for goods/services in Class 36 or 37 which cover the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                               Page 7 of 39</span>
 defendant‟s goods/services.
</p>
<p id="p_17">3.8 The defendant‟s trademark has few add-ons by way

of distinctive work due to which it is distinct from the

plaintiff‟s trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_18">3.9 The       use     of    trademark     "Lemon   Tree"      by   the

defendant      does        not   amount   to   infringement    under

<a href="/doc/1012419/" id="a_3">Sections 29(2)(a)</a> and (b) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_4">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999

because the business and services of the plaintiff and the

defendant are different and there is no likelihood of

confusion on the part of the public.
</p>
<p id="p_19">3.10 The      use     of    trademark     "Lemon   Tree"      by   the

defendant would not amount to infringement under

<a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_5">Section 29(4)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 because the

plaintiff has no reputation.
</p>
<p id="p_20">3.11 The plaintiff has pirated the trademark "Lemon Tree"

from Lemon Tree Hotel in USA which is in business since

the year 1998 as per the internet downloads filed by the

defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_21">4.    Learned counsel for the plaintiff in the rejoinder

vehemently denied that the defendants honestly and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                         Page 8 of 39</span>
 bonafidely adopted the trade mark "Lemon Tree".         The

plaintiff further denied that the defendant has invested

heavily in promotion, advertisement and publicity as

neither any material has been placed on record nor any

particulars have been furnished by the defendant in this

regard. The plaintiff is in the business of hotel industry

since 2002 and has already invested more than `5,000

crores.    The plaintiff has established the brand "Lemon

Tree" in the market whereas the defendant adopted the

said mark in 2009 with the sole intention of encashing the

goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff. The defendant has

no explanation as to why it changed its earlier name

Vaishnavi Estates to "Lemon Tree" all of a sudden in 2009.

Since the suit was filed immediately after the defendant

entered into the market, no prejudice would be caused to

the defendant if they are restrained from using the brand

"Lemon Tree". With respect to the defendant‟s plea that

the plaintiff is a pirate because Lemon Tree Hotel was

being run in the USA much prior to the alleged adoption of

the mark by the plaintiff, the plaintiff submitted that the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                               Page 9 of 39</span>
 photocopy of the document downloaded from the internet

by the defendant shows that Lemon Tree hotel in the U.S.

was operated by two Australian families, who have been in

the business of providing accommodation since 1998,

from which it cannot be assumed that the Australian

families are running hotel business under the trade mark

"Lemon Tree" since 1998.            It was further submitted that

there was no material to show that the said mark used

abroad enjoyed any reputation in India at any point of time

when the plaintiff adopted the same and the use of the

said mark abroad was to the knowledge of the plaintiff

when the plaintiff adopted the mark in India.

5.1 <a href="/doc/981264/" id="a_6">Ozone SPA Private Limited vs. Ozone Club</a>,
    2010 (42) PTC 469 (Del.)

      In   this      case,   the   plaintiff    was   the    registered

proprietor     of     the    trademark         „OZONE‟      in     classes

16,30,32,33 and 42. The plaintiff was running a spa which

falls in class 41 whereas the defendant was running fitness

centre, health club and gymnastics. This Court held that

the plaintiff‟s mark had acquired goodwill and reputation

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                               Page 10 of 39</span>
 and, therefore, was covered under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_7">Section 29(4)</a> of the

Trade Marks Act for protection of the mark relating to

dissimilar goods as the use of mark by the defendant

would be of unfair advantage and detrimental to the mark

of the plaintiff. The relevant finding of the Court are as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "19. Now I shall deal with the contentions
             raised by the defendant. The first
             objection of the defendant is that the suit
             for infringement of the trade mark is not
             maintainable as the plaintiff has no
             registration in its favour in class 41 of the
             Schedule IV of the classification, thus, the
             plaintiff cannot invoke the jurisdiction
             under <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_8">Section 134</a> of the Act. From the
             documents filed by the plaintiff it
             appears, prima facie, that the trade mark
             "Ozone" adopted and used by the plaintiff
             has acquired secondary meaning by
             virtue of long and continuous user. In
             support of the claim of goodwill and
             reputation, the plaintiff has furnished the
             statement of sale and promotional
             expenses as well as the documents to
             show that the mark "Ozone" has been
             continuously used and advertised in
             various modern media and the mark was
             adopted to distinguish with the services
             of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has filed the
             ample evidence on record to show their
             business     activities    and     extensive
             advertisement and in view of that, there
             is no hesitation to come to the conclusion
             that the said name "Ozone" is known

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                    Page 11 of 39</span>
              mark in relation to the services provided
             by the plaintiff despite of the fact that the
             plaintiffs application for registration in
             class 41 of Schedule IV of the
             Classification in relation to health club
             and related services is pending for
             registration but at the same time it is an
             admitted fact that the plaintiff has got
             the registration in class 42 in relation to
             services such as medical, hygiene and
             beauty care etc.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">             20. As regards the suit for infringement is
             concerned, undisputedly the plaintiffs
             trade mark "Ozone" is registered in
             respect of the various goods in classes
             16, 30, 32, 33 and particularly in class 42
             in respect of goods including hygiene and
             beauty care services. Although, these
             are not same services but somehow
             they are connected with the services
             provided by the plaintiff under the
             mark "Ozone" the mark which has
             already acquired a residual goodwill
             and reputation, therefore, this Court
             is of the considered opinion that the
             present matter covers under the
             dicta of <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_9">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act
             where the protection of the mark is
             given to the dissimilar goods as use
             of the mark by the defendant would
             be unfair advantage of or is
             detrimental to the mark of the
             plaintiff, therefore, it is a well known
             trade mark within the meaning of
             <a href="/doc/899174/" id="a_10">Section 2(1)(zg)</a> of the Act and have
             the present case covered under

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             "13. The counsel for the plaintiff had in
             opening submissions pitched her case
             primarily on <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_13">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act.
             Trademark, traditionally is with respect

             a reputation in India and the use of

             without due cause and takes unfair
             advantage of and/or is detrimental
             to the distinctive character or
             repute of the registered trademark.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             15. <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_17">Section 2(z)(g)</a> defines a well known
             trademark as the one which in relation
             to any goods, means a mark which has
             become so to the substantial segment
             of the public which uses such goods that
             the use of such mark in relation to other
             goods would be likely to be taken as
             indicating a connection in the course of
             trade between those goods and a
             person using the mark in relation to the
             first mentioned goods. In my view the
             segment of the public which uses
             the watches of the category/price
             range as the watches of the

             not before it. A matter very much akin
             to the matter in hand came up before a
             single Judge of this Court. It was
             observed in Cool ways India Vs. Prince
             Air Conditioning and Refrigeration 1993
             (1) Arbitration Law Reporter 401. The
             contention that a plaintiff himself is
             usurping or infringing the trade mark of
             a third party was not to be gone into by
             the Court while deciding the issue in
             between the parties. What is to be seen
             by the Court is as to whether the
             plaintiff has acquired good-will and
             reputation for his products. Moreover,
             the plaintiffs have placed on record a
             report on Urban Market for Batteries,
             October, 1997. A perusal of the same
             shows that Sony New Ultra was sold
             only one unit during the month of May,
             1997. There is no sale in the month of
             June, July, August, September, 1997.
             Similarly, Sony has got no market share
             during the months of May, June, July,
             August and September, 1997. Thus the
             same is absolutely of no avail to the
             defendants. To the same effect is the
             view expressed by a learned Single
             Judge of this Court in Amrit Soap
             Company Vs. New Punjab Soap Factory
             1989 (2) Arbitration Law Reporter 242.
             "The allegation that some other

hereunder:-

which resembles a „W‟, generally used with the words

„WELCOME GROUP‟ whereas the defendant‟s trade mark

 was logo of „M‟ with the word mark „MARLBORO‟. This

2010 (44) PTC 209 (Del.), the plaintiff was using the

trade mark „KNOCKOUT‟ in respect of beer. The defendant

started selling defence pepper spray under the trade mark

„KNOCKOUT‟.          The injunction was refused on the ground

that the plaintiff had not placed any evidence on record to

establish that the trademark „KNOCKOUT‟ had acquired

distinctiveness to the extent that the consumers would be

confused if they came across pepper spray with the trade

mark „KNOCKOUT‟ and the nature of business of the

parties was totally different and unrelated.

 respondent [Scotch Whisky Association (Scotland)] came

to know about the said registration in 1974 but they filed

rectification petition in 1986. The rectification petition was

dismissed by the Supreme Court broadly on the ground

that there had been an unexplained delay of more than 18

years and the adoption of trade mark „PETER SCOT‟ was

bona fide.

Bhadabhai</a>, 1996 PTC (16) (Del.), the plaintiff was the

registered proprietor of trade mark "KELLOG‟S CORN

FLAKE".      The defendant launched the corn flakes under

the trade mark "AIMS ARISTO CORN FLAKE" prominently

displayed on the boxes. However, the boxes carried some

colour combination similar to the plaintiff‟s box. This Court

has observed that since the marks are entirely different,

there was no chance of any confusion or deception.

7.5 In Johnson &amp; Johnson and Another vs. Christine

Hoden (P) Ltd., 1988 PTC 39 (Del.), the plaintiff‟s trade

mark was „STAYFREE‟ in respect of sanitary napkins. The

defendants      started    using   the   trade    mark    "COMFIT

 ALWAYS". The main trade mark used by the defendants

was "COMFIT ALWAYS" and the word "STAYFREE" was

used in descriptive sense. This Court refused the injunction

as the two marks were entirely different and there was no

likelihood of confusion and deception on the part of the

public.

2010 (42) PTC 639 (Del), the plaintiff‟s trade mark was

"OIL KINGS" in respect of oil. The defendant adopted the

trade mark (label) "KING‟S" Label.     The injunction was

refused because the trademark "KING‟S" registered and in

use by the defendant in various countries had worldwide

reputation. This Court further noted the fact that the

turnover of the defendant was more than `150 crores and

they had been spending more than `5 crores annually on

advertisement of their brand.

there would be no confusion or deception among the

public.

      During the course of arguments on 24th February,

2011, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that

the defendant has used the trade mark "Lemon Tree

Apartments" only in respect of one housing project under

construction at Hyderabad and the defendant has no other

project in the offing, whereupon the defendant was

directed to file an affidavit in this regard. Mr.T. Srinivas,

Managing Director of the defendant, submitted an affidavit

dated 23rd March, 2001 in which it was stated that 358

flats are being constructed in Lemon Tree Apartments, out

of which construction of 125 flats was complete and the

remaining flats were at various stages of construction and

the defendant had already sold 105 flats. The defendant

has placed on record copy of the development agreement

dated 24th July, 2008 between the land owners and the

three developers including the defendants.       As per the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                 Page 23 of 39</span>
 said agreement, the defendant and two other developers,

namely, M/s. Aakruti Construction and Deepthi Homes

entered into an agreement with the four co-owners of the

land for construction of multi-storyed building thereon. The

developers have paid a sum of `50 lakhs to the land

owners and have agreed to construct four blocks having

built up area of 4 Lakh square feet. The land owners and

developers have 50% share each in the built up property.

The development agreement does not contain any clause

for giving any name to the project or the apartments. The

Managing Director of the defendant also appeared before

this   Court    on   23rd   March,   2011    and   undertook      to

confine/restrict to      use   of trade     mark "Lemon Tree

Apartments" in respect of one project in hand and not to

use the same for any other project.

 facie view that the plaintiff has a strong prima facie case

for grant of ad-interim injunction because:-

9.1.1        The plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the

trademark "Lemon Tree".
</p>
<p id="p_37">9.1.2        The plaintiff is in continuous use of the said

trademark since October, 2002.
</p>
<p id="p_38">9.1.3        The plaintiff has eleven operational hotels and

eight hotels are under construction all over the country.

9.1.4        The plaintiff has invested more than `5,000

crores in the hotel business.
</p>
<p id="p_39">9.1.5        The plaintiff has prima facie reputation in

respect of the said trademark on the basis of the aforesaid

facts,    annual     revenues    and    the    expenses      on

advertisements.
</p>
<p id="p_40">9.1.6        The defendant adopted the identical trade mark

"Lemon Tree" without any justification in year 2009 in

respect of its project at a distance of 2 kilometers from the

plaintiff‟s hotel which came into existence in 2008.       The

adoption of the plaintiff‟s trade mark "Lemon Tree" by the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CS(OS)No.2338/2009                                  Page 25 of 39</span>
 defendant appears to be dishonest with the sole intention

to encash the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff.

9.1.7        The defendant‟s claim that the mark "Lemon

Tree" has become distinctive of their business and they

have invested huge amount and have given vide publicity

is misconceived in as much as the plaintiff instituted this

suit in 2009 itself immediately after becoming aware of

the defendant‟s use. The defendant has also not placed on

record any material to substantiate its claim. The entire

defense of the defendant appears to be frivolous.

9.1.8        The     defendant‟s   mark      "Lemon       Tree

Apartments" is identical to the registered trade mark of

the plaintiff; the services of the plaintiff and the defendant

are similar (the plaintiff is in hotel business whereas the

defendant is in the business of construction); it is likely to

cause confusion to the public that the defendant‟s "Lemon

Tree Apartments" have an association with the plaintiff

and, therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to protection under

<a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_36">Section 29(2)</a> and (3) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_37">Trade Marks Act</a>.

 9.1.9.       Even if the services of the plaintiff and the

defendant are taken to be not similar as contended by the

defendant, the plaintiff is entitled to protection under

<a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_38">Section 29(4)</a> of the Trade Marks Act as the plaintiff has

reputation in India; use of the infringing mark by the

defendant is without any justification; the defendant has

taken unfair advantage and it is detrimental to the

distinctive character as well as the repute of the plaintiff‟s

registered trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_41">9.1.10       With respect to the plea that there is a Lemon

Tree Hotel in USA, the defendant has not been able to

show cross border reputation of the said hotel in India.

9.2 Balance of convenience

9.2.1        The balance of convenience lies in favour of the

plaintiff and against the defendant as the plaintiff is the

registered proprietor of the trademark "Lemon Tree" and

is in continuous use since October, 2002         with eleven

operational hotels and eight hotels under construction all

over the country with an investment of more than `5,000

crores.

 9.2.2         On the other hand, the defendant who had

been carrying on its construction business in the name of

Vaishnavi     Estates   (P) Ltd   since    1997,   adopted     the

plaintiff‟s    trademark    "Lemon        Tree"    without    any

justification in 2009 with the full knowledge of the

plaintiff‟s hotel in Hyderabad at a distance of about 2 kms

from the plaintiff‟s project and the plaintiff immediately

filed the present suit.
</p>
<p id="p_43">9.2.3         The defendant is using the plaintiff‟s registered

trade mark "Lemon Tree" in respect of one project.

9.2.4         The defendant has given an undertaking to this

Court on 23rd March, 2011 not to use the said trademark

for any other project. Even one project in respect of which

the defendant is using the trademark "Lemon Tree" is a

joint venture agreement in respect of which the defendant

has already sold more than 105 flats.
</p>
<p id="p_44">9.2.5         It is not disputed that the defendant has only

limited interest in the project till the sale of the flats.

 9.3 Irreparable loss and injury

      The plaintiff would suffer irreparable loss and injury

in case the defendant is not restrained from using the

plaintiff‟s registered trademark. If the defendant is not

restrained from using the plaintiff‟s registered trademark

"Lemon Tree", it would also dilute the plaintiff‟s trademark

and would also cause confusion to the public, who would

associate the defendant‟s project with the plaintiff.

9.4 Relevant judgments

      This case is squarely covered by the principles laid

down in Ozone SPA Private Limited (supra), Rolex SA

(supra), Vardhman Properties Ltd. (supra), Indian

Shaving Project Limited (supra) and Mahendra &amp;

Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd. (supra). With respect to the

judgments cited by the defendant, this Court accepts the

submissions of the plaintiff recorded in para 7 above.

             violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and
             Mahatma Gandhi guided the people to
             ingrain these values in their daily life.
             Truth constituted an integral part of the
             justice-delivery system which was in
             vogue in pre-Independence era and the
             people used to feel proud to tell truth in
             the      courts    irrespective    of    the
             consequences.           However,        post-
             Independence period has seen drastic
             changes in our value system. The
             materialism has over-shadowed the old
             ethos and the quest for personal gain has
             become so intense that those involved in
             litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of
             falsehood,       misrepresentation       and
             suppression of facts in the court
             proceedings. In the last 40 years, a new
             creed of litigants has cropped up. Those
             who belong to this creed do not have any
             respect for truth. They shamelessly resort
             to falsehood and unethical means for
             achieving their goals. In order to meet the
             challenge posed by this new creed of
             litigants, the courts have, from time to
             time, evolved new rules and it is now well
             established that a litigant, who attempts
             to pollute the stream of justice or who
             touches the pure fountain of justice with
             tainted hands, is not entitled to any relief,

           which the Courts are engaged by the

           step and even if they succeed in
           prolonging the litigation due to their

<p id="p_47"> 10.3 I agree with the findings by the learned Judge in

Padmawati's case (supra) and wish to add a few words.

There is another feature which has been observed and it is

of unscrupulous persons filing false claims or defences

with a view that the other person would get tired and

would then agree to compromise with him by giving up

some right or paying some money. If the other party is not

able to continue contesting the case or the Court by

reason of falsehood falls into an error, the wrong

succeeds. Many times, the other party compromises, or at

other times, he may continue to fight it out. But as far as

the party in the wrong is concerned, as this Court noted in

Padmawati's          case   (supra),   even   if   these    litigants

ultimately lose the lis, they become the real victors and

MANU/SC/0714/2011, the Supreme Court has held that the

Courts have to take into consideration pragmatic realities

and have to be realistic in imposing the costs. The relevant

paragraphs of the said judgment are reproduced hereunder:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">           "45.     ...We are clearly of the view that
           unless we ensure that wrongdoers are denied
           profit or undue benefit from the frivolous
           litigation, it would be difficult to control
           frivolous and uncalled for litigations. In order
           to curb uncalled for and frivolous litigation,
           the courts have to ensure that there is no
           incentive or motive for uncalled for litigation.
           It is a matter of common experience that
           court's otherwise scarce and valuable time is
           consumed or more appropriately wasted in a
           large number of uncalled for cases."

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">           "52. The main question which arises for our

           drastically changed or improved if the

           obligation of the trial judge to carefully
           scrutinize, check and verify the pleadings and
           the documents filed by the parties. This must
           be done immediately after civil suits are filed.

           at the earliest according to the object of the
           Act. If this exercise is carefully carried out, it
           would focus the controversies involved in the
           case and help the court in arriving at truth of

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">           C. Imposition of actual, realistic or

           tendency of introducing false pleadings
           and forged and fabricated documents by
           the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs
           would     also     control     unnecessary
           adjournments      by    the   parties.  In
           appropriate cases the         courts may
