<p id="p_1">       In this writ petition, the controversy is regarding the filling up of the

post of Headmistress of an aided High School, of which the 4th respondent

is the Manager. Petitioner commenced continuous service as HSA in the

aforesaid school w.e.f. 15/7/89 and was test qualified in December, 2001.

Petitioner completed 12 years graduate service on 15/7/2001. In so far as

the 5th respondent is concerned, her continuous service in the school as

HSA commenced on 7/6/93 and she got the test qualifications in June,

2000 and completed 12 years graduate service on 7/6/2005. As far as the

6th respondent is concerned, even according to the petitioner, she is senior

to both the petitioner and the 5th respondent and was also qualified for the

post in all respects. Therefore, details regarding her service particulars are

not necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.    There arose the vacancy of Headmistress in the school w.e.f.

01.04.2001. At that time, both the petitioner and the 5th respondent were

unqualified. Petitioner submits that despite her eligibility and seniority, the

5th respondent was posted as Teacher in charge and that subsequently,

she was promoted on a regular basis w.e.f. 7/6/2005. The appointment of

the 5th respondent as Headmistress was approved by the DEO and in

appeal to the DPI, by Ext.P5 order, the 5th respondent's promotion was

set aside on the ground that the school did not have minority status and

that the petitioner was the rightful claimant. In the revision filed by the

Manager before the 1st respondent, Ext.P6 order was rendered taking the

view that the school is a minority educational institution and on that basis,

the promotion of the 5th respondent was also upheld. Petitioner sought

review of Ext.P6 and that was rejected by Ext.P7. The aforesaid orders

were challenged before this Court in WP(C) No.30984/05, in which this

Court rendered Ext.P8 judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.     In the said judgment, referring to the judgment                 in

<a href="/doc/1680750/" id="a_1">Rev.K.C.Seth v. State of Kerala</a> (1991(2) KLT 662), the learned

Judge took the view that it is clear that unless the institution is established

and administered by the minority community, it will not be entitled to the

benefit of rights under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_2">Article 30</a> of the Constitution of India. Proceeding

further, Learned Judge took note of the contention of the management

that the school was originally established in 1950 and administered by a

member of Nadar Christian community and therefore the school was

founded by a member of the Christian Nadar Community. Reference was

also made to the judgment of the Apex Court in Manager, St.Thomas

U.P.S. v. Commissioner</a> (2002(2) SCC 497). Thereafter the learned

Judge held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">            It is to be noted that in Ext.P6, there is no finding that
     the school was established by a member of the minority
     institution. If there has been such a finding and the petitioner
     has given up his claim, I would not have been inclined to
     interfere with the finding that the institution enjoys rights
     under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_4">Article 30.</a> This is a patent case where the authority has
     proceeded on the basis opposed to law as declared by the
     Apex Court.      In such circumstances, it becomes necessary
     that the matter be reconsidered by the Government.</blockquote><p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">     4.     Again dealing with the claim of the petitioner herein for the

post of Headmaster, the learned Judge held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Of course, even if it is found that the respondent is a
     minority institution, still the question would arise as to
     whether it was correct to approve of the appointment of
     fourth respondent. When the vacancy arose, it was open to a
     minority    institution  to  appoint   any   qualified   person
     irrespective of seniority as HM. But the right under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_5">Article 30</a>
     does not extend to appointing a person who is not qualified.
     Certainly, it is for the third respondent to take note of the
     claim of sixth respondent also in accordance with law. If the
     sixth respondent is not found entitled to be appointed as HM,
     then certainly it is the petitioner who would be eligible, as
     admittedly the fourth respondent has become qualified only
     in the year 2005. This is on the basis of the decision of the
     Full Bench in Padmanabhan Nair's Case.</blockquote><p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">                                                (Emphasis supplied)

Against Ext.P8 judgment, though the Manager filed WA 2387/07, it was

submitted that the same was dismissed as withdrawn.

</p><p id="p_8">     5.     Accordingly,    the  matter   was   reconsidered    by  the 1st

respondent and it was thereafter that the 1st respondent issued Ext.P9

order. In Ext.P9 order, in so far as the claim of the 4th respondent that the

educational institution in question was entitled to protection of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_6">Article 30</a> of

the Constitution, it was held that;
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      "During the hearing, it became convinced that the school has
      minority right as it being administered by a community having
      minority status and that administration alone is sufficient for
      getting minority right vide Section 2(5) of K.E.Act".</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">      6.    After holding the school to be a minority institution, the

appointment of the 5th respondent was upheld in the following terms.

</p><p id="p_11">            Government have examined the case in detail with
     reference to the rules and orders in force and the decision of
     the Supreme Court in various cases. Under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_7">Article 30(1)</a> of the
     Constitution of India and based on various Supreme Court
     Orders on minority status of the Educational Institutions
     Government find that Vimala Hridaya HS, Virali is a minority
     institution. But the <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_8">article 30(1)</a> of the constitution does not
     extend to appointing a person who is not qualified.
     Sr.Philomina was not qualified at the time of her appoint but
     there was a senior hand, Smt.Nesammal who was fully
     qualified as on 01/04/2001. She had rightful claim as on that
     date. She had not relinquished the right explicitly.      But the
     petitioner was not qualified on the date of occurrence of
     vacancy and hence she has no superior claim over the present
     incumbent, though she got qualified a little earlier than the
     present incumbent, subsequently. As the minority institution
     had no right to post an unqualified person the only qualified
     person at that time had the right to be appointed though she
     did not stake the claim in the last 6 years. On the date of
     appointment, Sr.Philomina was not qualified and there was a
     qualified senior. So her appointment as teacher was not in
     order. Smt.Nesammal ought to have been appointed. But on
     her part she never staked claim or challenged the posting of

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       :5 :</span>



      Sr.Philomina. The original petitioner is equally unqualified on
      the date of occurrence of vacancy. The only claim she can
      make is about the delay in posting of an HM                  by the
      management and that it is not justifiable as she was in the
      zone of consideration, a little before. But as Mrs.Nesammal is
      senior to her, she can't claim any right to question the delay.

</p><p id="p_12">             In the light of the above facts and circumstances,
      Government are pleased to direct the Manager, Vimalahridaya
      H.S., Virali to ascertain the willingness of Smt.Nesammal to be
      posted as H.M, in writing within 15 days after issuing notice
      and to appoint her as H.M with retrospective effect from
      01/04/2001, after reverting the present H.M, Sr.Philomina, if
      the former does not relinquish her claim for the post of HM
      Government also order that Sr.Philomina will continue as HM,
      if Smt.Nesammal relinquishes her claim, as contemplated in
      the KER.                                  (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_13">      7.     It is challenging Ext.P6, P7 and P9 and to declare that the

petitioner is entitled to be appointed           as teacher in charge w.e.f.

01.04.2001 and as Headmistress w.e.f. 15/7/2001, on her completing 12

years of service that this writ petition is filed. Directions are also sought for

to declare that the word "or administered" contained in Section 2(5) of the

K.E Act is ultra vires of <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_9">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution of India and to

declare that the 5th respondent is not entitled to get minority protection. It

should be noted here that arguments were not addressed on the vires of

Section 2(5) of the K.E.Act.

executed by the 6th respondent as provided in the note to Rule 44 of

Chapter XIV A KER. The contentions raised by the petitioner are two fold.

One is that in Ext.P8 judgment, this Court has already held that unless the

school is established and administered by a minority community, the

school is not entitled to protection of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_10">Article 30</a> of the Constitution. It is

argued that despite this binding direction, only on the basis that under

Section 2(5) of the Kerala Education Act, a school administered by a

minority community is entitled to the protection of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_11">Article 30</a> of the

Constitution, the 1st respondent illegally took the view that the school is

entitled to minority status.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      9.    In so far as the petitioner's claim for appointment as teacher

in charge and as Headmistress is concerned, it is contended that in Ext.P8

judgment, following the Full Bench judgment in <a href="/doc/553505/" id="a_12">Padmanabhan Nair v.

Dy.Director</a> (1991(1) KLT 337), this            Court has already held that

admittedly, the 5th respondent herein became qualified only in 2005 and

therefore the rival claimants are the petitioner and the 6th respondent

herein. It is stated that the 6th respondent has relinquished her claim for

appointment as per Ext.P13 and if that be so, petitioner is the only rightful

claimant, who alone could have been appointed as the teacher in charge

and as Headmistress on her becoming qualified. It is therefore contended

that the conclusion to the contrary in Ext.P9 is illegal.</p><pre id="pre_2">

        10.   On   the   other   hand,    the   learned    Senior   Counsel

</pre><p id="p_16">Sri.Gopakumaran Nair, who argued for respondents 4 to 6 contended that

the school is entitled to minority status. Referring to the counter affidavit

filed, it was contended that the school was established by a member of the

same minority community by name late Tapasimuthu Nadar and was

thereafter taken over by the 4th respondent. According to them, the school

having been established by a member of the minority community and is

still administered by another member of the same community, is entitled

to minority status and protection of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_13">Article 30</a> of the Constitution. It was

also submitted that the National Commission for Minority Educational

Institutions have by order dated 21/4/2008 declared that the school is a

minority educational institution. On this basis, it was contended that the

school being a minority educational institution, it is entitled to have a

choice of its own, in the matter of appointment of Headmistress of the

school and that the said right of theirs has been confirmed by the Apex

Court and also this court in the various judgments. Counsel relied on the

judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/1528765/" id="a_14">Annie Francis v. D.E.O, Aluva</a> (2005(3) KLT

</p><p id="p_17">238) and the Apex court in <a href="/doc/81469/" id="a_15">Secy.Malankara Syrian Catholic College

v. T.Jose</a> {(2007) 1 SCC 368)} and <a href="/doc/146760/" id="a_16">Ammad v. Emjay High School</a>

(1998(2) KLT 828).

<p id="p_18">WPC 28358/07

</p><p id="p_19">      11.   According to the learned counsel since both the petitioner and

the 5th respondent were unqualified as on the date of occurrence of

vacancy, the eligibility of the 5th respondent who has since been appointed

need be assessed only as on the date of appointment. It was stated that

the 5th respondent was appointed on 7/6/05 and that as on that date, she

was fully qualified in terms of Rule 44A of Chapter XIV A KER.

</p><p id="p_20">      12.   Thus what arises for consideration is the correctness of the

finding of the 1st respondent on the minority status of the school and also

the correctness of the claim of the petitioner to be appointed as

Headmistress of the school in the vacancy that arose on 01/04/2001 to

which the 5th respondent has been appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      13.   In so far as the minority status of the school in question is

concerned, <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_17">Article 30</a> of the Constitution provides that all minorities,

whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and

administer educational institution of their choice. Section 2(5) of the Kerala

Education Act defines minority schools, as schools established and

administered or administered by such minorities as have the right to do so

under Clause 1 of <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_18">Article 30</a> of the Constitution. What is important to be

noticed is that while the right under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_19">Article 30</a> is available only to

minorities, who have established and administered educational institutions,

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                       :9 :</span>



the definition in Section 2(5) applies to educational institutions established

and administered or administered by minorities. These provisions came up

for the interpretation of this Court in <a href="/doc/1680750/" id="a_20">Rev.K.C.Seth v. State of Kerala</a>

(1991(2) KLT 662), where in para 7, this Court has held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">              In view of the above, the institution in question cannot be
       considered as one established by the 2nd and 3rd respondent even
       though it is administered by them. If that be so, the institution
       cannot be treated as a minority school entitled to the protection
       of <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_21">Article 30(1)</a> of the Constitution of India notwithstanding the
       vide definition of minority school contained in S.2(5) of the Kerala
       Education Act. Therefore, Rule 44 Chapter XIV (A) of the Kerala
       Education Rules has to be strictly applied in the matter of
       appointment of Headmaster. Hence, the petitioner being senior
       to the 4th respondent, is entitled to be promoted to the post of
       Headmaster which fell vacant on 31/3/1989 in preference to the
       4th respondent in O.P.No.9158 of 1989.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22"> It is also be noticed that in that case there was no challenge to the vires

of Section 2(5) of the K.E. Act and therefore this Court held that the

section should be read down as conferring minority status only to schools

established and administered by minorities.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       14.    In so far as this case is concerned, this issue was raised in WP

(C) No. 30984/05 and was considered in Ext.P8 judgment. After noticing

the judgment in the case of Rev.K.C.Seth, taking note of the contention

of the management that the school was established by a member of the

religious minority of Nadar Christian Community and after referring to the

Apex Court judgment in Manager, St.Thomas U.P. v. Comissioner

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      :10 :</span>



(2002(2) SCC 497), this Court held that it was necessary that the matter

shall be reconsidered by the Government. Accordingly, the issue regarding

minority status was directed to be reconsidered by the Government.

However, a reading of Ext.P9 Government order shows that the

Government upheld the claim of the 4th respondent for minority status only

on the ground that the school is administered by a community having

minority status and that administration alone is sufficient for getting

minority right vide Section 2(5) of the K.E.Act.
</p>
<p id="p_24">      15.    In my view, Government ought to have examined the question

in the light of the judgment of this Court in Rev.K.C.Seth's case where it

has been held that administration alone will not confer minority status and

that establishment of the educational institution is also necessary. Section

2(5) of the K.E.Act also has been read down, consistent with <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_22">Article 30</a> of

the Constitution. The judgment in Rev.K.C.Seth's case shows that it has

been specifically held that the words "established and administered" have

been used conjunctively and not disjunctively. If that be so, satisfaction of

both these conditions are necessary. However, this aspect has not been

considered by the Government in Ext.P9 and therefore the finding that the

school is entitled to minority status cannot be approved.

</p><p id="p_25">      16.    True, relying on Exts. P10 to P12, counsel for the petitioner

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                    :11 :</span>



was arguing that Nadar Christian community, a member of which is stated

to have established the school in question, is not a minority community. I

am not persuaded to accept the contention of the learned counsel that

the above documents suggest such a conclusion.          A reading of these

documents show that all that has been held in Exts. P10, P11 and P12 is

that minority status cannot be granted to the school in question for the

reason that there was nothing to prove that the school was established by

a member of the minority community. Therefore, these orders do not

conclude the issue that the Nadar Christian Community is not a minority

community. In this context, it is also stated that along with IA 14400/08,

respondents have produced copy of order No.F.No.429 of 2007/27218

dated April 21, 2008 of the National Commission for Minority Educational

Institutions, signed by its Secretary, declaring the school to be a minority

educational institution covered by <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_23">Article 30</a> of the Constitution of India.

Though, the finding in this behalf contained in Ext.P9 cannot be sustained,

so long as the aforesaid order dated April 21, 2008 stands, any further

dispute is purely academic.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      17.    Now what remains is the claim of the petitioner for

appointment as Teacher in charge and as Headmistress. This contention

has to be appreciated in the background of Ext.P8 judgment, where it was

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                    :12 :</span>



held by this Court that when the vacancy arose, it was open to the

minority institution to appoint a Headmistress from among the qualified

persons, irrespective of their seniority.   It was also held that the 5th

respondent had become qualified only in the year 2005 and that the claim

of the 6th respondent herein will have to be taken note of.

</p><p id="p_27">      18.    As far as the rule that governs appointment of Headmistress

of the school in question is concerned, it is Rule 44(A) of Chapter XIV A

KER. The vacancy arose on 01/04/2001 and admittedly both the petitioner

and the 5th respondent were not qualified as on that date. It was in these

circumstances, that the 5th respondent was appointed as Teacher in

charge.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      19.    Petitioner contends that in the absence of a qualified person

to be appointed as Headmistress, in terms of Rule 45, Chapter XIV A KER,

the senior most teacher should have been appointed as the teacher in

charge and that in terms of Rule 45(c)(2) such temporary promotee shall

be replaced as     soon as possible by the member of the service who

becomes entitled for promotion under the Rules. It is stated that being

the senior most, the petitioner should have been temporarily promoted

and that, on her becoming qualified by completing 12 years of service on

15/7/2001,     she    should   have     been    regularly  appointed    as

the Headmistress. Although she has no dispute about the superior claim of

the 6th respondent, petitioner bases her claim on Ext.P13, the

relinquishment given by the 6th respondent w.e.f. 01/04/2001. It is stated

that this Court has already held that the 5th respondent was ineligible to be

considered, referring to the Full Bench judgment in <a href="/doc/553505/" id="a_24">Padmanabhan Nair

v. Dy.Director</a> (1991(1) KLT 337) and that therefore, the rival

claimants are only the petitioner and the 6th respondent. According to her,

since the 6th respondent has relinquished her claim by Ext.P13, the only

eligible person is the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner also relied on

the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/391237/" id="a_25">Prasad v. Philipose Mar Dilshus

U.P.School</a> (2005(3) KLT 487) contended that even if it is argued that

the school in question is a minority educational institution having the right

to choose the suitable person to be appointed as Headmistress, such right

of choice is confined to persons having the qualifications prescribed under

the statute. It was contended that in view of Ext.P13 relinquishment, she

being the only qualified person, should have been appointed as the

teacher in charge and as Headmistress.
</p>
<p id="p_29">       20.   This contention of the counsel for the petitioner is

contradicted by the counsel for the respondents 4 to 6 by arguing that as

on the date of occurrence of vacancy both were unqualified. It is stated

that if that be so, since the school has right of choice, irrespective of

seniority, to appoint a suitable person as its Headmistress, it is immaterial

that the petitioner got qualified first. According to them, as on the date of

appointment, the 5th respondent was qualified and if that be so, the

appointment is valid and proper.
</p>
<p id="p_30">       21.   I have considered the respective contentions.       In the Full

Bench judgment in <a href="/doc/553505/" id="a_26">Padmanabhan Nair v. Dy.Director</a> (1991(1) KLT

</p><p id="p_31">337), this Court referring to the Full Bench judgments in <a href="/doc/1556021/" id="a_27">James Thomas

and others v. Chief Justice, High</a> Court of Kerala and others (1977

KLT 622) and <a href="/doc/644492/" id="a_28">Varghese and others v. State of Kerala and others</a>

(1981 KLT 458) held that for promotion, eligibility has to be reckoned

with reference to the date of occurrence of vacancy and that if there was a

vacancy and none is available to be promoted, when a person became

qualified for being promoted to such vacancy, he would be entitled to be

considered for promotion in that vacancy. Proceeding further, it was held

in that case that as there was a vacancy available and on the teacher

becoming qualified, he should have been appointed to that vacancy in

terms of the provisions contained in the KER. This judgment has been

referred to in Ext.P8 judgment and it is on that basis it has been held that

the 5th respondent having become qualified only in 2005, the claim of the

petitioner and 6th respondent alone is to be considered.

</p><p id="p_32">      22.   What is to be now examined is the contention of the counsel

for respondents 4 to 6 that being a minority educational institution, they

have the freedom to choose a person of their choice to occupy the post of

Headmistress. The right of minority communities to choose a person,

whom they consider fit to be appointed as Headmaster has been

recognised by the Apex Court and also this Court in various judgments.

The Apex Court judgments in this context are <a href="/doc/146760/" id="a_29">Ammad v. Emjay High

School</a> (1998(2) KLT 828) and <a href="/doc/81469/" id="a_30">Secy.Malankara Syrian Catholic

College v. T.Jose and others</a> (2007(1) SCC 386). In so far as some of

the judgments rendered by this court are concerned, they are <a href="/doc/1528765/" id="a_31">Annie

Francis v. D.E.O. Aluva</a> (2005(3) KLT 238) and <a href="/doc/391237/" id="a_32">Prasad v. Philipose

Mar Dilshus U.P.School</a> (2005 (3) KLT 487).              A reading of these

judgments would show that the legal position is settled that the minority

communities have the right to choose a person whom they consider most

suitable to occupy the post of Headmaster either from among the teachers

working in the school or from outside, and that such choice should be from

among those who are qualified to hold the post.
</p>
<p id="p_33">      23.   If that is the position, following the judgment of the Full Bench

in <a href="/doc/553505/" id="a_33">Padmanabhan Nair v. Dy.Director</a> (1991(1) KLT 337), which is

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    :16 :</span>



followed in Ext.P8 judgment also, the date which is relevant for reckoning

the eligibility of teachers to be considered for the post of Headmaster is

the date of occurrence of vacancy viz., 01/04/2001.       As on that date,

though the 6th respondent was qualified, both the petitioner and the 5th

respondent were unqualified.       Though the management could have

resorted to direct recruitment, that was not done. Instead they made

temporary arrangement. In such a situation, Rule 45(c), which provides

that the person so appointed will be replaced by the first person who

becomes qualified to be appointed as Headmistress assumes importance.

In this case, the first person who thus became qualified as Headmistress

subsequent to 01/04/2001, is the petitioner, on completion of 12 years

graduate service on 15/7/2001.
</p>
<p id="p_34">       24.    In so far as the 5th respondent is concerned, as already

noticed, she became qualified for the post of Headmaster only on

7.6.2005. It was taking into account this fact and following the Full Bench

judgment in Padmanabhan Nair's case (supra), that in Ext. P8 it was

held that if the 6th respondent is found to be not entitled to be appointed

as Headmistress, then certainly it was the petitioner herein who would be

eligible, as admittedly the 5th respondent herein (who was 4th respondent

in Ext. P8), got qualified only in the year 2005. Against this judgment

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                     :17 :</span>



though W.A. No. 2387/06 was filed, that was dismissed as withdrawn and

thus this judgment has attained finality. If that be so, the 5th respondent

can no longer aspire to be appointed as Headmistress in the vacancy that

arose on 1.4.2001.      Resultantly those who remain in the fray are the

petitioner and the 6th respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      25.    The 6th respondent's superior eligibility to be appointed as

Headmistress of the school is not in dispute.     Even as on 1.4.2001, she

was qualified, but however, following Ext. P9, the impugned order that

was passed by the 1st respondent, the 6th respondent executed Ext. P13

dated 20.8.2007 relinquishing her claim to be appointed as Headmistress

with effect from 1.4.2001.         Petitioner contends that since the 5th

respondent has already been held to be ineligible in Ext. P8 judgment and

as the 6th respondent has relinquished her claim to be appointed as

Headmistress by virtue of Ext. P13, she is the only remaining candidate

and therefore the management had no option, but to appoint her as

Headmistress.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      26.    It is true that in view of Ext. P8 judgment, I must accept the

contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the rival claimants

are only the petitioner and the 6th respondent.    However, the case of the

petitioner is that the 6th respondent has relinquished her claim by Ext. P13

WPC 28358/07
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                    :18 :</span>



and therefore, that relinquishment remains operative and the post is to be

filled up by appointing the petitioner. Incidentally the correctness of this

submission also needs to be examined.
</p>
<p id="p_37">       27.   Relinquishment of promotion by a senior teacher is executed

in terms of the provisions contained in Rule 44 of Chapter XIVA, K.E.R.

The Note to Rule 44 reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "Whenever the Manager intends to appoint a person as
       Headmaster other than the senior claimant, the Manager shall
       obtain a written consent from such senior claimant renouncing
       his claim permanently. Such consent shall have the approval of
       the Educational Officer concerned".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_38">From the scheme of the provisions contained in Chapter XIVA, KER, it is

evident that except in the case of minority schools the senior most

qualified teacher is entitled to be appointed as Headmaster.     Whenever

the Manager intends to appoint a person other than the senior claimant as

Headmaster, the Manager shall obtain a written consent from such senior

claimant renouncing his claim permanently. This Note has come up for

consideration of this Court on several occasions. It has been held that the

permanency attached to the relinquishment only operates as against the

vacancy which is intended to be filled up and that a senior claimant who

has executed the relinquishment cannot be overlooked permanently unless

fresh relinquishment is executed on each of the occassions when vacancies

are sought to be filled up.
</p>
<p id="p_39">      28.    Before I proceed further to examine the effect of Ext.P13

relinquishment executed by the 6th respondent, the background in which

the relinquishment was executed, needs to be considered.                 This

necessarily calls for an examination of Ext.P9 and at the cost of repetition,

I extract the operative portion of the said order.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "In the light of the above facts and circumstances,
      Government are pleased to direct the Manager, Vimalahridaya
      H.S., Virali to ascertain the willingness of Smt.Nesammal to be
      posted as H.M, in writing within 15 days after issuing notice
      and to appoint her as H.M with retrospective effect from
      01/04/2001, after reverting the present H.M, Sr.Philomina, if
      the former does not relinquish her claim for the post of HM
      Government also order that Sr.Philomina will continue as HM,

<p id="p_40">By this order, the Government have accepted that the rightful claimant is

the 6th respondent and that in the event of her relinquishing her claim, the

5th respondent could continue as Headmistress. Therefore, unless the 6th

respondent, the senior claimant executed the relinquishment, it was not

possible for the management to continue the 5th respondent as

Headmistress.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      29.    If Ext.P13 is examined bearing in mind the above stated facts

which transpired during that time, the conclusion is irresistible that the 6th

respondent has executed Ext.P13 only to facilitate the 5th respondent's

continuance as Headmistress of the school.       On the other hand, if the

proposal of the management was to fill up the post by appointing the

petitioner, different considerations may have prevailed upon the 6th

respondent and it is not known whether she would have relinquished her

claim in such a situation. Therefore, once I hold that in view of Ext.P8

judgment, which has become final, the 5th respondent was ineligible to be

considered against the vacancy of Headmistress which arose on

01/04/2001, as a necessary consequence, I must also hold that the

direction to obtain relinquishment of the 6th respondent to facilitate the

continuance for the 5th respondent as Headmistress is also ineffective.

Otherwise, the result will be that the 6th respondent will be loosing her

recognized claim to be appointed as Headmistress of the school and the

petitioner will be getting an unmerited windfall over the 6th respondent. In

my view, once Ext.P9 upholding eligibility of the 5th respondent is held to

be illegal, Ext.P13 relinquishment should also cease to be effective.

</p><p id="p_42">       30.   There is yet another way of looking at the problem. Question

of relinquishment by a senior claimant is provided in the note attached to

Rule 44, Chapter XIV A KER. Rule 44(1) provides that the appointment of

Headmasters shall ordinarily be according to seniority as per the seniority

list prepared and maintained.      Now that the National Commission for

Minority Educational Institutions vide its order dated April 21, 2008

declared the school to be a minority educational institution, covered under

<a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_34">Article 30</a> of the Constitution of India, it is entitled to all rights that are

recognized in favour of the minority educational institutions. As held by the

Apex Court in Ammad's case (1998(2) KLT 828), when the school is

declared as a minority educational institution, it is only the recognition of a

factual position and the declaration is only an open acceptance of a legal

character. Therefore, though declaration has been made only by order

dated April 21, 2008, it being only the recognition of an existing factual

position, the school had the minority status even as on the date of

occurrence of vacancy.
</p>
<p id="p_43">       31.   It is the settled legal position that minority educational

institutions are entitled to choose any qualified person whom it considers

most suitable for appointment as Headmaster and that seniority

contemplated in Rule 44 does not operate against a minority educational

institution to insist that the senior most teacher should be appointed as

Headmaster. The necessity of relinquishment as provided in the note to

Rule 44 arises only when the Manager proposes to fill up the post of

Headmaster by a person other than the senior claimant. Necessarily the

senior has to relinquish the claim only if he has an enforceable legal right

WPC 28358/07

to be appointed as Headmaster in terms of Rule 44 of Chapter XIV A KER

and the Manager has a corresponding duty to appoint a senior teacher.

Since minority institutions have the freedom to make appointment

irrespective of the seniority of the teachers, a senior teacher in a minority

school cannot claim any enforceable right to be appointed as Headmaster.

In the absence of such a right, there is no necessity for the Manager to

obtain relinquishment from the senior teacher to enable the Manager to fill

up the post of Headmaster by appointing a junior qualified teacher.

</p><p id="p_44">      32.    Viewed in that manner, the school being a minority

educational institution, there was no necessity for the Manager to have

obtained Ext.P13 relinquishment from the 6th respondent for appointing a

teacher junior to the 6th respondent as Headmistress of the school. If so,

the relinquishment was unnecessary and inoperative and cannot stand in

the way of the Manager appointing the 6th respondent as Headmistress, if

she accepts the same nor can the petitioner prevent the 6th respondent

from accepting the post of Headmistress in the school.

</p><p id="p_45">      33.    For the aforesaid reasons, Ext.P9 order to the extent it

upholds the eligibility of the 5th respondent to be appointed as

Headmistress deserves to be invalidated and I do so. Having regard to the

fact that the surviving claimants are the petitioner and the 6th respondent,

I direct that the 4th respondent Manager shall reconsider the eligibility of

the petitioner and the 6th respondent to be appointed as the teacher-in-

charge and as Headmistress of the school in the vacancy that arose w.e.f.

01/04/2001.    It is clarified that if the 6th respondent is unwilling to be

appointed to the post, it shall be the petitioner who will be entitled to be
