HEADNOTE:



JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
MOHAN,	J.-  Criminal  Appeal No. 327 of  1994	is  directed
against	 the judgment and order dated 13-4-1994 of the	High
Court of Calcutta in CO No. 9121 (W) of 1993.
</p><p id="p_2">2.Criminal  Appeal No. 328 of 1994 is directed	against	 the
judgment  and  order dated 13-4-1994 of the  High  Court  of
Calcutta in CO No. 8377(W) of 1993.  Criminal Appeal No. 329
of 1994 is directed against the judgment and order dated 13-
4-1994	of the High Court of Calcutta in CO No.	 8378(W)  of
1993.
</p><p id="p_3">3.All  these cases arise out of writ petitions filed in	 the
High Court of Calcutta challenging the validity of  sanction
and  taking  cognizance	 of the cases against  each  of	 the
respondents by the Designated Court under the Terrorist	 and
Disruptive  Activities (Prevention) Act,  1987	(hereinafter
referred  to  as 'TADA).  A further challenge  in  the	writ
petition  was also made to the 'vires' of TADA.	 The  orders
of  sanction  and  taking  cognizance  were  quashed.	 The
challenge  to the Act was not gone into since the  same	 was
pending at the relevant time before this Court.
</p><p id="p_4">4.To highlight the issue involved, it is enough if we advert
to the facts in Criminal Appeal No. 328 of 1994 since CO No.
8377(W)	 of  1993,  against  which  this  appeal  has	been
preferred, is the main case.  The same decision was  applied
to  Criminal  Appeals Nos. 327 and 329 of 1994.	  The  short
facts are as under.
</p><p id="p_5">5.On  the evening of 16-3-1993, an explosion occurred at  or
near  Premises	No. 267, B.B. Ganguly Street,  Calcutta.  69
persons died, 5 of them died as a result of direct blast and
46  others were injured.  The said premises and	 some  other
buildings adjoining it collapsed and/or were badly damaged.
</p><p id="p_6">6.A  complaint	was  lodged  on	 17-3-1993  regarding	this
incident by Mr B.K. Chattopadhaya, Sub-Inspector attached to
Bowbazar  Police  Station.  This complaint  was	 treated  as
first information report.  On that basis, Case No. 84  dated
17-3-1993  was	registered  in	the  police  station   under
<a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_1">Sections   120-B</a>/<a href="/doc/1517318/" id="a_2">436</a>/<a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_3">326</a>/<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_4">307</a>/<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_5">302</a>  Indian  Penal	  Code	 and
<a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_6">Sections  3</a> and <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_7">5</a> of the Explosive Substances  Act.   Having
regard	to the gravity of the offence, the  Commissioner  of
Police,	 Calcutta  passed an order that the  case  shall  be
investigated by a team of high-ranking police officials.  In
the course of investigation witnesses were examined, various
seizures  were	made  and confessions made  by	two  of	 the
accused, namely, Pannalal Jaysoara and Mohammed Gulzar	were
recorded  by a learned Metropolitan Magistrate	on  7-4-1993
and   19-5-1993	 respectively.	 During	 investigations	  it
appeared  that materials had transpired for prosecuting	 the
accused under Sections 3 and 4
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">688</span>
of TADA.  On 3-5-1993, information to this effect was  given
to the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta.	 The
learned	 Magistrate made a record of this fact and  observed
that the investigating officer might proceed to	 investigate
offences under TADA.
</p><p id="p_7">7.Upon	completion  of investigation,  the  police  obtained
sanction  to  prosecute	 under	<a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_8">Sections  3</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_9">5</a>  of	 the
Explosive   Substances	Act  from  the	 State	 Government.
Sanction  under	 Section  20-A(2) of TADA  from	 the  Police
Commissioner  was  also	 obtained.   The  charge-sheet	 was
submitted on 14-6-1993, well within 90 days as is spoken  to
under <a href="/doc/1346692/" id="a_10">Section 167(2)(a)(i)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
(hereinafter referred to as the 'Code').
</p><p id="p_8">8.The  sanction to prosecute under <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_11">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1335368/" id="a_12">5</a>  of	 the
Explosive Substances Act and the sanction under Section	 20-
A(2)  were obtained on 11-6-1993.  While  granting  sanction
under  Section	20-A(2) of TADA it was	mentioned  that	 the
records	 were  placed before the sanctioning  authority	 for
examination and perusal.  It appeared that for the last	 5/6
years accused Pannalal Jaysoara had been manufacturing bombs
in  the	 "Khaskhas"  room on the first floor  of  267,	B.B.
Ganguly	 Street,  Calcutta as and when required	 by  accused
Mohammed  Rashid Khan, first respondent in  Criminal  Appeal
No.  328 of 1994.  Accused Jaysoara was introduced to  other
accused,  namely, Mohammed Abdul Aziz, first  respondent  in
Criminal Appeal No. 329 of 1994 and Lala alias Parwez  Khan.
Death  of  69 persons, serious injuries to  46	persons	 and
complete destruction of a two-storeyed building and  partial
collapse of other two and damage to five more buildings were
caused	by the accused by an explosion caused by  bombs	 and
huge quantities of extremely dangerous nitro-glycerine-based
explosives which experts have opined to be dangerous to life
and  property.	 The sanctioning authority  mentioned  inter
alia that the intention of the accused was to strike  terror
in  the	 people	 and/or to strike  terror  in  a  particular
section of the people and/or to adversely affect the harmony
amongst	 the Hindus and the Muslims.  It was also  mentioned
the accused had conspired and prepared to commit  disruptive
activities.    In   the	 charge-sheet  all   the   necessary
ingredients  under  Sections  3(1) and 4 of  TADA  had	been
mentioned.
</p><p id="p_9">9.The  first respondent, Mohammed Rashid Khan moved  a	writ
petition  under	 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article 226</a> of the  Constitution  of  India
making inter alia the following prayers:

	      the petitioner from custody forthwith.
</blockquote><p id="p_10">10.A declaration was also prayed for that TADA is  violative
of  the Constitution and is liable to be struck	 down.	 But
the  High Court by its impugned judgment held that TADA	 has
been wrongly applied in the case and the orders of  sanction
and further taking cognizance by the Designated Court on 14-
6-1993	was  not proper, legal and valid and  the  same	 was
quashed and set aside.
</p><p id="p_11">11.Aggrieved  by  the impugned judgment, the State  of	West
Bengal has preferred these criminal appeals.
</p><p id="p_12">12.Mr K.T.S. Tulsi, learned Additional Solicitor General  in
attacking the judgment argues as under.
</p><p id="p_13">13.The	High  Court  gravely erred in  quashing	 the  order,
taking cognizance, by entering the area which is beyond	 the
scope of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of the	Constitution
of  India.  The jurisdiction is confined to cases where	 the
allegations  before  the Designated Court  ex  facie  cannot
constitute  an	offence under TADA.  The High  Court  cannot
examine	 the merits of the allegations.	 In fact,  what	 has
been  done  by	the High Court is  a  laboured	exercise  of
scrutinising  the  material  placed  before  the  Designated
Court.	 In doing so, it entered into a debatable  area	 and
began the process of appreciation of evidence  admissibility
of confession or prejudgment on trial or determine the guilt
or innocence of the accused.  It has made an analysis of the
materials  to  determine  the  truth  or  otherwise  of	 the
allegations.   It  has conducted a virtual  pre-trial  at  a
premature stage.  On that basis, it had come to a conclusion
that  there is no evidence in support of these	allegations.
The  law  is,  the  High  Court	 must  assume  each  of	 the
allegations made in the charge-sheet to be factually correct
and examine the ingredients of the offence without adding or
subtracting anything therefrom.
</p><p id="p_14">14.In support of this submission, learned counsel relies  on
<a href="/doc/1577324/" id="a_15">State  of Maharashtra v. Abdul Hamid Haji Mohammed1</a>  wherein
this Court has held, the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> has no
jurisdiction  to  enter into a debatable  area	whether	 the
direct	accusation  made in conjunction with  the  attendant
circumstances, if proved to be true, is likely to result  in
conviction for an offence under TADA.  The moment there is a
debatable area, in the case, it is not amenable to the	writ
jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_15">15.<a href="/doc/1033637/" id="a_17">In	State  of  Haryana  v.	Bhajan	Lal2</a>  it  has	been
categorically laid down that the allegations made in the FIR
or  the complaint taken on their face value and accepted  in
its entirety constitute an offence.  The High Court

is  not justified in quashing the criminal proceedings.	  <a href="/doc/1287305/" id="a_18">In
State  of  Bihar v. P.P. Sharma3</a> this Court had	 ruled	that
writ petition should not be entertained against charge-sheet
while exercising jurisdiction.	If the matter is  considered
on  merits  in the guise of prima facie evidence,  it  would
amount to a pre-trial.	To the same effect are the following
rulings:

</blockquote><p id="p_16">16.  The  next	submission is, under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_25">Article  226</a>  the	High
Court  is not entitled to go into the validity or  otherwise
of  the order granting sanction for prosecution.  The  order
of  sanction  is required to be proved by  evidence  in	 the
course of trial.  All objections with regard to validity  or
otherwise could be raised there since witnesses are summoned
to  prove  the	order  and  they  being	 subject  to  cross-
examination.   In this case, the order of sanction,  on	 the
face  of it, shows that the sanctioning authority  had	gone
through	  all  the  reports,  the  recorded  statements	  of
witnesses,  confessions and seizure list and the opinion  of
experts.   The High Court has to accept these  averments  on
their  face  value.   The correctness or  otherwise  of	 the
statement   is	only  subject  to  proof  during  a   trial.
Therefore,  the	 High Court is wrong in holding,  there	 was
non-application	 of mind.  In the case of PP Sharma3 it	 has
been held, if all the facts of the case are not mentioned in
the  sanction order the same does not become invalid as	 the
prosecution can prove these facts in the course of trial.
</p><p id="p_17">17.  The finding of the High Court that the affidavit of  Mr
Sujit  Kumar Sanyal is not proper because he was neither  an
investigating  officer	nor  an	 informant  is	contrary  to
record.	  It  was brought to the notice of  the	 High  Court
through the affidavit of the Commissioner of Police that the
Special	 Investigation	Team had been set  up  on  18-3-1993
which  was headed by Mr Sujit Kumar Sanyal.   Unfortunately,
the  affidavit of Commissioner of Police was not taken	into
account.   Therefore, the contrary findings are wrong.	 The
High Court wrongly excluded from consideration the effect of
confession  of	the  two accused for the  reasons  that	 the
confession could not have been considered by the  Designated
Court as the same remained in sealed cover.  In this regard,
it is submitted that charge-sheet specifically refers to the
confession  recorded by the Magistrate under <a href="/doc/78014276/" id="a_26">Section 164</a>  of
the Code.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">691</span>
</p><p id="p_19">18.The	High  Court has held in the impugned  judgment	that
from  the act of preparation and storage of bombs  intention
to  commit  offences under TADA cannot be  inferred  as	 the
motive was to defend the Muslims.  This finding is  shocking
and is contrary to the well-established principles of  self-
defence.   Then again, the preparation and keeping of  bombs
are  illegal.	It tantamounts to  terrorising	the  people.
Therefore, this would be a terrorist act under <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_27">Section 3(1)</a>.
<a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_28">If  the Act</a> itself is illegal it cannot be justified on	 the
plea  of self-defence.	The question is whether a  right  of
private defence exists under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29"> Indian Penal Code</a> or any  other
law.  Further, <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_30">Section 3(3)</a> is also attracted.
</p><p id="p_20">19.This Court in <a href="/doc/1931444/" id="a_31">Yogendra Morarji v. State of Gujarat7</a>	(SCC
p.  234, para 30) has dealt with the right of  self-defence.
The right of self-defence commences not before a  reasonable
apprehension arises in the mind of the accused.
</p><p id="p_21">20.The finding of the High Court that there are no materials
in  support of allegation of conspiracy under Section.	3(3)
proceeds on misappreciation of the material and is  contrary
to  the averments contained in the chargesheet.	 It  is	 not
necessary  to  bring  home  the	 charge	 of  conspiracy	  to
establish  the time and the place of conspiracy or even	 the
actual words of communication.	It is not necessary to prove
who  entered into conspiracy and the nature  of	 conspiracy.
The existence of conspiracy can be inferred from the conduct
of  the	 various  accused prior to  and	 subsequent  to	 the
conspiracy.   Existence of explosive materials is enough  to
prove the conspiracy when there was preparation for a  large
number of bombs.  In support of this submission, reliance is
placed on <a href="/doc/928322/" id="a_32">Ajay Aggarwal v. Union of India8</a>, dealing with the
law  relating to conspiracy.  On the basis of this  citation
it is submitted, even if the explosion has not taken  place,
the very possession of bomb would amount to conspiracy.
</p><p id="p_22">21.Then	 again,	 the High Court has clearly  gone  wrong  in
holding	 that  there must be a	breakdown  of  law-enforcing
machinery.    That  would  be  a  condition  precedent	 for
prosecuting  the  accused  for offences	 under	TADA.	This
finding is contrary to the decision of this Court in  <a href="/doc/1813801/" id="a_33">Kartar
Singh  v. State of Punjab9</a>.  In that ruling the	 legislative
intention to bring TADA has been clearly spelt out.  In para
145 at p. 653, of the ruling what has been observed is	that
the  ordinary procedural law was found to be  inadequate  by
the Legislature and, therefore, the object of Legislature in
bringing  in  TADA may not be defeated	or  nullified.	 The
interpretation of the High Court, if adopted, would  clearly
make  the  TADA unworkable.  Sections 3 and 4  of  TADA	 are
intended for the whole of India.  It has nothing to do	with
the breakdown of law-enforcing machinery.
</p><p id="p_23">22.The	High Court had gone on a totally  incorrect  premise
when  it quashed the order taking cognizance on	 the  ground
that it is not a reasoned
7 (1980) 2 SCC 218 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 394
8(1993) 3 SCC 609, 617 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 961

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">692</span>
order.	 It  is submitted that no reasons  need	 be  stated.
Therefore,  this  approach  of the  High  Court	 is  clearly
contrary to the following rulings of this Court:

</blockquote><p id="p_24">23.  Equally, the High Court erred in holding that the Court

submissions, it is urged that the judgment of the High Court
is perverse and is liable to be set aside.
</p><p id="p_25">24.Mr  U.R. Lalit, learned Senior Counsel appearing for	 the
appellants submits that a charge-sheet in criminal law is  a
mere   narration.   It	is  a  manifestation   of   evidence

restricted way, as has been done by the High Court.  In this
case the High Court has grievously erred.

automatic.   In	 fact,	in  <a href="/doc/1300233/" id="a_40">A.C.  Aggarwal,   Sub-Divisional

it means, must take cognizance and that it has no discretion

cognizance under <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_42">Section 193</a>.
</p><p id="p_27">26.  Mr Ram Jethmalani, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on
behalf	of  the	 respondents submits that a  report  of	 the
police	 constitutes  the  facts  found	 as  a	 result	  of

called upon to take action.  The report in the	accompanying
documents  -though complementary must be  held	distinctive.
In  law, the report should contain the minimum.	 Should	 the
report	fail to bring out the ingredients of an offence	 the
same  cannot be supplemented by other materials.  Thus,	 the
submission  is,	 the  report is relevant for  the  issue  of

automatically.	 The  specific	case  of  these	 respondents
before the High Court was, there was no such sanction.	 The

</p><p id="p_52">40.  Section  20-A of TADA with regard to taking  cognizance
of  offence postulates under sub-section (2), that no  court
can  take cognizance of any offence under this	Act  without
the previous sanction of the Inspector General of Police, or
as the case may be, the Commissioner of Police.
</p><p id="p_53">41.  Such a provision relating to sanction is not new  under
criminal  jurisprudence.  <a href="/doc/1874283/" id="a_72">Section 132</a> of the  Code  provides
for  sanction.	This section is a bar to the prosecution  of
police officers under <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_73">Sections 129</a>, <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_74">130</a> or 131.	 The  object
is  to	protect	 responsible  public  servants	against	 the
institution  of	 possible vexatious and mala  fide  criminal
proceedings  for  offences alleged to be committed  by	them
while  they  are acting or purported to act as such  in	 the
discharge of their official duty.
</p><p id="p_54">42.  <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_75">Section 197</a> contains a similar sanction.  The object of
the section is to provide for two things, namely,
	      (1)   to	protect government servants  against
	      institution of vexatious proceedings, and
	      (2)   to secure the well-considered opinion of
	      a	 superior authority before a prosecution  is
	      lodged against them.
</p><p id="p_55">Similar	 provisions  are  found	 in  other  enactments,	 for
example, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_76">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1947.
</p><p id="p_56">43.  Similarly, when Section 20-A(2) of TADA makes  sanction
necessary  for	taking cognizance - it is  only	 to  prevent
abuse of power by authorities concerned.  It requires to  be
noted  that  this  provision  of <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_77">Section  20-A</a>	came  to  be
inserted by Act 43 of 1993.  Then, the question is as to the
meaning of taking cognizance.  <a href="/doc/276703/" id="a_78">Section 190</a> of the Code talks
of  cognizance of offences by Magistrates.  This  expression
has not been defined in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_79"> the Code</a>.  In its broad and  literal
sense,	it  means taking notice of an offence.	 This  would
include	 the  intention of initiating  judicial	 proceedings
against	 the offender in respect of that offence  or  taking
steps  to  see	whether there is any  basis  for  initiating
judicial  proceedings  or  for	other  purposes.   The	word
'cognizance'  indicates	 the point when a  Magistrate  or  a
Judge  first  takes judicial notice of an  offence.   It  is
entirely  a different thing from initiation of	proceedings;
rather	it is the condition precedent to the  initiation  of
proceedings  by the Magistrate or the Judge.  Cognizance  is
taken of cases and not of persons.
</p><p id="p_57">44.Cognizance is defined in Wharton's Law Lexicon 14th Edn.,
at page 209.  It reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">	      "Cognizance (Judicial), knowledge upon which a
	      judge is bound to act without having it proved
	      in  evidence:  as the public statutes  of	 the
	      realm,  the ancient history of the realm,	 the
	      order and course of proceedings in Parliament,
	      the  privileges of the House of  Commons,	 the
	      existence	 of  war with a foreign	 State,	 the
	      several  seals of the King, the Supreme  Court
	      and  its jurisdiction, and many other  things.
	      A	 judge	is not bound to take  cognizance  of
	      current events, however notorious, nor of	 the
	      law of other countries."

	      justified in invoking the power under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_86">Article
	      226</a> of the Constitution on the ground that the
	      detention	 of  the accused is  not  under	 the

	      that  this  can happen only in  extreme  cases

	      attendant circumstances, if proved to be true,
	      is  likely  to  result in	 conviction  for  an
	      offence under TADA Act.  The moment there is a

quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised sparingly
and with circumspection and, that too, in the rarest of rare
cases;	that  the Court will not be justified  in  embarking
upon  an  inquiry as to the reliability	 or  genuineness  or
otherwise  of the allegations made in the first	 information
report or the complaint.  It was further held that where the
allegations  made  in the first information  report  or	 the
complaint,  even if they are taken at their face  value	 and
accepted in the entirety, do not prima facie constitute	 any
offence	 or make out a case against the accused, then  alone
the proceeding could be quashed.

as all knew the consequences.
</p><p id="p_71">2.   The said Mohd.  Rashid Khan had his office in  Premises

required  by Accused 1 Md.  Rashid Khan, the  Satta  Bookie.
Kalloo	@ Sarafaraz Khan, a henchman of Accused 1 picked  up
Accused	 3 Pannalal Jaysoara first for preparing  bombs	 for
their  group  and through accused Kalloo @  Sarafaraz  Khan,
Accused 3 Pannalal Jaysoara was introduced to Accused 1	 Md.
Rashid	Khan, Accused 2 Abdul Aziz, Accused 7 Lala @  Parwez
Khan,  accused Zakrin and Accused 8 Parvez Imtiaz Khan.	  It
also  transpired that accused Pannalal used to take cash  Rs
100 regularly every week either from accused Rashid Khan  or
from  accused Kalloo @ Sarafaraz Khan.	Accused	 3  Pannalal
used  to receive the said money from the office	 of  accused
Rashid Khan at 266, B.B. Ganguly Street.
</p><p id="p_74">5.   This bomb-manufacturing matter was supervised mainly by

</p><p id="p_76">6.   After  the communal riot in recent past between  Hindus
and  Muslims  in Bombay, Accused 1 Md.	Rashid	Khan  became
very  worried for the Muslims because, according to  him,  a
large  number  of  Muslims  died at  Bombay  and  the  local
Government   did   nothing  for	 their	community   and	  he
apprehended that such sort of communal riot might take place
in  Calcutta  and Government may not stand by  the  side  of
Muslims as in Bombay as a result many Muslims would die.  As
such accused Md.  Rashid Khan hatched a conspiracy with	 his
henchmen viz. accused Kalloo, Lala, Zakrin, Khalid, Murtaza,
Aziz,  Gulzar  etc. to procure huge  quantity  of  explosive
materials for preparing large number of bombs with a view to
kill  the  Hindus in Calcutta by using those  bombs  through
Muslim brothers. (emphasis supplied)
</p><p id="p_77">7. Pursuant to that conspiracy Accused 5 was entrusted	with
the  task  of  procuring  explosive  materials.	  For  this,
Accused 1, Rashid Khan, paid money to Accused 5 Md.   Khalid
through	 accused  Kalloo.   Within a  few  days,  Accused  5
Khalid,	 with  the  help  of  accused  Hassu  procured	huge
quantities  of explosive materials and brought those to	 the
first  floor of 267, B.B. Ganguly Street, in two  drums	 and
two  bags and kept the same there with the help	 of  accused
Murtaza, Gulzar, Tenia and Ukil.  Again on 16-3-1993 accused
Md.  Khalid and accused Hassu brought explosive materials in
two bags and with accused Gulzar and Mustafa @ Murtaza	came
near  the Satta Gali at about 20/20.30 hrs.  There with	 the
help of accused Tenia, Ukil and Khurshid brought those	bags
inside	the  Khaskhas  Godown on first floor  of  267,	B.B.
Ganguly Street through Satta Gali.  At that time there	were
some  other  persons  present in Satta Gali  who  saw  this.
Thereafter  accused Murtaza, Khalid and Hassu  and  Khurshid
kept  two drums and four bags together and placed a  plastic
sheet.	 Accused  Khalid  and Hassu opened  those  bags	 and
brought	  out  explosive  materials  and  some	 small	 tin
containers.   Then accused Tenia, Ukil, Hassu  and  Khurshid
started mixing the explosive materials while accused Gulzar,
Khalid and Murtaza started straining the materials.  Accused
Gulzar	tried to open the lid of a drum but he was asked  by
accused Khalid and accused Murtaza not to do so.  As such he
did not open the lid of the drum.  Soon after accused  Nisar
Gulzar,	 Khalid and Murtaza were straining  those  explosive
materials.  Accused Lala, Kalloo and Imtiaz came inside	 the
first floor of 267, B.B. Ganguly Street and supervised	this
manufacturing  process.	  Owner	 of  Khaskhas  Godown,	E.M.
Naushad	 and his men were present inside the first floor  of
the  said  building i.e. inside	 his  godown-cum-residential
place  at  that time.  At about 21.00/21.30  hours  of	that
night, an electrician of that locality who used to sleep  in
the  night  inside the Khaskhas Godown regularly  also	came
there  but  being  rebuked by accused Murtaza  he  left	 the
Khaskhas Godown.  Some other people who used to stay  during
night  were also present inside the Khaskhas Godown on	that
night.
</p><p id="p_78">8.   Thereafter	 at  intervals accused	Gulzar	and  accused
Khalid	left  that house for their  destinations.   All	 the
street lights and lights inside Satta Gali and lights on the
first floor of 267, B.B. Ganguly Street and its surrounding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">703</span>
areas were burning.  A few persons were present inside Satta
Gali  then.  On the same morning, i.e.,	 16-3-1993,  accused
Kalloo	with  accused Imtiaz went to the  place	 of  accused
Pannalal  Jaysoara and asked him to come to their  place  at
Bowbazar  Street for preparing bombs.  At about	 22.00/22.30
hours,	on that day, accused Pannalal came to the office  of
accused Md.  Rashid Khan at 266, B.B. Ganguly Street.  There
he met accused Aziz, Rashid, Lala and Zakrin who took him to
the "Khaskhas Godown-cum-Factory" located on the first floor
of 267, B.B. Ganguly Street through Satta Gali where accused
Murtaza,  Tenia, Nisar, Ukil, Hassu and Khurshid were  found
preparing  bombs and there was huge quantity of the  mixture
of  explosive  materials over a plastic sheet on  the  first
floor of 267, B.B. Ganguly Street besides a number of  empty
small tin containers.
</p><p id="p_79">9.   At	 about	23.00/23.30  hours  on	16-3-1993,   accused
Pannalal,  after  preparing a few bombs came down  and	went
out, being followed by a witness.  Accused Zakrin was  found
standing near the Satta Gali and accused Md. Rashid Khan was
then  talking with two persons of Haberly Lane, standing  on
the pavement in front of 266, B.B. Ganguly Street.  At	that
time, accused Pannalal went to accused Rashid Khan and	told
him  that it would take long time, even up to the  next	 day
evening,  to prepare bombs - with all such huge quantity  of
explosive materials and asked accused Rashid Khan as to	 the
necessity of preparing such large number of bombs.   Accused
Rashid Khan answered him in presence of those two persons as
to  why	 large number of bombs were necessary  referring  to
recent past Bombay Riot.
</p><p id="p_80">10.  Then  Accused 1 Mohammed Rashid Khan asked	 Accused  3,

thereafter  went  towards his hotel "Shahi  Darbar".   After
departure  of accused Rashid Khan, Accused 3  Pannalal	also
left that place for his residence.

	      returned to the prosecution for making copies,
	      the  said fact should have also been  recorded

	      cognizance and the writ court should not enter
	      into the aforesaid controversy.
	      It  has,	therefore, been suggested  that	 the

</blockquote><p id="p_91">From  the above analysis of the judgment, it is	 clear	what
actually  the  High  Court has done  is	 to  appreciate	 the
evidence at the pre-trial stage.
</p><p id="p_92">58.The	affidavit of Mr Tushar Kanti Talukdar,	Commissioner
of Police, Calcutta, which came to be filed pursuant to	 the
permission  granted by the Court, categorically states	that
sanction  was  accorded by him.	 The Commissioner  had	gone
through the voluminous records and came to the conclusion on
his own.  It is further stated by him as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_63">	      "I state that I had examined in particular the
	      statements  of witnesses indicating  that	 the
	      accused persons along with others conspired to
	      create   disharmony  between  the	 two   major
	      communities    and   over	  a    period	 had
	      systematically been collecting huge quantities
	      of  explosive substances to use them  whenever
	      needed.  In fact, on 16-3-1993 one  instalment
	      of  two big bags of explosives had arrived  at
	      the  place and were kept in the khaskhas	room
	      of  267, B.B. Ganguly Street.  These two	bags
	      were in addition to two big bags and two drums
	      that  had	 arrived earlier and stored  in	 the
	      same  room.  The statements of  witnesses	 and
	      confessional statements of two accused clearly
	      indicate that the accused had no faith in	 the
	      established  Government.	The accused men	 had
	      openly  declared that the Government had	done
			    nothing  to	 protect the Muslims  against  the
	      Hindus  in  Bombay riots and in  Calcutta	 the
	      Government will also do
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">				   707</span>
	      nothing  to  protect  the	 Muslims.   It	 was
	      declared that thus it was necessary to arm the
	      Muslims with huge quantities of bombs so	that
	      they  could  use those for  their	 protection.
	      The  statements and confessions indicate	that
	      bombs  were being manufactured on that day  to
	      attain  such  object.  One of  the  confessing
	      accused,	who  is an expert  in  manufacturing
	      bombs,  had stated in his confession  that  he
	      was told by Rashid Khan to prepare bombs	from
	      such huge quantities of explosive	 substances.
	      The accused in his confession also stated that
	      he  told Rashid Khan that preparing bombs	 out
	      of  such huge quantities of  explosives  would
	      not  only take whole night of 16th  March	 but
	      would  also need to next day till	 near  about
	      the evening.  The materials also indicate that
	      on that day while he left after preparing some
	      bombs,  others continued to manufacture  bombs
	      out  of  explosive substances  that  had	been
	      collected.   I  was satisfied that  the  facts
	      emerged	did  call  for	 prosecution   under
	      Sections	3  and	4  of  TADA.   "   (emphasis
	      supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_93">59.It  should also be stated, at this stage, that  the	High
Court had overlooked the fact that Mr Sujit Kumar Sanyal had
sworn  to the earlier affidavit as the Head of	the  Special
Investigating  Team  which has also been  mentioned  by	 the
Commissioner.  Merely because of the failure of the Court to
mention	 that  it had perused the order	 of  sanction  while
taking	cognizance  cannot lead to the conclusion  that	 the
existence of the order of sanction could be doubted.
</p><p id="p_94">60.The	finding that there was no order of sanction  is	 not
correct	 factually.   The affidavit of	Sujit  Kumar  Sanyal
clearly states as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">	      "I  say that on 14-6-1993 before	the  learned
	      Designated  Court had passed the order  taking
	      cognizance   I  had  placed  all	the   papers
	      including the two sanctions and the statements
	      recorded under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_126">Section 161</a> of the Code  before
	      the Court.  I say that it was well within	 the
	      competence  of the learned Chief	Metropolitan
	      Magistrate  to be informed that  investigation
	      under  Sections 3 and 4 of TADA Act was  being
	      carried  on  and	to correct  the	 records  by
	      adding <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_127">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/895566/" id="a_128">4</a> of the said Act."
	      Again in paragraph 12, the affidavit  proceeds
	      to state:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">	      "I  further say that it was only in course  of
	      the  investigation that  materials  indicating
	      commission of offences under <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_129">Sections 3</a> and  <a href="/doc/895566/" id="a_130">4</a>
	      of  the  said Act of 1987 had  transpired.   I
			    further say that after the cognizance had been
	      taken on the basis of the charge-sheet and the
	      materials collected after investigation  being
	      the materials in the case diary which  include
	      two  sanctions  and  the	statements  recorded
	      under   <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_131">Section  161</a>  of	the  Code  and	 the
	      documents seized and various seizure lists the
	      learned  Designated  Court issued	 warrant  of
	      arrest   against	 the   absconding    accused
	      persons."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_66">	      Paragraph 13 mentions as follows:
	      "I  say that the sanction under the said	TADA
	      1993  was granted on 11-6-1993 being No. 1  by
	      the Commissioner of Police, Calcutta and under
	      the <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_132">Explosive Substances Act</a> on that day being
	      4509-P by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">	      708</span>
	      Government of West Bengal.  I further say that
	      the  charge-sheet that was filed on  14-6-1993
	      has specifically mentioned that such  sanction
	      had    already   been   obtained.	    It	  is
	      categorically  denied that the initiation	 and
	      continuation  of the said criminal  proceeding
	      against	the   petitioner  and	before	 the
	      Designated Court under the TADA and said order
	      dated   14-6-1993	 is  illegal.	It  is	 not
	      necessary	 to mention in the order sheet	that
	      sanction	was  granted.	It  is	emphatically
	      denied   that   no  sanction  was	  given	  by
	      Respondents 3 and 4 or that the law enjoins  a
	      duty upon the Designated Court to record by an
	      order   the  fact	 of  having  received	such
	      sanction."
</blockquote><p id="p_95">61.There  is no justification on the part of the High  Court
to ignore this affidavit because the Commissioner of Police,
Calcutta had sworn to the fact that a Special  Investigation
Team had been set up on 18-3-1993 which was headed by  Sujit
Kumar Sanyal.
</p><p id="p_96">62.The order of sanction, on the face of it, shows that	 the
sanctioning  authority had perused the police  papers.	 The
High  Court  had to necessarily accept	these  averments  on
their  face  value.   The correctness or  otherwise  of	 the
statement  could  be gone into only at the  time  of  trial.
This  Court  in <a href="/doc/1287305/" id="a_133">State of Bihar v. PP  Sharma,  IAS3</a>  already
referred to, held as under: (SCC pp. 250-25 1, paras 27,  28
and 3 1 )
	      "The sanction under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_134">Section 197</a> CrPC is not an
	      empty  formality.	  It is essential  that	 the
	      provisions  therein  are to be  observed	with
	      complete strictness.  The object of  obtaining
	      sanction	is  that  the  authority   concerned
	      should  be  able to consider  for	 itself	 the
	      material	before	the  Investigating  Officer,
	      before  it  comes to the conclusion  that	 the
	      prosecution in the circumstances be sanctioned
	      or  forbidden.  To comply with the  provisions
	      of  <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_135">Section  197</a> it must be  proved  that	 the
			    sanction  was  given in respect of	the  facts
	      constituting  the	 offence  charged.   It	  is
	      desirable that the facts should be referred to
	      on  the face of the sanction <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_136">Section 197</a>	does
	      not   require  the  sanction  to	be  in	 any
	      particular  form.	 If the	 facts	constituting
	      the offence charged are not shown on the	face
	      of   the	 sanction,  it	is   open   to	 the
	      prosecution,  if challenged, to  prove  before
	      the court that those facts were placed  before
	      the sanctioning authority.  It should be clear
	      from  the	 form  of  the	sanction  that	 the
	      sanctioning authority considered the  relevant
	      material	 placed	 before	 it  and   after   a
	      consideration of all the circumstances of	 the
	      case it sanctioned the prosecution.
</p><p id="p_97">	      In  the  present case  the  investigation	 was
	      complete	on the date of sanction	 and  police
	      reports had been filed before the	 Magistrate.
	      The  sanctioning	authority  has	specifically
	      mentioned	 in  the  sanction  order  that	 the
	      papers  and  the case diary  were	 taken	into
	      consideration  before granting  the  sanction.
	      Case diary is a complete record of the  police
	      investigation.  It contains total material  in
	      support or otherwise of the allegations.	 The
	      sanctioning  authority having taken  the	case
	      diary into

	      consideration before the grant of sanction  it
	      cannot be said that there was  non-application
	      of  mind	on  the	 part  of  the	 sanctioning
	      authority.   It  is  nobody's  case  that	 the
	      averment	in the sanction order to the  effect
	      that  case diary was taken into  consideration
	      by the competent authority, is incorrect.	 We,
	      therefore,  do not agree with the	 finding  of
	      the  High	 Court	and  set  aside	 the   same.
</p><p id="p_98">	      (emphasis supplied)
	      Finally, we are at a loss to understand as  to
	      why  and	on  what reasoning  the	 High  Court
	      assumed	extraordinary	jurisdiction   under
	      Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of  India
	      at  a stage when the Special Judge was  seized
	      of the matter."
</p><p id="p_99">	      In view of this decision, the approach of	 the
	      High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_137">Article 226</a> is clearly wrong.
</p><p id="p_100">63.  It	 is true, as contended by Mr Ram  Jethmalani,  there
must  be  valid sanction, otherwise there is a bar  to	take
cognizance.   <a href="/doc/1841408/" id="a_138">In Gokulchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. King</a> 16  it
was observed thus: (AIR at p. 84)
	      "The  sanction  to prosecute is  an  important
	      matter;  it constitutes a condition  precedent
	      to the institution of the prosecution and	 the
			    Government	have  an  absolute  discretion	to
	      grant  or withhold their sanction.   They	 are
	      not,  as the High Court seem to have  thought,
	      concerned	 merely	 to see	 that  the  evidence

	      or economic grounds they regard a	 prosecution
	      as  inexpedient.	 Looked at as  a  matter  of

</blockquote><p id="p_103">66.In  our considered view, certainly the  Designated  Court
could do all these at the time of framing of charges and not
the  High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_144">Article 226</a>, as has been done  in	 the
instant case.
</p><p id="p_104">67.We are not in a position to accept the submissions of the
learned counsel for the respondent that in order to find out
whether	 a  valid  sanction  existed,  the  High  Court	 had
appreciated the findings.
</p><p id="p_105">68.Equally,  much cannot be said of the fact that the  order
of sanction mentions "sanction for prosecution", since it is
stated	"sanction for prosecution under Sections 3 and 4  of
TADA  Act" means only sanction to proceed under	 Sections  3
and  4	of TADA Act.  The ruling of <a href="/doc/1936933/" id="a_145">Ram Kumar  v.  State  of
Haryana18</a>,  dealt  with the different situation	 as  to	 the
scope  of sanction under <a href="/doc/1874283/" id="a_146">Sections 132</a> and <a href="/doc/1731569/" id="a_147">197</a> of  the  Code.
In  the	 case of a public servant, both the  sanctions	were
necessary.  That judgment has no application to the  present
case.
</p><p id="p_106">69.Having   regard   to	 the  various  acts   of   expressed
conspiracy,  it has to be "and/or".  It is only	 during	 the
trial  the prosecution has to prove the part played by	each
of the accused.
</p><p id="p_107">70.  In	 Alvin	Krulewitch v. United States20, it  was	held
thus:(L Ep. 799)
	      "When the trial starts, the accused feels	 the
	      full   impact  of	 the  conspiracy   strategy.
	      Strictly,	  the	prosecution   should   first
	      establish	 prima	facie  the  conspiracy	 and
	      identify	 the   conspirators,   after   which
	      evidence	of acts and declarations of each  in
	      the  course  of its execution  are  admissible
	      against  all.   But the order of proof  of  so
	      sprawling a charge is difficult for a judge to
	      control.	 As a practical matter, the  accused
	      often is confronted with a hodgepodge of	acts
	      and  statements by others which he  may  never
	      have  authorized	or intended  or	 even  known
	      about, but which help to persuade the jury  of
	      existence of the conspiracy itself.  In other
	      31 (1977) 2 SCC 699: 1977 SCC (Cri) 404
	      18 (1987) 1 SCC 476, 478 : 1987 SCC (Cri) 190

	      words,   a  conspiracy  often  is	 proved	  by
	      evidence	 that	is  admissible	 only	upon

			    (emphasis supplied)
Hence,	proving	 of conspiracy against	each  accused  would
arise  only  at	 the  stage of the trial  which	 is  yet  to
commence in the instant case.
</p><p id="p_108">71.  In Walli Mohammad v. King21 it is held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">	      "The statements of each prisoner are  evidence
	      against  himself	only  and  are	inadmissible
	      against his fellow accused.  Consequently, the
	      only  safe method of testing the	strength  of
	      the  case for the prosecution is to take	each
	      man's case separately, neglect the evidence of
	      the other and ask whether the conflicting	 and
	      inconsistent nature of the matters alleged and
	      persons implicated combined with the admission
	      that  the accused man was himself	 present  is
	      enough  to justify a verdict against him.	  It
	      may  be  possible that each  is  sheltering  a
	      third  person and even if it be possible	that
	      one  of the two accused is guilty, there	must
	      be  circumstances from which could be  deduced
	      which  of the two is the guilty  one.   Though
	      proof  of	 motive is not essential,  it  is  a
	      material	 consideration.	  But  it   is	 not
	      legitimate  to  speculate as to  possible	 but
	      unproved motives.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_70">	      The difficulty in all cases where two  persons

	      are  directed and however firmly a  Judge	 may
	      steel   his  mind	 against  being	  influenced
	      against  one by the evidence  admissible	only
	      against  the other, nevertheless the mind	 may
	      inadvertently  be affected by the	 disclosures
	      made by one of the accused to the detriment of

</blockquote><p id="p_109">Neither of these rulings would apply because the question of
leading	  evidence  by	the  prosecution  in   relation	  to
conspiracy,  as	 stated above, would arise only	 during	 the
stage of trial which is yet to commence in the instant case.
</p><p id="p_110">72.  As to the fact of conspiracy, the charge-sheet  clearly
mentions  the same.  Therefore, factually, this	 finding  is
wrong.	 We are not in a position to accept the argument  of
the learned counsel for the respondent that if the bombs are
for  self-defence,  there is no mens rea and  therefore,  no
offence	 under TADA.  The finding of the High Court on	this
aspect is as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">	      "It  may	be noted that if  according  to	 the
	      police  report itself the reason or  intention
	      behind  preparing	 and storing  bombs  was  to
	      defend  the Muslim community in the  event  or
	      riot taking place by possible attack by Hindus
	      because  the Government would not take  action
	      as  was done in Bombay, it cannot possibly  be
	      inferred or said that the accused intended  to
	      strike terror or that he had any other  intent
	      specified	  under	 the  TADA  Act.   It	has,
	      however,	been  submitted	 by Mr	Roy  in	 the
	      course   of  his	argument  that	 there	 are
			    statements of witnesses to the effect that the
	      people  of the locality were 'scared'  of	 the
	      accused, implying that they were considered as
	      dangerous	 persons.   It	has  been  submitted
	      further that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">	      712</span>
	      assuming	the fact to be true, from this	fact
	      it  does not follow that the  accused  entered
	      into  a conspiracy to prepare and store  bombs
	      with  any of the intents specified in  <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_148">Section
	      3(1)</a> viz. to strike terror amongst the  people

</blockquote><p id="p_111">The least we can say is that this finding is shocking.
</p><p id="p_112">73.We  may usefully refer to Ajay Aggarwal case8.  At  pages
617-618, paras 8-10 it is stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">	       "8.  ...	 It  is	 not  necessary	 that	each
	      conspirator  must know all the details of	 the
	      scheme  nor be a participant at  every  stage.
	      It  is  necessary that they should  agree	 for
	      design   or   object   of	  the	 conspiracy.
	      Conspiracy   is  conceived  as  having   three
	      elements:	 (1) agreement; (2) between  two  or
	      more   persons  by  whom	the   agreement	  is
	      effected; and (3) a criminal object, which may
	      be  either the ultimate aim of the  agreement,
	      or  may  constitute the means, or one  of	 the
	      means by which that aim is to be accomplished.
	      It is immaterial whether this is found in	 the
	      ultimate	objects.  The common law  definition
	      of  'criminal conspiracy' was stated first  by
	      Lord Denman in Jones' case that an  indictment
	      for conspiracy must "charge a conspiracy to do
	      an  unlawful  act by unlawful means"  and	 was
	      elaborated  by  Willies, J. on behalf  of	 the
	      judges  while  referring the question  to	 the
	      House  of Lords in Mulcahy v. Reg32 and  House
	      of  Lords in unanimous decision reiterated  in
	      Quinn v. Leathem33:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">	      `A  conspiracy  consists	not  merely  in	 the
	      intention of two or more, but in the agreement

	      do a lawful act by unlawful means.  So long as
	      such  a design rests in intention only, it  is
	      not  indictable.	When two agree to  carry  it
	      into  effect,  the  very plot  is	 an  act  in
	      itself,  and the act of each of  the  parties,
	      promise  against promise, actus contra  actum,

police report, cannot be sustained.  <a href="/doc/918619/" id="a_162">In Satya Narain  Musadi

</p><p id="p_127">83.That	 is not the position here.  Hence, that	 is  clearly
distinguishable.   The High Court has found in the  impugned
judgment as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">	      "The acts which the accused persons did is the
	      act of preparation and storage of bombs, which
	      are undoubtedly made of explosive	 substances.
	      From these acts of preparation and storage  of
	      bombs, it cannot be inferred that the  accused
	      intended	to kill the Hindus or strike  terror
	      amongst the people or a section of the people,
	      alienate a section of the people or  adversely
	      affect the harmony among different sections of
	      the people.  Such an intent cannot be inferred
	      from  the	 mere  preparation  and	 storage  of
	      bombs.   It  may be noted in  this  connection
	      that police report does not disclose that	 the
	      accused  persons caused the explosion.   As  a
	      consequence of the explosion which occurred on
	      16-3-1993	 a large number of persons who	were
	      killed  were Muslims and not Hindus  and	even
	      from  the consequences of the  explosion	with
	      which  the accused have not been	charged,  it
	      cannot  be  inferred  that  accused  who	 are
	      alleged  to  have	 been  responsible  for	 the
	      preparation and storage of the bombs, intended
	      to  kill	Hindus, or strike terror  amongst  a
	      section of people or that they had any of	 the
	      intents specified in <a href="/doc/1056565/" id="a_167">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act."
</blockquote><p id="p_128">We  are	 clearly  of the opinion that  this  is	 a  perverse
reasoning.
</p><p id="p_129">84.On intention and motive, we only need to refer to  Corpus
Juris  Secundum (A Contemporary Statement of American  Law),
Volume 22.  It is held at page 116 (Criminal Law) as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_80">	      "Intention

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_82">	      (b)   Specific or general intent crimes
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_83">	      (a)In general.- As actual intent to commit the
	      particular crime toward which the act moves is
	      a necessary element of an attempt to commit  a
	      crime.   Although	 the intent must be  one  in
	      fact,  not  merely  in law,  and	may  not  be
	      inferred	from the overt act alone, it may  be
	      inferred from the circumstances."
</blockquote><p id="p_130">85.As  regards motive in American Jurisprudence,  2nd  Edn.,
Vol. 21, in <a href="/doc/1568384/" id="a_168">Section 133</a>, it is stated as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">	      "133.  Motive.- In criminal law motive may  be
	      defined as that which leads or tempts the mind
	      to indulge in a criminal act or as the  moving
	      power  which impels to action for	 a  definite
	      result."
</blockquote><p id="p_131">86.Tested in the light of the above, suffice it to hold	 the
preparation and storage of bombs, as pointed out above,	 are
per  se illegal acts.  The intention that it was  to  defend
the Muslims, is totally unwarranted.  "Bomb is not a toy  or
top  to play with".  The further question is, when does	 the
so-called  right  of  self-defence arise?   The	 High  Court
should have assumed that each of the allegations made in the
charge-sheet  to  be  factually	 correct  and  should	have
examined  the  ingredients  of	the  offence.	As   rightly
contended by Mr U.R.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">717</span>
<p id="p_132">Lalit,	learned Senior Counsel, the charge-sheet  cannot  be
considered in a restricted way.
</p><p id="p_133">87.On a careful perusal of the judgment we are left with the
impression  that the High Court had indulged in	 a  laboured
exercise, without limiting itself to the proper jurisdiction
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_169">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, in  matters
of this kind.  We do not want to elaborate on the motive  to
prepare	 bombs and the intention thereto since the trial  is
yet to commence.
</p><p id="p_134">88.For	 all  the  above  reasons  we  have  absolutely	  no
hesitation  in	holding	 that the  High	 Court	has  clearly
exceeded its powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_170">Article 226</a> of the Constitution in
quashing  the orders of sanction and taking  of	 cognizance.
Therefore,  we set aside the impugned judgment of  the	High
Court  and direct the Designated Court to proceed  with	 the
case in accordance with the law with utmost expedition.
</p><p id="p_135">89.  In	 the  result,  the  criminal  appeals  are   allowed
accordingly.
