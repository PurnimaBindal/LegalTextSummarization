ACT:
Constitution  of  India,  1950-Arts.  15(1)(4)	and   29(2)-
Reservations of seats in Medical Colleges in favour of	hill
and  Uttrakhand areas-Constitutional validity  of-Tests	 for
determining backwardness.



HEADNOTE:
For admission of students to medical colleges in the  State,
the  State Government had made reservation for	rural,	hill
and  Uttrakhand areas on the ground that people coming	from
these areas belonged to socially and educationally  backward
classes.  The validity of these reservations was  questioned
in  the High Court.  The High Court in one case struck	them
down  as unconstitutional, without considering	the  earlier
decision.
On  appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf  of	 the
State  that  the  object  of  the  classification  was	 the
advancement  of	 medical education for candidates  from	 the
reserved  areas	 and to give students from these  areas	 the
benefit of medical education.  It was further contended that
by <a href="/doc/1975922/" id="a_1">Art. 41</a> and <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_2">46</a> of the Constitution the State is  enjoined
to  promote with special care the educational  and  economic
interests of the weaker sections of the people and that 'the
reservations  were not on the grounds of place of birth	 but
on the ground of residence and, therefore, the	reservations
would  not fall within the mischief of either <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_3">Art. 15(1)</a>  or
<a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_4">Art. 29.</a>
<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_5">Art.  15(1)</a>  states that the State  shall  not	discriminate
against	 any citizen grounds only of religion, race,  caste,
sex, place of birth or any of them.  <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_6">Art. 29(2)</a> states	that
no  citizen shall be denied admission into  any	 educational
institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out  of
State  funds  on  grounds only	of  religion,  race,  caste.
language or any of them.
Allowing the appeal in part,
HELD:Reservation  in  favour of candidates  from  rural
areas  is unconstitutional.  The reservations for  the	hill
and Uttrakhand areas are severable and are valid. [773D]
(1)  The  Constitution does not enable the  State  to  bring
socially   and	educationally  backward	 areas	within	 the
protection  of	<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_7">Art. 15(4).</a>  The  backwardness	contemplated
under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_8">Art. 15(4)</a> is both social and educational.  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_9">Art. 15(4)</a>
speaks	 of  backwardness  of  classes	of   citizens	and,
therefore,  socially and educationally backward	 classes  of
citizens  in <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_10">Art. 15(4)</a> could not be equated  with  castes'.
[766C-D]
(2)Neither  caste  nor race nor religion can be	 made  the
basis  of  classification for the  Purposes  of	 determining
social	and educational backwardness within the	 meaning  of
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_11">Art.  15(4).</a>   When  <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_12">Art. 15(1)</a>	 forbids  discrimination  on
grounds	 only of religion. race and caste, caste  cannot  be
made   one  f  the  criteria  for  determining	social	 and
educational  backwardness.  If caste or religion  is  recog-
nised as a criterion of social and educational	backwardness
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_13">Art. 15(4)</a> will stultify <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_14">Art. 15(1).</a>  When a  classification
takes	recourse  to  caste  as	 one  of  the  criteria	  in
determining socially and educationally backward classes	 the
expression  classes"  in  that case  violates  the  rule  of
expression   unius est exclusio alterius.  The socially	 and
educationally backward classes of citizens are groups  other
than, groups based on caste. [766F-G]
(3)The	place of habitation and its environment is also	 a
determining  factor  in judging the social  and	 educational
backwardness.  Backwardness is judged by economic basis that
each  region  has its own measurable possibilities  for	 the
Maintenance of human number,. standards of living and  fixed
property.   From  an economic Point of view the	 classes  of
Citizens are backward when they do not make effective use of
resources.   Neglected	opportunities and People  in  remote
Places raise walls of social backwardness of people.  People
in the hill any

Uttrakhand  areas  illustrate  the  educationally   backward
classes	 of citizens because lack of educational  facilities
keep them stagnant and they have neither meaning and  values
nor awareness for education. [767A; <a href="/doc/27045/" id="a_15">E-G]

Ors</a>. [1969] 1 S.C.R. 103, referred to.
(4)The	test of poverty is not the determining	factor	of
social backwardness. [768D]

S.C.R. 236, referred to.
(5)A  division	between the population on  the	ground	of
poverty that the people in the urban areas are not poor	 and
that  the  people  in the rural areas are  poor	 is  neither
supported  by  facts  nor by a division	 between  the  urban
people	on  the one hand and the rural people on  the  other
that  the  rural  people  are  socially	 and   educationally
backward  classes.   It	 cannot be said	 that  all  citizens
residing  in  rural  areas are	socially  and  educationally
backward. [768G-H]
(6)Population  cannot be class by itself.   Rural  element
does  not make it a class., To suggest that the rural  areas
are   socially	and  educationally  backward  is   to	have
reservations  for  the majority of the State.	The  special
need for medical men in rural areas will not make the people
in  the	 rural	areas socially	and  educationally  backward
classes of citizens. [769B-C]
(7)The	 fact  that  the  number  of  marks  obtained	by
candidates  from  rural	 areas were much  lower	 than  marks
obtained  by general candidates makes it neither  valid	 nor
justifiable  ground for determining social  and	 educational
backwardness.	On the other hand the success of  candidates
from rural areas at the open competition indicates that	 the
rural  areas  do not represent educational  backwardness  of
citizens.  [769D]
(8)The reservation for rural areas cannot be sustained	on
the  ground  that  the rural areas  represent  socially	 and
educationally  backward	 classes of  citizens.	 Poverty  in
rural areas cannot be the basis of classification to support
reservation for rural areas.  Poverty is found in all  parts
of India.  No reservation can be made on the basis of  place
of birth.  This would offend <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_19">Art. 15.</a> [769G-H]
In  the instant case the reservation for rural areas  cannot
be  upheld  because  there is  no  classification  based  on
residence between students coming from within the State	 and
others coming without. [772B]
(9)The	present case of classification of rural	 areas	is
not  one  of  under  classification.   This  is	 a  case  of
discrimination in favour of the majority of rural population
to  the	 prejudice  of	students  drawn	 from  the   general
category.  This classification is unconstitutional. [772G]

</p><p id="p_10">The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
RAY, C. J.-The principal question for consideration in these
Civil Appeals and Writ Petition is whether the	instructions
framed	by  the State in making reservations  in  favour  of
candidates  from Rural Areas, Hill Areas and Uttrakhand	 are
constitutionally valid.	 These reservations were made by the
State  Government  for	admission  of  students	 to  medical
colleges in the State of Uttar Pradesh.
</p><p id="p_11">In  Civil Appeal No. 1542 of 1974 the instructions  for	 the
combined  premedical test for the year 1973 were  impeached.
The instructions for the combined pre-medical test 1973	 for
admission  to 7 medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh under	 the
Meerut University provided for reservation, of 117 seats for
rural  areas,  25  seats for hill areas	 and  25  seats	 for
Uttrakhand  area.   The	 total	number of  seats  in  the  7
colleges  is  782. 392 seats are open  to  candidates  under
general	 category.   There are	reservations  for  Scheduled
Castes,	 Scheduled Tribes, children of	political  sufferers
and children of army personnel.	 The reservations for rural,
hill	and    Uttrakhand   areas   were    challenged	  as
unconstitutional.
</p><p id="p_12">In  Civil Appeal No. 1385 of 1973 the  combined	 pre-Medical
test  for  admission  to 5 medical  colleges  at  Allahabad,
Kanpur,	 Meerut,  Agra	and Jhansi for	the  year  1971	 was
challenged.   The  total number of seats was 758.  26  seats
were  reserved for the nominees of the Government  of  India
under  various heads. 732 seats were available to be  filled
in  through  the combined pre-medical test. 368	 seats	were
open  to  general competition. 89 seats	 were  reserved	 for
rural  areas,  23  seats for bill areas	 and  23  seats	 for
Uttrakhand  Division.  The reservations for the rural,	bill
and Uttrakhand areas were challenged as unconstitutional.
The  contention	 on  behalf  of	 the  State  was  that	 the
reservations  for rural, hill and Uttrakhand areas  are	 for
socially  and educationally backward classes.  It  was	also
said  that these reservations are valid on  geographical  or
territorial basis.
</p><p id="p_13">The affidavit evidence on behalf of the State was this.	 The
Government in the years 1952 and 1953 made reservations	 for
Kisan and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">764</span>
hill area candidates.  The Government reviewed the  position
from   time  to	 time.	 The  reservations  are	  considered
necessary  to attract graduates from those areas  which	 are
otherwise  handicapped	in the matter of education.   It  is
necessary  to  feed  the dispensaries with  medical  men  in
adequate number to serve the people inhabiting those  areas.
The  rural,,  hill  and Uttrakhand  areas  lack	 educational
facilities,  People living there are illiterate or  have'  a
very   modest  education.   Their  economic   condition	  is
unsatisfactory.	  The,	level of income is  low.   There  is
acute  poverty.	  There	 is lack and  in  some	cases  total
absence	 of communication and transportation.	Historically
these  areas  have been neglected.  People living  in  those
areas  are socially backward.  The percentage  of  education
among  them is low.  Candidates from those areas on  account
of  various  difficulties  and	handicaps  cannot  generally
compete on parallel or equal footing with other	 candidates.
The  State  maintains and financially supports	the  medical
colleges.   The State can. therefore, claim to lay down	 the
criterion  for	admission  to those  colleges.	 The  State,
classified  these  rural,  hill	 and  Uttrakhand  areas	  as
socially and educationally backward areas.
The  affidavit	evidence on behalf of the candidate  at	 the
combined  pre-medical test is that candidates  belonging  to
reserved categories obtained admission although they secured
marks as low as 128 and other candidates were placed in	 the
waiting list although the marks obtained by them was as	 low
as  103.  In the general category candidates in the  waiting
list secured about 266 marks. (See petition In Civil  Appeal
No. 1542 of 1974).  In Civil Appeal No. 1385 of 1973 it	 was
alleged	 that  the candidates from rural  Scheduled  Castes,
Uttrakhand  and Hill areas who obtained	 admission  obtained
281,  298 and 163 marks respectively whereas the  Petitioner
in  that  case	obtained  288 marks  and  could	 not  obtain
admission because of reservation of seats.
The  High  Court  at Allababad upheld  the  reservation	 for
rural, hill and Uttrakhand areas in <a href="/doc/336138/" id="a_26">Subhash Chandra v. State
of  U.P</a>. A.I.R. 1973 All. 295.	The High Court	struck	down
the  aforesaid	reservation in the case of  <a href="/doc/1263278/" id="a_27">Dilip  Kumar  v.
State  of U.P</a>. A.I.R. 1973 All. 592.  The High Court in	 the
case  of  Dilip Kumar (supra) however did not  consider	 the
case  of Subhash Chandra which was an earlier decision.	  It
is desirable from the point of view of judicial propriety to
refer to earlier decisions of the same High Court.
The contentions of the Attorney General were under two broad
heads.	First, the State hag given sufficient material which
remains	 uncontradicted	 to show that  the  areas  concerned
consisted  of  people  who  were as  a	class  socially	 and
educationally  backward.   Among the factors  given  by	 the
Government  were  the  factors recognised by  the  Court  in
determining  socially  and educationally  backward  classes.
These	were  poverty,	nature	of  occupation.	  place	  of
residence,  lack  of  education and  also  the	sub-standard
education  of the candidates for the test in  comparison  to
the  average standard of candidates from  general  category.
Second,	 the, classification has not been made only  on	 the
basis  of  Place  of birth as is  evident  from	 the,  State
affidavit.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">765</span>
<p id="p_14">If  this  classification  be neither  within  the,  vice  of
<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_28">Article	 15(1)</a> or <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_29">Article 29(2)</a> then the  classification  of
rural,	hill  and Uttrakhand areas can be justified  on	 the
basis of reasonable sources for the purpose of admission  to
medical	 colleges.   The  sources are the  rural,  hill	 and
Uttrakhand  areas  which form  geographical  or	 territorial
basis.
</p><p id="p_15">The Attorney General put in the forefront the object of	 the
classification	to be the advancement of  medical  education
for  candidates	 from  reserved	 areas.	  He  amplified	 his
submissions as follows.	 It is a notorious fact that  rural,
hill  and Uttrakhand areas are socially backward because  of
extreme	  poverty.   These  areas  are	also   educationally
backward because the standard of literacy is poor and  there
is  lack  of educational facilities.  There,  is  dearth  of
doctors in these reserved areas.  It is necessary to attract
students from these areas for admission to medical colleges.
This will give impetus to students from these areas to equip
themselves as doctors.
</p><p id="p_16">The   Attorney	 General  submitted  that  the	 object	  of
classification is to give students from rural areas  benefit
of  medical  education.	 If the object is to  get  the	best
material  then	it  would be, justifiable  to  look  at	 the
historically  backward	rural areas which  have	 no  medical
colleges.   The	 classification may be supported  either  on
historical or geographical exigencies of circumstances,	 The
geographical,  territorial,  historical	 and  the   economic
conditions  in the rural and hill areas were  emphasised  to
support the classification.
</p><p id="p_17">The  Attorney  General	laid  considerable  stress  on	the,
feature	 that  Rural  India is	socially  and  educationally
backward  by  reason  of poverty.  He said  that  the  Court
should take judicial notice of the extreme poverty in  these
areas.	The rural people were said to have common traits  of
agriculture  and  they	were  all  conditioned	by  economic
poverty.  Articles 41 and 46 were put in the forefront	that
the  right  to education was one of the	 provisions  in	 the
Directive  Principles  of  State Policy.  The  State  is  to
promote	 with  special	care the  educational  and  economic
interests of the weaker sections of the people.
<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_30">Article	 15(1)</a> states that the State shall not	discriminate
against	 any  citizen  on grounds only	of  religion,  race,
caste,.sex  place  of birth or any of  them.   The  Attorney
General	 submitted that the reservation was not	 on  grounds
only of place of birth or caste.  <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_31">Article 29(2)</a> states	that
no  citizen shall be denied admission into  any	 educational
institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out  of
State  funds  on  grounds only	of  religion,  race,  caste,
language or any of them.  It is said by the Attorney General
that inasmuch as place of birth is not mentioned in  <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_32">Article
29(2</a>), the reservations in the present case would not offend
<a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_33">Article	 29(2).</a>	  The Attorney General	submitted  that	 the
reservations in the present case were not on ground of place
of  birth  but on ground of residence. and,  therefore,	 the
reservations  would not fall within the mischief  of  either
<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_34">Article 15(1)</a> or <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_35">Article 29(2).</a>
</p><p id="p_18"><a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_36">Article 15(4)</a> was added by the Constitution First  Amendment
Act,  1951.   The  object  of the  amendment  was  to  bring
Articles  15  and 29 in line with  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_37">Article  16(4).</a>   <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_38">Article
16(4)</a> states that nothing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">766</span>
in  that  Article shall prevent the State  from	 making	 any
provision  for the reservation of appointments or  posts  in
favour	of  any	 backward class of  citizens  which  in	 the
opinion	 of the State is not adequately represented  in	 the
services  under the State.  <a href="/doc/149321/" id="a_39">In the State of Madras  v.	Smt.
Champakam  Dorairajan</a> [1951] S.C.R. 525 the  reservation  of
seats for non-Brahmins, backward Hindus, Brahmins, Harijans,
Anglo  Indians and Indian Christians and Muslim was held  to
offend <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_40">Article 15(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_41">29(2).</a>	 This Court pointed out that
the omission of. a clause like <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_42">Article 16(4)</a> from <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_43">Article 29</a>
indicated  the intention of the Constitution makers  not  to
introduce communal consideration in matters of admission  to
educational institutions.
</p><p id="p_19"><a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_44">Article 15(4)</a> speaks of socially and educationally  backward
classes	 of citizens.  The State described the	rural,	hill
and Uttrakhand areas as socially and educationally  backward
areas.	The Constitution does not enable the State to  bring
socially   and	educationally  backward	 areas	within	 the
protection  of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_45">Article 15(4).</a>  The Attorney General  however
submitted that the affidavit evidence established the rural,
hill and Uttrakhand areas to have socially and educationally
backward classes of citizens.  The backwardness contemplated
under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_46">Article 15(4)</a> is both social and educational.  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_47">Article
15(4)</a>  speaks of backwardness of classes of  citizens.	 The
accent is on classes of citizens.  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_48">Article 15(4)</a> also speaks
of  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes.	  Therefore,
socially  and educationally backward classes of citizens  in
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_49">Article	 15(4)</a> could not be equated with castes.  <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_50">In  M.  R.

classification	taken  recourse	 to  caste  as	one  of	 the
criteria in. determining socially and educationally backward
classes	 the expression "classes" in that case violates	 the
rule of expression unius est exclusio altrius.	The socially
and  educationally backward classes of citizens	 are  groups
other than groups based on caste.
</p><p id="p_21">The expression "socially and educationally backward classes"
in  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_57">Article 15(4)</a> was explained in Balaji's case (supra)  to
be comparable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.	 The
reason	is  that the Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled  Tribes
illustrated  social  and educational  backwardness.   It  is
difficult   to	 define	  the	expression   "socially	 and
educationally	backward   classes   of	  citizens".	 The
traditional unchanging occupations of citizens may  continue
to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">767</span>
social and educational backwardness. The place of habitation
and its environment is also a determining factor in  judging
the social and educational backwardness.
The expression "classes of citizens" indicates a homogeneous
section	 of the people who are grouped together	 because  of
certain	  likeliness   and  common  traits   and   who	 are
identifiable by some common attributes.	 The homogeneity  of
the   class   of   citizens  is	  social   and	 educational
backwardness.  Neither caste nor religion nor place of birth
will  be  the uniform element of common attributes  to	make
them a class of citizens.
</p><p id="p_22">The  traits of social backwardness are these.  There  is  no
social structure.  There is no social hierarchy.  There	 are
no means of controlling the environment through	 technology.
There	is  no	organization  of  the  society	 to   create
inducements  for  uplift of the people	and  improvement  of
economy.   Building of towns and industries, growth of	cash
economy which are responsible for greater social wealth	 are
absent among such classes.  Social growth and well being can
be satisfied by massive change in resource conditions.	High
lands  'and hills are to be developed in fiscal	 values	 and
natural	  resources.   Nature  is  a   treasury.    Forests,
mountains, rivers can yield an advanced society with the aid
of education and technology.
</p><p id="p_23">The hill and Uttrakhand areas in Uttar Pradesh are  instance
of  socially and educationally backward classes of  citizens
for these reasons.  Backwardness is judged by economic basis
that  each region has its own measurable  possibilities	 for
the  maintenance of human numbers, standards of	 living	 and
fixed property.	 From an economic point of view the  classes
of citizens are backward when they do not make effective use
of  resources.	When large areas of land maintain a  sparse,
disorderly and illiterate population whose property is small
and  negligible	 the  element  of  social  backwardness	  is
observed.  When effective territorial specialisation is	 not
possible  in  the  absence of  means  of  communication	 and
technical processes as in the hill and Uttrakhand areas	 the
people are socially backward classes of citizens.  Neglected
opportunities  and  people in remote places raise  walls  of
social backwardness of people.
</p><p id="p_24">Educational  backwardness is ascertained with  reference  to
these  factors.	  Where people have traditional	 apathy	 for
education on account of social and environmental  conditions
or   occupational  handicaps,  it  is  an  illustration	  of
educational backwardness.  The hill and Uttrakhand areas are
inaccessible.  There is lack of educational institutions and
educational  aids.  People in the hill and Uttrakhand  areas
illustrate  the educationally backward classes	of  citizens
because	 lack of educational facilities keep  them  stagnant
and  they have neither meaning and values nor awareness	 for
education.

backward  classes of citizens within the meaning of  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_60">Article

their residence in the rural areas and they are identifiable
by  such  on  traits  and  have	 for  long  constituted	 and
continued  to  constitute a well-known	division  of  Indian
society.   It was emphasised that the people in rural  areas
are always grouped together under the general or class	name
of "rural people.
</p><p id="p_26"><a href="/doc/335876/" id="a_61">In  Triloki Nath &amp; Anr. v. State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir  &amp;	Ors</a>.
(supra) this Court said that the members of an entire  caste
or  community may, in the social, economic  and	 educational
scale  of  values at a given time, be backward and  may,  on
that account be treated as a backward class, but that is not
because	 they  are  members of a  caste	 or  community,	 but
because they form a class.
</p><p id="p_27">In  Balaii's  case  (supra)  this  Court  said	that  social
backwardness  is  on  the ultimate analysis  the  result  of
poverty	 to a large extent and that the problem of  backward
classes	 is  in	 substance  the	 problem  of  rural   India.
Extracting these observations the Attorney General contended
that poverty is not only relevant but is one of the elements
in  determining the social backwardness.  We are  unable  to
accept	the  test of poverty as the  determining  factor  of
social backwardness.
</p><p id="p_28">The  1971  Census  showed population in India  to  be  54.79
crores.	 32-89 crores or 80.1 per cent live in rural  areas.
10.91 crores or 43.9 per cent live in cities and towns.	  In
1921  the rural population in India was 88.8 per  cent.	  In
1971 the rural population was reduced to 80.7 per cent.	 The
rural population of Uttar Pradesh in 1971 was roughly  seven
and a half crores.  The population in Uttrakhand was roughly
seven  and  a half lakhs.  The population of Hill  areas  in
Uttar  Pradesh was near about twenty-five lakhs.  It is	 in-
comprehensible	as  to how 80.1 per cent of  the  people  in
rural areas or 7 crores in rural parts of Uttar Pradesh	 can
be  suggested  to be socially backward because	of  poverty.
Further, it is also not possible to predicate poverty as the
common	trait of rural people.	This Court in <a href="/doc/579569/" id="a_62">J. P.  Parimoo
v. State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir</a> [1973] 3 S.C.R. 236 said that if
poverty	 is  the exclusive test a large	 population  in	 our
country	 would be socially and educationally backward  class
of citizens.  Poverty is evident everywhere and perhaps more
so in educationally advanced and socially affluent  classes.
A  division  between the population of our  country  on	 the
ground of poverty that the people in the urban areas are not
poor  and  that the people in the rural areas  are  poor  is
neither	 supported  by facts nor by a division	between	 the
urban  people  on the one hand and the rural people  on	 the
other  that the rural people are socially and  educationally
backward class.
</p><p id="p_29">Some  people  in  the  rural  areas  may  be   educationally
backward,  some may be socially backward. there may  be	 few
who  are  both socially and educationally backward.  bit  it
cannot be said that all citizens residing in rural areas are
socially and educationally backward.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">769</span>
<p id="p_30">80 per cent of the population in the State of Uttar  Pradesh
in  rural areas cannot be said to be a homogeneous class  by
itself.	 They are not of the same kind.	 Their occupation is
different.  Their standards are different.  Their lives	 are
different.   Population cannot be a class by itself.   Rural
element does not make it a class.  To suggest that the rural
areas  are  socially and educationally backward is  to	have
reservation for the majority of the State.
On  behalf of the State it is said that it is  necessary  to
have reservation of seats for the people from rural areas in
order  to attract people from those areas who are  otherwise
handicapped  in	 the matter of education, so that  they	 can
serve  the people in the rural areas on completion of  their
medical	 education.   In order to attract  medical  men	 for
service	 in  rural  areas arrangements are  to	be  made  to
attract	 them.	 The special need for medical men  in  rural
areas  will not make the people in the rural areas  socially
and educationally backward classes of citizens.
It was said that the number of marks obtained by  candidates
from  rural areas showed that they were much lower than	 the
marks obtained by general candidates and this would indicate
educational  backwardness.   That is neither a valid  nor  a
justifiable  ground for determining social  and	 educational
backwardness.	Educational institutions should attract	 the
best  talents.	It has been held by this Court	in  Balaij's
case  (supra) that 50 per cent of the seats  in	 educational
institutions should be left open to general competition.  in
the  present case, it appears that 85 candidates from  rural
areas  were  selected in the general seats.   One  candidate
from  Uttrakhand area, 7 candidates from hill areas and	 one
Scheduled  Caste  candidate also completed for	the  general
seats.	The candidates from hill areas, Uttrakhand  Division
and  Scheduled Castes are exceptions and  their	 performance
will not detract from the reservations for Scheduled  Caste,
bill and Uttrakhand areas.  The performance of 85 candidates
from rural areas speaks eloquently for the high standards of
education in rural areas.
</p><p id="p_31">The  reservation for rural areas cannot be sustained on	 the
ground	 that  the  rural  areas  represent   socially	 and
educationally	backward   classes   of	  citizens.	This
reservation  appears to be made for the majority  population
of  the	 State. 80 per cent of the population of  the  State
cannot	be  a  homogeneous class.  Poverty  in	rural  areas
cannot be the basis of classification to support reservation
for  rural areas.  Poverty is found in all parts  of  India.
In the instructions for reservation of seats it is  provided
that in the application form a candidate for reserved  seats
from  rural areas must submit a certificate of the  District
Magistrate of the District to which he belonged that be	 was
born  in rural area and had a permanent home there,  and  is
residing there or that he was born in India and his  parents
and  guardians	are  still  living  there  and	earn   their
livelihood  there.  The incident of birth in rural areas  is
made the basic qualification.  No reservation can be made on
the  basis of place of birth, as this would  offend  Article
</p><p id="p_32">15.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">770</span>
The  onus  of proof is on the State to	establish  that	 the
reservations  are  for socially and  educationally  backward
classes	 of  citizens.	The State has established  that	 the
people	in  hill  and  Uttrakhand  areas  are  socially	 and
educationally backward classes of citizens.
The  Attorney General submitted that if the State failed  to
establish  that the people in rural areas are  socially	 and
educationally  backward classes of citizens the	 reservation
for  rural areas could be sustained on the ground  that	 the
reservations  are  clearly on  geographical  or	 territorial
basis.	The Attorney General referred to the instruction for
reservation  of	 seats	and  submitted	that  the  basis  of
reservation is not only place of birth but place of birth as
well as the residence of the applicant or place of birth  as
well as the residence of the applicant parents or  guardian.
He  relied on the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1628/" id="a_63">D. P.  Joshi  v.
State  of  Madhya  Bharat &amp; Anr</a>. [1955]	 1  S.C.R.  1215  in
support	 of  the proposition that a  classification  on	 the
basis of residence is valid as a geographical or territorial
classification.	  On  behalf of the State it was  said	that
under  <a href="/doc/1975922/" id="a_64">Article	41</a> the State has a duty	 to  make  effective
provision for securing the right to education.	Reliance was
placed	on  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_65">Article  46</a> that the State	shall  promote	with
special	 care the educational and economic interests of	 the
weaker	sections  of  the  people.   The  Attorney   General
submitted  that	 the reservations for the  rural  areas	 was
really to obtain students from the source of rural areas.
In  D. P. Joshi's case (supra) the State Government  made  a
rule  that no capitation fee should be charged for  students
who are bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat but  capitation
fee should be retained for non-Madhya Bharat students.	This
rule  was  challenged  as an infraction of  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_66">Article  14</a>	 and
<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_67">15(1).</a>	 This Court held that the rule did not infringe	 the
fundamental  right  guaranteed	by  <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_68">Article  15(1)</a>   because
residence  and place of birth are two  distinct	 conceptions
with  different	 connotations both in law  and	fact.	This
Court  said  that <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_69">Article  15(1)</a>  prohibited  discrimination
based  on  place of birth and the prohibition could  not  be
read  as  one  of  discrimination  based  on  residence.   A
division  into	two  groups, viz., bona	 fide  residents  of
Madhya Bharat and nonresidents of Madhya Bharat was held not
to be a violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_70">Article 14.</a>  A classification based  on
residence  was held to have a fair and substantial  relation
to  the purpose of the law.  It was said that if  the  State
had  to	 spend money on education, it was  not	unreasonable
that the State should order the educational system in such a
manner that the advantage of it would to some extent  ensure
for the benefit of the State.
</p><p id="p_33">The other two decisions on which Attorney General relied  on
are <a href="/doc/203735/" id="a_71">R. Chitralekha &amp; Anr v. State of Mysore &amp; Ors</a>. [1964]  6
S.C.R.	368  and <a href="/doc/1276295/" id="a_72">D. K. Chanchala v. State of Mysore  &amp;	Ors</a>.
etc.  [1971]  Supp.  S C.R ' 608 The classification  in	 the
present	 case was laid by the Attorney General to  encourage
higher	education  to bona fide applicants  from  the  rural
areas.	It is also said that the candidates from rural areas
will have to execute a bond that they agree to serve the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">771</span>
Government for five years so, that doctors could be provided
in   rural   areas.   This  was	 said  to  be	a   relevant
consideration for supporting the classification.
In  Chitralekha's  case	 (supra) the  Government  of  Mysore
defined	 backward classes and directed that 30 per  cent  of
the  seats  in	professional  and  technical  colleges	 and
institutions  would  be	 reserved  for	them.	The   Mysore
Government  laid  down that classification of  socially	 and
educationally backward classes should be on the basis of (1)
economic  condition, and (2) occupation.  According to	that
order, a family whose income is Rs. 1,200 per annum or	less
and   persons  or  classes  who	 followed   occupations	  of
agriculture  petty  business, inferior services,  crafts  or
other  occupations involving. manual labour were defined  to
be  socially economically and educationally backward.	This
Court said that the classification of backward classes based
on  economic  conditions  and occupation  does	not.  offend
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_73">Article	 15(4).</a>	 This Court explained Balaji's case  (supra)
by  stating  that the authority concerned might	 take  costs
into  consideration  in ascertaining the backwardness  of  a
group  of persons but if it did not, the order would not  be
bad  on that account if it could ascertain the	backwardness
of  a  group  of  persons on the  basis	 of  other  relevant
material.
</p><p id="p_34">In   Chanchala's  case	(supra)	 one  of  the	rules	made
reservation for children of political sufferers and  another
rule  provided	for  distribution  of  seats  according	  to
Universities.	The  reservation for children  of  political
sufferers  was upheld on the ground that such a	 classifica-
tion has reasonable nexus with object of the rules, viz.,  a
fair  and  just distribution of seats.	With regard  to	 the
distribution  of  seats according to the  Universities,	 the
rule  provided	that  seats in the  general  pool  would  be
distributed  University-wise.  Scats in colleges  affiliated
to Kamatak University were to be allotted to persons passing
from  colleges	affiliated to that University and  seats  in
colleges  affiliated  to Bangalore and	Mysore	Universities
were  to  be respectively allotted to persons  passing	from
colleges affiliated to each such University.  The rule	also
provided that not more than 20 per cent of the seats in	 the
colleges   affiliated  to  any	university  might   in	 the
discretion  of	the  Selection	Committee,  be	allotted  to
students  passing  from	 colleges affiliated  to  any  other
university  in the State or elsewhere.	This  classification
was  impeached	to  be neither	based  on  any	intelligible
differentia nor to have a rational nexus with the object  to
the rules.
</p><p id="p_35">This  Court in Chanchala's case (supra) held that since	 the
universities  were  set up for	satisfying  the	 educational
needs of different areas where they were set up and  medical
colleges were established in those areas, it could safely be
presumed that they also were so set up to satisfy the  needs
for  medical  training of those attached  to  those  univer-
sities.	  Such	a  basis  for  selection  did  not  have   a
disadvantage of district wise or unit-wise selection as	 any
student from any part of the State could pass the qualifying
examination in any of the three universities irrespective of
place  of  birth  or  residence.   The	discretion  of	 the
selection  committee to admit outsiders upto 20 per cent  of
the total available seats in any of these colleges was	held
to advance the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">772</span>
interest of education by drawing the best students not	only
in the State but also elsewhere in India.
</p><p id="p_36">In  the	 present case, the reservation for  the	 rural	area
cannot be upheld because there is no classification based on
residence between students coming from within the State	 and
others coming from without.  The object of providing medical
education to students in Uttar Pradesh is to secure the best
possible students for admission to these colleges.  It is in
this  context that districtwise allocation was held by	this
Court in <a href="/doc/1342109/" id="a_74">Rajendran v. State of Madras</a> [1968] (2) S.C.R.	 786
to violate <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_75">Article 14.</a>	The University-wise distribution  of
seats  which  was  found to be	valid  in  Chanchala's	case
(supra) does not have any application in the present case.
The submission of the Attorney General that rural population
would be a source for drawing students cannot be upheld.  An
illustration of different sources of categories of  students
is  <a href="/doc/195765/" id="a_76">Chitra  Ghosh &amp; Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.  [1970]  1
S.C.R.	 413.	There  the  categories	of   students	were
classified as residents of Delhi; sons/daughters of  Central
Government servants posted in Delhi; candidates whose father
is  dead and is wholly dependent on borther/sister who is  a
Central	 Government servant posted in Delhi;  sons/daughters
of  residents  of  Union  Territories  including   displaced
persons	  registered  therein;	sons/daughters	of   Central
Government  servants  posted  in  Indian  Missions   abroad;
cultural scholars.  Colombo Plan Scholars; Thailand Scholars
and  Jammu and Kashmir State Scholars, Rural area  in  Uttar
Pradesh cannot be said to be a source for reservation of the
type in Chira Ghosh's case (supra).
</p><p id="p_37">The Attorney General relied on Beryl F. Carroll v. Greenwich
Insurance  Co. of New York 50, L.Ed. 246, Weaver  v.  Palmer
Brother Co. 70 L.ED. 654 and West Coast Hotel Co. v.  Ernest
Parrish 81.  L.ED. 703 in support of the proposition that if
an evil is especially experienced in a particular branch  of
business,  the Constitution embodies no Prohibition of	laws
confined  to the evil or doctrinaire requirement  that	they
should be couched in all embracing terms- it was said if the
law  was intended to remove the evil where it was most	felt
it  was	 not  to  be overthrown	 because  there	 were  other
instances  to which it might have been applied.	  This	rule
really	means that there is no doctrinaire requirement	that
the legislation should be couched in all embracing terms.  A
case  of under classification would be an instance  of	this
rule.  The present case of classification of rural areas  is
not  one  of  under  classification.   This  is	 a  case  of
discrimination in favour of the majority of rural population
to  the	 prejudice  of	students  drawn	 from  the   general
category.  The classification is unconstitutional.
In CivilAppeal	 No.   1385  of	 1973  two   other   minor
contentions  were raised. One  was that the  reservation
was  beyond  50 per sent. The total number of  seats  to  be
filled	in through the combined test is 732.  The number  of
general	 seats is 368. 26 seats are reserved for  Government
of  India nominees under various beads.	 The reservation  of
26  seats was contended to be considered  while	 calculating
the percentage of reserved seats.  If 26 seats are  included
it was said that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">773</span>
reserved  seats would come to 52 per cent. 26 seats  form  a
source	from which selection is made.  The Government  bears
the  burden  of expenses of education.	A  provision  laying
down  a	 source is not a reservation [see  Chanchala's	case
(supra)].
</p><p id="p_38">The  other contention was that the State Government  changed
the  percentage of reserved seats after the premedical	test
was  held.  The contention was that candidates belonging  to
reserved  classes  were able to secure some of	the  general
seats on the basis of then better performance in competitive
test  and therefore more seats went to people from  reserved
classes.  The Government did not change the number of  seats
for reserved classes.  Candidates belonging to the  reserved
classes	 were  selected	 by reason of  their  excellence  in
education.   The reservation has not been changed.  We	have
already held that the success of candidates from rural areas
at  the open competition indicates that the rural  areas  do
not represent educationally backward classes of citizens.
For these reasons we hold that the reservation in favour  of
candidates  from  rural	 areas	is  unconstitutional.	 The
reservations   for  the,  hill	and  Uttrakhand	 areas	 are
severable and these are valid.
</p><p id="p_39">We allow Civil Appeal No. 1385 of 1973 in part.
Civil Appeal No. 1542 of 1974 is also allowed in part.	 The
reservations for the hill and Uttrakhand areas are upheld in
