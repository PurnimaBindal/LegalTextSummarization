2.      To be referred to the reporter or not?                                                Yes.

        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.                "Aveda" and "Uveda" the two marks are subject matters of

consideration under present application. "Aveda" is the trademark of plaintiff for

which plaintiff is having a registration certificate showing registration in the name

of plaintiff since 1986 for hair care, skin care and other beauty products. The

name of plaintiff itself is "Aveda Corporation". The defendant has adopted a mark

"Uveda" for its skin care and beauty products recently.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.      The contention of plaintiff is that plaintiff had popularized this trademark

throughout the word by spending considerable amount on promotional

activities/advertisements. In the year 2008-09 itself, an amount in excess of 50


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">+ IA No. 14808/2009 in CS(OS) No. 2179/2009   Aveda Corporation v. Dabur India Ltd.   Page 1 of 11</span>
 million dollars was spent on promotion of goods worldwide by the plaintiff.

Defendant introduced fairness cream, face wash and moisturizer under the mark

"Uveda" in August, 2009.                 The mark "Uveda" adopted by defendant was

phonetically similar to the plaintiff‟s mark. It was being used by the defendant for

similar products and the mark was deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff. The

defendant though a well known company was trying to take advantage of the

reputation of the plaintiff. The defendant was prominently using the word "Uveda"

on its products and was also guilty of passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff

since the ordinary consumer with an imperfect recollection was bound to get

confused between the two words "Aveda" &amp; "Uveda". This application for interim

injunction has been made for restraining defendant from using the word "Uveda"

during pendency of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.                The defendant accepted notice of the application and argued the

matter. It is submitted by the defendant that the plaintiff had no sales in India and

the mark of the plaintiff "Aveda" was not known in India. Plaintiff was admittedly

supplying its beauty products in India to only one Spa in Rishikesh and its

products were not available at any shop in the market anywhere in India. There

was no question of same consumer getting confused since the products of the

plaintiff were not even available in India for sale. The other ground taken is that

the plaintiff was catering to a very high end limited market the cost of 50 ml

packing of the plaintiff‟s product was more than Rs.300/- whereas the cost of 30

gm packing of defendant‟s product was Rs.95/-. The packaging of the defendant

was altogether different from that of the plaintiff and in order to fortify this point

samples of defendant‟s cream and the plaintiff‟s cream were brought to the Court.

The plaintiff packaging was small in size in blue colour while the carton of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">+ IA No. 14808/2009 in CS(OS) No. 2179/2009   Aveda Corporation v. Dabur India Ltd.   Page 2 of 11</span>
 defendant‟s product was in red and orange/saffron colours and bigger in size. It

was also stated that the style of writing "Uveda" and "Aveda" was also different

and there was no reason for confusion of the customer and there was no chance

of passing off the goods of the defendant as that of the plaintiff since "Dabur" was

prominently written over the word "Uveda". The get up and mode of writing was

also altogether different.
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.                The other plea taken is that the word "Veda" was in public domain

and the plaintiff‟s adoption of "Aveda" and its literature indicated that the product

has to do something with the Ayurvedic science.                         The plaintiff cannot have

monopoly over the word "Veda". The defendant can also use the word "Veda"

with variation and if the variation adopted by the defendant was sufficient to

distinguish the product of the defendant from that of the plaintiff no cause of

action was made for filing the suit or the application.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.                Defendant placed reliance on Office Cleaning Services Limited v.

Westminister Window and General Cleaners Ltd. 63 RPC LXIII 39 wherein the

contest was between titles of "Office Cleaning Services Ltd." and "Office Cleaning

Association" and the issue was whether the two names were sufficient to

distinguish the respective businesses. The House of Lords observed that in the

case of a trademark where the words are descriptive and are used by two traders

as part of their respective trade names, the Court will not readily assume that use

of the descriptive words would disentitle another trader to use the same as part of

his trade name and the Court would easily accept small differences between the

two names as sufficient to avoid a confusion. Reliance is also placed on <a href="/doc/147065063/" id="a_1">Three-

N-Products Private Ltd. v. Emami Limited</a> 2008 (4) CHN 608 wherein the contest


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">+ IA No. 14808/2009 in CS(OS) No. 2179/2009   Aveda Corporation v. Dabur India Ltd.   Page 3 of 11</span>
 was between plaintiff‟s claim over word "Ayur" and the defendant‟s mark "Ayu" in

respect of same class of products. The Calcutta High Court observed as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  39. The plaintiff is on stronger ground in its assertion of its
                  complaint of the use of the mark "Ayu" as part of one of the
                  defendant's brands. It has been recognized that the use of a
                  prefix or a suffix by the defendant with the plaintiff's
                  registered mark may not allow the defendant the right to use
                  such mark. Of its two marks that include "Ayu" the
                  defendant uses its stable mark "Himani" in conjunction with
                  "Ayucare" and since the plaintiff complains of the use of the
                  word "Ayu" as part of the mark "Himani Ayucare", it appears
                  that there is sufficient bona fide attempt by the defendant to
                  avoid confusion and to preclude association of its such mark
                  with the plaintiff or its registered mark "Ayu". The use of
                  "Ayu" by the defendant in such mark notwithstanding, prima
                  facie, no case of infringement in respect of "Ayu" is made out
                  by the plaintiff in respect of the defendant's "Himani
                  Ayucare" mark.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  49. The word "Ayur" hints at an association with
                  Ayurveda. Whether or not the plaintiff uses any Ayurvedic
                  component in any of its products manufactured under the
                  registered device in which the word "Ayur" features
                  prominently, the word conveys - in the context of the
                  products manufactured by the plaintiff - a nexus with
                  Ayurveda. The word "Ayur" in the plaintiff's marks may be
                  perceived to refer to the composition of the products. The
                  more descriptive a word, the closer the resemblance of the
                  word to the efficacy or the nature of the associated product,
                  the more remote will be the presumption as to its exclusivity
                  and the more demanding it will be on the plaintiff to establish
                  distinctiveness. For the owner of an unregistered word mark
                  to claim exclusivity over the mark in the trade, the word must
                  almost be incapable of application to the goods of any other
                  trader. The plaintiff's "Ayur" word does not pass such high
                  test.
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">6.                The defendant also submitted that while the plaintiff‟s presence in

India was miniscule, the defendant‟s presence in India and of its products

including the "Uveda" cream was at large scale. The sale of its product with

"Uveda" mark was already Rs.75 lac and products of Rs.1crore were in the

pipeline. The Court should consider while granting an interim injunction that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">+ IA No. 14808/2009 in CS(OS) No. 2179/2009   Aveda Corporation v. Dabur India Ltd.   Page 4 of 11</span>
 plaintiff was not going to suffer any loss much less irreparable loss since the

product of plaintiff was not in the market whereas the defendant would suffer an

irreparable loss. The balance of convenience was also in favour of the defendant.

Defendant relied upon <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_2">Wander Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Antox India (P) Ltd</a>. 1990(2) Arb.L.R

399 wherein Supreme Court observed as under:
</p>
<p id="p_11">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  5.     Usually, the prayer for grant of an interlocutory
                  injunction is at a stage when the existence of the legal right
                  asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both
                  contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are
                  established at the trial on evidence. The court, at this stage,
                  acts on certain well settled principles of administration of this
                  form of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary and
                  discretionary. The object of the interlocutory injunction, it is
                  stated is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of
                  his rights for which he could not adequately be compensated
                  in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were
                  resolved in his favour at the trial. The need for such
                  protection must be weighed against the corresponding need
                  of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from
                  his having been prevented from exercising his own legal
                  rights for which he could not be adequately compensated.
                  The court must weigh one need against another and
                  determine where the "balance of convenience lies". The
                  interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo,
                  the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie. The
                  court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what
                  he considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to
                  be prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant
                  consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence
                  his enterprise or whether he has already been doing so in
                  which latter case considerations somewhat different from
                  those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to
                  commence his enterprise, are attracted.

<p id="p_12">7.                Defendant also relied on Bimal Govindji Shah Trading as Acme

Industries v. Pannalal Chandulal 1997(2) Arb.L.R.76 and <a href="/doc/2044127/" id="a_3">J.R.Kapoor v. Micronix

India</a> 1994 (Suppl) (3) SSC 215. It was further argued by the defendant that word

„Veda‟ being in public domain and indicative of the product implying

vedic/ayurvedic knowledge could not be monopolized by the plaintiff and in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">+ IA No. 14808/2009 in CS(OS) No. 2179/2009   Aveda Corporation v. Dabur India Ltd.   Page 5 of 11</span>
 support of his contention he relied upon SBL Ltd. v. Himalaya Drug Co. 1997

PTC (17) (<a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_4">DB) and Ruston and Hornby Ltd. v. Zamindara Engineering Co</a>. AIR

1970 SC 1649 wherein Supreme Court had observed as under:


</p><p id="p_13">                  7.      x     x       x      x     In       an      action     for
                  infringement where the defendant's trade mark is identical
                  with the plaintiff's mark, the Court will not inquire whether the
                  infringement is such as is likely to deceive or cause
                  confusion. But where the alleged infringement consists of
                  using not the exact mark on the Register, but something
                  similar to it the test of infringement is the same as in an
                  action for passing off. In other words, the test as to
                  likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of
                  marks is the same both in infringement and passing off
                  actions.
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><p id="p_15">8.                It is also argued by the defendant that mere registration of the

trademark without its use in India would not entitle the plaintiff to stop others from

using a mark which was different from that of the plaintiff but had some similarity

more so when word „Veda‟ was used by plaintiff with prefix „A‟ was being used by

the defendant with prefix „U‟. It is also submitted that defendant‟s name "Dabur"

was a well known brand and nobody could buy a cream of "Dabur" thinking it as

that of the plaintiff which was not a known brand in India. It is also submitted that

registration of a mark has a prima facie evidential value about its validity and

nothing more and this presumption was a rebuttable presumption and can be

displaced. Right created under Section 13 in favour of registered property was

not an absolute right to it was subservient to other provisions of the Act. He

relied upon <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_5">N.R.Dongre &amp; Ors. v. Whirlpool Corporation &amp; Ors</a>. AIR 1995 Delhi

300 wherein this Court had observed as under:

<p id="p_16">
</p><p id="p_17">                  30. x         x      "From a reading of the above sections it
                  is clear that registration of mark in the trade mark registry
                  would be irrelevant in an action for passing off.

                   Thus, the law is pretty well settled that in order to succeed at
                  this stage the appellant had to establish user of the aforesaid
                  mark prior in point of time than the impugned user by the
                  respondents. The registration of the said mark or similar
                  mark prior in point of time to user by the appellant is
                  irrelevant in an action for passing off and the mere presence
                  of the mark in the register maintained by the trade mark
                  registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose
                  names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for the
                  purposes of deciding the application for interim injunction
                  unless evidence had been led or was available of user of the
                  registered trademarks. In our opinion, these clear rules of
                  law were not kept in view by the learned single Judge and
                  led him to commit an error."
</p>
<p id="p_19">
</p><p id="p_20">9.                It is also submitted by the defendant that general rule was that the

generic-ness of a composite word is determined by examining the composite

word as a whole rather than examining it in isolation. Word „Aveda‟ was nothing

but distortion of word „Veda‟ similarly „Uveda‟ used by defendant was a distortion

of generic word „Veda‟ and the Court have not granted injunctions where the

generic words have been used.
</p>
<p id="p_21">

</p><p id="p_22">10.               The plaintiff‟s contention is that merely because the sale of the

plaintiff was only to one customer i.e. at a spa, could not be a ground for refusing

protection to plaintiff for its trademark. The quantum of sale is not a measure of

protection of the trademark. Moreover, the Court has to look upon the goodwill

generated by the plaintiff through its international campaign and advertisements

in reputed magazine like „Vogue‟. It is also submitted that the plaintiff‟s products

bearing trademark "Aveda" were displayed on number of websites including

www.aveda.com, www.ebay.com, www.beautyappointments.com and were easily

accessible to the customers who wanted to purchase the same.                                The word

"Aveda" was a coined word by the plaintiff and the plaintiff was entitled for

 protection. To fortify this point plaintiff had relied upon <a href="/doc/610677/" id="a_6">Essel Packaging Limited

v. Sridhar Narra &amp; Anr</a>. 2002(25)PTC 233 (Del.). The plaintiff submitted that the

trans-border reputation of the plaintiff had spread throughout India with the help

of internet, tv. etc and merely because the plaintiff had not marketed its product in

India for general consumption and was supplying only to its few exclusive

customers at a spa would not disentitle plaintiff to the protection. In support of this

argument plaintiff relied upon <a href="/doc/128046/" id="a_7">India Shaving Products Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Gift Pack &amp;

</p><p id="p_24">11.               It is further pleaded that merely because the word „Veda‟ was in

common domain would not prevent the plaintiff from getting protection.                               It is

submitted that even common word like „Veda‟ can be used by the plaintiff with a

prefix and would get as protection as trademark. He relied upon <a href="/doc/1181080/" id="a_9">Century Traders

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  21. We now come to the question of balance of
                  conveniences.      It has been urged on behalf of the
                  respondents that the mark "RAJARANI" is common to the
                  trade and for this purpose reliance has been placed on the
                  registration in Andhra Pradesh and Amritsar. There is a
                  distinction between a mark being "common on the register"
                  and "common to the trade". There is no evidence on record
                  to show that there is actual user of this mark by any party
                  other than the parties before us. Inasmuch as trade mark is
                  property right, an invasion of it should be protected and the
                  balance of convenience would obviously be in favour of the
                  appellant who was admittedly the first user of this mark. We
                  cannot accept that there is any prima facie evidence of
                  respondent No.3 being the owner of the mark. Indeed, this
                  is belied by the registration applications filed by the

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">12.               In order to grant an interim injunction under Order 39 Rule 1&amp;2

CPC, the Court has to consider if plaintiff had a prima facie case; second if the

plaintiff would suffer an irreparable loss and injury and third if the balance of

convenience lies in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. It is an

undisputed fact that the plaintiff‟s presence in India was miniscule. The product

of plaintiff was not available in the market and plaintiff was supplying only to one

spa in Rishikesh.          The question of arising of confusion among the common

customers thus does not arise. Spa in Rishikesh where the product of plaintiff is

used is not a common customer. Spa is a known spa which caters to the need of

high end customers and it is evident that the owners of spa, despite availability of

many other similar beauty products in India, are using particularly costly products

of plaintiff, only because they know about the product of the plaintiff, thus there is

no question of confusion as far as owners of spa is concerned. The product of

the plaintiff is not available in the market at any shop. The sample which plaintiff

brought to the Court also does not have any price tag in rupees, it only has a bar

code. Under these circumstances, the question that the defendant was making

an effort of passing off its product as that of plaintiff does not arise. It is not the

case of plaintiff that defendant has made any effort to export its products to any

person representing that this was product of the plaintiff thus, it is not a case of

 passing off.

<p id="p_26">13.               The issue of confusion even otherwise cannot arise because the

defendant‟s product clearly mentions that it is a product of „Dabur‟, though the

font of „Dabur‟ is smaller than the font of "Uveda" but the defendant can be told to

make the two fonts equal so that „Dabur‟ is written on the product equally

prominent. It may appear that the defendant was inspired by using the word

„Uveda‟ because of this word is associated with „Veda‟ and the plaintiff has prior

registration of word „Aveda‟ as a trademark in its name and ultimately the Court

may come to the conclusion that use of word „Uveda‟ amounted to infringement

of the trade mark of the plaintiff but mere prima facie case is not sufficient to

grant an interim injunction. Along with prima facie case, the Court has to see two

other factors viz. balance of convenience and irreparable injury. The plaintiff,

who has no market in India and was supplying to only one spa cannot claim to be

suffering irreparable injury. All bills which have been attached by the plaintiff are

in respect of sales, not in India but outside India. In India its sale is limited only to

one spa. It does not seem to be a case where plaintiff would suffer an irreparable

injury in case the injunction is refused. The plaintiff can always be compensated

by costs in case ultimately it is found that defendant tried to capture the market

on the basis of goodwill of the plaintiff‟s product. The price difference between

the product of the plaintiff and defendant was also so much that defendant was

catering to the different strata of market than the one being catered by the

plaintiff. Under these circumstances, I do not think that any irreparable loss or

injury was going to be caused to the plaintiff. The balance of convenience also

does not lie in favour of the plaintiff. In case the defendant is restrained from

 marketing its product, the defendant would suffer a loss of around Rs.1 crore in

respect of pipeline products whereas the plaintiff has no market in India and its

supplies to the spa were not going to be affected, since the spa was using

plaintiff‟s product knowing fully well that it was not defendant‟s product and

Dabur‟s "Uveda" was a different brand from that of plaintiff. In view of these

circumstances, I consider that mere prima facie case would not suffice to grant

an interim injunction, other two factors viz. balance of convenience and

irreparable injury should also be present for granting injunction under Order 39

Rule 1&amp;2 CPC.

</p><p id="p_28">14.               The ends of justice would be served in case the defendant is

directed that it would use the word „Dabur‟ more prominently and in a larger font

as UVEDA on all future packaging of its cream, and the defendant is directed to

maintain an account of sales of all its products under the mark "Uveda" so that if

ultimately incase, the Court upholds the right of the plaintiff to claim damages

from the defendant the damages can be determined. With this, the application is

disposed of and defendant is directed as above.
