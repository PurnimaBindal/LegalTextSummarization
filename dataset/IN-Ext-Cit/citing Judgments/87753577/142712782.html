Per Court:
</p>
<p id="p_2">1              I have heard the learned Advocate for the Petitioner, the

learned AGP and the learned Advocate on behalf of Respondent No.2.

2              I have also perused the order passed by this Court (Coram :

Sunil P. Deshmukh, J.) dated 02.09.2015 by which, the Petitioner has

been granted the ad-interim relief. The said relief has been continued for a

period of about three and half years.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3              The learned AGP points out that after lodging of this petition,

the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_1">Gurudassing

Nawoosing Panjwani vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a>, 2016 (2)

SCC 213 has been reported and the Honourable Supreme Court has laid

down the law that a second revision is a statutory remedy available.

4              The learned Advocate for the Petitioner submits that the

Respondents are rendered strangers to the property at issue since they

have sold the property to the persons from whom the Petitioner has

purchased the property by the registered sale deed. With this admitted

position, unless the Respondents succeed in getting the sale deed declared

as null and void, there would not be any cause of action to initiate any

litigation against the Petitioner, much less of the nature of challenging a

mutation entry.
</p>
<p id="p_4">5              Though the learned Advocate for the Petitioner appears

forceful, the fact remains that a statutory remedy is available. Though the

learned Advocate for Respondent No.2 opposes, I am of the view that the

ad-interim relief granted three and half years ago might as well, be

continued till the revision petition is decided within a time frame.

6              Considering the above, this Writ Petition is disposed of. The

Petitioner shall file his revision petition within four weeks from today

before the appropriate authority under Section 247 of the Maharashtra

Land Revenue Code. If it is filed within the said period of four weeks, ad-

interim relief granted by this Court on 02.09.2015 shall continue till

30.09.2019 or till the second revision is decided, whichever is earlier. The

litigating sides would cooperate with the second revisional authority and

the said authority shall decide the said revision on or before 30.09.2019.
