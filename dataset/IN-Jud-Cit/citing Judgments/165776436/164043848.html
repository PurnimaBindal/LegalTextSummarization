M/s. GlaxoSmithKline Asia Pvt. Ltd. and the respondent No.8,

MSD Pharmaceuticals Private Limited, respectively for preventing

cervical cancer in women and the experimentation of the vaccine

was done as an immunization by the Governments of Gujarat

and Andhra Pradesh (before bifurcation, the State of Andhra

Pradesh, eventually the State of Andhra Pradesh and the State of

Telangana) with the charity provided by the respondent No.6,

namely, PATH International. The issue also arose with regard to

the untimely death of certain persons and grant of compensation.

Certain orders were passed by this Court from time to time.

</p><p id="p_5">2.   A stage came in the life span of this litigation, which is still

in continuation, when the Court vide order dated 12th August,

2014, had posed the following questions:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     “i) Whether before the drug was accepted to be used
     as a vaccine in India, the Drugs Controller General of
     India and the ICMR had followed the procedure for said
     introduction?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     ii) What is the action taken after the Parliamentary
     Committee had submitted the           72 nd report on
     30.08.2013?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">     iii) What are the reasons for choosing certain places in
     Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     iv) What has actually caused the deaths and other
     ailments who had been administered the said vaccine?

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     v)   Assuming this vaccine has been administered,
     regard being had to the nature of the vaccine, being not

     an ordinary one, what steps have been taken for
     monitoring the same by the competent authorities of the
     Union of India, who are concerned with health of the
     nation as well as the State Governments who have an
     equal role in this regard?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">     vi) The girls who were administered the vaccine,
     whether proper consent has been taken from their
     parents/guardians, as we have been apprised at the Bar
     that the young girls had not reached the age of
     majority?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">     vii) What protocol is required to be observed/followed,
     assuming this kind of vaccination is required to be
     carried out?”

</blockquote><p id="p_6">3.   In the said order, the Court had also directed as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     “At this juncture, we are obligated to state the Union of
     India, who is required to assist this Court in proper
     perspective, shall direct its competent authority to
     produce the file by which the Drugs Controller General
     of India had approved the vaccine for introduction in
     India. Mr. Suri, learned senior counsel for the Union of
     India will produce the said file.       Additionally, the
     relevant documents shall also be provided to the
     concerned counsel for the petitioners.”

</blockquote><p id="p_7">4.   In the course of proceedings, affidavits were filed by the

Union of India and the State of Gujarat. Learned counsel for the

petitioners, Mr. Colin Gonsalves in Writ Petition (C) No. 558 of

2012 and Mr. Anand Grover in Writ Petition (C) No. 921 of 2013

had drawn the attention of this Court to the 81 st Report dated

22nd December, 2014 of the Parliamentary Standing Committee.

Be it noted, when the report of the Parliamentary Standing

Committee was produced, the question arose with regard to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                   4</span>

“concept of consent” for administration of vaccine and the

resultant illness suffered by the victims and such other issues

and the Court had issued certain directions for filing of affidavits

pertaining to steps that have been taken by the concerned

Governments keeping in view the various instructions given from

time to time including what has been stated in the report of the

Parliamentary Standing Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_8">5.   It is worthy to note here that certain affidavits were filed

about the safety measures being undertaken with regard to the

consent and the method of trial and the improvements made

thereon.   In essence, the stand of the Union of India and the

States was that the vaccine was necessary and steps have been

taken to avoid any kind of hazards.        That apart, the factual

allegations made by the petitioners were also controverted.

</p><p id="p_9">6.   On 18th November, 2015, an issue was raised by the learned

senior counsel appearing for the respondent No. 8, MSD

Pharmaceuticals Private Limited and by the learned Additional

Solicitor General whether this Court while exercising the power of

judicial review or its expansive jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article 32</a>

dealing with the public interest litigation, can advert to the report

of the Parliamentary Standing Committee and on that basis issue

directions. After the said issue was posed, the learned counsel
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                                           5</span>

for the parties sought time to file written notes of submissions

and argue the matter.       Regard being had to importance of the

matter, assistance of the learned Attorney General for India was

sought.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.     Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney General for India has

filed a written note of submission contending, inter alia, that the

reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee are at best

external   aids   of    construction    in   order     to   determine    the

surrounding circumstances or the historical facts for the purpose

of discerning the mischief sought to be remedied, but not for any

other purpose. He has referred to certain authorities which we

shall refer to in the course of our deliberation. We may clarify

that    though    Mr.   Rohatgi   has    filed   the    written   note    of

submissions, today we have been assisted by Mr. Ranjit Kumar,

learned Solicitor General, Mr. A.K. Panda and Mr. Ajit Kumar

Sinha, learned senior counsel and Mrs. Rekha Pandey, learned

counsel on behalf of Union of India.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.     Mr. Grover and Mr. Gonsalves, learned senior counsel

appearing for the petitioners, who intend to reply on the report of

the Parliamentary Standing Committee submitted that looking at

the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee by this

Court in a writ petition preferred under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2">Article 32</a> of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                    6</span>

Constitution is only to be apprised about facts to arrive at a

conclusion for the purpose of issue of necessitous directions and

there cannot be absolute rule that it cannot be looked at.

According to them, there is no impediment to rely on the said

report as the reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee

are put on the website and in such a situation, the Court can

always take aid of the report not only for the purpose of

understanding the legislative intendment of a legislation, but also

for taking the facts into consideration to issue any prerogative

writ. Learned senior counsel would contend that as long as the

reference to report does not violate the freedom of speech of the

members of the Committee or there is no attempt to impugn the

report or criticize the same, reliance on the same should not be

prohibited.   It is urged by Mr. Gonsalves that the role of the

Parliament in the modern democracy has gone beyond the

traditional concept and the perception is to have a transparent

society and when there is access to the report, there is no

warrant not to utilize the same in a proceeding before the Court.

</p><p id="p_12">9.   Learned senior counsel appearing for the Union of India

would in reply submit that the arguments advanced by the

learned counsel for the petitioners are to be tested on the

constitutional   parameters    and    various   Articles   of   the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                           7</span>

Constitution are to be read in proper perspective. It is asserted

by him that the constitutional scheme does not favour the

interpretation which is sought to be placed by the learned

counsel for the petitioners. According to the learned counsel for

Union of India, the report of the Parliamentary Standing

Committees    are    meant      to    guide    the    functioning   of   the

departments and work as a precursor to the debate in Parliament

but not meant to be used in court as it does not countenance any

contest in a court of law.
</p>
<p id="p_13">10. To appreciate the controversy, we may usefully refer to the

Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of Lok Sabha Rules

(for short, &#x27;the Rules&#x27;).       Rule 2 of the Rules defines the

“Parliamentary Committee”.           For the sake of completeness, we

reproduce the same:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     ““Parliamentary Committee” means a Committee which
     is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by
     the Speaker and which works under the direction of the
     Speaker and presents its report to the House or to the
     Speaker and the Secretariat for which is provided by the
     Lok Sabha Secretariat.”

</blockquote><p id="p_14">11. Chapter     26   of   the    Rules        deals   with   Parliamentary

Committees and the matters regarding appointment, quorum,

decisions of the committee, etc.               There are two kinds of

Parliamentary Committees: (i) Standing Committees, and                   (ii)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                8</span>

Adhoc Committees.        The Standing Committees are categorized

by their nature of functions. The Standing Committees of the Lok

Sabha are as follows:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">     “a)    Financial Committees;

     b)      Subject Committees or Departmentally related

</pre><p id="p_16">             departmentally related Standing Committees
             under various ministries.”

</p><p id="p_17">12. From the aforesaid, it is quite clear that there are various

departmentally related Standing Committees under various

Ministries. It is apt to note here that in the case at hand, Rule

270 of the Rules which deals with the functions of the

Parliamentary Committee meant for Committees Rajya Sabha is

relevant. It reads as follows:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                10</span><p id="p_18">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">     “270. Functions

           Each of the Standing Committees shall have the
     following functions, namely:—

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     (a)   to consider the Demands for Grants of the related
           Ministries/ Departments and report thereon. The
           report shall not suggest anything of the nature of
           cut motions;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">     (b)   to examine Bills, pertaining to the related
           Ministries/  Departments,     referred to the
           Committee by the Chairman or the Speaker, as
           the case may be, and report thereon;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">     (c)   to consider the annual reports of the
           Ministries/Departments and report thereon; and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">     (d)   to consider national basic long term policy
           documents presented to the Houses, if referred to
           the Committee by the Chairman or the Speaker,
           as the case may be, and report thereon: Provided
           that the Standing Committees shall not consider
           matters of day-to-day administration of the
           related Ministries/Departments.”


</blockquote><p id="p_19">13. Rule 271 provides for applicability of provisions relating to

functions. Rule 274 deals with the report of the Committee. The

said Rule reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     “274. Report of the Committee

     (1) The report of the Standing Committee shall be
     based on broad consensus.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">     (2) Any member of the Committee may record a
     minute of dissent on the report of the Committee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">     (3) The report of the Committee, together with the
     minutes of dissent, if any, shall be presented to the
     Houses.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                               11</span>



</blockquote><p id="p_20">14. Rule 274(3) is extremely significant, for it provides that the

report of the Committee together with the Minutes of the dissent,

if any, is to be presented to the House. Rule 277 stipulates that

the report is to have persuasive value.     The said Rule is as

follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">     “277. Reports to have persuasive value.— The report
     of a Standing Committee shall have persuasive value
     and shall be treated as considered advice given by the
     Committee.”

</blockquote><p id="p_21">15. Relying on the said Rule, it is argued by the learned counsel

for the petitioners that the report of the Standing Committee has

a persuasive value and hence, it can be taken note of for the

purpose of fact finding by this Court. The learned counsel for the

Union of India, on the contrary, would contend that as per the

scheme of the Rules, it is meant to have persuasive value and

considered as an advice given by the Standing Committee to the

Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_22">16. It is submitted on behalf of the Union of India that the Rules

277 – 279 deal with submission of the Report of the Committee

and provide that if no time frame is given, the same would be

submitted within a month from the appointment of the

Committee and the reports shall be presented to the House by

the Chairperson. It is further urged that the reports submitted by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                                                 12</span>

the different Committees are examined/debated by the House

and only thereafter they are adopted. Our attention has been

drawn to Rule 277 and Rule 278 made for Lok Sabha which

provide for Scope of Advice regarding reports submitted by

Select/Joint Committees. In essence, the purpose of reliance is,

it is a matter of concern to the debates in the Parliament.

</p><p id="p_23">17. At this juncture, we may look at the origin and working of

the Parliamentary Committee. The Committee system in India,

as has been stated in “The Committee System in India :

Effectiveness in Enforcing Executive Accountability”, Hanoi

Session, March 2015, is as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     “The origin of the Committee system in India can be
     traced back to the Constitutional Reforms of 1919. The
     Standing Orders of the Central Legislative Assembly
     provided for a Committee on Petitions relating to Bills,
     Select Committee on Amendments of Standing Orders,
     and Select Committee on Bills. There was also a
     provision for a Public Accounts Committee and a Joint
     Committee on a Bill. Apart from Committees of the
     Legislative Assembly, members of both Houses of the
     Central Legislature also served on the Standing
     Advisory Committees attached to various Departments
     of the Government of India. All these committees were
     purely advisory in character and functioned under the
     control of the Government with the Minister-incharge of
     the Department acting as the Chairman of the
     Committee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">          After the Constitution came into force, the position
     of the Central Legislative Assembly changed altogether
     and the committee system underwent transformation.
     Not only did the number of committees increase, but
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                                  13</span>

       their functions and powers were also enlarged.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">            By their nature, Parliamentary Committees are of
       two kinds: Standing Committees and Ad hoc
       Committees. Standing Committees are permanent and
       regular committees which are constituted from time to
       time in pursuance of the provisions of an Act of
       Parliament or Rules of Procedure and Conduct of
       Business in Lok Sabha. The work of these Committees
       is of continuous nature. The Financial Committees,
       Departmentally Related Standing Committees (DRSCs)
       and some other Committees come under the category of
       Standing Committees. Ad hoc Committees are
       appointed for a specific purpose and they cease to exist
       when they finish the task assigned to them and submit
       a report. The principal Ad hoc Committees are the
       Select and Joint Committees on Bills. Railway
       Convention Committee, Joint Committee on Food
       Management in Parliament House Complex, etc. also
       come under the category of ad hoc Committees.”

</blockquote><p id="p_24">18. In the said document in respect of Standing Committees of

Parliament, it has been observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">       “Standing Committees are those which are periodically
       elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker, Lok
       Sabha, or the Chairman, Rajya Sabha, singly or jointly
       and are permanent in nature. In terms of their
       functions, Standing Committees may be classified into
       two categories. One category of Committees like the
       Departmentally Related Standing Committees (DRSCs),
       Financial Committees etc., scrutinize the functioning of
       the Government as per their respective mandate. The

issues. As is indicated hereinbefore, Mr. Grover and Mr.

Gonsalves, learned senior appearing for the writ petitioners,

would contend that the executive being accountable to the

Parliamentary Standing Committee, the report of the Committee

which is in the public domain and hence, that can be relied upon

by them to buttress a fact situation and in any way, establish it.

Learned counsel for the Union of India and the contesting

respondents, per contra, would urge that the Parliamentary

Standing Committee report cannot be tendered as a piece of

evidence to prove a fact and once it is referred to, it invites a

contest and criticism.

<p id="p_26">20. We may fruitfully state that the procedure of the Committee

is neither inquisitorial nor adjudicative. It has its own character.

The procedure is sui generis. In the Westminister system,

Parliament also deals with the matter of accountability of the

executive and standing Committees of Parliament, on many an

occasion, examine the propriety and wisdom of the conduct of

the executive. The reports of the Committees are for the

assistance of Parliament. The procedure for drawing up such

reports, is entirely a matter for the Committee and it has

authority to receive evidence from witnesses – but it is for their

own assistance.       No person has a right to be heard by the

Committee even if the Committee is examining a matter which

may result in an adverse comment on the conduct of such

person. The principles of natural justice are not applicable.

      Government obligating it to bring the provisions of
      <a href="/doc/78418978/" id="a_6">Section 3</a> into force. The Parliament having left to the
      unfettered judgment of the Central Government the
      question as regards the time for bringing the provisions
      of the 44th Amendment into force, it is not for the court
      to compel the government to do that which, according to
      the mandate of the Parliament, lies in its discretion to
      do when it considers it opportune to do it.          The
      executive is responsible to the Parliament and if the
      Parliament considers that the executive has betrayed its
      trust by not bringing any provision of the Amendment
      into force, it can censure the executive. It would be
      quite anomalous that the inaction of the executive
      should have the approval of the Parliament and yet we
      should show our disapproval of it by issuing a
      mandamus. The court&#x27;s power of judicial review in
      such cases has to be capable of being exercised both
      positively and negatively, if needed it has that power:
      positively, by issuing a mandamus calling upon the
      government to act and negatively by inhibiting it from
      acting. If it were permissible to the court to compel the
      government by a mandamus to bring a constitutional
      amendment into force on the ground that the
      government has failed to do what it ought to have done,
      it would be equally permissible to the court to prevent
      the government from acting, on some such ground as
      that, the time was not yet ripe for issuing the
      notification for bringing the Amendment into force.”

the power to direct the Parliament to bring an Act into force.

thrust on the point that there cannot be a combat or dispute over

the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee in a court of

law and, therefore, the respondents are debarred from contesting

the same and that is the singular ground not to place reliance

upon the same.

charges levelled against the person concerned do not amount to

misbehavior and may decide not to adopt the motion. Though

the decision was rendered in a different context, it has been

taken aid of to bolster the proposition that the report of the

Kumar Agrawal vs. Union of India</a> and others6, wherein it has

been stated in the context of the report of the Comptroller and

Auditor General of India (CAG) that the report of the CAG is

always subject to Parliamentary debates and it is possible that

the Parliamentary Accounts Committee can accept the Ministry&#x27;s

objection to the CAG report or reject the report of the CAG. What

has been stated is that CAG though indisputably is an

independent        constitutional   functionary,   yet   it   is   for   the

Parliament to decide whether after receiving the report, i.e. the

Parliamentary Accounts Committee to make its comments on the

power of the Parliament and its supremacy within its sphere.

</blockquote><p id="p_51">42. What is necessary to understand from <a href="/doc/1347342/" id="a_33">Article 105(2)</a> is that

no member of the Parliament can be made liable for any

proceeding in any court because of what he has stated in a

committee.   The   Parliamentary    Standing    Committee    is   a

committee constituted under the Rules and what a member

speaks over there is absolutely within the domain of that

committee. Freedom of speech of a member of a Committee is

only guided subject to provisions of the Constitution and the

Rules   and   standing   orders   regulating   the   procedure    of

Parliament.    It is also seemly to note that <a href="/doc/986670/" id="a_34">Article 105(4)</a>

categorically lays the postulate that clauses 1, 2 and 3 shall

apply to any committee of the Parliament.
</p>
<p id="p_52">43. <a href="/doc/1670439/" id="a_35">Article 118</a> deals with rules of procedure. Clause 1 of the

said Article stipulates that each House of Parliament may make

rules for regulating, subject to the provisions of the Constitution,

its procedure and the conduct of its business.       Thus, the said

Article empowers the Parliament to regulate its procedure apart

from what has been stated directly in the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_53">44. <a href="/doc/598239/" id="a_36">Article 121</a> provides restriction on discussion in Parliament.

The same is extracted below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">     “121.     Restriction on discussion in Parliament.–
     (1) No discussion shall take place in Parliament with
     respect to the conduct of any Judge of the Supreme
     Court or of a High Court in the discharge of his duties
     except upon a motion for presenting an address to the
     President praying for the removal of the Judge as
     hereinafter provided.”


</blockquote><p id="p_54">45. The aforesaid Article makes it vivid that the Parliament shall

not discuss as regards the conduct of any Judge of the Supreme

Court or of a High Court in the discharge of his duties, except

upon a motion been presented before the President of India

praying for removal of the Judge as provided in the Constitution.

Thus, the discussion of the Parliament is restricted by a

constitutional provision.
</p>
<p id="p_55">46. <a href="/doc/1283667/" id="a_37">Article 122</a> stipulates a restraint on courts to inquire into

proceedings of the Parliament. The said Article being absolutely

significant is reproduced below:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">     “122.      Courts not to inquire into proceedings of
     Parliament.– (1) The validity of any proceedings in
     Parliament shall not be called in question on the ground
     of any alleged irregularity of procedure.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">     (2) No officer or member of Parliament in whom
     powers are vested by or under this Constitution for
     regulating procedure or the conduct of business, or for
     maintaining order, in Parliament shall be subject to the
     jurisdiction of any court in respect of the exercise by
     him of those powers.”

</blockquote><p id="p_56">47. The purpose of referring to the aforesaid Articles is that

while exercising the power of judicial review or to place reliance

on the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee, the

doctrine of restraint has to be applied by this Court as required

under the Constitution. What is argued by the learned counsel

for the petitioners is that there is no question of any kind of

judicial review from this Court or attributing anything on the

conduct of any of the members of the Committee, but to look at

the report for understanding the controversy before us.         The

submission “looking at the report,” as we perceive, is nothing but

placing reliance thereupon. The view of a member of the

Parliament   or   a   member   of   the   Parliamentary   Standing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                                  29</span>

Committee who enjoys freedom of speech and expression within

the constitutional parameters and the rules or regulations

framed by the Parliament inside the Parliament or the Committee

is not to be adverted to by the court in a lis.

</p><p id="p_57">48. In this regard, it is appropriate to refer to the observations

made by the House of Lords in Hamilton v. Al Fayed31:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">       “The Court of Appeal held, first, that apart from any
       question of parliamentary privilege the principle in
       Hunter’s case [1982] AC 529 had no application: a par-
       liamentary decision was not analogous to a decision of
       the court. Next, the Court of Appeal held that the pro-
       ceedings before the PCS, his report and its acceptance
       by the CSP were all “parliamentary proceedings” and
       therefore any attempt to investigate or challenge any of
       the procedures adopted constituted a breach of parlia-
       mentary privilege: they constituted a “questioning” of
       parliamentary procedures. They therefore held that the
       judge had been in error and had himself breached par-
       liamentary procedure by criticizing the procedures
       adopted by the PCS. The conclusion of the Court of Ap-
       peal on these two points met the concerns of the Solici-
       tor General. The Court of Appeal were clearly correct on
       these points and they were not further challenged on
       appeal to your Lordship’s House….
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">       Presumably because of the way the case was presented
       to them, the Court of Appeal never considered the rele-
       vant question (viz whether there should be a fair trial
       stay) raised by question 2 of the summons. The only
       way in which Mr Al Fayed could justify his defamatory
       statements was by detailed challenge to Mr Hamilton’s
       conduct in Parliament, which challenge would be pre-</blockquote><p id="p_58">
</p><p id="p_59">       cluded by parliamentary privilege. That being so it
       would in my judgment have been impossible for Mr Al
       Fayed to have had a fair trial in this action if he had
       been precluded from challenging the evidence produced
31 [2001] 1 A.C. 395
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                 30</span>

     to the parliamentary committees on behalf of Mr. Hamil-
     ton. Had it not been for <a href="/doc/69160841/" id="a_38">section 13</a>, the court should, in
     my judgment, have stayed the libel action brought by
     Mr. Hamilton by making an order under paragraph 2 of
     the summons. However, <a href="/doc/69160841/" id="a_39">section 13</a> does apply to this
     case and provides a complete answer to it.”

</p><p id="p_60">49. We will be failing in our duty if we do not note another

submission of the learned Solicitor General that for issuance of a

writ of mandamus, it is primary to establish that one has a right

and, in the case at hand, an effort has been made to rely on the

Parliamentary Standing Committee&#x27;s report to create a right

which is legally not permissible.
</p>
<p id="p_61">50. The controversy has to be seen from the perspective of

judicial review.   The basic principle of judicial review is to

ascertain the propriety of the decision making process on the

parameters of reasonableness and propriety of the executive

decisions.    We are not discussing about the parameters

pertaining to the challenge of amendments to the Constitution or

the constitutionality of a statute. When a writ of mandamus is

sought on the foundation of a factual score, the Court is required

to address the facts asserted and the averments made and what

has been stated in oppugnation. Once the Court is asked to look

at the report, the same can be challenged by the otherside, for it

cannot be accepted without affording an opportunity of being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                                                     31</span>

heard to the respondents.           The invitation      to contest a

Parliamentary Standing Committee report is likely to disturb the

delicate balance that the Constitution provides between the

constitutional institutions.     If the Court allows contest and

adjudicates on the report, it may run counter to the spirit of

privilege of Parliament which the Constitution protects.

</p><p id="p_62">51. As advised at present, we are prima facie of the view that the

Parliamentary Standing Committee report may not be tendered

as a document to augment the stance on the factual score that a

particular activity is unacceptable or erroneous. However, regard

being had to the substantial question of law relating to

interpretation    of   the   Constitution   involved,   we   think   it

appropriate that the issue be referred to the Constitution Bench

under <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_40">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution. We frame the following

questions for the purpose of reference to the Constitution

Bench:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">     (i)   Whether in a litigation filed before this Court either

           under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_41">Article 32</a> or <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_42">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of

           India, the Court can refer to and place reliance

           upon the report of the Parliamentary Standing

           Committee?

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">     (ii) Whether such a Report can be looked at for the

         purpose of reference and, if so, can there be

         restrictions for the purpose of reference regard

         being had to the concept of parliamentary privilege

         and the delicate balance between the constitutional

         institutions that Articles 105, 121 and 122 of the

         Constitution conceive?
