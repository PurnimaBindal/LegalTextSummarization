dated 16.12.2010 passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Jabalpur 


in Writ Petition No. 1360 of 2009. 
</p>
<p id="p_4">


</p><p id="p_5">2.                Facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are as under: 


A.        In the year 1972, the State of Madhya Pradesh conceived a dam 


          to   provide   irrigation   facilities   to   farmers   of   Khargone     district. 


          The   dam,   on   filling   upto   full,   would   cause   submergence   of 


      1258.59 hectares  of  land, out  of  which 1037.715  is  private   and 


      206.635 is government  and 14.24 hectares is  forest land.


B.    On   10.1.1992,   a   detailed   Project   Report   was   prepared   and 


      submitted to the State Government and  the Final Project Report 


      was   approved   by   Technical   Committee   of   Central   Water 


      Commission vide order dated 6.5.1997. Clearance to the project 


      was given by the Government of India. It was on 10.10.2002 that 


      the project was accorded Environmental and Forest clearance.  


C.    The Cabinet of Ministers in its meeting dated 4.10.2002 approved 


      payment of Special Rehabilitation Grant (hereinafter called SRG) 


      to be paid to oustees, who would not ask for land in lieu of land 


      acquired. As a consequence thereof, order dated 28.12.2002  was 


      issued to the same effect in the name of the Governor of the State 


      of Madhya Pradesh. 
</p>
<p id="p_6">
D.    On   23.5.2004,   construction   of   dam   site   commenced   and   was 


      completed   upto   crest   level   in   the   year   2008;   only   gates   were 


      required to be installed so as to achieve full reservoir level of 317 


      metres.   Subsequent   thereto,   Notification   dated   5.3.2008   was 


      issued   regarding   submergence   of   four   villages,   namely,   Sonud, 


      Nimit, Bedhaniya and Khamid.

E.         Appellant   approached   the   High   Court   by   filing   writ   petition 


No.   1360   of   2009   claiming   various   reliefs,  inter-alia,  to   stop   further 


construction which may cause submergence so that displaced families 


are resettled and rehabilitated in 6 months before the submergence;   to 


direct State Government to provide irrigated agricultural land to eligible 


oustees   including   encroachers   and   landless   labourers;     to   declare   the 


order   dated   7.6.1991   passed   by   Narmada   Valley   Development 


Department (hereinafter called NVDD) amending para 5.1   of the Re-


settlement   and   Rehabilitation   Policy,   1991   (hereinafter   called   R   &amp;   R 


Policy) to be ultra vires and unconstitutional, being arbitrary and mala 


fides. 
</p>
<p id="p_8">
F.         The State Authorities opposed the writ petition contending that 


the validity of the R &amp; R Policy had already been upheld by the courts; 


landless labourers  were not entitled for allotment of agricultural  land; 


the writ petition was filed at much belated stage, i.e. after completion of 


the   dam;   appellant   had   an   alternative   efficacious   remedy     before   the 


Grievance  Redressal Authority (hereinafter  called GRA);   amendment 


in para 5.1 of the R &amp; R Policy was only procedural, and carried out 


legally and was thus valid; even otherwise the amendment to para 5.1 


was   inconsequential   because   the   allotment   of   land   for   the   oustees   is

provided under Clause 3 of the R &amp; R Policy and amendment carried 


out   in   Clause   3   of   the   Policy   at   subsequent   stage   had   not   been 


challenged by the appellant. 
</p>
<p id="p_9">
G.         The High Court considered the rival submissions advanced on 


behalf   of   the   parties   and   held   that   challenge   to   the   validity   of   the 


amendment   dated   7.6.1991   was   belated   and   could   not   be   entertained. 


The   alternative   remedy   before   the   GRA   was   efficacious   and   no 


extraordinary situation prevailed warranting the High Court to interfere 


at such a stage. The landless labourers were not entitled for allotment of 


agricultural land. The oustees had been offered grant; the value of their 


land   had   also   been   assessed   under   the   <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_1">Land   Acquisition   Act</a>,   1894 


(hereinafter   called   `the   Act   1894').   Person   aggrieved,   if   any,   can 


approach  the GRA if  he is not satisfied with the reliefs granted to him 


in terms of the R &amp; R Policy. After taking the aforesaid view, the High 


Court issued various directions including:   to install radial gates, block 


sluice gates and to fill up dam upto 310 metres; when canal network is 


ready, the Government could approach the Court to fill up the dam to 


317 metres; the Government would ensure that land oustees were given 


benefits to which they are entitled under the R &amp; R Policy within four

weeks; and that persons aggrieved, if any, were at liberty to agitate the 


grievances in respect of  reliefs before the GRA.

</p><p id="p_12">3.        Ms.   Chittaroopa   Palit,   representative   of   the   appellant,   has 


raised before us all the issues which had been agitated before the High 


Court, including the right of oustees for allotment of land in lieu of land 


acquired   and   non-compliance   of   R&amp;R   Policy   is   violative   of 


fundamental   rights   of   the   oustees   enshrined   in   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_2">Article   21</a>   of   the 


Constitution.  It has further been submitted  by her that the amendment 


in Clause 5.1 of the R &amp; R Policy was null and void as it has not been 


carried out in accordance with the procedure prescribed under <a href="/doc/141478/" id="a_3">Section 


21</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897 as well as the provisions of  <a href="/doc/500615/" id="a_4">Article 


166(2)</a> and   <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_5">(3)</a> of the Constitution of India.   Clause 5.1 of the R &amp; R 


Policy could not be amended in violation of Rule 7(viii) of Part II of the 


Business Rules.  And that since the Ministry of Welfare, Government of 


India, has accorded clearance to the project with a clear understanding 


that landless   labourers  would  also  be  allotted  agricultural   land  and as 


the   same   has   not   been   complied   with,   the   High   Court's   judgment 


requires interference.

appearing   for   the   respondents   has   vehemently   opposed   the   appeal 


contending that Clause  5.1 of the R &amp; R Policy deals  with procedure 


only.   Entitlement for allotment   of land   is provided under Clause 3.2 


of the R &amp; R Policy and as the amendment to the said clause was not 


challenged,   amendment   to   Clause   5.1   remains   inconsequential.   Dam 


construction started in   year 2004 and compensation for land acquired 


had been determined much ago. By December 2002, the benefit of SRG 


had also been given to the oustees.  The writ petition was filed in year 


2008  after  the  dam stood   fully  constructed.   At  the  time   of   filing   the 


writ petition  there was no challenge to Clause 5.1 of the R &amp; R Policy, 


rather   it   was   challenged   seeking   amendment   by   filing   an   application 


dated 11.5.2010. Amendment to Clause 5.1 of  R &amp; R Policy  has been 


in conformity with the Business Rules  of the Government and  all the 


orders in this respect had been passed in the name of the Governor. The 


Council of Ministers had delegated the power to the NVDD and to the 


Hon'ble   Minister   for   Rehabilitation   and   in   case   there   was   any 


difference between the said two Hon'ble Ministers, the matter would be 


referred to the Hon'ble Chief Minister. The law permits delegation of 


power to make routine changes in subordinate legislation. Therefore, no

lieu   of   the   land   acquired,   for   the   simple   reason   that   there   was   no 


amendment  in year 1991 to Clause  3.2 of the   R &amp; R Policy and the 


amendment   to   the   said   Clause   3.2   incorporated   on   27.4.2002   is   not 


under challenge.  The amendment under challenge simply facilitated an 


oustee   to   claim   compensation   instead   of   land.     This   may   be   for   the 


reason that oustee may be willing to settle in another State or in urban 


area or   wants to adopt any other vocation/profession or wants to start 


any   other   business.   However,   it   does   not   take   away   the   right   of   any 


oustee to claim the land in lieu of the land acquired.  Therefore, in our 


opinion, amendment to Clause 5.1 remains inconsequential so far as the 


right   of   an   oustee   to   claim   land   in   lieu   of   the   land   acquired   is

<p id="p_51">

"The   President   as   well   as   the   Governor   is   the  

constitutional   or   formal   head.   The   President   as  

well   as   the   Governor   exercises   his   powers   and  

functions   conferred   on   him   by   or   under   the  

Constitution on the aid and advice of his Council  

of Ministers, save in spheres where the Governor  

is   required   by   or   under   the   Constitution   to  

exercise  his  functions in his  discretion.  Wherever  

the   Constitution   requires   the   satisfaction   of   the  

President or the Governor for the exercise by the  

President   or   the   Governor   of   any   power   or  

function,   the   satisfaction   required   by   the  

Constitution is not the personal satisfaction of the  

President   or   Governor   but   the   satisfaction   of   the  

President or Governor in the constitutional  sense  

in   the   Cabinet   system   of   Government,   that   is,  

satisfaction  of his  Council  of  Ministers  on  whose  

aid   and   advice   the   President   or   the   Governor  

generally   exercises   all   his   powers   and   functions.  

The   decision   of   any   Minister   or   officer   under  

Rules   of   Business   made   under   any   of   these   two  

Articles   77(3)   and   166(3)   is   the   decision   of   the  

President   or   the   Governor   respectively.   These  

articles   did   not   provide   for   any   delegation.

a provision permitting sub-delegation is merely supplementary and can

Government's executive business was carried on.

While   upholding   the   order   of   detention,   the   court   held   that   the

       It   is   impermissible   in   law   to   read   a   part   of   the   document   in 


isolation. The document is to be read as a whole. The letter of approval 


mentions  "allotting a minimum of 2 hectares of land for all landless  


labourers"  and says that unmarried major daughters would be treated 


as   separate   entities   for   that   particular   purpose,   i.e.   of   allotting   2 


hectares of land. Ms. Palit never pleaded the cause of unmarried major

entitlement   of   major   sons   and   daughters   of   oustees   for   allotment   of 


land in negative in  Narmada Bachao Andolan  III  (supra). Thereby, 


Ms. Palit mistakenly relied on the clearance letter by the Ministry of

itself a precondition for granting clearance to the project.

labourers as a condition, the Government of M.P. did not accept such a 


condition.  The Ministry of Welfare's clearance was not statutory,   like

any other statutory clearance e.g. clearance granted by Environment and 


Forest Ministry.   There is nothing in that clearance as to what would be 


the   consequence   for   non-compliance   with   those   conditions.   More   so, 


subsequent thereto, it is evident from the record that representations had 


been   filed   on   behalf   of   the   oustees   before   the   Ministry   of   Welfare. 


However, no action had ever been taken by the Ministry of Welfare that 


the   terms   incorporated   by   it   while   granting   clearance   were   not   being 


adhered   to   and   in   spite   of   writing   several   letters,   the   Ministry   of 


Welfare   did not consider it proper to take any action or even to refer 


those letters to the State Government or to the NVDD.   Thus, the said 


Authorities also treated the same as non-statutory. 





</p><p id="p_84">       In view of the above, we do not find any cogent reason to accept 


the   submission   made   by   Ms.   Palit   that   landless   labourers   are   entitled 


for allotment of agricultural land to the extent of 2 hectares. The said 


contention is devoid of any merit.  Even otherwise, it does not appeal to 


us that landless labourer could be entitled for allotment of agricultural 


land admeasuring two hectares.  Neither  it had ever been contemplated 


nor it is compatible with R &amp; R Policy.   Nor such land had ever been 


allotted to this class of persons.  The contention is hereby rejected.
