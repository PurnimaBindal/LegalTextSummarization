MR. JUSTICE S.RAVINDRA BHAT
</pre><p id="p_1">1.       This common order will dispose of the various rival applications, for temporary
injunctions preferred by the parties. The plaintiffs, M/s Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Health Care
Ltd., (the sole plaintiff in the first suit and second plaintiff in CS (OS) 2646/2008) and Horlicks
Limited United Kingdom (which is the first plaintiff in CS (OS) 2646/2008) are hereafter
collectively referred to as "Horlicks". The defendant in these suits and who is also the plaintiff
in CS (OS) 547/2010 (originally instituted before the Bombay High Court and transferred to the
file of this Court by orders of the Supreme Court) is hereafter referred to, for convenience, as
"Heinz".
</p><p id="p_2">2.       Horlicks states that in August, 2004, it had instituted a civil suit in the Calcutta High
Court seeking permanent injunction against Heinz alleging that it had issued a disparaging
advertisement in respect of its product "Horlicks", as against Heinz‟s product Complan. It is
stated that a temporary injunction was issued against Heinz with a direction to show the
impugned advertisement without disparaging content.                  This, it is alleged, led to publication of
another advertisement, which in turn resulted in initiation of contempt proceedings. Horlicks
apparently filed another suit before the Madras High Court impugning an advertisement by
Heinz in which its product Complan depicted a growing cup, taller than the other two cups with
rival products, which were stagnant. The Madras High Court, it is alleged, allowed Heinz to use
the comparative cups without any letter, along with the Complan cup provided the colour of the
two cups were the same.
</p><p id="p_3">3.       Heinz instituted a Civil Suit in Bombay High Court alleging disparagement against
Horlicks. It impugned a moving advertisement, which comprised of a 30 Second footage with

I.A. Nos.15233/08 in CS(OS) 2577/08, 15647/08 in CS (OS) 2646/2008, ___(un-numbered) (O-39, R-1&amp;2 CPC) in CS(OS)
547/2010

                                                                                                             Page 2
 audio and video lines. This advertisement placed the two rival products, i.e. Horlicks and
Heinz‟s Complan alongside each other in baskets held by two mothers; the advertisement also
indicated the maximum retail price of the two products. It was alleged that the impugned
moving advertisement made disparaging remarks against Complan in regard to nutrients in
health value as compared with Horlicks‟ product.
</p><p id="p_4">4.       The points of distinction between the present three suits and the suits filed in the Madras
and Calcutta High Court were that there was no specific reference to Horlicks. The Bombay suit,
filed before the High Court, on 12.11.2008 sought for various reliefs including permanent
injunction. The Bombay suit had impugned a moving advertisement dated 21.10.2008. Heinz‟s
attempt to secure ad interim relief was unsuccessful. A statement was made on behalf of
Horlicks that even while retaining the comparative costs of the two rival products, mention
would be made of the flavor as well as the price of the product and that the products would refer
to only one flavor. Dissatisfied with the Single Judge‟s Order, Heinz appealed to the Division
Bench, which declined to grant the injunction and permitted withdrawal of the appeal by its order
dated 2.12.2008. The Division Bench in its order stated that the prima facie view taken by the
learned Single Judge cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose of finally disposing of
motion for temporary injunction; even while not interfering with the orders of the single Judge,
the parties were left with the liberty to argue their respective contentions in the pending motions
for temporary injunction.
</p><p id="p_5">5.       Horlicks, in the first suit, recounts the history of inter se litigation between the parties. In
this suit (hereafter called as "first Delhi suit"), Horlicks complains of an advertisement issued by
Heinz on 15.12.2008. It claims to have filed a suit in which an amendment was sought. The
Court permitted Horlicks to withdraw the suit and file a fresh one, which was done.
Consequently, the first suit was filed. The impugned advertisement was issued in the Television
media on 11.12.2008 by Heinz.                It shall be hereafter referred to as the "first Complan
advertisement". The contents of the advertisement may now be briefly described. Kavita, (the
"Horlicks mother") is out shopping when she is approached by another young mother, known to
her (the "Complan mother"). The latter asks Kavita why she has started compromising on her
child‟s health; to which, Kavita gets confused and seeks an explanation. The Complan mother
explains by telling that she (Kavita) was buying a product made of cheap ingredients and that she

I.A. Nos.15233/08 in CS(OS) 2577/08, 15647/08 in CS (OS) 2646/2008, ___(un-numbered) (O-39, R-1&amp;2 CPC) in CS(OS)
547/2010

                                                                                                             Page 3
 is compromising with her child‟s growth. Kavita then responds by asking whether she was
compromising. The Complan mother then holds a bespectacled and fat child, (i.e. Kavita‟s
child) and asks Kavita whether she knew that with Complan how fast her child could grow.
Kavita dejectedly responds in the negative. At this stage, the Complan other mother picks up a
Complan packet and states that it would help children grow twice as tall. The Complan mother
elaborates this and highlights the product stating that it (Complan) has 23 vital nutrients and
more protein, particularly quality milk protein and underlines that as the reason why Complan is
better than any other health drink. Even as Kavita looks on the Complan mother emphasizes that
intelligent mothers know that one cannot buy gold with the price of brass. At this, Kavita tells
the Complan mother that she was made to understand wrongly and had been misled and from
that day there would be no compromises. A visual shows her pushing away the Horlicks bottle,
which she had earlier picked up and substitute it with a packet of Complan. The next shot
highlights Complan‟s quality and attributes.
</p><p id="p_6">6.       Heinz‟s second advertisement opens with the same cast, i.e. Kavita, the Horlicks mother
and the Complan mother in a departmental store.                   The Complan mother‟s son picks up a
Complan pack; at this Kavita queries the former as to how her son is so tall and healthy. The
Complan mother replies that she gives the boy a health drink with better quality protein. Kavita
then queries her as to what is meant by better quality protein. The Complan mother then explains
"Yes: Complan". Kavita seeks an elaboration. At this stage, there is a female "voice over"
which highlights that Complan has 23 vital nutrients, 18% protein and that too with better quality
100% milk protein. The camera then focuses on the Complan mother who says that these
ingredients are essential for a child‟s growth. The Complan mother goes on to ask Kavita:
"have you ever read the label of cheap Horlicks?"
</p><p id="p_7">Kavita replies in negative. The Complan mother then states that it (with reference to Horlicks)
contains "cheap products and ingredients" which means less proteins and less nourishment and
then comments that if one wants one‟s child to grow tall and healthy there ought not to be any
compromise. The last frame of this, second advertisement ends with a female voice over with
the image of Complan flashing; the female voice urges
"drink Complan and see the difference".

547/2010

                                                                                                             Page 4
</p><p id="p_9"> 7.       Horlicks contends that its health food drink is essentially designed according to the
international guidelines, i.e. United States Dietary Reference Intake and Codex providing for
100% daily requirement of iron, folic acid and several vitamins. It is stated that the Heinz
advertisement deliberately suppresses that these nutrients are important in contributing to a
child‟s growth; it is further disputed that children drinking Complan are getting higher rate of
growth than those of drinking Horlicks. It is stated by representing that Complan is much better
than any other health drink, Heinz‟s advertisement is giving a false impression that products
other than Complan are compromising on the child‟s health and growth. Serious objection is
taken to the insinuation that refers to use of the word „compromise‟ in the context of the overall
impact of the two advertisements upon the consumers.                     It is also argued that the explicit
reference to gold and brass in first advertisement and even more direct reference to Horlicks
containing "cheap" ingredients leading to compromise, amount to disparaging references and a
slanderous attempt by Heinz to increase its market share through misleading advertisements.
Horlicks takes objection to the use of the word „Cheap‟, which it submits is in a derogatory
manner and not a bona fide description of the product‟s attributes.
</p><p id="p_10">8.       Horlicks‟ second suit seeks permanent injunction on almost identical terms, as in its first
suit. Here, however, what is impugned are two comparative advertisements issued by Heinz in
the print media. The first advertisement was issued on 02.12.2008 in Delhi Edition of Times of
India; the same reads as follows: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "(PHOTOGRAPH OF COMPLAN MOTHER WITH CHILD)

                  Heinz‟s Case

10.      Heinz‟s defence is identical in both the Delhi suits.                 Its position, in support of its
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_13">temporary injunction claim - in the transferred Bombay suit - is also identical with such defence.
</blockquote><p id="p_14">It states that the advertisements issued by it were in self-defence, and in response to Horlicks‟
advertisement of 13th October, 2008, by which Complan was disparaged. It urged that Horlicks
in that advertisement, unfairly attempted to wean away its customers. The relevant part of
Heinz‟s allegations, in its pleadings, may be usefully seen, for this purpose, from the following
extract of its written statement, in the first Delhi Suit: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">         "The advertisement is a clear attempt by the Plaintiff to target the consumers of the
         goods sold under the COMPLAN brand and get them to change their brand loyalty by
         disparaging and denigrating the Defendant‟s product as can be seen from the following
         among various claims made by the Plaintiff in its impugned advertisement:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">         Slide 6 of the Advertisement: Song of COMPLAN Mother: My drink makes me taller! In
         reply on the Slide 7 &amp; 8 the HORLICKS boy counts on his fingers and says: HORLICKS
         makes me Taller; Stronger; Sharper!

         This comparison clearly states that while COMPLAN only helps the child to grow taller,
         HORLICKS helps the child the grow taller, sharper, and stronger. The consumers get
         the impression that the COMPLAN drink does not have sufficient nutritional value and is
         thus inferior to HORLICKS.

          In Slide 9 the Song of HORLICKS mother says: Its Proven!
         However the plaintiff has not mentioned any parameters of comparison or the subject
         matter of any study to substantiate the said claims or any explanation as to how it is
         proven or by whom it is proven that the drink HORLICKS makes a child Taller, Stronger
         and Sharper while the drink COMPLAN only makes the child Taller.

<p id="p_16">         Slide 10 the HORLICKS mother: Ok! What is the price of yours?
</p><p id="p_17">         Slide 11 the COMPLAN Mother: Umm.... Rs. 174/-
</p><p id="p_18">         Slide 12 the Son of the HORLICKS Mother: HORLICKS is only Rs. 128/-
         Slide 13 the son of the COMPLAN mother excitedly says: Mom, we are higher in this.
         This above comparison in the slides from 10 to 13 in conjunction with the slides 7 &amp; 9
         clearly gives the impression that the COMPLAN drink is higher in price with lesser
         nutritional value in comparison to the HORLICKS drink. This attempt by the Plaintiff
         was specifically designed to disparage and denigrate the reputation of Defendants drink
         COMPLAN in the eyes of the consumers. The Plaintiff could not accept the growing
         popularity of the Defendants drink COMPLAN and therefore decided to defame the
         product by releasing the said advertisement. In the slide 13, the child specifically makes
         the mockery of the value/price of the COMPLAN drink. The Plaintiff is deliberately and
         with the malafide intentional trying to create the wrong impression amongst the
         consumers of COMPLAN that they are only paying more price and are giving lesser
         nutritional value to their child by choosing to buy COMPLAN over HORLICKS.
</p>
<p id="p_19">         Slide 14: We cut to the COMPLAN mom thinking and a HORLICKS banner moving
         behind. In the end the last slide shows the COMPLAN mother is thinking and the
         HORLICKS banner is moving behind in her direction. Thus, making the COMPLAN
         mother to think about changing from COMPLAN to HORLICKS. This advertisement is
         targeted to influence the loyal COMPLAN customers to change their drink to
         HORLICKS. Thus the Plaintiff are disparaging and denigrating the reputation of the
         Defendants popular drink COMPLAN by making comparison which is false and without
         any base."
</p>
<p id="p_20">11.      Heinz denies any disparagement in its advertisements, in the Delhi suits. Horlicks‟ claim
at market leadership in the food (malted) drink market at 43.1% (of the market share, as opposed
to Heinz‟s alleged share of 11%) is denied. It is alleged that Complan‟s brand image has always
been that of a complete health drink, containing all necessary nutrients for a child‟s growth. It
submits that all its advertisements are focused and featured on the effect of its product on
growing children. It alludes to Complan‟s previous brand image up to 2003 as one catering to
I.A. Nos.15233/08 in CS(OS) 2577/08, 15647/08 in CS (OS) 2646/2008, ___(un-numbered) (O-39, R-1&amp;2 CPC) in CS(OS)

 the sick and aged, and how, based on a study, after 2005, the brand positioning has been as that
which helps children grow. Heinz refers to orders of the Madras High Court, and Calcutta High
Court, in the two Horlicks suits and argues that the advertisements there did not involve any
price or cost comparison, unlike in the Bombay action. It is alleged that Horlicks has scant
respect for the process of law and has repeatedly indulged in offending activities to unfairly gain
additional market share, by misleading advertisements.
</p><p id="p_21">12.      Heinz justifies its advertisements impugned by Horlicks in the Delhi suits, saying that
they have to be seen in the overall context of Horlicks‟ advertisements, impugned in the Bombay
suit, and not in isolation. It is submitted that Complan, as a matter of fact, contains milk based
protein, and 23 nutrients. In contrast, Horlicks‟ ingredients are not milk based, and contain 19
nutrients.    It is further stated that such ingredients are conducive to growth, and Heinz‟s
advertisements, which merely spell out facts, such as:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">         (1) Complan‟s 100% milk based protein composition;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">         (2) Ingredients being more expensive as compared with those of Horlicks:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">         (3) Horlicks being cheaper priced than Complan.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">cannot be objected to, or held to be disparaging. On the other hand, submits Heinz, Horlicks‟
advertisements imply that Complan does not have as good effects as the Horlicks drink.
</p><p id="p_23">13.      It is stated that Horlicks has, in its advertisement underscored the price differential and,
therefore, should not complain of disparagement when the same effect is spelt out in the
Complan advertisements. It is further argued that comparative advertisement with reference to
price differential attributes and qualities of the products - which includes the number of
ingredients as well as their effects (in the case of food stuff etc). - can legitimately be portrayed
without being called "disparaging".
</p><p id="p_24">14.      Horlicks relies upon this Court‟s judgment reported as <a href="/doc/1786438/" id="a_1">Pepsico Inc. v. Hindustan Coca
Cola</a> 2003 (27) PTC 305 to say that while "puffing" or exaggeration by trader or seller of goods,
of his products, is permissible, disparaging rival product would not be justified. Reliance is also
placed upon <a href="/doc/1722050/" id="a_2">Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v. Hindustan Lever Ltd</a>. (1999) 7 SCC 1 where the
Supreme Court held that a distinction should be made and due latitude given for an



I.A. Nos.15233/08 in CS(OS) 2577/08, 15647/08 in CS (OS) 2646/2008, ___(un-numbered) (O-39, R-1&amp;2 CPC) in CS(OS)

                                                                                                             Page 9
 advertisement to promote one‟s clientage. This latitude, it is submitted, does not extend to
license to misrepresent.
</p><p id="p_25">15.      Elaborating on the argument, Horlicks submits that advertisements particularly those in
the electronic media can be powerful and that the advertiser has to walk a tight rope while
telecasting the commercial - and always be alive to whether what is being conveyed denigrates
the rival product and the likely impact of such a message. Reliance is also placed in this context
upon the judgment reported as Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd. v. Cavincare Pvt. Ltd., ILR (2007)
II Delhi 368 and another judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in <a href="/doc/115388/" id="a_3">D.N. Prasad v.
Principal Secretary</a> 2005 Cri LJ 1901.               It is argued that taken as a whole, the impugned
advertisements in the two Delhi suits have crossed the boundary of what is permissible puffing
and actually denigrate Horlicks‟ product. It is submitted that repeated use of the expression
„cheap‟ in order to convey that if the product is used, it would result in compromising on the
growth needs of the child, taken together with the visual portrayal, conveys a negative image
implying that Horlicks is clearly an inferior product and that if mothers have health concern for
their children, they ought to buy Complan.
</p><p id="p_26">16.      Heinz argues, on the other hand, that its advertisements portray the truth about its
product, and those of Horlicks. It is argued that the right to reach out to one‟s clientele is part of
the Constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech, under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_4">Article 19 (1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of
India. Reiterating its averments that the advertisements impugned in the Delhi suit are to be
taken together with the context of the Bombay suit, and the advertisements issued by Horlicks, in
the first place, it is argued that after having called Horlicks cheaper than Complan with a view to
market the product, on the basis of perceived cost (or price) advantage, it cannot be now argued
that a different manner of highlighting the same idea, (by Heinz) amounts to product denigration,
or slander. It is submitted that as far as use of expressions other than "cheap" is concerned, Heinz
cannot be faulted, since Horlick‟s Mumbai advertisement (the subject matter of the Bombay suit)
trumpets that Horlicks boys grow taller, stronger and sharper, in comparison with Complan
mother‟s statement that boys drinking Complan are "taller".
</p>
<p id="p_27">17.      It is submitted that while there is no dispute that a trader or seller of goods can exaggerate
and "puff" his products to increase his sales, and that so long as he does not make derogatory
references to rival products, equally, advertisements have the right to portray facts, and highlight
I.A. Nos.15233/08 in CS(OS) 2577/08, 15647/08 in CS (OS) 2646/2008, ___(un-numbered) (O-39, R-1&amp;2 CPC) in CS(OS)
547/2010

                                                                                                           Page 10
 aspects which are true. So long as this thumb rule of truthful portrayal of a rival‟s product, is
maintained, an action for alleged disparagement cannot lie.                      In this context, reliance is
placed on the judgment of the Division Bench reported as                                    Dabur India Ltd.
v. Colortek Meghalaya Pvt. Ltd. and Godrej Sara - Lee                           (FAO 625/2009, decided on
2.02.2010), particularly the following observations:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">         "While hyped-up advertising may be permissible, it cannot transgress the grey areas of
         permissible assertion, and if does so, the advertiser must have some reasonable factual
         basis for the assertion made. It is not possible, therefore, for anybody to make an off-the-
         cuff or unsubstantiated claim that his goods are the best in the world or falsely state that
         his goods are better than that of a rival...."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">In support of the argument that it has made fair and permissible comment, Heinz relies on
various reports and studies to prima facie establish that milk based protein foods are superior to
others. It is argued that Complan is therefore, undeniably superior, and better at assisting growth
in children. It is argued that Complan does contain 23 nutrients, as compared with Horlick‟s 19
nutrients. Horlick‟s ingredients are priced cheaper than those of Complan. Therefore, submits
Heinz, the advertisements issued by it are not disparaging. Heinz complains that Horlick‟s
advertisements, impugned in the Bombay suit, are clearly disparaging, as they are aimed at
showing Complan as ineffective, and expensive.
</p>
<p id="p_29">18.      The above narration reveals that the issue, in the three suits, is whether Horlick‟s
complaint about disparagement of its products in the advertisements issued by Hienz (which are
the subject matter of the two Delhi suits) cross the boundary of permissible commercial speech.
Likewise, the Court has to consider whether Horlick‟s advertisement, impugned in the Bombay
suit, disparages Heinz‟s product, Complan.
</p>
<p id="p_30">19.      The law relating to false advertisements, causing injury to a rival trader‟s goods, was
expounded in several decisions in the 19th Century. These were re-visited in De Beers Abrasive
v. International General Electric Co. 1975 (2) All ER 599 where the Court summarized the
correct position as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_31">         "What precisely is the law on this point? It is a blinding glimpse of the obvious to say
         that there must be a dividing line between statements that are actionable and those which
I.A. Nos.15233/08 in CS(OS) 2577/08, 15647/08 in CS (OS) 2646/2008, ___(un-numbered) (O-39, R-1&amp;2 CPC) in CS(OS)
547/2010

                                                                                                           Page 11
          are not; and the sole question of a dry point of law such as we are discussing here is;
         where does the line lie? On the one hand, it appears to me that the law is that any trader
         is entitled to puff his own goods, even though such puff must, as a matter of pure logic,
         involve the denigration of his rival's goods. Thus in the well known case of the three
         adjoining tailors who put notices in their respective windows reading: 'The best tailor in
         the world', 'The best tailor in this town', and 'The best tailor in this street', none of the
         three committed an actionable offence."
</p>
<p id="p_32">         Where, however, the situation is not that the trader is puffing his own goods, but turns to
         denigrate those of his rival, then, in my opinion, the situation is not so clear cut.
         Obviously the statement: 'My goods are better than X's' is only a more dramatic
         presentation of what is implicit in the statement: 'My goods are the best in the world'.
         Accordingly, I do not think such a statement would be actionable. At the other end of the
         scale, if what is said is: 'My goods are better than X's, because X's are absolute rubbish',
         then it is established by dicta of Lord Shand in the House of Lords in White v. Mellin
         (1895) AC 154, which were accepted by counsel for the defendants as stating the law, the
         statement would be actionable.
</p>
<p id="p_33">         Between these two kinds of statements there is obviously still an extremely wide field; and
         it appears to me that, in order to draw the line, one must apply this test, namely, whether
         a reasonable man would take the claim being made as being a serious claim or not. A
         possible alternative test is to ask whether the defendant has pointed to a specific
         allegation of some defect or demerit in the plaintiff's goods. This is, I think, the test
         favoured by the learned editors of the last few editions of Salmond on Torts"
</p>
<p id="p_34">20.      <a href="/doc/16588679/" id="a_5">In Reckitt &amp; Colman of India Ltd. v. M.P. Ramchandran and Anr</a>. 1999 19 PTC 741, the
Calcutta High Court considered the concept of negative advertisement. The Court, after
considering several English decisions including White v. Mellin 1895 AC 154; Bubbuck v.
Wilkinson 1899 (1) OB 86; and De Beers Abrasive (supra) held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">         "I) A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in the world, even though the

<p id="p_35">         IV) He however, cannot, while saying that his goods are better than his competitors', say
         that his competitors' goods are bad. If he says so, he really slanders the goods of his

          competitors. In other words he defames his competitors and their goods, which is not
         permissible.
</p>
<p id="p_36">         V) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the manufacturer of such goods no action
         lies, but if there is such defamation an action lies and if an action lies for recovery of
         damages for defamation, then the Court is also competent to grant an order of injunction
         restraining repetition of such defamation."
</p>
<p id="p_37">In Pepsi Co. Inc. and Ors.(supra) a Division Bench of this Court held that comparative
advertising, which discredits or denigrates the trade mark or trade name of a rival is
impermissible. The Division Bench held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">         "What is disparagement. The New International Websters' Comprehensive Dictionary
         defines disparage/disparagement to mean, "to speak of slightingly, undervalue, to bring
         discredit or dishonor upon, the act of deprecating, derogation, a condition of low
         estimation or valuation, a reproach, disgrace, an unjust classing or comparison with that
         which is of less worth, and degradation. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines
         disparage as under, to bring dis-credit on, slightingly of and depreciate.....To decide the
         question of disparagement we have to keep the following factors in mind namely; (i)
         Intent of commercial (ii) Manner of the commercial (iii) Storyline of the commercial and
         the message sought to be conveyed by the commercial. Out of the above, "manner of the
         commercial", is very important. If the manner is ridiculing or the condemning product of
         the competitor then it amounts to disparaging but if the manner is only to show one's
         product better or best without derogating other's product then that is not actionable.

<p id="p_38">Summing up the law the Court said that:

</p>
<p id="p_41">21.      The Court‟s approach was indicated in Dabur (supra), by the Division Bench, where a
large number of previous rulings were considered. It was observed that the following factors are
to be kept in mind:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">         "(1) The intent of the advertisement - this can be understood from its story line and the
         message sought to be conveyed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">         (2) The overall effect of the advertisement - does it promote the advertiser's product or
         does it disparage or denigrate a rival product?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">         In this context it must be kept in mind that while promoting its product, the advertiser
         may, while comparing it with a rival or a competing product, make an unfavourable
         comparison but that might not necessarily affect the story line and message of the
         advertised product or have that as its overall effect.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">         (3) The manner of advertising - is the comparison by and large truthful or does it falsely
         denigrate or disparage a rival product? While truthful disparagement is permissible,
         untruthful disparagement is not permissible."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_42">22.      In determining the meaning in the impugned advertisement, the Court has to take into
account the fact that the public expects a certain amount of hyperbole in advertising. The test is
whether a reasonable man would take the claim being made, as one made seriously. The more
precise and specific the claim, the more likely it was that the public would take it seriously. The
Court will have to do what an ordinary man would do - take it with a large pinch of salt. ( See
De Beers Abrasive Products Ltd (supra)and Vodafone Group Plc v. Orange Personal
Communications Services Ltd [1997] F.S.R. 34).

distinctive features:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">         (1)      All of them specifically refer to Horlicks, and are comparative advertisements.
         (2)      Heinz emphasizes that its Complan has 23 nutrients, as compared to 19 in
         Horlicks;
</blockquote><pre id="pre_6">         (3)      Complan contains 100 percent milk protein

          (5)      Use of other drinks would compromise on the child‟s growth (this element is,
         however absent from the newspaper advertisements which are the subject matter of the
         second Delhi suit).
</blockquote><p id="p_44">24.      An application of the principles discussed previously in this judgment, would mean that
the Court has to, as far as possible, consider the overall effect of the advertisements; a minute
dissection of each term, or phrase is uncalled for, and the stand point from where the Court
should judge the nature of the alleged disparagement should be not of the aggrieved trader, but
the reasonable, or average consumer, who is conscious of trading rival‟s propensities to puff and
exaggerate their products. At the same time, this reasonable or average consumer is likely to be
influenced by factual assertions made in such advertisements. Specific assertions, or claims, in
advertisements are more likely impact directly, as contrasted with vague and general claims. (See
Vodafone Group plc v. Orange Personal Communications Services Ltd [1997] F.S.R34, to the
effect that the public are used to the ways of advertisers who will stress the good points of a
product and ignore others, and that the more precise the claim, the more likely the average
consumer would take it seriously).
</p><p id="p_45">25.      Heinz is no doubt right in contending that comparative price differential can be
highlighted. However, while doing so, the advertisement should be fair, and non-judgmental.
The advertiser has various choices, while portraying the price differential. If his products are
lower in cost, obviously, that perceived advantage would be highlighted. However, when a rival
chooses to highlight this aspect, with special emphasis on the quality of his product, care has to
be exercised to ensure that no commercial, or advertisement injury, occurs to the rival‟s product.
In this case, the use of the term "cheap" in relation to the product, is in the electronic media. The
line between the a permissible expression, and the pejorative or what is likely to cast a slur on
another‟s goods, is slight, and determined by the context in which terms and expressions are
used. While "cheap" may be positive, in the context of a trader proclaiming that his wares are a
bargain, or good value for money, (since in the case of many products, consumers are price
sensitive) "cheap" used by a rival, in an advertisement might well connote not just inexpensive,
but inferior. Here it would be useful to recollect the judgment of Lord Reid in Lewis v. Daily
Telegraph [1963] 2 All E.R. 151, where it was observed that words have to be seen in their
ordinary sense and context:

          "..is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does not live in an ivory
         tower and he is not inhibited by the rules of construction. So he can and does read
         between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs
         ... What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been
         called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather
         misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not
         necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a
         thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in
         what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their
         natural and ordinary meaning.."
</p>
<p id="p_47">26.      In this case, the word "cheap" has been used repeatedly, by Heinz in respect of Horlicks;
the suggestion further is that it uses "cheap" ingredients, as opposed to Complan‟s 100 % milk
protein ingredients, which are not cheap. In one advertisement, the insuniation is that good
quality ("gold") cannot be had for the price of brass. The next word used repeatedly is
"compromise" on the growth needs of the child. While lauding or commending Complan‟s
qualities, as best suited to a child‟s growth needs, is permissible, any contrast with a rival
product, such as Horlicks, with a further suggestion that use of such (rival) product would
compromise on the child‟s growth, with images of a tall and healthy boy, said to be using
Complan, as compared with a less healthy or child, clearly amounts to denigration of the rival
product - in this case, Horlicks. Heinz‟s attempt to justify its position by saying that Horlicks
had referred to its product as cheaper than the rival Complan, is technically correct, but
unpersuasive, because the contexts of the rival advertisements are entirely different. Nor is the
Court satisfied that the mere detail that it uses 23 nutrients, as opposed to 19 used by Horlicks,
brings it within the permissible or fair threshold.
</p><p id="p_48">27.      This Court is conscious of the powerful and lasting impact that audio visual images have
on viewers. Unlike the printed word, which is processed analyzed, and assimilated uniquely by
each individual, an advertisement in the electronic media, particularly, has a different impact.
First, it has a wider spread; it is perceived aurally through different senses, such as sound, visual,
and printed. The suggestive power of this medium is greater. Second, such advertisements use
several different tools, like music, dialogue, colors, and other aids, to bring home the message.
Advertisements through this medium can, and do operate at conscious and subconscious levels;
their power of suggestion extends not just to the discerning, or educated viewer, but to an entire
range of viewership, with diverse income earning capacities, educational attainments, tastes, and

547/2010

                                                                                                           Page 16
 so on. They influence even children. The impact of a catchy phrase, a well acted skit or story
line, or even distinctive sounds or distinctive collocation of colors, can well define the brand or
product‟s image, by imprinting it in the public memory forever. In these circumstances, it
becomes even more imperative for an advertiser, who wishes to indulge in comparative
advertisement, to tread the boundary carefully. In the present case, the Court is satisfied, prima
facie that the references to Horlicks, on an overall consideration, in the impugned two
advertisements issued by Heinz, amount to disparagement.
</p><p id="p_49">28.      The second Delhi suit is concerned with two newspaper advertisements. They compare -
or list out the so called qualities of the two rival products. What is interesting, however are the
captions and the text which precede the comparison. The first advertisement proclaims "Do you
know the difference between what is good and what is cheap?" It suggests to mothers to be
          "well informed so that you do not unknowingly compromise by choosing a cheaper
         health drink.... It has been prove that milk protein is a complete protein. Milk Protein is
         far superior to incomplete proteins from other common and cheaper sources like barley
         and wheat*"
</p>
<p id="p_50">The second advertisement contains the heading "Cheaper price or your child‟s complete
growth?" and goes on to suggest, to caring mothers that they are to be well informed so that
they do not "unknowingly compromise by choosing a cheaper health drink..... Milk Protein in
Complan is far superior to incomplete proteins from other common sources like barley and
wheat found in cheaper health drinks."
</p><p id="p_51">29.      Both the advertisements, like the electronic versions, use "cheap" as connoting inferior,
since the comparison is with Complan with "superior" ingredients. Again, like the electronic
versions, the use of "compromise" (in the child‟s growth needs) with pointed reference to the
inferior quality of barley or wheat based food drinks (i.e. in this case Horlicks) as opposed to
milk protein based Complan, is pejorative, and derogatory. These parts of the advertisements
clearly disparage Horlicks. As regards the comparison, or comparative table, the Court is of
opinion that to the extent they rival products‟ ingredients are listed out (as Horlicks does not
claim that these are misleading) there can be no objection. Heinz has referred, at the foot of each
advertisement, to a report by the National Institute of Nutrition of 1995. Horlicks submits that
this report has not seen the light of the day. The Court is of the opinion that since at this stage
only the prima facie strength of the rival parties, based on the existing documents, is being

547/2010

                                                                                                           Page 17
 considered, the absence of such a report would not lead to an inference that a reference to it is
false or misleading, or that such claims are misleading. At best it might amount to "puffing"
which, in the circumstances, is legitimate.
</p><p id="p_52">30.      Now, coming to Heinz‟s claim for temporary injunction. Its objection to Horlicks‟
advertisement, impugned in the Bombay suit, appears to be three fold, i.e. price comparison,
leading to shift in consumer loyalty; second, the claim that the Horlicks boy is taller, stronger,
and sharper, as opposed to the Complan boy‟s claim of only one attribute, i.e. tall and third, that
the overall impact of the advertisement is that Complan is not only more expensive, but less
nutritional, and effective to a growing child‟s needs.
</p><p id="p_53">31.      This Court is of the opinion that a fair application of the tests indicated in the previous
part of this judgment, would lead to the conclusion that Horlicks‟ advertisement does not
disparage. The price comparison is by a trader, who wishes to advertise that his product has a
cost (or price) advantage, over the rival‟s goods. It accurately describes the position. The
difference in attributes of the consumer, is part of a natural dialogue, where the Complan boy
proclaims with pride that using it (Complan) makes him stronger; the other boy, naturally
responds saying that Horlicks makes him taller, stronger and sharper. This is at best an instance
of puffing.      As far as Heinz‟s complaint about the impact of Horlicks‟ advertisement that
Complan is less nutritional is concerned, the Court notes that there is no comparison of
ingredients, nor is the advertiser basing the claim on any expert opinion or report. It is just the
claim of a       boy, no more than that. In the circumstances, it is held that the Horlicks
advertisement, impugned in the Bombay suit, does not disparage Complan.
</p><p id="p_54">32.      Before concluding, it would be appropriate to deal with a submission made by Heinz, that
all the advertisements, and their potential impact is to be seen in totality, and the Court should
not see any one advertisement in isolation. While as a general statement, the argument may be
attractive, and perhaps appropriate, such an approach cannot have universal application. This is
because an advertiser‟s acts in indulging in a "retaliatory" advertisement campaign, highlighting
his goods‟ attributes, - even comparing them with those of a rival- may be part of a larger
context, (and triggered by such rival‟s advertisement, or publicity campaigns, with a view to
compete in the market place), the subjective context cannot color the Court‟s primary task to

547/2010

                                                                                                           Page 18
 determine whether the advertisement complained of indeed disparages the rival‟s goods. At best
the context can provide the Court with the clue about motivation - of the complained conduct.
</p><p id="p_55">33.      In view of the above discussion, the temporary injunction application in the first Delhi
suit is allowed; Heinz is restrained from publishing or telecasting the two impugned
advertisements, or any other advertisements containing similar content, which tends to cast a slur
on Horlicks, by implying that it is cheap or inferior, or that it compromises on essential qualities.
Similarly, the ad-interim injunction application in the second Delhi suit, is allowed, partly; Heinz
is restrained from publishing any reference to Horlicks being cheap, or inferior, or comprising of
inferior ingredients, or compromising on children‟s growth needs. Heinz‟s ad-interim temporary
injunction application, for the reasons discussed above, is dismissed. In the circumstances, Heinz
is directed to bear the costs of the three injunction applications, quantified at ` 75,000/- each, to
be paid to Horlicks, within four weeks.
