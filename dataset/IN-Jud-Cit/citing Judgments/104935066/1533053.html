Appellant‟) has filed Arbitration Appeal No. 14 of 2011 against the
Respondent FTV BVI under <a href="/doc/1783117/" id="a_3">Section 37(2)(b)</a> of the Act. The Appellant has
also filed O.M.P. No. 809 of 2011 under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Act for directions
to the Respondent to comply with the Memorandum of Agreement
(`MOA‟) dated 9th August 2001 with the Petitioner and not act in
furtherance of an Agreement dated 19th April 2011 between the Respondent
and Media Network of Distribution (India) Ltd. without first giving an
opportunity to the Appellant in terms of Clause 21 of the MoA dated 9th
August 2001.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2. Since both the appeal and the petition arise out of the same facts between
the same parties, they have, with the consent of the parties, been heard
together.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3. Modi Entertainment Network Ltd. („MEN‟) and the Respondent entered
into the MOA on 9th August 2001 whereunder the Respondent appointed
MEN as its sole and exclusive distributor in the Territory, i.e., India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives, for

for internet including programme sales in the Territory.
</p>

<p id="p_5">4. The period of the MOA was five years from the date of the execution,
i.e., 9th August 2001 extendable for a period of seven years as provided in
Clause 6(3). Clause 6 and 7 of the MOA are relevant for the purposes of
the present case and read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "6. JOINT VENTURE: It is hereby agreed by and between
     the Parties that during the subsistence of this MOA, if MEN
     achieves the gross revenue projections, as mentioned in clause

     then agreed that, this MOA shall stand automatically extended

     revenue projections:

<p id="p_6">5. Clause 9 provided that MEN would pay to the Respondent a minimum
guarantee of US$ 720,000 per annum based on the exchange rate prevailing
on the date of execution. Clause 9 reads as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      (i) MEN will guarantee fTV, a minimum guarantee of
     US$720,000 per annum based on the exchange rate prevailing

     business plan and if the Parties are unable to reach any
     consensus then the Minimum Guarantee amount will increase
     at the rate of 20% per annum from the fourth year of
     operation."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_7">6. Clause 21 gave the Appellant the right of first refusal and read as
under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     "21. FIRT RIGHT TO REFUSAL : During the subsistence of
     this MOA and on formation of JVCO, if fTV launches any new
     channels or any business considered in this MOA in the
     Territory, it agrees and undertakes to provide MEN with the
     exclusive first opportunity to acquire distribution, air time
     marketing and merchandising rights for the same ("the Offer").
     Any such Offer shall be in writing and MEN shall have 30
     days to accept the Offer of fTV. If MEN fails or declines to
     accept the fTV Offer, then in that case, fTV may offer the same
     to any third party, except that if fTV determines to enter an
     agreement with a third party with respect to distribution, air
     time marketing and merchandising rights for new channels,
     fTV shall first re-offer to MEN the opportunity to enter into an
     agreement on the same terms as with the third party (and will
     provide MEN with written notice of its determination, the
     terms of such agreement and the identity of third party). MEN
     will have a period of 30 days in which to accept such re-offer,
     failing which fTV shall be free to enter into an agreement with
     such third party on the terms no less favorable than those
     described to MEN."
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                        Page 4 of 21</span>
<p id="p_8"> 7. Clause 19 of the MOA permitted the assignment by MEN of its rights
under the MOA to the company to be formed by it. Admittedly, the rights
and obligations under the MOA were assigned by MEN to the Petitioner
with the consent of the Respondent. Clause 30 contained the arbitration
agreement. The MOA was to be governed by the laws of England.
However, the venue of the arbitration was to be in India and held in
accordance with the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_9">8. It is the Appellant‟s case that consequent upon the breach by the
Respondent of MOA the appellant filed O.M.P. No. 207 of 2003 in this
Court under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_5">Section 9</a> of the Act. The said petition was disposed of in terms
of the settlement between the parties. The consent terms were filed in this
Court on 22nd January 2004. Both parties agreed that the MOA would
continue to be valid and binding on the parties. Clause 4(f),(g) and (h) of
the consent terms read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">     "f. FTV undertakes that it will make the best efforts to re-encrypt
     the current Free-to-Air Channel. FTV will revert to MEN with its
     plan for re-encryption in due course. After, and as and when, the
     FTV signal into India is re-encrypted, the Parties aver that they
     will revert to the terms and conditions of the MOA dated
     9/6/2001 and will be bound by them, including the Minimum
     Guarantee payments and the respective obligations of each party.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">     g. As long as the FTV Channel remains Free to Air, MEN will
     not be liable to pay any Minimum Guaranteed amounts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     h. The revenue sharing between the Parties, during the period that
     the FTV Channel is Free-to-Air, will be on a 50:50 basis both ad
     sales (net of agency commission of 15%) and
     merchandizing/licensing."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_10">9. On 9th August 2005 an addendum (hereinafter „First Addendum‟) was
executed by MEN and the Respondent. It was stated that the MOA read
with the consent terms was being further amended by the First Addendum
which would regulate the terms of commercial business and understanding

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                       Page 5 of 21</span>
 of the parties including the assignors and beneficiaries. The Start Date of
the First Addendum was 1st April 2005. All other terms of the MOA read
with the consent term not modified by the First Addendum were to be made
valid and binding. Clause 3 of the First Addendum stated as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "The India signal will be Free to Air and any decision of
     converting it to an encrypted mode will be mutually discussed
     and agreed upon between FTV BVI and FTV India, taking into
     consideration the market conditions in India."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_11">10. The Respondent was to be paid a minimum guarantee of US$ 240,000
per annum or 30% of the net revenue collected, whichever was higher for
revenue from advertising sales, sponsorship sales, events, programme
placement income and any other revenue to air-time sales in the Territory.
The minimum guarantee of US$ 20,000 per month was to be paid to the
Respondent by the 15th of the subsequent month and not to be reduced by
any costs or tax.
</p>

<p id="p_12">11. This was followed by a Second Addendum dated 30th March 2006
(hereinafter „Second Addendum‟) executed by the Respondent and the
MEN which stated that "the said MOA read with the consent terms are
being further amended as per the second addendum." It was further stated
that the Second Addendum "will regulate the terms of commercial business
and understanding of the above-mentioned parties including the Assignors
and beneficiaries and or their agents on the terms as hereinafter
mentioned." Clause 3 of the Second Addendum stated that "the India signal
will be Free to Air and any decision of converting it to an encrypted mode
will be mutually discussed and agreed upon between FTV BVI and MEN
Mauritius, taking into consideration the market conditions in India." Clause
4 of the Second Addendum stated that the Respondent was to receive a
minimum guarantee of US$ 240,000 per annum or 30% of the net revenue
collected, whichever was higher, from advertising sales, sponsorship sales,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                       Page 6 of 21</span>
 events, programme placement income and any other revenue relating to air-
time sales in the Territory. Like the First Addendum, the Second
Addendum also provided that a minimum guarantee of US$ 20,000/- was
to be paid in full to the Respondent by the 15th of the subsequent month
without reduction for any costs or tax. The period of the Second Addendum
was sixty months from the Start Date and was to be "reviewed after this
term." Admittedly, the sixty months period in terms of the Second
Addendum, came to an end on 31st March 2011.
</p>

<p id="p_13">12. It is the case of the Appellant that it had made all payments in terms of
the Second Addendum up to October 2010. On 28th March 2011 there were
two letters written by the Respondent to MEN, and the Appellant. The first
was a final notice concerning the outstanding dues aggregating USD
112,500 being the monthly minimum guarantee due from October 2010 to
February 2011. Apart from the above minimum guarantee payment, the
Respondent alleged that it was also owed the revenue share from various
licensees, mobile distribution, internet revenues, advertising etc. Further,
RRsat informed the Respondent about the outstanding payments owed to it
by the Appellant and MEN. It was stated by the Respondent in the letter
dated 28th March 2011 that it wished to settle the dispute in a friendly
manner.
</p>

<p id="p_14">13. On the same date, i.e., 28th March 2011, another letter was written by
the Respondent to MEN and the Appellant, the subject matter of which
referred to the expiry of the MOA dated 1st August 2001, the Consent
Terms dated 9th December 2003 and the Second Addendum dated 30th
March 2006. The Appellant and MEN were asked to settle all the
outstanding dues with respect to the MOA and the First and Second
Addendums. Para 5 of the said letter read as under:
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                        Page 7 of 21</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "5. In the meantime, please confirm in writing by 4pm on 31st
     March 2011, that you accept the offer set out. If we do not hear
     from you but you nevertheless continue after 31 st March 2011 to
     broadcast Fashion Television, such conduct will amount to an
     acceptance of the offer:

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">     5.1 The right to broadcast the local FTV Channel according to the
     Agreement will be extended subject to the paragraphs set out
     below until such time as it is determined by any party in its sole
     discretion.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">     5.2 The Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising in
     connection with the same shall be governed by the law of
     England and Wales and in the event of any dispute arising under
     or in connection with the Agreement (including claims in respect
     of non-contractual liability and including claims based upon
     events already taken place or in respect of rights already accrued),
     the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
     of the Courts of England and Wales.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">     5.3 If by 4pm on 31st March, you accept that this offer in writing,
     then any dispute referred to in 5.2 above shall be referred to
     arbitration before a sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with
     the rules of the London Court of International Arbitration ("the
     LCIA"); the seat of the arbitration shall be England and the rules
     of the LCIA shall apply."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_15">14. MEN then sent an e-mail to the Respondent in which it stated that the
Respondent had failed to fulfill its commitment under the Consent Terms
and the attempt of the Respondent to wriggle out of its commitment would
amount to violation of the said Terms. Further, it was stated in the
alternative that, since the JVCO was not formed, Clause 7 had to be
severed. As a consequence, Clause 6 which provided for automatic renewal
would be inapplicable to the MOA. It was further maintained by MEN that
the addendums "only dealt with commercial aspects which were specific to
the terms mentioned within and cannot be read to have modified the
original period agreed under the MOA."
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                        Page 8 of 21</span>
<p id="p_16"> 15. On 1st April 2011 the Respondent wrote to the Appellant, inter alia,
stating that MEN could buy 1 million euro shares of the Respondent at
favourable price and must keep them for validity of the contract.
Alternatively, MEN could deposit one million euros with the Respondent
which could be returned by it in equal parts over the duration of the
extension of the agreements. It was stated that the issues should be resolved
by 7th April 2011. The Respondent sent another e-mail on 20th April 2011
stating that the Agreement came to an end by efflux of time on 31st March
2011. It was urged that the problem could be solved if the outstanding
amounts would be paid and the easiest way was for MEN to buy shares or
make the deposit as guarantee for performance. This was contested by
MEN by a reply e-mail in which it maintained that the MOA read with the
Consent Terms remained binding.
</p>

<p id="p_17">16. The Appellant then filed O.M.P. No. 390 of 2011 in this Court under
<a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_6">Section 9</a> of the Act seeking the interim relief of restraining the Respondent
from giving effect to the termination notice dated 28th March 2011 and also
restraining the Respondent from entering any third party agreement for
appointing them as distributors of the Respondent‟s FTV channel during
the subsistence of the MoA dated 9th August 2001. In the said petition this
Court passed an interim order on 24th March 2011 by which subject to
deposit of 50% of minimum guarantee before the Registrar General of this
Court till the next date of hearing, i.e., 22nd July 2011, the Respondent was
restrained from appointing any third party for distribution, merchandising
and licensing the rights of FTV channel in the Territory covered by the
MOA dated 9th August 2001 in case not already appointed.
</p>

<p id="p_18">17. The Respondent on 2nd June 2011 filed an application for vacation of
the said interim order. On 3rd August 2011 after hearing the parties and
after noting that the parties had nominated their respective Arbitrators, this

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8"> ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                        Page 9 of 21</span>
 Court disposed of O.M.P. No. 390 of 2011 and I.A. No. 9848 of 2011 in
the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">     "a.50% minimum guarantee amount deposited by the petitioner

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">     b. It is agreed between the parties that they have no objection if

<blockquote id="blockquote_23">     c. The parties are agreeable that the petition under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_7">Section 9</a> of
     the Act be treated as application under <a href="/doc/1171700/" id="a_8">Section 17</a> of the Act
     which could be decided by the arbitral tribunal within two weeks
     from the date of commencement of the first meeting. The

     of the Act within the period of seven days from the date of
     passing of the order and the interim order dated 24.05.2011 shall
     continue till the disposal of the interim application which would
     be decided as per its own merit and without the influence of the
     ex-parte order passed by the Court.

<blockquote id="blockquote_24">     d. The parties will not take any unnecessary adjournments.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">     5. The parties shall appear before the Arbitral Tribunal as and
     when the first of sitting is fixed by the Arbitral Tribunal."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_19">18. Before the Arbitral Tribunal the Appellant filed an application on 2 nd
September 2011 for directions to the Respondent to disclose and produce
the agreement entered into between it and Media Network Ltd. It is
submitted that pursuant thereto the Respondent submitted a incomplete
copy of the said agreement dated 19th April 2011. Arguments on the
application under <a href="/doc/1171700/" id="a_10">Section 17</a> of the Act were heard by the Arbitral Tribunal
on 6th September 2011.
</p>

<p id="p_20">19. The Arbitral Tribunal passed the impugned order dated 20 th October
2011 rejecting the Petitioner‟s application under <a href="/doc/1171700/" id="a_11">Section 17</a> of the Act and
vacated the interim order passed by this Court on 24 th May 2011 which had

 remained in operation till then. The Arbitral Tribunal, however, directed
that the said interim order would continue to remain in operation up to 4 th
November 2011 since an abrupt vacating of the interim order might lead to
difficulty and the parties required some time to rearrange their business
affairs. In the impugned order dated 20th October 2011 the Arbitral
Tribunal held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">         (a) There was prima facie substance in the submissions made by
         both the sides. For the purpose of grant of ad interim relief the

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">         (b) The balance of convenience was not in favour of the Appellant.
         The injury to the Appellant, if any, could well be compensated by

</blockquote>

<p id="p_23">22. Having considered the above submissions, this Court does not find
any valid ground having been made out by the Appellant for interference
with the impugned order dated 20th October 2011 passed by the Arbitral
Tribunal rejecting the Appellant‟s application under <a href="/doc/1032428/" id="a_29">Section 17</a> of the Act.
The reasons for this conclusion follow.
</p>

<p id="p_24">23. At the outset, it requires to be stated that the reasoning that follows is
only a prima facie view of the court on the basis of the existing pleadings
and the submissions of the counsel for the parties in regard to the grant of
interim relief in an application under <a href="/doc/1032428/" id="a_30">Section 17</a> of the Act. In other words
it is not to be construed as a final view on merits.
</p>

<p id="p_25">24. The term of the MOA was essentially for a period of five years
beginning 1st August 2001. The MOA envisaged that there would be a
joint venture company („JVCO‟) incorporated by the two parties in India
with equal equity participation. Clause 6 of the MOA made the formation
of the JVCO, during the subsistence of the MOA, contingent upon MEN

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                         Page 16 of 21</span>
 achieving the gross revenue projections stated in Clause 7. When the fTV
channel became free to air, it was plain that the revenue earnings
projected under Clause 7 would be unable to be achieved. The changed
market conditions meant that revenues would have to be generated mainly
from advertisement and not from subscription. Consequently, the
conditionalities under Clause 6 for the formation of the JVCO could not
be met. Under Clause 6 (3) it was agreed that if no agreement was reached
between the parties for the formation of JVCO then the MOA would stand
automatically extended for a period of seven years from "the date of such
disagreement". The narration of events indicates that there was no
„disagreement‟ as such on the formation of the JVCO. The parties
accepted that the conditions for the formation of the JVCO, as set out in
Clause 7, could not be met. Consequently, the conditionality envisaged
under Clause 6.3 of the MOA, viz., a „disagreement‟ between the parties
as to the formation of the JVCO, was not fulfilled and therefore the
question of an automatic extension of the MOA by a further seven years
did not arise.
</p>

<p id="p_26">25. The First and Second Addendums were by way of an amendment to
the MOA. The First Addendum dated 9th August 2005 was to be valid for
12 months from the Start Date, i.e., 1st August 2005. It clearly stated that
the fTV channel would be free to air in India and a minimum guarantee
would be payable to the Respondent. This was also stated in the Second
Addendum dated 30th March 2006, which was for a period of 60 months
from the Start Date i.e., 1st April 2006. The term of the Second Addendum
came to an end on 31st April 2006. There is nothing in either of the
Addendums which indicates that on completion of the term of the
Addendums, the MOA would stand revived. Prima facie it does appear
that the MOA as amended by the Consent Terms, and the First and
Second Addendums came to an end by efflux of time on 31 st March 2011.
</p>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                       Page 17 of 21</span>
<p id="p_27"> Thereafter while the Respondent proposed a month to month contract, the
Appellant did not agree to the conditions imposed by the Respondent and
maintained that the MOA stood revived. The stand of the Respondent on
the other hand was that the MOA as well as the Addendums had come to
an end by efflux of time. There was no implied continuation of the
contract on the terms specified in the MOA. There was thus no agreement
as such between the parties after 31st March 2011. There is merit in the
contention of the learned Senior counsel for the Respondent that the mere
fact that the Respondent did not withdraw the signals to the Appellant
immediately did not mean that the Respondent had consented to the
extension of the MOA. The Respondent would have otherwise had to
remain idle till it found another Indian party holding a broadcast licence to
enter into an agreement with. It is not possible to accept the contention of
learned Senior counsel for the Appellant that after 31st March 2011, the
automatic extension clause of the MOA dated 9th August 2001 stood
revived and the MOA was meant to expire only on 8th August 2013.
Consequently, the question of a negative covenant in the MOA, i.e.,
Clause 21 thereof, being enforceable thereafter.
</p>

<p id="p_28">26. The relief of an injunction to enforce a negative covenant under
Section 42 SRA is a discretionary one. It is contingent upon the injunction
seeker performing its obligations. Section 42 SRA reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">          "42. Injunction to perform negative agreement: -
          Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1436285/" id="a_31">Section 41</a>,
          where a contract comprises an affirmative agreement to do a
          certain act, coupled with a negative, express or implied, not to do
          a certain act, the circumstances that the Court is unable to compel
          specific performance of the affirmative agreement shall not
          preclude it from granting an injunction to perform the negative
          agreement:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">          Provided that the plaintiff has not failed to perform the contract
          so far as it is binding on him."
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">ARB. A. No. 14/2011 &amp; O.M.P. No. 809/2011                        Page 18 of 21</span>
<p id="p_29"> 27. It is therefore not as if the mere existence of a negative covenant is
enough to persuade a court to grant an interim injunction to enforce it.
Under <a href="/doc/124747/" id="a_32">Section 14</a> (1) (c) SRA a contract which is in its nature
determinable cannot be specifically enforced. Further under <a href="/doc/1436285/" id="a_33">Section 41</a> (e)
SRA an injunction cannot be granted to prevent the breach of a contract
the performance of which would not be specifically enforced. Although
<a href="/doc/1626651/" id="a_34">Section 42</a> is an exception to this rule, and a court can grant an injunction
to perform the negative agreement in a contract which is coupled with an
affirmative agreement, it is conditional upon the contract subsisting at the
time such injunction is sought and further the injunction seeker complying
with the contractual obligations placed on him in terms of the proviso to
Section 42 SRA. As discussed hereinbefore, the Court is prima facie of
the view that the contract came to an end by efflux of time on 31st March
2011. Further, on its own admission the Appellant did not pay the
Respondent any amount from October 2010 onwards. The deposit of 50%
of the minimum guaranteed amount in this Court was only to meet the
condition imposed by this Court while passing the interim order dated 24th
May 2011. Consequently the conditions envisaged under Section 42 SRA
for enforcement of a negative covenant of the MOA do not appear prima
facie to be met.
</p>

<p id="p_30">28. <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_35">In Gujarat Bottling Co. Limited v. Coca Cola Co</a>. the Supreme Court
explained in para 42 that "the Court is, however, not bound to grant an
injunction in every case and an injunction to enforce a negative covenant
would be refused if it would indirectly compel the employee either to
idleness or to serve the employer." The Supreme Court referred to the
earlier decision in <a href="/doc/452434/" id="a_36">Niranjan Shankar Golikari v. Century Spinning &amp;
Manufacturing Co. Limited</a> AIR 1967 SC 1098. In the present case, the
Respondent cannot possibly telecast its channel in India without being an
associated with an Indian broadcaster holding a valid licence. A restraint

 on the respondent from entering into an agreement with third parties
would certainly render it idle if it were not to permit the Appellant to
downlink the signal. Therefore, by continuing the ad interim injunction
restraining the Respondent from contracting with third parties the Court
would be doing indirectly what it cannot directly under <a href="/doc/124747/" id="a_37">Sections 14</a> (1) (c)
read with <a href="/doc/1436285/" id="a_38">Section 41</a> (e) SRA. In other words the Court would in effect be
requiring the Respondent to perform a positive obligation to keep alive a
contract which is not only by its very nature determinable but has in fact
come to an end by efflux of time and is          therefore not specifically
enforceable. The decisions cited by learned Counsel for the Appellant are
distinguishable on facts.
</p>

<p id="p_31">29. This Court does not find any error committed by the Arbitral Tribunal
in its conclusion that the balance of convenience does not lie with the
Appellant and that it is not likely to suffer any irreparable injury if an ad
interim injunction is not granted in its favour. This Court also concurs
with the prima facie opinion expressed by the Arbitral Tribunal that the
injury likely to be suffered by the Respondent by grant of an ad interim
injunction in favour of the Appellant outweighs the injury which could be
suffered by the Appellant if such injunction were not granted.
</p>

<p id="p_32">30. This Court does not find any ground having been made out by the
Appellant for interference with the impugned order of the Arbitral
Tribunal. The relief prayed for in OMP No.809 of 2011 under <a href="/doc/1112600/" id="a_39">Section 9</a>
of the Act also cannot be granted. This Court however reiterates that this
order represents the prima facie view of this Court at this stage. The
Arbitral Tribunal will, in passing the final Award form an independent
view uninfluenced by what has been stated in this order or the impugned
order of the Arbitral Tribunal on merits.
