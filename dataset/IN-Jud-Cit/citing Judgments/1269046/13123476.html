</p><p id="p_6">3.           On February 4, 2005 when these petitions came up for

consideration, the Bench thought that these matters deserved to be heard

by the larger Bench. The full text of the reference order is as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      &quot;In these petitions challenge is to the constitutional validity of
      <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_13">Section 6-A</a> of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946
      (for short, &quot;the Act&quot;). This section was inserted in the Act
      w.e.f. 12-9-2003. It, inter alia, provides for obtaining the
      previous approval of the Central Government for conduct
      of any inquiry or investigation for any offence alleged to have
      been committed under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_14">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1988
      where allegations relate to officers of the level of Joint Secretary
      and above.        Before insertion of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_15">Section 6-A</a> in the Act,
      the requirement to obtain prior approval of the Central Government
      was contained in a directive known as &quot;Single Directive&quot; issued
      by the Government. The Single Directive was a consolidated set of
      instructions issued to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by
      various      Ministries/Departments       regarding   modalities    of
      initiating    an     inquiry    or registering a case against certain
      categories of civil servants. The said directive was stated to have
      been issued to protect decision-making-level officers from the
      threat and         ignominy         of     malicious and     vexatious
      inquiries/investigations and to give protection to officers at the
      decision-making level and to relieve them of the anxiety from the
      likelihood of harassment for taking honest decisions. It was
      said that absence of such protection to them could adversely affect
      the efficiency and efficacy of these institutions because of the
      tendency of such officers to avoid taking any decisions which
      could      later    lead     to harassment by any malicious and
      vexatious inquiries/investigations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      2.      The Single Directive was quashed by this Court in a
      judgment delivered on 18-12-1997 (<a href="/doc/1203995/" id="a_16">Vineet Narain &amp; Ors. v.
      Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. (1998) 1 SCC 226). Within a few

      sought to be inserted providing for the previous approval of

      another Ordinance promulgated on 27-10-1998. From the date of

</p><p id="p_9">3.      The validity of <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_19">Section 6-A</a> has been questioned on the
touchstone of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_20">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Learned amicus curiae
has contended that the impugned provision is wholly subversive
of independent investigation of culpable bureaucrats and strikes
at the core of rule of law as explained in Vineet Narain case and
the principle of independent, unhampered, unbiased and
efficient investigation. The contention is that Vineet Narain
decision frames a structure by which honest officers could
fearlessly enforce the criminal law and detect corruption
uninfluenced by extraneous political, bureaucratic or other
influences and the result of the impugned legislation is
that the very         group of persons, namely, high-ranking
bureaucrats whose misdeeds and illegalities may have to
be inquired into, would decide whether CBI should even start
an inquiry or investigation against them or not. There will be no
confidentiality and insulation of the investigating agency from
political and bureaucratic control and influence because the
approval is to be taken from the Central Government which
would involve leaks and disclosures at every stage. The
very nexus of the criminal-bureaucrat-politician which is subverting
the whole polity would be involved in granting or refusing
prior approval before an inquiry or investigation can take place.
Pointing out that the essence of a police investigation is
skilful inquiry and collection of material and evidence in a
manner by which the potential culpable individuals are not
forewarned, the submission made is that the prior sanction of the
same department would result in indirectly putting to notice the
officers to be investigated before commencement of
investigation. Learned Senior Counsel contends that it is wholly
irrational and arbitrary to protect highly-placed public servants
from inquiry or investigation in the light of the conditions
prevailing in the country and the corruption at high places as
reflected in several judgments of this Court including that of
Vineet Narain. <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_21">Section 6-A</a> of the Act is wholly arbitrary and
unreasonable and is liable to be struck down being
violative     of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_22">Article    14</a> of the Constitution           is the
submission of learned amicus curiae.
</p>
<p id="p_10">4.      In support of the challenge to the constitutional
validity of the impugned provision, besides observations
made in the three-Judge Bench decision in Vineet Narain
case reliance has also been placed on various decisions
including <a href="/doc/627937/" id="a_23">S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India</a> [(1967) 2 SCR 703],
<a href="/doc/1261492/" id="a_24">Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P</a>. [(1991) 1 SCC 212], <a href="/doc/1186368/" id="a_25">Ajay

Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India</a> [(2004) 4 SCC 311] to
emphasize that the absence of arbitrary power is the
first essential of the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional
system is based. In Mardia Chemicals case a three-Judge Bench
held Section 17(2) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of
Financial Assets and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_27">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 to
be unreasonable and arbitrary and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_28">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution. <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_29">Section 17(2)</a> provides for condition of deposit
of 75% of the amount before an appeal could be
entertained.     The condition has been held to be illusory
and oppressive.           <a href="/doc/1490167/" id="a_30">Malpe Vishwanath Acharya v. State of
Maharashtra</a> [(1998) 2 SCC 1], again a decision of a three-
Judge Bench, setting aside the decision of the High Court
which upheld the provisions of Sections 5(10)(b), 11(1)
and 12(3) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging
House Rates Control Act, 1947 pertaining to standard rent
in petitions where the constitutional validity of those provisions
was challenged on the ground of the same being
arbitrary, unreasonable and consequently ultra vires <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_31">Article 14</a>
of the Constitution, has come to the conclusion that the said
provisions are arbitrary and unreasonable.
</p><p id="p_11">5.      Learned Solicitor General, on the other hand, though very
fairly admitting that the nexus between criminals and some
elements of establishment including politicians and various
sections of bureaucracy has increased and also that there is a
disturbing increase in the level of corruption and these
problems need to be addressed, infractions of the law need to
be investigated, investigations have to be conducted          quickly
and      effectively    without    any    interference    and     the
investigative agencies      should     be    allowed   to   function
without any interference of any kind whatsoever and that
they have to be insulated from any extraneous influences
of any kind, contends that a legislation cannot be struck
down on the ground of arbitrariness or unreasonableness
as such a ground is available only to quash executive
action and orders. Further contention is that even a delegated
legislation cannot be quashed on the ground of mere arbitrariness
and even for quashing such a legislation, manifest arbitrariness is
the requirement of law. In support, reliance has been placed
on observations made in a three-Judge Bench decision in
<a href="/doc/1732220/" id="a_32">State of A.P.. v. McDowell &amp; Co</a>. [(1996) 3 SCC 709] that no
enactment can be struck down by just saying that it is arbitrary
or unreasonable and observations made in <a href="/doc/675008/" id="a_33">Khoday Distilleries
Ltd.      v. State of Karnataka</a> [1996 (10) SCC 304] that
delegated legislation can be struck down only if there is manifest
arbitrariness.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                          5</span>
</p><p id="p_13">           6.     In short, the moot question is whether arbitrariness and
           unreasonableness or manifest             arbitrariness       and
           unreasonableness, being facets of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_34">Article 14</a> of the
           Constitution are available or not as grounds to invalidate a
           legislation. Both counsel have placed reliance on observations
           made in decisions rendered by a Bench of three learned Judges.

</p><p id="p_14">           7.     Further contention of learned Solicitor General is that the
           conclusion drawn in Vineet Narain case is erroneous that the
           Constitution Bench decision in <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_35">K. Veeraswami v. Union of India</a>
           [(1991) 3 SCC 655] is not an authority for the proposition that in
           the    case    of   high     officials,   requirement     of prior
           permission/sanction    from     a     higher officer or Head of the
           Department is permissible, the submission is that conclusion
           reached in para 34 of Vineet Narain decision runs
           contrary to observations and findings contained in para 28 of
           Veeraswami case.
</p>
<p id="p_15">           8.    Having regard to the aforesaid, we are of the view that the
           matters deserve to be heard by a larger Bench, subject to
           the orders of Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India.&quot;

Backgroundof Section6- A

</p><p id="p_17">4.                 We may first notice the background in which <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_36">Section 6-A</a> was

inserted in the <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_37">DSPE Act</a>. In 1993, Vineet Narain approached this Court

under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_38">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India complaining inertia by the

Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in matters where the accusation made

was against high dignitaries. The necessity of monitoring the investigation

by this Court is indicated in paragraph 1 of the judgment1, which reads:


</p><p id="p_18">           &quot;These writ petitions under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_39">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India

            potential of escalating to the dimensions they reached or to give rise
            to several issues of considerable significance to the implementation
            of rule of law, which they have, during their progress. They began as
            yet another complaint of inertia by the Central Bureau of Investigation
            (CBI) in matters where the accusation made was against high

       dignitaries. It was not the only matter of its kind during the recent
       past. The primary question was: Whether it is within the domain of
       judicial review and it could be an effective instrument for activating
       the investigative process which is under the control of the executive?
       The focus was on the question, whether any judicial remedy is
       available in such a situation? However, as the case progressed, it
       required innovation of a procedure within the constitutional scheme
       of judicial review to permit intervention by the court to find a solution
       to the problem. This case has helped to develop a procedure within
       the discipline of law for the conduct of such a proceeding in similar
       situations. It has also generated awareness of the need of probity in
       public life and provided a mode of enforcement of accountability in
       public life. Even though the matter was brought to the court by certain
       individuals claiming to represent public interest, yet as the case
       progressed, in keeping with the requirement of public interest, the
       procedure devised was to appoint the petitioners’ counsel as the
       amicus curiae and to make such orders from time to time as were
       consistent with public interest. Intervention in the proceedings by
       everyone else was shut out but permission was granted to all, who so
       desired, to render such assistance as they could, and to provide the
       relevant material available with them to the amicus curiae for being
       placed before the court for its consideration. In short, the
       proceedings in this matter have had great educative value and it
       does appear that it has helped in future decision-making and
       functioning of the public authorities.&quot;

certain instructions to CBI regarding modalities of initiating an inquiry or

registering a case against certain categories of civil servants, fell for

consideration. We shall refer to Single Directive No. 4.7(3) at some length a

little later but suffice to say here that this Court struck down Single Directive

No.4.7(3). While doing so, the Court also made certain recommendations in

respect of CBI and Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). One of such

recommendations was to confer statutory status to CVC.

Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs for

class and thereby subverts the normal investigative process and violates

the fundamental right(s) under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_55">Article 14</a> of every citizen. He submits that if

the impugned provision is replicated at the State level and provision of

‘previous approval’ by respective State Governments is required, then the

rule of law would completely collapse in the whole of India and no high level
corruption would be investigated or punished. He relies upon decision of

this Court in Vineet Narain1. He also relies upon the decision in I.R. Coelho2

in support of the proposition that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_56">Article 14</a> is a part of the rule of law and it

is the duty of the judiciary to enforce the rule of law.

independence of CBI to hold a preliminary enquiry (PE) or investigation.

Citing the judgments of this Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation (2G

Spectrum case)3 and Manohar Lal Sharma4 following Vineet Narain1,

learned amicus curiae submits that trend of these judgments is to preserve

the rule of law by insulating the CBI from executive influence which could

derail and result in inaction in enforcing the criminal law against high level

corruption. Learned amicus curiae highlighted that there was no

requirement of previous approval as contained in the impugned provisions

referred to N.N. Vohra Committee report which paints a frightening picture

of criminal-bureaucratic-political nexus - a network of high level corruption

block inquiry and investigation by CBI by conferring the power of previous

approval on the Central Government.

<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">14.         Mr. Anil B. Divan, learned amicus curiae wants us to take

judicial notice of the fact that high level bureaucratic corruption goes hand

in hand, on many occasions, with political corruption at the highest level.

This very group of high ranking bureaucrats, whose misconduct and

criminality, if any, requires to be first inquired into and thereafter

investigated, can thwart, defeat and impair this exercise. In substance, the
potential accused would decide whether or not their conduct should be

inquired into. He argues that the essence of skillful and effective police

investigation is by collection of evidence and material secretly, without

leakage so that the potential accused is not forewarned leading to

destruction or tempering of evidence and witnesses. Such investigation is

compromised by the impugned provision, viz., <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_61">Section 6-A</a> of the DSPE Act.

The requirement of previous approval in the impugned provision would

mean leakages as well as breach of confidentiality and would be wholly

destructive of an efficient investigation. The provision, such as <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_62">Section 6-A</a>,

offers an impregnable shield (except when there is a court monitored

investigation) to the criminal-bureaucratic-political nexus. If the CBI is not

even allowed to verify complaints by preliminary enquiry, how can the case

move forward? In such a situation, the very commencement of enquiry /

investigation is thwarted and delayed. Moreover, a preliminary enquiry is

intended to ascertain whether a prima facie case for investigation is made

out or not. If CBI is prevented from holding a preliminary enquiry, it will not

be able to even gather relevant material for the purpose of obtaining

previous approval.

A of the DSPE Act can be seen in the reply to the debate in Parliament on

those who are in decision making positions, those who have to exercise

discretion and those who have to take vital decisions could become target

of frivolous complaints and need to be protected. Therefore, some

screening mechanism must be put into place whereby serious complaints

would be investigated and frivolous complaints can be thrown out. If such

protection is not given to senior decision makers, anyone can file a
complaint and the CBI or the police can raid the houses of such senior

officers. This may affect governance inasmuch as instead of tendering

making level would only give safe and non-committal advice. He argues

that the object of <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_99">Section 6-A</a> is to provide screening mechanism to filter out

frivolous or motivated investigation that could be initiated against senior

officers to protect them from harassment and to enable them to take

Veeraswami25 were strongly pressed into service by Mr. L. Nageswara Rao.

against senior government servants as such. It only provides a filter or pre-

simply on the ground of unreasonableness as that by itself does not

constitute a ground. He submits that a Constitution Bench in K.T. Plantation

proportionality, etc., always raises an element of subjectivity on which Court

cannot strike down a statute or a statutory provision. Unless a constitutional

infirmity is pointed out, a legislation cannot be struck down by just using the

word ‘arbitrary’. In this regard, he heavily relies upon the decisions of this

Court in In re. Natural Resources Allocation33, McDowell 34 and Rakesh

concept above the Constitution. Relying upon Indira Nehru Gandhi37,

learned Additional Solicitor General argues that meaning and constituent

elements of rule of law must be gathered from the enacting provisions of

the Constitution; vesting discretionary powers in the Government is not

contrary to the rule of law. Moreover, he submits that exceptions to the

exceptions cannot be termed as violating the rule of law. In this regard,

learned Additional Solicitor General refers to <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_116">Section 197</a> of Cr.P.C. and

relies upon Matajog Dobey38, wherein this Court upheld constitutional

         the statute in question. The classification may be founded on
         different bases; namely, geographical, or according to objects or
         occupations or the like. What is necessary is that there must be a

<p id="p_94">41.            In Ram Krishna Dalmia41, it was emphasized that the above

principles will have to be constantly borne in mind by the court when it is

called upon to adjudge the constitutionality of any particular law attacked

as discriminatory and violative of the equal protection of laws.


</p><p id="p_95">42.            Having culled out the above principles, the Constitution Bench

in Ram Krishna Dalmia41, further observed that statute which may come up

for consideration on the question of its validity under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_180">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution may be placed in one or other of the following five classes:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                                                                29</span>
&quot;(i)    A statute may itself indicate the persons or things to whom
its provisions are intended to apply and the basis of the
classification of such persons or things may appear on the face of
the statute or may be gathered from the surrounding circumstances
known to or brought to the notice of the court. In determining the
validity or otherwise of such a statute the court has to examine
whether such classification is or can be reasonably regarded as
based upon some differentia which distinguishes such persons or
things grouped together from those left out of the group and
whether such differentia has a reasonable relation to the object
sought to be achieved by the statute, no matter whether the
provisions of the statute are intended to apply only to a particular
person or thing or only to a certain class of persons or things.
Where the court finds that the classification satisfies the tests, the
court will uphold the validity of the law.
</p>
<p id="p_96">
</p><p id="p_97">(ii)   A statute may direct its provisions against one individual
person or thing or to several individual persons or things but no
reasonable basis of classification may appear on the face of it or
be deducible from the surrounding circumstances, or matters of
common knowledge. In such a case the court will strike down the
law as an instance of naked discrimination.
</p>
<p id="p_98">
</p><p id="p_99">(iii)   A statute may not make any classification of the persons or
things for the purpose of applying its provisions but may leave it to
the discretion of the Government to select and classify persons or
things to whom its provisions are to apply. In determining the
question of the validity or otherwise of such a statute the court will
not strike down the law out of hand only because no classification
appears on its face or because a discretion is given to the
Government to make the selection or classification but will go on to
examine and ascertain if the statute has laid down any principle or
policy for the guidance of the exercise of discretion by the
Government in the matter of the selection or classification. After
such scrutiny the court will strike down the statute if it does not lay
down any principle or policy for guiding the exercise of discretion
by the Government in the matter of selection or classification, on
the ground that the statute provides for the delegation of arbitrary
and uncontrolled power to the Government so as to enable it to
discriminate between persons or things similarly situate and that,
therefore, the discrimination is inherent in the statute itself. In such
a case the court will strike down both the law as well as the
executive action taken under such law.

</p><p id="p_104">43.            In Vithal Rao17, the five-Judge Constitution Bench had an

occasion to consider the test of reasonableness under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_181">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution. It noted that the State can make a reasonable classification

for the purpose of legislation and that the classification in order to be

reasonable must satisfy two tests: (i) the classification must be founded on

intelligible differentia and (ii) the differentia must have a rational relation

with the object sought to be achieved by the legislation in question. The

Court emphasized that in this regard object itself should be lawful and it

cannot be discriminatory.        If the object is to discriminate against one

section of the minority, the discrimination cannot be justified on the ground

that there is a reasonable classification because it has rational relation to

the object sought to be achieved.

consideration in re. Special Courts Bill, 197812 as the President of India

made a reference to this Court under <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_182">Article 143(1)</a> of the Constitution for

consideration of the question whether the &quot;Special Courts Bill&quot; or any of its

provisions, if enacted would be constitutionally invalid. The seven Judge

Constitution Bench dealt with the scope of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_183">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

Noticing the earlier decisions of this Court in Budhan Choudhry69, Ram

Krishna Dalmia41, C.I. Emden70, Kangsari Haldar71, Jyoti Pershad49 and

Ambica Mills Ltd.72, in the majority judgment the then Chief Justice Y.V.

Chandrachud, inter alia, exposited the following propositions relating to

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_184">Article 14:</a>
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><p id="p_108">        &quot;(1)      xxx                         xxx                               xxx

        (2) The State, in the exercise of its governmental power, has of
        necessity to make laws operating differently on different groups or
        classes of persons within its territory to attain particular ends in
        giving effect to its policies, and it must possess for that purpose
        large powers of distinguishing and classifying persons or things to
        be subjected to such laws.
</p>
<p id="p_109">        (3) The constitutional command to the State to afford equal
        protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and
        application of a precise formula. Therefore, classification need not
        be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of
        persons or things. The courts should not insist on delusive
        exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of
        classification in any given case. Classification is justified if it is not
          palpably arbitrary.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">2</span>
(4) The principle underlying the guarantee of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_188">Article 14</a> is not that
the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the
Indian territory or that the same remedies should be made
available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances. It
only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be
treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed.
Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation,
and there should be no discrimination between one person and
another if as regards the subject-matter of the legislation their
position is substantially the same.
</p>
<p id="p_112">(5) By the process of classification, the State has the power of
determining who should be regarded as a class for purposes of
legislation and in relation to a law enacted on a particular subject.
This power, no doubt, in some degree is likely to produce some
inequality; but if a law deals with the liberties of a number of well-
defined classes, it is not open to the charge of denial of equal
protection on the ground that it has no application to other persons.
Classification thus means segregation in classes which have a
systematic relation, usually found in common properties and
characteristics. It postulates a rational basis and does not mean
herding together of certain persons and classes arbitrarily.

(6) The law can make and set apart the classes according to the
needs and exigencies of the society and as suggested by
experience. It can recognise even degree of evil, but the
classification should never be arbitrary, artificial or evasive.

(7) The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational,
that is to say, it must not only be based on some qualities or
characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped
together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or
characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the
legislation. In order to pass the test, two conditions must be
fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must be founded on an
intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped
together from others and (2) that that differentia must have a
rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.

(8) The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the
object of the Act are distinct things and what is necessary is that
there must be a nexus between them. In short, while <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_189">Article 14</a>
forbids class discrimination by conferring privileges or imposing
liabilities upon persons arbitrarily selected out of a large number of
other persons similarly situated in relation to the privileges sought
to be conferred or the liabilities proposed to be imposed, it does
not forbid classification for the purpose of legislation, provided
such classification is not arbitrary in the sense above mentioned.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">                                                                           33</span>
(9) If the legislative policy is clear and definite and as an effective
method of carrying out that policy a discretion is vested by the
statute upon a body of administrators or officers to make selective
application of the law to certain classes or groups of persons, the
statute itself cannot be condemned as a piece of discriminatory
legislation. In such cases, the power given to the executive body
would import a duty on it to classify the subject-matter of legislation
in accordance with the objective indicated in the statute. If the
administrative body proceeds to classify persons or things on a
basis which has no rational relation to the objective of the
Legislature, its action can be annulled as offending against the
equal protection clause. On the other hand, if the statute itself does
not disclose a definite policy or objective and it confers authority on
another to make selection at its pleasure, the statute would be held
on the face of it to be discriminatory, irrespective of the way in
which it is applied.
</p>
<p id="p_113">(10) Whether a law conferring discretionary powers on an
administrative authority is constitutionally valid or not should not be
determined on the assumption that such authority will act in an
arbitrary manner in exercising the discretion committed to it. Abuse
of power given by law does occur; but the validity of the law cannot
be contested because of such an apprehension. Discretionary
power is not necessarily a discriminatory power.
</p>
<p id="p_114">(11) Classification necessarily implies the making of a distinction or
discrimination between persons classified and those who are not
members of that class. It is the essence of a classification that
upon the class are cast duties and burdens different from those
resting upon the general public. Indeed, the very idea of
classification is that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that
the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines the matter of
constitutionality.
</p>
<p id="p_115">(12) Whether an enactment providing for special procedure for the
trial of certain offences is or is not discriminatory and violative of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_190">Article 14</a> must be determined in each case as it arises, for, no
general rule applicable to all cases can safely be laid down. A
practical assessment of the operation of the law in the particular
circumstances is necessary.
</p>
<p id="p_116">(13) A rule of procedure laid down by law comes as much within
the purview of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_191">Article 14</a> as any rule of substantive law and it is
necessary that all litigants, who are similarly situated, are able to
avail themselves of the same procedural rights for relief and for
defence with like protection and without discrimination.&quot;

principle which informs both Articles 14 and 16 are equality and inhibition

<p id="p_122">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">       &quot;....From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to

       arbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to
       political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of
       <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_197">Article 14</a>, and if it affects any matter relating to public employment,

a presumption of constitutionality of an enactment, and a clear

transgression of constitutional principles must be shown. The fundamental

nature and importance of the legislative process needs to be recognized by

the Court and due regard and deference must be accorded to the

legislative process. Where the legislation is sought to be challenged as

authority to pass administrative orders - if such conferment is without any

guidance, control or checks, it is violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_202">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.

The Court also needs to be mindful that a legislation does not become

unconstitutional merely because there is another view or because another

method may be considered to be as good or even more effective, like any

issue of social, or even economic policy. It is well settled that the courts do

not substitute their views on what the policy is.

paragraphs 45 and 46 held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_132">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_21">      &quot;45. Obviously, where the accusation of corruption is based on
      direct evidence and it does not require any inference to be drawn
      dependent on the decision-making process, there is no rational
      basis to classify them differently. In other words, if the accusation
      be of bribery which is supported by direct evidence of acceptance
      of illegal gratification by them, including trap cases, it is obvious
      that no other factor is relevant and the level or status of the
      offender is irrelevant. It is for this reason that it was conceded that
      such cases, i.e., of bribery, including trap cases, are outside the
      scope of the Single Directive. After some debate at the Bar, no
      serious attempt was made by the learned Attorney General to
      support inclusion within the Single Directive of cases in which the
      offender is alleged to be in possession of disproportionate assets.
      It is clear that the accusation of possession of disproportionate
      assets by a person is also based on direct evidence and no factor
      pertaining to the expertise of decision-making is involved therein.
      We have, therefore, no doubt that the Single Directive cannot
      include within its ambit cases of possession of disproportionate
      assets by the offender. The question now is only with regard to
      cases other than those of bribery, including trap cases, and of
      possession of disproportionate assets being covered by the Single
      Directive.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      46. There may be other cases where the accusation cannot be
      supported by direct evidence and is a matter of inference of corrupt
      motive for the decision, with nothing to prove directly any illegal
      gain to the decision-maker. Those are cases in which the inference
      drawn is that the decision must have been made for a corrupt
      motive because the decision could not have been reached
      otherwise by an officer at that level in the hierarchy. This is,
      therefore, an area where the opinion of persons with requisite
      expertise in decision-making of that kind is relevant and, may be
      even decisive in reaching the conclusion whether the allegation
      requires any investigation to be made. In view of the fact that the
      CBI or the police force does not have the expertise within its fold
      for the formation of the requisite opinion in such cases, the need
      for the inclusion of such a mechanism comprising of experts in the
      field as a part of the infrastructure of the CBI is obvious, to decide
      whether the accusation made discloses grounds for a reasonable
      suspicion of the commission of an offence and it requires
      investigation. In the absence of any such mechanism within the
      infrastructure of the CBI, comprising of experts in the field who can

       evaluate the material for the decision to be made, introduction
       therein of a body of experts having expertise of the kind of
       business which requires the decision to be made, can be
       appreciated. But then, the final opinion is to be of the CBI with the
       aid of that advice and not that of anyone else. It would be more

Can the Legislature lay down different principles for investigation/inquiry

into the allegations of corruption for the public servants who hold a

particular position? Is such classification founded on sound differentia? To

answer these questions, we should eschew the doctrinaire approach.

Rather, we should test the validity of impugned classification by broad

considerations having regard to the legislative policy relating to prevention

of corruption enacted in the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_215">PC Act</a>, 1988 and the powers of

process of classification, what should be regarded as a class for purposes

of legislation and in relation to law enacted on a particular subject. There

is bound to be some degree of inequality when there is segregation of one

class from the other. However, such segregation must be rational and not

artificial or evasive. In other words, the classification must not only be

based on some qualities or characteristics, which are to be found in all

persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those

qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of

the legislation.   Differentia which is the basis of classification must be

the object itself is discriminatory, then explanation that classification is

reasonable having rational relation to the object sought to be achieved is

immaterial.

on the basis of status in the Government service is not permissible under

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_218">Article 14</a> as it defeats the purpose of finding prima facie truth into the

allegations of graft, which amount to an offence under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_219">PC Act</a>, 1988.

Can there be sound differentiation between corrupt public servants based

on their status? Surely not, because irrespective of their status or position,

corrupt public servants are corrupters of public power. The corrupt public

servants, whether high or low, are birds of the same feather and must be

confronted with the process of investigation and inquiry equally. Based on

the position or status in service, no distinction can be made between public

servants against whom there are allegations amounting to an offence under

the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_220">PC Act</a>, 1988.

public servants and punishing such persons is a necessary mandate of the

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_221">PC Act</a>, 1988. It is difficult to justify the classification which has been made

in <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_222">Section 6-A</a> because the goal of law in the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_223">PC Act</a>, 1988 is to meet

corruption cases with a very strong hand and all public servants are warned

through such a legislative measure that corrupt public servants have to

face very serious consequences. In the words of Mathew, J. in Ambica

Mills Ltd.72, &quot;The equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection

of equal laws. But laws may classify...... A reasonable classification is one

which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not&quot;.

Mathew, J., while explaining the meaning of the words, ‘similarly situated’

stated that we must look beyond the classification to the purpose of the

law. The purpose of a law may be either the elimination of a public mischief

or the achievement of some positive public good. The classification made

in <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_224">Section 6-A</a> neither eliminates public mischief nor achieves some

positive public good. On the other hand, it advances public mischief and
protects the crime-doer.           The provision thwarts an independent,

unhampered, unbiased, efficient and fearless inquiry / investigation to track

down the corrupt public servants.

<p id="p_144">
</p><p id="p_145">60.            The essence of police investigation is skilful inquiry and

collection of material and evidence in a manner by                  which      the

potential   culpable individuals are not forewarned. The previous approval

from the Government necessarily required under <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_225">Section 6-A</a> would result

in indirectly putting to notice the officers     to   be   investigated     before

commencement          of    investigation.   Moreover, if the CBI is not even

allowed to verify complaints by preliminary enquiry, how can the case

move forward? A preliminary enquiry is intended to ascertain whether a

prima facie case for investigation is made out or not. If CBI is prevented

from holding a preliminary enquiry, at the very threshold, a fetter is put to

enable the CBI to gather relevant material. As a matter of fact, the CBI is

not able to collect the material even to move the Government for the

purpose of obtaining previous approval from the Central Government.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                                                                                44</span>
</p><p id="p_146">61.            It is important to bear in mind that as per the CBI Manual,

(Paragraph 9.10) a preliminary enquiry relating to allegations of bribery and

corruption should be limited to the scrutiny of records and interrogation of

bare minimum persons which being necessary to judge whether there is

any substance in the allegations which are being enquired into and whether

the case is worth pursuing further or not. Even this exercise of scrutiny of

records and gathering relevant information to find out whether the case is

worth pursuing further or not is not possible. In the criminal justice system,

the inquiry and investigation into an offence is the domain of the police.

The very power of CBI to enquire and investigate into the allegations of

bribery and corruption against a certain class of public servants and

officials in public undertakings is subverted and impinged by Section 6-A.


</p><p id="p_147">62.            The justification for having such classification is founded

principally on the statement made by the then Minister of Law and Justice

that if no protection is to be given to the officers, who take the decisions

and make discretions, then anybody can file a complaint and an inspector

of the CBI or the police can raid their houses any moment. If this
elementary protection is not given to the senior decision makers, they

would not tender honest advice to political executives. Such senior officers

then may play safe and give non-committal advice affecting the

governance. The justification for classification in <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_226">Section 6-A</a> is also put

forth on the basis of the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                                                                             45</span>
which CVC Bill, 1999 was referred particularly at the question relating to

Clause 27 regarding amendment of the <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_227">DSPE Act</a> (the provision which is

now <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_228">Section 6-A</a>). The Joint Parliamentary Committee, in this regard noted

as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_148">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">              &quot;The Committee note that many witnesses who
              appeared before the Committee had expressed the
              need to protect the bonafide actions at the decision
              making level. At present there is no provision in the Bill
              for seeking prior approval of the Commission or the
              head of the Department etc. for registering a case
              against a person of the decision making level. As such,
              no protection is available to the persons at the decision
              making level. In this regard, the Committee note that
              earlier, the prior approval of the Government was
              required in the form of a ‘Single Directive’ which was set
              aside by the Supreme Court. The Committee feel that
              such a protection should be restored in the same format
              which was there earlier and desire that the power of
              giving prior approval for taking action against a senior
              officer of the decision making level should be vested
              with the Central Government by making appropriate
              provision in the Act.        The Committee, therefore,
              recommend that Clause 27 of the Bill accordingly
              amended so as to insert a new <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_229">section 6A</a> to the <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_230">DSPE
              Act</a>, 1946, to this effect.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_149">63.           As a matter of fact, the justification for <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_231">Section 6-A</a> which has

been put forth before us on behalf of the Central Government was the

justification for Single Directive       4.7(3)(i) in Vineet Narain1 as well.

However, the Court was unable to persuade itself with the same. In Vineet

Narain1 in respect of Single Directive 4.7(3)(i), the Court said that every

person accused of committing the same offence is to be dealt with in the

same manner in accordance with law, which is equal in its application to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                                                                             46</span>
everyone. We are in agreement with the above observation in Vineet

Narain1, which, in our opinion, equally applies to <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_232">Section 6-A</a>. In Vineet

Narain1, this Court did not accept the argument that the Single Directive is

applicable only to certain class of officers above the specified level who
are decision making officers and a distinction can be made for them for the

purpose of investigation of an offence of which they are accused. We are

also clearly of the view that no distinction can be made for certain class of

officers specified in <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_233">Section 6-A</a> who are described as decision making

officers for the purpose of inquiry/investigation into an offence under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_234">PC

Act</a>, 1988. There is no rational basis to classify the two sets of public

servants differently on the ground that one set of officers is decision

making officers and not the other set of officers. If there is an accusation of

bribery, graft, illegal gratification or criminal misconduct against a public

servant, then we fail to understand as to how the status of offender is of

any relevance. Where there are allegations against a public servant which

amount to an offence under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_235">PC Act</a>, 1988, no factor pertaining to

expertise of decision making is involved.        Yet, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_236">Section 6-A</a> makes a

distinction. It is this vice which renders <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_237">Section 6-A</a> violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_238">Article 14.</a>

Moreover, the result of the impugned legislation is that the very group of

persons, namely, high ranking bureaucrats         whose     misdeeds         and

illegalities may have to be inquired into, would decide whether the

CBI should even start an inquiry or investigation against them or not.

whether to proceed or not in such cases should be with the CBI itself and

not with the Central Government and (b) in any event the final decision to

commence investigation into the offences must be of the CBI with the
internal aid and advice and not of anybody else. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_241">Section 6-A</a> also suffers

from the vice of classifying offenders differently for treatment thereunder for

inquiry and investigation of offences, according to their status in life. Every

person accused of committing the same offence is to be dealt with in the

same manner in accordance with law, which is equal in its application to

everyone.

Committee under the Chairmanship of the former Home Secretary (Shri

N.N. Vohra) to take stock of all available information about the activities of

the crime syndicates/mafia organizations, which had developed links with

and were being permitted by Government functionaries and political

personalities. In para 14.3 of the report, the Committee has observed that

linkages of crime syndicate with senior Government functionaries or

political leaders in the States or at the Centre could have a destabilizing

effect on the functioning of the Government. The report paints a frightening

picture of criminal-bureaucratic-political nexus - a network of high level

corruption. The impugned provision puts this nexus in a position to block

inquiry and investigation by CBI by conferring the power of previous

approval on the Central Government.

</p><p id="p_164">67.          Can it be said that the classification is based on intelligible

differentia when one set of bureaucrats of Joint Secretary level and above

who are working with the Central Government are offered protection under

<a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_255">Section 6-A</a> while the same level of officers who are working in the States

do not get protection though both classes of these officers are accused of

an offence under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_256">PC Act</a>, 1988 and inquiry / investigation into such

allegations is to be carried out.     Our answer is in the negative. The

provision in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_257">Section 6-A</a>, thus, impedes tracking down the corrupt senior

bureaucrats as without previous approval of the Central Government, the

CBI cannot even hold preliminary inquiry much less an investigation into the

allegations. The protection in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_258">Section 6-A</a> has propensity of shielding the
corrupt. The object of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_259">Section 6-A</a>, that senior public servants of the level

of Joint Secretary and above who take policy decision must not be put to

any harassment, side-tracks the fundamental objective of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_260">PC Act</a>, 1988

to deal with corruption and act against senior public servants. The CBI is

not able to proceed even to collect the material to unearth prima facie

substance into the merits of allegations. Thus, the object of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_261">Section 6-A</a>

itself is discriminatory. That being the position, the discrimination cannot be

justified on the ground that there is a reasonable classification because it

has rational relation to the object sought to be achieved.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">                                                                              51</span>

this signature tune and effectively <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_263">Article 14.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_166">
</p><p id="p_167">69.          Undoubtedly, every differentiation is not a discrimination but at

the same time, differentiation must be founded on pertinent and real

differences as distinguished from irrelevant and artificial ones. A simple

physical grouping which separates one category from the other without any

rational basis is not a sound or intelligible differentia. The separation or

segregation must have a systematic relation and rational basis and the

object of such segregation must not be discriminatory. Every public servant

against whom there is reasonable suspicion of commission of crime or

there are allegations of an offence under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_264">PC Act</a>, 1988 has to be treated

equally and similarly under the law. Any distinction made between them on

the basis of their status or position in service for the purposes of inquiry /

investigation is nothing but an artificial one and offends <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_265">Article 14.</a>


</p><p id="p_168">70.          Office of public power cannot be the workshop of personal

gain. The probity in public life is of great importance. How can two public

servants against whom there are allegations of corruption or graft or bribe-

taking or criminal misconduct under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_266">PC Act</a>, 1988 can be made to be

treated differently because one happens to be a junior officer and the other,

a senior decision maker.

</p><p id="p_170">71.           Corruption is an enemy of nation and tracking down corrupt
public servant, howsoever high he may be, and punishing such person is a

necessary mandate under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_267">PC Act</a>, 1988. The status or position of

public servant does not qualify such public servant from exemption from

equal treatment. The decision making power does not segregate corrupt

officers into two classes as they are common crime doers and have to be

tracked down by the same process of inquiry and investigation.


</p><p id="p_171">72.           It is argued on behalf of the Central Government that now

office memorandum (dated 26.09.2011) approving the recommendations

made by the Group of Ministers has been issued which provides inter alia

for quick consideration of the request by the CBI for approval and also to

give reasons for granting / rejecting sanction under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_268">Section 6-A</a>.          It is

submitted that delay in disposal of the requests by the CBI is now taken

care of and if there is denial of sanction order under <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_269">Section 6-A</a>, such order

of the Central Government can be challenged in a writ petition before the

High Court. Such protection, it is submitted, is even recognized by United

Nations in <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_270">Article 30</a> of the UN Convention against corruption. This aspect

has been considered by this Court in Manohar Lal Sharma4 to which we

shall refer appropriately a little later.

coverage and by strengthening the provisions.                        It came to be enacted

because <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_272">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1947 as amended from time to time

was inadequate to deal with the offences of corruption effectively. The new

Act now seeks to provide for speedy trial of offences punishable under the

amongst the public servants.

corruption by public servants not only leads to corrosion of the moral fabric

of the society but also harmful to the national economy and national

misusing their power due to corruption can cause considerable damage to

       magnitude of corruption in our public life is incompatible with the
       concept of a socialist secular democratic republic. It cannot be
       disputed that where corruption begins all rights end. Corruption
       devalues human rights, chokes development and undermines
       justice, liberty, equality, fraternity which are the core values in our
       Preambular vision. Therefore, the duty of the court is that any anti-

that this provision virtually imposes fetters on private citizens and also on

servants are treated as a special class of persons enjoying the said

protection so that they can perform their duties without fear and favour and

without threats of malicious prosecution but the               protection against

malicious prosecution which is extended in public interest cannot become a

during the period when the Single Directive was not in operation or until
<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_323">Section 6-A</a> was brought on the statute book, CBI harassed any senior

government officer or investigated frivolous and vexatious complaints. The

high-pitched argument in justification of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_324">Section 6-A</a> that senior government

officers may be unduly and unnecessarily harassed on frivolous and

vexatious complaints, therefore, does not hold water.

</p><p id="p_199">85.          Criminal justice system mandates that any investigation into

the crime should be fair, in accordance with law and should not be tainted.

It is equally important that interested or influential persons are not able to

misdirect or highjack the investigation so as to throttle a fair investigation

resulting in the offenders escaping the punitive course of law. These are

important facets of rule of law.    Breach of rule of law, in our opinion,

Cr.P.C. can investigate it after obtaining appropriate order from the

Magistrate having power to try such case or commit the case for trial

regardless of the status of the officer concerned. The scheme of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_332">Section

155</a> and <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_333">Section 156</a> Cr.P.C. indicates that the local police may investigate

a senior Government officer without previous approval of the Central

Government. However, CBI cannot do so in view of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_334">Section 6-A</a>. This

anomaly in fact occurred in Centre for PIL79. That was a matter in which

investigations were conducted by the local police in respect of senior

Government official without any previous approval and a challan filed in the

court of Special Judge dealing with offences under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_335">PC Act</a>, 1988.

Dealing with such anomaly in Centre for PIL79, Madan B. Lokur, J. in

Manohar Lal Sharma4 observed, &quot;It is difficult to understand the logic
behind such a dichotomy unless it is assumed                                  that   frivolous
 and

vexatious complaints are made only when the CBI is the investigating

agency and that it is only CBI that is capable of harassing or victimizing a

senior Government official while the local police of the State Government

does not entertain frivolous and vexatious complaints and is not capable of

harassing or victimizing a senior government official. No such assumption

can be made.&quot;             The above clearly indicates that <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_336">Section 6-A</a> has brought

an anomalous situation and the very object of the provision to give

protection to certain officers (Joint Secretary and above) in the Central
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">79</span>

</p><p id="p_202">87.         It is pertinent to notice that in Subramanian Swamy9 this Court

noted that as per supplementary written submissions tendered by the

learned Attorney General, 126 cases were awaiting sanction for

prosecution from the Central Government for periods ranging from one

year to few months. Moreover, in more than one-third of the cases of

requests for prosecution in corruption cases against public servants,

sanctions have not been accorded. Whether an enactment providing for

special procedure for a certain class of persons is or is not discriminatory

and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_339">Article 14</a> must be determined in its own context. A

practical assessment of the operation of the law in particular circumstances

is necessary and the court can take judicial notice of existing conditions

from time to time. The scenario noted in Subramanian Swamy9 and the

facts in Telecom Watchdog5 - to illustrate the few - show that differentia in

<a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_340">Section 6-A</a> is directly destructive and runs counter to the object and

reason of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_341">PC Act</a>, 1988. It also undermines the object of detecting and

punishing high level corruption.

       suitable preliminary enquiry into the allegations by a responsible

their status.

Government is required since the inquiry does not have the same adverse

connotation that an investigation has. To that extent, <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_342">Section 6-A</a>, as it is,

does not survive. Insofar as investigation is concerned, an investigation

into a crime may have some adverse impact but where there are

whether high or low, whether decision-maker or not, an independent

investigation into such allegations is of utmost importance and unearthing

the truth is the goal. The aim and object of investigation is ultimately to

      a competent authority. That does not mean that the Act was
      intended to condone the offence of bribery and corruption by public
      servant. Nor it was meant to afford protection to public servant from
      criminal prosecution for such offences. It is only to protect the
      honest public servants from frivolous and vexatious prosecution.
      The competent authority has to examine independently and
      impartially the material on record to form his own opinion whether
      the offence alleged is frivolous or vexatious. The competent
      authority may refuse sanction for prosecution if the offence alleged
      has no material to support or it is frivolous or intended to harass
      the honest officer. But he cannot refuse to grant sanction if the
      material collected has made out the commission of the offence
      alleged against the public servant. Indeed he is duty-bound to
      grant sanction if the material collected lend credence to the offence
      complained of. There seems to be another reason for taking away
      the discretion of the investigating agency to prosecute or not to
      prosecute a public servant. When a public servant is prosecuted
      for an offence which challenges his honesty and integrity, the issue
      in such a case is not only between the prosecutor and the offender,
      but the State is also vitally concerned with it as it affects the morale
      of public servants and also the administrative interest of the State.

direction by the Court. The feature of independence of judiciary has no

application to the officers covered by the Single Directive. The need for

independence of judiciary from the executive influence does not arise in the

case of officers belonging to the executive.....&quot;

found to be confined to the Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme

Court, who are constitutional functionaries, and their position being distinct

and different from the Government officers. In our opinion, the Constitution

Bench decision in K. Veeraswami25 has no application to the senior public

servants specified in <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_347">Section 6-A</a>. We have, therefore, no hesitation in

holding that the conclusion reached in para 34 in Vineet Narain1, in no

manner, can be said to be inconsistent with the findings recorded in para

28 of K. Veeraswami25.

Mr. L. Nageswara Rao where permission of the government is required

before taking cognizance or for institution of an offence. <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_348">Section 197</a> of

Cr.P.C. was also referred to, which provides for protection to Judges and

public servants from prosecution except with the previous sanction by the

competent authority. It may be immediately stated that there is no similarity

between the impugned provision in <a href="/doc/131125629/" id="a_349">Section 6-A</a> of the DSPE Act and

<a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_350">Section 197</a> of Cr.P.C. Moreover, where challenge is laid to the

constitutionality of a legislation on the bedrock or touchstone of

classification, it has to be determined in each case by applying well-settled

two tests: (i) that classification is founded on intelligible differentia and (ii)

that differentia has a rational relation with the object sought to be achieved

by the legislation. Each case has to be examined independently in the

context of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_351">Article 14</a> and not by applying any general rule.
