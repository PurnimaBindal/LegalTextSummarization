                   the marks &#x27;RONAK&#x27;, &#x27;AUTOMAX&#x27;, &#x27;WIREPOOL&#x27; &#x27;DATSUN&#x27; etc.,

</p><p id="p_38">                   22.   H.S. Sahni states that the Appellants, by using the impugned mark
                   &quot;M.G. Cable&quot; and adopting &quot;M.G. Cables (India)&quot; are infringing his
                   registered trademarks &quot;M.G.&quot; and &quot;M.G.I.&quot;. Further, the trade name and
                   the impugned marks used by the Appellants were visually, phonetically
                   and structurally identical to his registered trademarks. He further
                   contended that the placement of the letters &#x27;M&#x27; and &#x27;G&#x27; had been
                   deliberately copied by the Appellants and the word &#x27;Cable&#x27; is a generic
                   word describing the goods and therefore, if the generic word is ignored,
                   the similarity in the two marks is apparent. He also contended that the
                   Appellants had registered their marks under Class 6, however, they were
                   attempting to dishonestly produce and market their goods under Class 12
                   by using the trademarks that were deceptively similar to his registered
                   trademarks.

<p id="p_39">                   THE IMPUGNED ORDER:
</p>

<p id="p_40">                   23.   On 02.09.2019, the learned Commercial Court considered the rival
                   submissions and prima facie, found merit in the Appellants&#x27; case. The
                   learned Commercial Court was of a prima facie view that H.S. Sahni had
                   infringed the Appellants&#x27; trademark and had passed off his goods as those
                   of the Appellants. The relevant extract of the impugned order is

                              documents filed in support therein, it is reflected that
                              plaintiff has prima facie shown that he is having
                              registered trademark for the mark &#x27;M.G.Cable&#x27;. Plaintiff
                              has also been able to show that he is the prior user since

                             1996 and as per the documents with particular mention of
                             &#x27;M.G. Cable&#x27; since, 2000 onwards. Plaintiff has also been
                             able to show prima facie that he is having a copyright of
                             his trade-dress. Defendant on the other has not been able
                             to show prima facie his prior use than the plaintiff. More
                             particularly the trade-dress used by the defendant appears
                             to be similar to the trade-dress of the plaintiff. The trade-
                             dress of both the parties which are available on the
                             judicial record have been perused thoroughly. Plaintiff
                             has also been able to show prima facie that he has also
                             obtained NOC from Registrar of Trademark as well.
                             Thus, the judgments relied upon by the plaintiff and more
                             particularly Chinna Trust (Supra) are applicable in
                             present facts and circumstances and the judgment Devans
                             (Supra) which has been relied upon by the defendant is
                             equally applicable in the present facts and circumstances.
                             The plaintiff has therefore been able to establish the
                             prima facie case in his favour and against the defendant.
                             As per the ratio laid down in the above cited judgments,
                             it is reflected that there can be registration of certificate
                             for a product in different classes as there may be
                             overlapping with regard to the categories mentioned
                             therein. In such circumstances, it is the prior use which
                             has to be considered. In the present case it appears to be
                             in favour of plaintiff as mentioned above. In such
                             circumstances therefore, balance of convenience is also
                             tilted in favour of plaintiff and I am of the considered
                             opinion that, he shall suffer an irreparable loss on each
                             and every day if the relief sought by him is not granted.

</p>
<p id="p_43">                   REASONS AND CONCLUSION:
</p>
<p id="p_44">                   25.   The Appellants as well as H.S. Sahni claim that they are the prior
                   users of the trademark &quot;M.G. Cables&quot;. The learned Commercial Court
                   had found in favour of the Appellants and observed that they had been
                   able to show prior user since the year 1996. Further, the Appellants had
                   also established copyright in the trade dress used by them. As opposed to
                   same, the learned Commercial Court found that H.S. Sahni has not been
                   able to, prima facie, establish that he was a prior user of the trademark in
                   question.
</p>
<p id="p_45">                   26.   The first and foremost question, to be addressed, is whether the
                   aforesaid findings of the learned Commercial Court warrant any
                   interference in these proceedings. There is no document available on
                   record which suggests that H.S. Sahni was using trademarks &quot;M.G&quot;,
                   &quot;M.G.I&quot; or &quot;M.G Cable&quot; since the year 1989, as claimed by him.

                   opposition, H.S. Sahni had claimed that he had spent a large sum of
                   money in publicity of the trademarks &quot;M.G.&quot; and &quot;M.G.I&quot;; however,
                   there is no material on record to show any such expenditure on publicity
                   of the said trademarks &quot;M.G.&quot;/&quot;M.G.I&quot;. The earliest invoice placed on
                   record by H.S. Sahni, in support of his claim that he was dealing in control
                   cables, is dated 25.08.1989. The image of the said invoice is reproduced
                   below-

<p id="p_47">                   28.   The said invoice mentions &quot;MGI&quot; and several others marks,
                   namely, &quot;RONAK&quot;, &quot;AUTOMAX&quot;, &quot;WIREPOOL&quot; and &quot;DATSUN&quot;.
                   Some of these marks are similar to other well-known marks. Further, the
                   printed endorsement on the invoice reads: &quot;Always Insist Original Datson
                   Control Cables&quot;. This indicates that H.S. Sahni was using the trademarks
                   &quot;DATSUN&quot;/&quot;DATSON&quot; in respect of control cables. Some of the
                   invoices for a later period do not indicate the names of any

                   INDIA&quot;; certificate bearing registration no. 4/19447/II under the Delhi

</p>
<p id="p_56">                   35.   In addition, the Appellants have also produced invoices including
                   an invoice dated 18.06.2001, which bears the mark &quot;M.G CABLE&quot; on its
                   top left corner.

                   finding of the learned Commercial Court that the Appellants were the
                   prior user of the mark &quot;M.G. CABLES&quot;. The Appellants had applied for
                   and obtained the registration of the copyright in respect of the artistic
                   work of the trade dress of the product &quot;M.G. CABLES&quot; in the year 2013.
                   The extract from the Register of the Copyrights indicates that Appellant
                   no.2 is a registered proprietor of the copyright bearing no.106276/2013,

<p id="p_60">                   38.    It is apparent from the above that H.S. Sahni has applied for
                   registration of the device mark, which is almost identical to the
                   Appellants&#x27; copyright. Clearly, H.S. Sahni cannot be permitted to use the
                   said trademark or any other deceptively similar trademark in respect of

                   12; Appellant no.2 is the proprietor of the registered trademark in Class 6
                   (and not Class 12).
</p>
<p id="p_62">                   40.   Mr. Bansal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of H.S. Sahni,
                   emphasised that H.S. Sahni had registered the said trademarks under
                   Class 12 in relation to &quot;parts, fittings and accessories of motor land
                   vehicles, control cables, meter cables for use in motor land vehicles&quot;. The
                   Appellants&#x27; trademark &quot;M.G. CABLE&quot; was registered in Class 6 in
                   relation to &quot;unwrought or partly- wrought common metals and their
                   alloys, non-electrical wires and cables nut and bolts and spring all being
                   goods included in Class - 06&quot;. He submitted that the Appellants did not
                   have any registration in respect of control cables or automotive parts but
                   in respect of hardware; therefore, the learned Commercial Court had erred
                   in granting an interim injunction on the basis of the said registration.
</p>
<p id="p_63">                   41.   The material, placed on record, clearly indicates that the Appellants
                   are, inter alia, engaged in the business of dealing with automotive
                   cables/control cables, however, they had secured the registration of the
                   trademark &quot;M.G. CABLE&quot; under Class 6 in relation to goods which also
                   included &quot;non-electrical wires&quot;. Class 12 appears to be the apposite class
                   for registration of the product in question (control cables). However, on a
                   broader literal interpretation, the said wires would also fall in the
                   description of &quot;non-electrical wires&quot;. Thus, we cannot readily accept that
                   the registration of the trademarks in favour of the Appellants would not
                   inure to their benefit in respect of control cables. The specified classes of
                   goods for purposes of registration of trademarks is a broad classification.
                   It would be erroneous to consider them as distinct airtight silos.

                   consists of a list of classes. Under the said system, there are 34 classes of

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                         &quot;Classification of goods given in the rules not the criterion
                         Whether or not two sets of goods or services are of the
                         same description is not be decided on the basis of the

                   Ors.: 2015 SCC OnLine Mad 14278, the court held that &quot;Classification
                   of goods and service under the trademark is a broad classification:
                   whether the plaintiff&#x27;s product will fall within that classification or not, is
                   purely a subject matter of trial&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_73">                   49.   It is also well settled that if a person has obtained a registration in
                   respect of entire class of goods but intends to use the registered trademark
                   for only a specific product falling within the said class, the registration
                   granted to him is required to be limited to the goods or services in respect
                   to which the proprietor intends to use the said trademark [See: <a href="/doc/1747781/" id="a_5">Vishnudas

<p id="p_74">                   50.   In the present case, the appellants intend to use the trademark only
                   in connection with non-electrical cables and other metal parts. Thus, it
                   would be apposite to consider the registration in respect of the said goods.

                   As stated above, it was possible, at the material time, to accept the said
                   goods under Class 6. In the given facts, we are unable to accept that the
                   registration of the trademark in question, in favour of the Appellants,
                   would not inure to its benefit in respect of the goods in question.

                   registration of the trademarks &quot;M.G&quot; or &quot;M.G.I&quot; in favour of H.S. Sahni.
                   Mr. Bansal had earnestly contended that it was not sufficient for the
                   Appellants to establish that their use of the trademark was prior to the use
                   by H.S. Sahni; they were required to establish that they had used the mark
                   prior to registration of the trademark &quot;M.G&quot; and &quot;M.G.I&quot;, in favour of
                   H.S. Sahni. He relied upon <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_6">Section 34</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, in

                   indicates that the rights of a prior user of a mark are protected and cannot
                   be interfered with by a proprietor of a registered trademark. Thus, to seek
                   the benefit of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_9">Section 34</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, H.S. Sahni must

                           which can be seen from the opening words of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_15">Section 28</a> of
                           the Act which states &quot;Subject to the other provisions of this

</p><p id="p_82">                   56.   The next question, to be addressed, is whether H.S. Sahni is entitled
                   to the benefit of <a href="/doc/66616/" id="a_19">Section 33</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. It is contended
                   on behalf of H.S. Sahni that the Appellants were aware of the trademarks
                   registered in his favour as one of the constituent partners of Appellant no.2
                   had applied for registration of the trademark &quot;MGX&quot; under Class 12, by
                   Trademark application no. 1653480 dated 13.02.2008. The said
                   application had been opposed by H.S. Sahni [through M.K. Auto Sales
                   Corporation] on 24.03.2009. Thus, the Appellants were aware of the
                   trademarks &quot;M.G&quot; and &quot;M.G.I&quot;, registered in favour H.S. Sahni but had
                   taken no steps to challenge the same.
</p>
<p id="p_83">                   57.   In view of the prima facie findings that H.S. Sahni has been unable
                   to show any usage of the trademark &quot;M.G&quot;/&quot;M.G.I&quot; prior to the year 2017,
                   the question of any acquiescence on the part of the Appellants in such use
                   does not arise. Further, it is settled law that acquiescence cannot be
                   inferred by mere inaction on the part of the proprietor of a registered
                   trademark. It must be established that the proprietor&#x27;s conduct had, either
                   tacitly or by positive acts, encouraged the use of the allegedly infringing
                   trademark.

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">                             &quot;26. Acquiescence is sitting by, when another is invading

                             conduct inconsistent with the claim for exclusive rights in
                             a trade mark, trade name etc. It implies positive acts; not
                             merely silence or inaction such as is involved in

<p id="p_87">                   60.   In view of the above, this Court finds no infirmity with the decision
                   of the learned Commercial Court in restraining H.S. Sahni from using the
                   trademark &quot;M.G CABLE&quot; or any other deceptively similar marks.
                   However, insofar as restraining H.S. Sahni from using the trademarks
                   &quot;M.G&quot;/ &quot;M.G.I&quot; is concerned, the learned Commercial had declined the
                   said interim relief solely on the ground that H.S. Sahni was a proprietor
                   of the said registered trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_88">                   61.   As noted above, the learned Commercial Court had, prima facie,
                   found that the Appellants were prior user of the trademark &quot;M.G
                   CABLE&quot;. They held the registered copyright in respect of the artistic
                   work of the label &quot;M.G CABLE&quot;. The Appellants were also registered
                   proprietors of the trademark &quot;M.G CABLE&quot; albeit under Class 6 but in
                   respect of the same products. Notwithstanding the same, H.S. Sahni has
                   not been restrained from using the mark &quot;M.G&quot; and &quot;M.G.I&quot;. However,
                   it is clear that use of the trademark &quot;M.G&quot; and &quot;M.G.I&quot; has the propensity
                   to cause confusion in the minds of the customer. After the learned
                   Commercial Court had passed the impugned order, H.S. Sahni had
                   commenced using the following labels:-

                   similar to the font and manner in which &quot;MG CABLES&quot; is printed in the

                   Commercial Court - with which we concur - an interim order, restraining
                   H.S. Sahni from using the trademarks &quot;M.G&quot; or &quot;M.G.I&quot;, ought to have

<p id="p_91">                   63.   It is well settled that it is necessary to restrain the use of deceptive

                   to also protect the public at large, who may be misled as to the source of
