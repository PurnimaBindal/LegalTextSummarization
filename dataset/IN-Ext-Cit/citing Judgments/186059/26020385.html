                          ORDER ON SENTENCE

29.10.2011

Pr.:   Sh. Virender Singh, Ld. Addl. P.P for State.

       Convict Raj Kumar in J/C with Sh. A. K. Tiwari, Advocate Amicus

Curiae, Advocate.

       Heard on sentence.

       It is submitted that the convict is not previous convict and he is poor

person and has clean antecedents. He is aged about 35 years and having

two small children to support as he is the only person who look after them as

his wife has died. He is also having old aged parents to support. Therefore,

lenient view is prayed for. It is further submitted that the case does not fall

within category of rarest of the rare case as per the conduct of the accused

where he himself surrendered in the court, therefore, the convict be given

lesser punishment.

       On the other hand, Ld. Addl. PP for State submitted that in this case,

the convict has killed his wife, who was the mother of his two children, and his

old aged father-in-law. The murder was committed in causing 10 incised

wounds on the person of Ram Chander and six wounds on the person of

Seema. The murder was committed in gruesome manner and therefore the

extreme penalty of death sentence be awarded to the accused.

      The Hon'ble Supreme Court in many cases has reiterated that life

imprisonment is the rule and death penalty is the exception to be given only in

the rarest of the rare case. <a href="/doc/1829378/" id="a_3">In Lehna V. State of Haryana</a>, 2002 SCC (Cri)

526, it was held that the death penalty can be awarded when:

          (1)When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal,
             grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or dastardly manner so as
             to arouse intense and extreme indignation of
             the community.
          (2)When the murder is committed for a motive which
             evinces total depravity and meanness, e.g., murder by
             hired assassin for money or reward, or cold-blooded
             murder for gains of a person vis-a-vis whom the murderer
             is in a dominating position or in a position of trust, or
             murder is committed in the course for betrayal of the
             motherland.
          (3)When murder of a member of a Scheduled Caste or
             minority community, etc., is committed not for personal
             reasons but in circumstances which arouse social wrath,
             or in cases of "bride burning" or "dowry deaths" or when
             murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of
             extracting dowry once again or to marry another woman
             on account of infatuation.
          (4)When the crime is enormous in proportion. For instance
             when multiple murders, say of all or almost all the
             members of a family or a large number of persons of a
FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                  Page 2 of 55
                                       -3-


             particular caste, community, or locality, are committed.
           (5)When the victim of murder is an innocent child, or a
              helpless woman or old or infirm person or a person vis-a-
              vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position, or a
              public figure generally loved and respected by the
              community.
      In the present case, the convict is held guilty for offence punishable u/s

302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4">IPC</a> and u/s 25/27 <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_5">Arms Act</a>.

      In the present case, deceased Ram Chander was given 10 stab

injuries, out of which one wound was given on right abdomen, one on the left

lower chest, one on left lower abdomen, one on the left lower chest, one on

the right abdomen, one on the right lower abdomen. Deceased Seema was

also given stab injuries, out of which one was on upper outer aspect of chest

on left side, one on upper outer aspect of left breast, one below the nape of

neck. The murder was committed of woman and father-in-law who were living

there. The wife was helpless and father-in-law was also old. The convict has

committed murder of his wife and father-in-law by causing these injuries, he

ensured that they died at the spot. The murder had shaken conscience of the

community where it was committed. However his subsequent conduct and the

fact that there is nothing else has come on record which can result in saying

that it was extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or dastardly

manner. This case, however, borders on the rarest of the rare case as


FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                   Page 3 of 55
                                       -4-


innocent helpless wife and old father-in-law as been killed in cold

blooded manner.

      The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as "<a href="/doc/1392269/" id="a_6">Swami Sharddananda

V. State of Karnataka</a>", 2008 Crl. L.J. 3911 (AIR 2008 SC 3040) held that

case where the life imprisonment of 14 years appears to be inadequate,

however, the case would not fall within category of rarest of rare case for

death sentence. It would be lawful for the court to say that the life

imprisonment means for full life or may fix the period which would be sufficient

to meet the ends of justice and restrict the commutation.

      In the present case, the age of the convict is 35 years and he would

turn to 60 years in next 25 years. Keeping in view the totality of the facts and

circumstances of the case and as per the discussion above, I am of the

opinion that the ends of justice would be met in sentencing the

convict to undergo rigorous imprisonment (RI) for life for offence punishable

U/s 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>. He shall also be liable to pay fine of Rs. 25,000/-. In default of

payment of fine, he shall further undergo rigorous imprisonment (RI) for the

period of one year. The life imprisonment shall not be less than 25 years and

it cannot be commuted less than 25 years.

      The fine, if recovered, shall be deposited in any nationalised bank in

       wounds on his stomach and one on left foot and intestine had come out
       from one wound of stomach on account of injury and the meantime
       ACP/SHO also reached at the spot. Ct. Ram Naresh and HC Jayanti
       Prasad also reached at the spot and HC Jayanti Prasad handed over
       the copy of DD No. 21 to SI Sishu Pal. One Ashok Kumar met there
       and his statement was recorded. He stated that Ram Chander was
       living with his wife, son and daughter in Sabjimandi Maujpur for last
       18-20 years and his wife and son had pre-deceased him. Ram
       Chander was having weak financial position and therefore his daughter
       Seema was got married on 5.5.2003 with accused Raj Kumar by the
       mohalla people. After some days of marriage, accused Raj Kumar had
       started ill-treating her and was beating her. They made him understand
       many times but he did not mend is way. They were not insisting much
       accused as he may desert Seema. Seema had started living with his
       father for last two months at house no. 158/03 Gali Sanatan
       Dharamsala at the ground floor. It is stated that he was standing at
       about 6:00 p.m. in front of his house near Hotel Apna and in the
       meantime accused Raj Kumar was running from street and was saying
       that he had killed both of them and he was having knife in his hand.
       Suspecting the same, he went running to the house of Ram Chander
       and saw Ram Chander and his daughter were lying in pool of blood.
       On the basis of his statement FIR was registered. Spot was inspected
       by crime team and was photographed. The dead bodies were sent to
       mortuary, GTB Hospital. Blood stained and blood cement concrete and
       earth control were seized from the spot. On 16.08.2011 the dead

       bodies were identified and inquest papers were prepared. The inquest
       papers of Seema were prepared by Tehsildar but postmortem could not
       be conducted and on 17.08.2011 after the postmortem, the dead
       bodies were handed over. On 19.08.2011, an information was received
       that accused Raj Kumar would surrender in the court and thereafter
       accused was arrested after taking permission from the court and he
       made disclosure statement he can get recovered the knife. He was
       remanded to two days police custody remand. Again he was
       interrogated and he made another disclosure statement and stated that
       he can get recovered knife and shirt and is wearing pant which was
       worn by him at the time of incident. The pant was taken and seized

<p id="p_18">11.    This case is based upon circumstantial evidence and the prosecution
       has relied on the following circumstances to connect the accused
       persons with the offence :
</p><p id="p_19">       (i)     Deceased persons namely Ram Chander and her
               daughter Seema seen alive in the company of accused
               Raj Kumar by landlady,

               shirt at the instance of accused
</p><p id="p_24">       (vi)    subsequent opinion of doctor with respect to weapon of
               offence recovered at the instance of the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_25">12.    Ld. Defence Counsel submitted that the prosecution case is based on
       circumstantial evidence and chain of the circumstances is not
       complete. The circumstance of accused having been seen with the
       deceased is not proved as the landlady has not supported the
       prosecution. As per the prosecution witnesses the child was present
       there but no investigation has been carried out in that direction. Further
       submitted that the prosecution witnesses of subsequent incident having

       seen the accused were examined on the next day and they are
       introduced witnesses. Further there is variation of time since death
       between two postmortem reports which creates doubt towards the
       prosecution. Further the recovery allegedly effected at the instance of
       accused is doubtful. It is also submitted that there was other tenant
       also in the house in question but he has not been examined by the
       prosecution and the location of dead bodies are depicted differently by
       each witness therefore there is likelihood that some other person came
       in between. Further initially it was reported to the control room that
       unknown persons has stabbed whereas accused being known
       persons, his name would have given. Further submitted that accused
       has been falsely implicated in this case.

           be complete and incapable of explanation of any other
           hypothesis than that of guilt of the accused and such evidence

       the staircase and main gate was about 10 steps.

<p id="p_33">15.    PW-10 Ct. Neeraj is the photographer with mobile crime team who took
       photographs, which are Ex.PW-10/P1 to P13, of the spot. Photographs
       Ex.PW-10/P6, P7 and P10 depict the position of the dead bodies.
       These witnesses are corroborating each other with respect to time of
       reaching at the spot and PWs Sishu Pal and HC Jayanti Prasad saw
       dead bodies lying in these conditions and there were injuries on their
       person with sharp edged object which is also corroborated by the
       photographs. Therefore it is proved that dead bodies of deceased Ram
       Chander and Seema were lying in the house when IO reached.

<p id="p_34">16.    To prove the circumstance i.e. deceased Ram Chander and her
       deceased daughter Seema seen alive in the company of accused Raj
       Kumar by landlady, prosecution examined PW-2 Smt. Dayarani, the
       landlady of the house of deceased. She testified that Sh. Ram Chander
       (deceased) was her tenant and he was residing at the ground floor at
       her abovesaid house which is 158/3, Gali Sanatan Dharamshala,

       Maujpur, Delhi. She further stated that she alongwith her family are
       residing at the first floor of the house. Deceased Seema was the
       daughter of Ram Chander and she was married with Raj Kumar.
       Deceased Seema used to come at the house of his father Ram
       Chander and she was having two children. Deceased Ram Chander
       was residing at her house for last about 8-9 months and earlier to that,
       he was residing in their neighbourhood since 15-16 years. Accused Raj
       Kumar was residing at 'Akade Wali Gali'. Seema (deceased) was
       residing at her father's house for the last 1½ months prior to the
       incident. She further stated that on the date of incident i.e 15.08.2009,
       accused Raj Kumar had come at the house of Ram Chander and on
       that day, when she got down from the first floor to go to take milk, she
       saw that accused Raj Kumar was sitting on the bed and deceased
       Seema and her son were sitting on the sofa in the room. The father of
       the deceased Seema namely Ram Chander also met her at the door of
       the house and thereafter, she went to take the milk from dairy at about
       5.30 p.m. Thereafter, when she came back after taking the milk and
       when she entered into the house, she saw that Ram Chander and her
       daughter Seema were lying on the floor outside the room in front of
       bathroom and they were in pool of blood. She immediately cried and
       raised alarm. On this, the neighborers gathered there. Accused Raj
       Kumar was not present there at that time and son of Seema
       (deceased) whose aged was about 3-3½ years was weeping. Some
       one called the police and police officials reached there. On the same
       day, police officials met her and interrogated her and recorded her
       statement as she has stated today. Thereafter, she fell unconscious.

<p id="p_35">       This witness was declared partly hostile by the prosecution. However,
       when she was cross-examined by the prosecutor she firstly denied that
       she having made statement to the police that she had asked the father
       of the deceased Seema namely Sh. Ram Chander as to why he does
       not send his daughter to her matrimonial home and on this, he told her
       that the husband of his daughter used to beat her and as such, he was
       not sending his daughter to her matrimonial home. However admitted
       that having asked this very fact from the father of deceased Seema but
       she only denies that she has stated so to the police in her statement.
       She further denied that she stated to the police that accused Raj
       Kumar used to come at the house of Ram Chander and used to quarrel
       with Ram Chander on the issue of taking seema from there to his
       home. However, admitted that it happened that deceased Seema was
       residing at the house of her father for the last about two months before
       the incident and during that period, Raj Kumar came there and quarrel
       on this account. She further denied that on 15.08.2009 at about 5:30
       p.m. when she got down from the first floor, she saw that accused Raj
       Kumar was quarrelling with his wife Seema and his father-in-law Ram
       Chander and thereafter, she went upstairs and after ten-fifteen
       minutes, she heard noise of crying and on this, she immediately got
       down and saw that Seema and Ram Chander were lying in the pool of
       blood and thereafter, immediately, she came out in the street and
       called one boy who called the police over 100 number. In her
       cross-examination on behalf of accused she was confronted with the
       portion of her statement where she stated that when she get down from
       the 1st floor, she saw that Raj Kumar was sitting on the bed and

       deceased Seema and his son were sitting on the sofa and father of
       Seema namely Ram Chander met her at the door of the house and she
       went to take the milk from the dairy, which was not mentioned in her
       statement Ex.PW-2/A recorded u/s 161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_26">Cr.PC</a>. She further confronted
       with the portion of her statement wherein she stated that when she
       came back after taking the milk and when she entered into the house,
       she saw that Ram Chander and her daughter Seema lying in the pool
       of blood.
</p>

<p id="p_36">17.    This witness denied that on 15.08.2009, at about 5.30 PM, when she
       got down from the first floor, saw accused Raj Kumar was quarrelling
       with his wife Seema and his father-in-law Ram Chander and again
       came saw them dead whereas she had given statement that she got
       down from the first floor to go to milk and saw accused alongwith
       deceased which was an improvement and therefore she was
       confronted with the same. However, this witness is the landlady and
       lives on the first floor where deceased Ram Chander was living on the
       ground floor as tenant and staircase are near the room of Ram
       Chander. This witness has stated that she has got down and saw
       accused Raj Kumar, deceased Seema and Ram Chander alive at
       about 5:30 p.m. There is little variation in the sequence of events but
       even if one removes the portion of improvement made and version
       changed by this witness yet it is established on record that she had
       seen accused Raj Kumar in the house of Ram Chander where Ram
       Chander and her daughter Seema was present alive at about 5:30 p.m.
       She categorically denied the suggestion that accused Raj Kumar had

       not come to the tenanted portion where Ram Chander was residing in
       his   house   on   15.08.2009     at   any   time. There     is   no   other
       cross-examination on this aspect. Further she was corroborated by
       PW-1 Sh. Ashok Kumar PW-3 Satender Dutt Sharma that after
       marriage accused started harassing her and beating her and due to
       this behaviour of accused Raj Kumar, she (Seema) came to her
       father's house i.e 158/3, Gali Sanatan Dharm Shala, Maujpur to live
       there, about two months prior to the incident. This witness is
       independent witness and there is no animosity of the witness with the
       accused Raj Kumar and there is no reason as to why she would
       depose against the accused. Although this witness has been declared
       hostile, it is settled law that statement of a hostile witness can be relied
       upon if it is otherwise found trustworthy. The testimony of this witness is
       natural and has ring of truth and her presence at the spot is also not
       disputed. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that prosecution has
       succeeded in proving this circumstance.

       Raj Kumar. Accused Raj Kumar was residing at Gali No. 10 near Shiv
       Mandir, Maujpur, Delhi. Deceased Ram Chander was financially weak.
       All the residents of the mohalla people had also helped financially to
       Sh. Ram Chander in the marriage of his daughter. After marriage,
       accused Raj Kumar has started harassing and beating her. He and the
       other mohalla people had tried to make him (accused Raj
       Kumar)understand to not to give beatings to Seema. But, he continued
       harassing and beating her and he did not change his behaviour. Due to
       this behaviour of accused Raj Kumar, she (Seema) came to her
       father's house i.e 158/3, Gali Sanatan Dharm Shala, Maujpur to live
       there, about two months prior to the incident. He further stated that
       accused Raj Kumar had gone to the house of Ram Chander and
       threatened her to send back Seema to his home. But, Sh. Ram
       Chander had refused to send back her daughter Seema with accused
       Raj Kumar. He further stated that on 15.08.2009, at about 05:45-06:00
       PM, he was present in front of hotel namely 'Apka Bhojnalaya', he saw
       that accused Raj Kumar was coming running from the side of house of
       Ram Chander and he was having knife in his hand and on seeing him,
       he (accused) stopped there and told that 'maine dono ko maar dia hai.
       Jo kara jaye kar lo'. He (witness) immediately went to the house of
       Ram Chander and found that Sh. Ram Chander and his daughter
       Seema were lying in the room in blood of pool (khoon se latpat the). He
       raised alarm and on this mohalla people gathered there and someone
       called the police. PCR police reached there and thereafter local police

       does not remember weather he had stated to the IO in his statement
       that deceased Ram Chander was residing in the house of Sh. Sharma
       on rent. The rented house of deceased Ram Chander was at the
       distance about 20-25 steps away from his house. The house of
       deceased Ram Chander was after leaving 2-3 street from his house.
       His house is on the main road and rented house of deceased Ram
       Chander was inside the street. He was confronted with statement
       where he stated that he had disclosed the name of the hotel in his
       statement made to the police wherein it is not so recorded, however,
       hotel apna is mentioned therein. Therefore it does not appear to be any
       material improvement or inconsistency.       He is residing at the given
       address for the last 25 years. He used to treat deceased Seema as his
       daughter. He further stated that he used to sit on his milk dairy from
       06:00 AM to 04:00PM and thereafter his elder son used to sit there. His
       milk dairy is in front of his house i.e at property no. 1, Shiv Mandir Gali,
       Maujpur, Delhi. He admitted that the road of apna bhojnalaya hotel is a
       busy road and voluntarily stated that on the date of incident it was 15th
       August and it was a holiday. There were two more unknown persons
       present near him on the date of incident near the apna bhojnalaya. At
       that time there was cleaning work going on in the apna bhojnalaya. He
       does not know as to who had passed through the apna bhojnalaya on
       the date of incident prior to the incident. He admitted that if anyone
       wants to go the house of deceased Ram Chander, he would pass
       through the apna bhojnalaya. He came at the apna bhojnalaya at about
       05:00 PM. Apna bhojnalaya is of his bhabhi (sister-in-law). He did not

       Chander after 05:00 PM. The son of deceased Seema was with her at
       the house of her father deceased Ram Chander and her daughter was
       with the accused Raj Kumar. He was confronted with the portion where
       he stated that accused Raj Kumar on seeing him stopped there and
       stated 'maine dono ko maar dia hai, jo kara jaye kar lo' wherein it is not
       so recorded however, it is mentioned that accused Raj Kumar was
       running in the street and stating that 'maine dono ko maar dia'.
       Therefore, it does not appear to be improvement or inconsistency. He
       stated that he did not try to apprehend the accused Raj Kumar at that
       time and he rushed towards the house of deceased Ram Chander.
       Deceased Seema was lying on the floor in injured condition near the
       door of the room inside the room and deceased Ram Chander was
       lying on the floor near the kitchen and his legs were inside the room.
       He did not notice any other item scattered there. The PCR Police
       reached there within 10 minutes and 10 minutes thereafter local police
       also reached there. The mohalla people were gathered at the spot prior
       to reaching the police. His first statement was recorded at the place of
       incident between 11-12 midnight after coming from the hospital. Police
       did not record the statement of any other witness in his presence.
       His statement was not recorded at any other point of time except his
       signed statement Ex. PW-1/A. He denied the suggestion that he is
       deposing falsely being neighborers and interested witness and he is
       deposing at the instance of IO.

<p id="p_38">19.    There was some confusion about the location of Apna Bhojanalya. As

       one witness has stated that he was standing at Apna Bhojanalya and
       another witness has stated that Apka Apna Swadist Food Corner.
       During the course of arguments, clarification was taken from the
       prosecution as well as defence and both stated that Apna Bhojanalya
       and Apka Apna Swadist Food Corner are one and the same thing and
       they are not different. The clarification was also taken regarding Shiv
       Mandir. It is stated by Shiv Mandir is on one side of the main Maujpur
       Road and there is no Shiv Mandir at near the place of occurrence.
       Apna Bhojanalya is at the corner of Krishna Mandir Wali Gali and on
       main Maujpur Road. This witness lives at Main Maujpur Road and his
       house is at a distance of about 20/25 steps from the rented house of
       accused Ram Chander. He stated that Apna Bhojanalya is of his
       bhabhi. This witness is also an independent witness and his house
       located on the main road near Apna Bhojanalya which also belongs to
       his bhabhi and therefore his presence at Apna Bhojanalya at the
       relevant time is natural and was present therefore. He has also given
       graphic details of the house of deceased Ram Chander where
       deceased was residing as a tenant and also correctly depicted the
       position of the dead bodies. In his complaint he stated that he was
       standing in front of his house near hotel.
</p>

<p id="p_39">20.    Ld. Defence counsel has submitted that as per this witness his
       statement was recorded between 11-12 mid night whereas as per the
       complaint, it was recorded at about 8:00 p.m. and by 8:20 p.m. the FIR
       was registered.

<p id="p_40">21.    According to PW-27 SI Sishu Pal when he reached at the spot Ashok
       Kumar came and got his statement recorded and he made his
       endorsement and got the FIR registered. Apparently there is no delay
       in recording the FIR. Rather it appears that the witness was not sure as
       to when his statement was recorded. His statement could not have
       been recorded in between 11:00-12:00 mid night as by that time the
       FIR was already registered. The statement of this witness even if it is
       recorded at 11:00/12:00 mid night, the name of the accused had
       appeared as assailant in the FIR. Moreover, dead bodies were
       identified by the brother and father of accused themselves in the
       inquest report which was prepared by SDM which also rules out any
       manipulation by way of delay. Therefore minor discrepancy in the time
       of statement does not give benefit to the accused. The presence of the
       witness at the place is natural. This witness is independent witness
       who is respectable person of the society who had made arrangement
       for the marriage of daughter of deceased Ram Chander namely Seema
       who were financially weak and from their contribution the marriage took
       place with the accused. He has no animosity with the accused and
       there is nothing material elicited from his cross-examination which
       could discredit this witness. This witness also finds corroboration from
       landlady Smt. Daya Rani that son of the deceased was at the house of
       Ram Chander. Although this fact has been denied by the police
       witnesses for the reasons best known to them but both witnesses are
       consistent that son of deceased was present at that place.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                   Page 31 of 55</span>

       tenant in the house of Smt. Dayarani but he has not been examined as
       witness nor the child has been made as witness nor the informant has
       been examined as witness. The reason for not making son of
       deceased Seema as witness is very obvious i.e. the child was only
       aged about three and half years old. However, no question has been
       asked from this witness as well as Dayarani whether the tenant was
       present at that very time in the house or not. IO in his
       cross-examination has categorically stated that there was other tenant
       on the ground floor but that particular tenant was not present at that
       time. Therefore since the tenant was not present or has not witnessed
       the incident, he could not have been examined by the prosecution.
       Moreover, non-examined of such witness does not attract any adverse
       inference as the landlady herself has been cited as witness who was
       present in the house. The person who had given information to police
       control room has not been examined. Although his mobile number is
       mentioned on the information. IO has stated that he had enquired from
       the person namely Manoj Sharma but he has not made him witness.
       He has also not given specific reason for not making him as witness.
       Ld. Addl. PP submitted that as per landlady, she saw dead bodies and
       raised alarm and then someone called police. Apparently, he is not
       witness and given information on gathering information. Therefore, he
       was not witness and hence was not made witness. The witness is only
       the person who can give evidence of occurrence. It is not that every
       person who is not even directly concerned is witness. Not citing him as
       witness does not attract adverse inference.

       PW-4 Sh. Anil Tomar. Both these witnesses were examined by IO on
       the next day i.e. on 16.08.2011. PW-3 stated that on 15.08.2009 at
       about 6:00 p.m. he was present at restaurant namely 'Apka Apna
       Swadisht Food Corner' and saw accused Raj Kumar coming running
       from the street of temple and stated that 'maine dono ko marr diya -
       maine dono ko mar diya' and ran towards the Shiv Mandir Street and
       accused was having knife in his hand. In his cross-examination he
       stated that he lives in Shastri Gali which is far from the place where the
       murder took place. It is ten minutes walking distance from his house to
       the spot. The restaurant belongs to Sh. Sushil Kumar. Sh. Shushil
       Kumar was present in the restaurant and voluntarily stated that the
       restaurant was closed and Sh. Sushil Kumar was in the kitchen.
       He stated that he was present at the restaurant from 5 PM to 6 PM.
       There were the employees of the restaurant inside the restaurant. He
       was standing outside the restaurant at 'chabutra'. He was standing
       alone at that time. There are another ways also to reach at the house
       of Ram Chander (deceased) beside the way where he was standing, at
       that time. He did not see accused Raj Kumar while going towards the
       house of Ram Chander (deceased). He heard noise of accused Raj
       Kumar for two-three times from the distance of about 50 meters. He
       was saying that "maine dono ko mar dia". He stated that he did not try
       to apprehend the accused Raj Kumar and voluntarily stated that he
       went away within seconds before he could react. It took about two-
       three minutes to reach at the house of Ram Chander (deceased). He
       knows Ashok Kumar. There is no relation in between Ashok Kumar and

       Sushil Kumar who is the owner of the restaurant. He stated that IO had
       also recorded the statements of two-three mohalla people namely Anil
       Tomar and Ashok Kumar in his presence on 16.08.2009. However,
       There is no statement of Ashok Kumar recorded on 16.08.2009.
       This witness claims that he was standing alone at that time at the
       restaurant and he knows Ashok Kumar. Ashok Kumar also claims that
       he was present at that place which cannot be believed that this witness
       would not have stated that Ashok Kumar also present with him at Apka
       Apna Swadisht Food Corner. Recording of his statement on the next
       date and further stating that statement of Ashok Kumar was recorded in
       his presence is false. Further he had described the position of the dead
       body and stated that the dead body of Ram Chander was lying near
       the door of room and the dead body of Seema was lying near outside
       the kitchen near the room, which is incorrect. Apparently this witness is
       not witness of occurrence and his presence at the place is also
       doubtful as the place is far away from his house and his presence
       cannot be found natural at that place. There testimony of this witness
       has to be discarded.

<p id="p_43">24.    PW-4 Sh. Anil Tomar also similarly claims that he saw accused coming
       from the temple street while running and stating that maine dono ko
       maar diya - maine dono ko maar diya while he (witness) was passing
       through Krishna Mandir Wali Gali at about 6:00 p.m. and accused ran
       towards Shiv Mandir Street and was having knife in his right hand. On
       this, he reached at the house of Ram Chander and saw dead bodies

       cross-examination that IO recorded his statement on 16.08.2009 and I
       had put his signatures on the same. IO also recorded the statement of
       Satender and Ashok Kumar in his presence, on that day. Satender and
       Ashok Kumar had also signed their statements, in his presence. He
       further stated in his cross-examination the distance between his house
       and 'krishna mandir wali gali' is about 1 KM. The restaurant namely
       "Apka Apna Swadisht Food Corner" is located in the street of Krishna
       Gali. On 15.08.2009, he was going for pray at Shiv Mandir. Krishna
       Mandir Wali Gali is also known as Mandir Wali Gali. He stated that the
       accused passed just close to him on the opposite direction. The other
       public persons were also passing through the street, at that time. He
       admitted that he was going towards the same direction to Shiv Mandir
       from where the accused was coming while running. The house of
       deceased Ram Chander was ahead of Shiv Mandir after about 4-5
       houses from Shiv Mandir. He knows PW Ashok and Satender. He had
       seen Ashok at the house of Ram Chander but I did not see Satender,
       at that time. Ashok Kumar is known to general public in that area as
       two banks and one milk dairy are functioning from his premises. He
       also stated that he knew Satender Kumar only on the day when they
       went to GTB Hosptial Mortuary to receive the dead bodies. Satender
       was not known to him prior to 16.08.2009. Further in his
       cross-examination he was confronted with the portion of his statement
       wherein he stated that on 15.08.2009, he was passing through Krishna
       Street, wherein it is recorded that he was passing through Krishan
       Mandir. He was also confronted with the portion of his statement
       wherein he stated that accused ran towards the Shiv Mandir Gali
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                               Page 35 of 55</span>

       wherein Shiv Mandir is not recorded. He voluntarily stated that he has
       stated to the IO in his statement that accused ran towards the main
       road. He further voluntarily clarifies that he had stated in his
       examination-in-chief that accused was running from the side of Mandir
       Wali Gali towards Main Road, which is incorrect. In the manner he has
       described his position is also not convincing. He stated that he was
       going towards the same direction to Shiv Mandir from where the
       accused was coming and shiv mandir is ahead of 4/5 houses from
       house of deceased Ram Chander whereas there is no Shiv Mandir in
       the street of house of deceased. In fact Shiv Mandir is at main road
       Maujpur Road. He states that accused just passed closed him on the
       opposite direction which is not possible. Since accuse was going from
       Krishna Mandir Wali Gali towards the main road Maujpur and this
       witness was also going to Shiv Mandir which is on the same direction.
       Therefore coming from the opposite direction is not possible. He
       admitted that he was going towards the same direction to Shiv Mandir
       from where accused was coming while running, which is also
       improbable. This witness even otherwise lives at far away. His
       statement was recorded on the next day on 16.08.2009. As regards the
       contention of Ld. Counsel that these witnesses are introduced
       witnesses, therefore, their statements are not recorded on that very
       day when they were present at the spot and recorded on the next day
       on 16.08.2009. Therefore they are not reliable. I am of the opinion that
       these two witnesses PW-3 Satender Dutt Sharma and PW-4 Anil
       Tomar do not inspire confidence and appear to be introduced
       witnesses and their testimony is not reliable and to be discarded.

<p id="p_44">       However, testimony of PW Ashok Kumar is found to be reliable, cogent
       and convincing and he is trustworthy. He finds corroboration from the
       other witnesses. Therefore it has been established on record that

       after the incident and saying maine dono ko mar diya.

       deceased Seema and found six external antemortem injuries and gave

       weapon and injuries no.2, 4, and 5 were sufficient in ordinary course of

       opined that the rigor mortis was in passing stage. The doctors were

       to the prosecution version, both had been murdered at about 6:00 p.m.
       on 15.08.2009. Dr. Meghali Kelkar stated that ordinarily they keep the
       bodies in refrigerated conditions and the variation in the time since
       death is about six to eight hours on either side in refrigerated condition.
       The range of variation increases with increasing time since death. In
       her cross-examination, she admitted that she has not mentioned in the
       postmortem report that dead body was in the refrigerated condition.
       She has also not made enquiry as to at what temperature it was
       preserved. She stated that she says the variation of six to eight hours

       (sic) on the basis of her experience and knowledge acquired during her
       study and on court question she replied that she has conducted and
       supervised about 200 postmortems and she also teaching under
       graduates students of forensic medicines.      Similarly Dr. Atul Gupta
       stated with respect to variation in time since death and stated that the
       postmortem was conducted by him on 17.08.2009 at 2:05 p.m.
       whereas postmortem was conducted by Dr. Meghali on 17.08.2009 at
       11:50 a.m. and there is also rate of decomposition varies with effect of
       refrigeration conditions where they bodies are kept. The variation in
       time since death increases as the time since death increases. In this
       case, variation in the postmortem conducted by him can be about eight
       hours on both the side. On court question, he also stated that he has
       conducted and supervised about 3000 postmortem and he is also
       teaching under graduate students of forensic medicines. Therefore
       both the doctors who had conducted postmortem upon the dead bodies
       of deceased were quite experienced and both are consistent and
       stated that there can be variation of 8 hours on either side. Dr. Meghali
       Kelkar has given time since death as one and half days i.e. 36 hours
       and Dr. Atul Gupta has given the same as 2 days i.e. 48 hours.

       2:05 p.m. on 17.08.2009 it comes to 2:05 p.m. on 15.08.2009. He
       started conducting postmortem after two hours later from the time as
       that of Dr. Meghali Kelkar which is 11:50 a.m. therefore there is gap of
       about 2 hours in conducting the postmortem and thereafter there is
       variation of about 8 hours which reaches near the same time since
       death as that of Dr. Meghali Kelkar. Moreover as per the statement of
       landlady, she had seen both deceased alive at about 5:30 p.m. in the
       company of accused and when she returned after 15/20 minutes, she
       saw both dead. Therefore according to her occular account the time of
       death is between 5:30 p.m. to 5:50 p.m. on 15.08.2011. Therefore the

       having blood stains, knife and shirt at the instance of accused.
       Prosecution     examined     following   witnesses   to   prove   the   said
       circumstance. PW-23 Inspector Ramesh Kumar testified that on
       19.08.2009, he was present in Karkardooma Courts and came to know
       that accused Raj Kumar is surrendering before the court and hence as
       per the direction of the SHO he called the file through Ct. Brijesh and
       thereafter with the permission of the court arrested the accused. The
       disclosure statement of accused was also recorded which is
       Ex.PW-22/C wherein accused stated that he can get recovered the
       knife and he was taken to two days p/c remand. Thereafter on
       20.08.2009 accused made another disclosure statement which is
       Ex.PW-17/A wherein accused stated that he had thrown the knife
       between Dankaur Railway Station and Bair Railway Station alongwith

       the knife and they found that one knife in closed condition was also
       lying on the railway track which was picked by the accused and
       produced to the IO. The knife was in wet condition as on the last night
       it rained. Its sketch memo was prepared and it was seized. The shirt of
       the accused could not be traced out there. He further stated that IO
       again interrogated the accused and on this accused disclosed that he
       has kept his shirt at the house of his maternal uncle at village Bichat
       Sujanpur and he can get recovered the same. IO recorded his
       disclosure statement (Ex.PW-17/E). Thereafter accused led them at
       the village of his maternal uncle at Bichat Sujanpur and reached at the
       house of his maternal uncle where Sunil son of his maternal uncle met
       them and accused Raj Kumar asked Sunil to bring the shirt which he
       changed and kept in the house. On this, Sunil entered in the room and
       brought one shirt of green colour having the label of CNGIGL on the
       flap of pocket of front shirt to which accused had identified and told to
       the IO that shirt is the same which was worn by him on the date of

       worn by the accused at the time of interrogation. There was no spots
       like blood stains on the shirt. On 20.08.09, no one from the house of
       accused came to the Police Station. He does not remember from
       where the other spare pant was brought for the accused. The same
       was given to the accused at the same time when the IO seized his
       blood stained pant but he does not remember the colour of the pant
       which was provided by the IO to the accused.

       upon the accused or that it was not worn by the accused on that
       particular day. He could not tell the exact dimension of the blood spots

       accused, exhibit 10 is shirt of accused. As per result, exhibit 9 contains
       human blood of group 'A' and blood could not be detected on exhibit 10
       and 11 i.e. shirt and knife. However, blood could be detected on pant of
       accused having blood group 'A' and deceased Ram Chander was
       having blood group 'A'. As per exhibit 12, the same is blood on guage
       of deceased Ram Chander.
</p>

<p id="p_55">35.    It is submitted by Ld. Counsel that it is highly unbelievable that accused
       who had surrendered in the court would remain in the same pant
       having blood stains which he would have worn at the time of
       committing of offence and in support of his argument cited judgment of
       hon'ble Bombay High Court in case titled as Fakirapa v. State II (1996)
       CCR 102 (DB). I am agreement with Ld. Defence Counsel. It is true
       that after four days of the incident he would not continue to wear same
       pant which was blood stained. More so when he came to the court for
       surrender. Therefore this circumstances can be said to be improbable.

<p id="p_56">36.    PW-17 in his further cross-examination with respect to recovery of knife
       and shirt stated that on 22.08.09, he joined the investigation at about
       4:30 am. He along with Ct. Anuj, IO and accused went to Bair and
       Dhankor in a private Maruti Car. He could not tell the name of the driver
       and maruti car as well as registration number of the Maruti Car. IO had
       made the departure entry. They reached at the Bair Railway station at

       about 9:00 am which falls within the jurisdiction of PS Kakore. No
       proceedings was conducted by the IO at the Bair Railway Station.
       The trains AGN-Aligarh to New Delhi, Shuttle-Old Delhi to Aligarh and
       HAD pass (sic) in between 7:00 pm-9:00 pm from that place of
       recovery of knife. IO did not make any arrival entry in the local police
       station Kakore. The distance between the Fatehpur Railway Station
       and Bair Railway Station is 5 Km. The Fatehpur Railway Station falls
       within the jurisdiction of Dhankor. IO did not make any arrival and
       departure entry at PS Dhankur. No local police official were
       accompanied from the PS Dhankur and Kakore as well as from
       Railway Police. They reached at the Fatehpur Railway Station at about
       9:15 am. The electric poll no. 1394/29 and 1394/30 were opposite to
       each other and electric poll are 1394/31 and 1394/32 were opposite to
       each other, the distance in between the poll no. 1394/30 and 1394/32
       was about 75 meters. There was no residential area near the place of
       recovery of knife. There were no public person/farmer were working in
       the fields at that time. It took about ½ hr to reach at the place of
       recovery from Fatehpur Railway Station. No public person was asked
       to join the investigation at Fatehpur Railway Station and voluntarily
       stated that Fatehpur Railway Station is not functioning. The knife was
       lying near the stones in between the Railway track at the distance
       about 35 meters from the electric poll no. 1394/29. There was no other
       articles lying on the railway track near the knife. The knife was picked
       by the IO from the Railway track with the help of the handkerchief and
       at that time, he had caught hold of the accused. They reached near the
       place of recovery of knife at about 9:35 am/ 9:40 am. He stated that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                 Page 45 of 55</span>

       there is only one pulia and again stated there are two pullias in
       between the Fatehpur Railway Station and place of recovery of knife.
       They reached at the Pulia where the documents were prepared by the
       IO at about 10:00 am. There was no mud on the knife. They remained
       at the Pulia for about 15 minutes. He stated that he identified the knife
       from the rusting spots on the blade today. He admitted that on the
       blade of the knife, IO did not shown the rusting spots. IO had prepared
       the sketch of the same knife which was recovered at the instance of
       the accused.
</p>

<p id="p_57">37.    IO had recorded the second disclosure statement of accused at the
       Pulia near Railway track. IO in his cross-examination stated that on
       22.08.2009 at about 4:45 a.m. i.e. early morning he started
       investigation of this case and they went to Bair Railway Station from
       PS Bhajanpura in a private maruti car bearing registration number
       DL-5CB-3306. They reached at Bair Rly Station at about 7:45 a.m.
       They remained at Bair Railway Station for about 5 minutes and moved
       towards Dhankor Railway (station) and when they reached Fatehpur
       Railway Station, they left their vehicle there because the vehicle cannot
       go forward due to the bad way. He stated that he alongwith accused
       Raj Kumar, Ct. Vikram Singh moved towards Dhankor on the railway
       tracks leaving behind Ct. Anuj and driver in the vehicle. The distance
       between Fatehpur Railway Station and the place recovery of knife is
       about 2 - 2 ½ km. He admitted that he had not made any efforts to join
       the railway employee/public present at Fatehpur Railway Station and
       again stated that they were not present there. He stated he prepared

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                 Page 46 of 55</span>

       relevant papers of recovery sitting on the pullia. There was no mud on
       the knife. It took about ½ an hour to complete the proceedings. They
       remained at Fatehpur Railway Station for about 2-2 ½ hours.
</p>

<p id="p_58">38.    There are minor inconsistencies between the testimony of IO and HC
       Vikram with respect to recovery of knife. According to PW-17 HC
       Vikram they reached at 9:00 a.m. whereas IO claims that they reached
       at about 7:45 a.m. at Bair Railway Station. Further HC Vikram has
       stated that knife was picked by the accused in his examination-in-chief
       and produced to the IO whereas in his cross-examination he claims
       that knife was picked by IO with the help of handkerchief. However,
       both are consistent with respect to the place of recovery and in the
       manner the same was recovered. Despite lengthy cross-examination of
       PW-17 HC Vikram he could not be shaken and moreover, he had given
       graphic description of the place where recovery of knife was effected
       including location of electric poles. Both are consistent that Fatehpur
       Railway Station was not functioning. The minor inconsistency can be
       safely ignored in view of material consistency. Therefore, the
       prosecution has succeeded in proving that accused led the police party
       to the place near railway track between two railway stations where
       knife was lying in closed condition. He knew the place where knife was
       lying and the same was recovered at his instance.
</p>

<p id="p_59">39.    Ld. Counsel submitted that accused had not given definite information
       in his confessional statement, therefore, the same is not admissible in
       evidence and further cannot be connected with the accused as there

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                Page 47 of 55</span>

       was no blood stained detected according FSL report and cited <a href="/doc/923743/" id="a_29">State of
       Orissa v. Nrusingha Charan Barik</a> 1990 Crl.L. J. 1676 of Orissa High
       Court. The knife was recovered from the railway track. The accused
       made disclosure statement that he had thrown knife on the way from
       train. The accused had given information of stations in his confessional
       statement and on the search at his instance, the same was recovered.
       No one can tell the exact place of an article which is thrown from a
       running train. The approximate place can be told and the information
       given by the accused was definite. Therefore it cannot be said that
       accused had not given definite information. Further it has come on
       evidence that it had rained previous night and it might be probable that
       blood stained could be washed away on account of rain. Therefore the
       mere fact that blood stains were not found on the knife does not mean
       that the knife was not used in the offence. The doctor has opined that
       injury could have been caused by the said knife or such type of
       weapon. Accused knew the place where weapon of offence is lying and
       got recovered the same from railway lines which was a deserted place.
       The fact was within exclusive knowledge of accused. Therefore, the
       same is admissible in evidence against accused and it is proved that
       accused knew the place where the weapon of offence is lying.
</p>

<p id="p_60">40.    The subsequent opinion taken with respect to the recovery of knife
       which was recovered at the instance of accused from the Dr. Meghali
       Kelkar who opined that injuries no.1 to 9 and 11 can be possible by the
       given weapon or this type of weapon. However the opinion with respect
       to injuries caused to deceased Seema could not be obtained as the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                 Page 48 of 55</span>

       doctor who had conducted the postmortem was transfered from the
       hospital. Therefore it is established on record that deceased Ram
       Chander died with injury caused by knife and was possible by the knife
       recovered at the instance of accused.
</p>

<p id="p_61">41.    As regards the recovery of shirts, it is stated that shirt could not be
       traced and IO again interrogated accused and he then disclosed about
       the shirt. In his cross-examination, HC Vikram stated that they left the
       Pulia at about 10:00 am to reach to the village of maternal uncle of the
       accused at Bichat, Sujan Pur which is at the distance of about 12 Kms
       from the Pulia. They reached at the village of maternal uncle of
       accused at about 10:30 am. IO did not inform in the local PS and no
       police official were taken from there. He admitted that village Pradhan
       was also not joined in the investigation. The maternal uncle of the
       accused had expired. The house of the son of maternal uncle of
       accused is located in middle of the village. Two-three villagers were
       gathered when they reached at the house of son of maternal uncle of
       accused. They parked their vehicle (sic) in front of the house of the son
       of the maternal uncle of accused. Total area of the house is about 300
       sq. meter. They also entered in the house of S/o maternal uncle of
       accused and stayed in the varandah. Sunil had taken out the shirt from
       inside the room and produced the same to the IO. IO did not ask those
       villagers who gathered there to join in the investigation. He does not
       remember whether the copy of the seizure memos was given to the
       Sunil or not. IO in his cross-examination stated that they left the
       Fatehpur Railway Station at about 10:00 a.m. and reached at Bichat

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                 Page 49 of 55</span>

       Sujanpur at about 10:45 a.m. The house of maternal uncle of accused
       situated between the village towards outside. The vehicle may reach at
       the door of the house. Public persons were gathered there. 2-3 women
       and son of maternal uncle were present there. He could not tell
       whether he had given the copy of seizure memo of shirt to Mr. Sunil at
       the time or not. He also could not tell the dimension of the blood spots
       on the site. He further admitted that he had not given the information to
       local police about their arrival and departure from the village and also
       not given information about recovery of articles to them and voluntarily
       stated that he has short time, because, he has direction to produce the
       accused on the same day. The testimony of both witnesses is
       consistent to this effect.
</p>

<p id="p_62">42.    Ld. Defence Counsel submitted that Ct. Anuj was joined in the
       investigation of recovery but he has not deposed with respect to
       recovery. Ct. Anuj was examined as PW-16. However as per the
       testimony of HC Vikram, Ct. Anuj was driver of the IO, and therefore he
       has not been cited as witness regarding investigation. Not making
       driver of the vehicle as witness in the investigation, does not in any
       manner bring down the credibility of other witnesses who are
       consistent. It is also settled law that testimony of police witnesses only
       on the ground that public witnesses were not joined cannot be rejected
       if it is found trustworthy. It is common knowledge that public persons do
       not come forward to join in the investigation. The testimony of HC
       Vikram and IO with respect to recovery is consistent and corroborating
       each other at material point. HC Vikram in his cross-examination gives

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">FIR No. : 314/09, PS : Bhajanpura                                  Page 50 of 55</span>

       graphic details of the place and in the manner they effected the
       recovery. Despite lengthy cross-examination, nothing material could
       not elicited from these witnesses which can bring down their credibility
       or creates doubt about their presence. Recovery of shirt, although it
       was brought by one Sunil son of maternal uncle of accused on the
       asking of the accused but the fact that the same was within knowledge
       of accused and it also amounts to discovery of fact and is admissible
       u/s 27 of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_30">Indian Evidence Act</a>. Therefore the prosecution has
       succeeded in proving that the knife used as weapon of offence was
       recovered at his instance and shirt, which accused was wearing, was
       also recovered at his instance. However, as regard the shirt, as per
       FSL result there was no blood stains. Therefore even if it was
       recovered at the instance of the accused, it is not an incriminating
       evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_63">43.    Ld. Defence Counsel further submitted that since there is absence of
       motive, the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt and cited judgment of
       our own hon'ble High Court (D. B.) in case titled as <a href="/doc/965655/" id="a_31">Harish Chander @
       Billa v. State</a>, 1995 (3) 189 and judgment of Bombay High Court (DB) in

</p>
<p id="p_65">44.    Further the law on the subject is now well settled that the motive is not
       necessary to be proved. The hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as

              giving this one factor an importance which is not due and (to use
              the clichi) the motive is in the mind of the accused and can
              seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">45.    According to the discussion above, I am of the opinion that prosecution
       has succeeded in proving the following circumstances against the
       accused :
</p><p id="p_67">       (i)        Deceased persons namely Ram Chander and his
                  daughter Seema who are father-in-law and wife of
                  accused respectively seen alive in the company of
                  accused Raj Kumar by landlady at 5:30 p.m. On
                  15.08.2009 at her house i.e. 158/3, Gali Sanatan
                  Dharamsala, Maujpur, Delhi where deceased Ram
                  Chander was living as tenant and deceased Seema had
                  come to live with his father,

</p><p id="p_68">       (ii)       Accused Raj Kumar seen running having knife in his

                  Ashok and uttering maine dono ko mar diya which is at a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                        -53-</span>


               reached at the house and saw both lying in a pool of
               blood at their house,

</p><p id="p_69">       (iii)   Sh. Ram Chander and her daughter Seema were killed
               by sharp edged object at the same place and at the same
               time and the injuries on their person were caused by
               sharp edged object and sufficient in the ordinary course
               of nature to cause death,

</p><p id="p_70">       (iv)    Recovery of knife i.e. weapon of offence at the instance
               of accused.
</p>

<p id="p_71">46.    Now coming to the defence of the accused. The accused has stated
       that he had gone to some other place and he had cordial relation with
       deceased and he has been falsely implicated in this case. He has not
       led any evidence to substantiate his version. However, his father was
       examined by the prosecution as he had taken the dead bodies after the
       postmortem for cremation, who had stated that his son had gone out of
       Delhi at that time. Submission of father is of obvious reason so as to
       save his son, the accused. It is not believable that he was away had no
       knoweldge about the death of his wife and father-in-law as dead bodies
       were identified by his father and his brother. The inquest reports were
       signed by them. It cannot be believable that they had not informed the
       accused regarding this gruesome murder taken place with his wife and
       father-in-law. He would have immediately arrived on hearing the same.
       The conduct of accused clearly shows that he had himself absconded
       and defence is taken by him is sham defence.

<p id="p_72">47.    Therefore as per discussion above, I am of the opinion that the last
       time when the deceased were seen alive and when the accused was
       seen with knife and when the dead bodies were seen had occurred in
       so short duration that there is no possibility of any third person entering
       in the house and committing offence. There can be inescapable
       conclusion that it is the accused who had committed murder and no
       other person. The chain of circumstances are so well inter-connected
       and complete which rules out any possibility that there can be any
       other person other than accused who had committed the murder. The
       circumstances from which an inference of guilt is drawn are cogently
       and firmly established and the circumstances have definite tendency
       unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused; the circumstance,
       taken cumulatively, forms a chain so complete that there is no escape
       from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was
       committed by the accused and none else; and the circumstances are
       incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of guilt of the
       accused and evidence is consistent with the guilt of the accused and
       inconsistent with his innocence.
</p>

<p id="p_73">48.    Therefore, as per discussion, I am of the opinion that prosecution has
       succeeded in proving offence punishable u/s 302 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_33">IPC</a> beyond
       reasonable doubt against accused.
</p>

<p id="p_74">49.    Accused has used the weapon of offence i.e. knife and got recovered
       the same. The accused was not having any permit or licence to carry
