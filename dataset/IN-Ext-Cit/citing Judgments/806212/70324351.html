</pre><p id="p_36">2.5.    While analysing functions of transaction under business
support service segment, Ld.TPO bifurcated it into business/market
support services and technical support services. Ld. TPO was of
opinion that, assessee was engaged in marketing, promotional and
technical support activities in India on behalf of its AE. He thus
selected comparables under business service segment and technical
service segment separately.
</p><p id="p_37">Ld.TPO thus proposed following adjustment:
Rs.68,38,94,302/- for     software    development     service segment;
Rs.4,48,12,762/-     under      business    support    segment;          and
Rs.67,97,051/-       under technical support segment.
For determining approximate margin for technical support service
segment Ld.TPO after analysing total employee profile and salary
cost in    hands of assessee,     was of   opinion that salary cost of
employees for engineering service group under Business Support
Segment     is 1.19 crore, and therefore technical services can be
taken to be approximately 10% of total services. Ld.TPO thus
bifurcated 10% of total business support services to be technical
support service provided by assessee to the AE.

before DRP. DRP while analysing software support service segment,
excluded Bodhtree Consultants from     list of comparables selected
by Ld.TPO, direction was issued to exclude bank charges and
Fringe Benefit Tax for computation of margin, DRP also directed
for corrections of margins in respect of assessee and certain
comparables and to allow working capital adjustment for software
support service segment, business support     service segment and
technical support service segment.

study filed by assessee. It has been submitted by Ld.AR that
comparability analysis undertaken by assessee was based on well
accepted TP principles, and in absence of any information to the
contrary, it was inappropriate to reject comparability analysis
undertaken by assessee. Ld.AR submitted further that in case
of Sony India (P.) <a href="/doc/791776/" id="a_10">Ltd. v. CBDT</a> reported in (2006) 157 Taxman 125

based on the presence of factors enumerated in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_11">Section 92C</a> (3) (a)
to (d) of the Act. The Ld. A.R thus submitted that Ld.TPO should
have accepted assessee's analysis, since it was in accordance with

submitted that Ld.TPO had no reason nor has recorded reasons to
believe that transactions were not at the Arm's Length.

needs to be tested by using current year's data. It is only when
current year's data does not give a true picture of affairs and
results of comparables due to existence of some abnormal
circumstances, use of multiple year data may be considered. If
there be no such abnormal or exceptional circumstances/facts,

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS)
Assessee objected inclusion of this company proposed to be used in
the final set of comparables by Ld.TPO by contending that it was
not functionally comparable. Ld.AR submitted that this comparable
does not give segmental details of product and services. It has been
submitted that this company is a leading global brand, having huge
intangibles and significant expenses on R&amp;D and that it is a giant
risk taking company and has also undergone various acquisition

consideration that Ld.TPO has carried out this segregation which is
based on    employee cost that the Ld. TPO has attributed                 to
engineering services provided by assessee under the larger segment
of business support. He submitted that 10% basis is also an ad-
hoc basis. Ld.AR submitted that no separate agreement exists for
rendering technical support services. It has been submitted that no
separate payment has been received by assessee for alleged
technical support services. Placing reliance upon        principle of
consistency, Ld.AR    submitted that for assessment year 2008-09
and assessment years 2012-13, 2013-14         Ld.TPO has accepted
benchmarking of transaction under head business support service
segment and functions performed by assessee during year under
consideration   vis-a-vis   immediately preceding assessment years
and subsequent assessment years has been identical and similar.
He submitted that there exists no reason to disregard        approach
adopted by assessee which admittedly has been accepted by
Department.      He   thus      vehemently     opposed         separate
benchmarking of technical support service segment.

<p id="p_122">15.4.      It is well settled that although closely related transactions
can be aggregated, but, unrelated transactions cannot be clubbed
for determining ALP on a combined basis. The relevant criteria to
determine whether certain transactions be considered as one
international transaction or not is to see if such transactions were
entered into a package deal or were intended to be simultaneously
accepted or these are so closely linked that one cannot at all stand
without the other. If      above criteria is satisfied, then, two or more
related transactions can          be       considered       as            one
international transactions for purpose of determining their ALP.
</p>
<p id="p_123">15.5.      On the contrary, if    above criteria is not satisfied, then,
these transactions are to be viewed separate from each other and,
accordingly, their ALP should also be determined in a distinct
manner as if these are two separate independent transactions. The
mere fact that both intra-group services and goods are utilized by
assessee for       manufacture of the final product, cannot be treated
decisive      to      consider   such     separate transactions as            a

in which aggregation can be done in the context of AMP expenses.
The principles laid down in this case are universally applicable and
are not confined to the peculiar facts of that case alone. It has been
held that 'transactions         includes the number of closely
linked transaction.' Dealing with AMP expenses, it held vide paras 80
and 81 that inter-connected international transactions can be
aggregated and <a href="/doc/1942568/" id="a_16">section 92(3)</a> does not prohibit the set off. Further, in
paras 91, 121 and others, it held that the ALP of AMP expenses
should be determined preferably in a bundled manner with the
distribution activity. Vide paras 194 (i), (ii), (viii) and others it held
that for determining the ALP of these transactions in a bundled
manner, suitable comparables having undertaken similar activities of
distribution of the products and also incurring of AMP expenses
should be chosen. It still further held in paras 100, 121, and 194 (iii),
</p><p id="p_127">(vi) and (xi) that if adjustment is not possible or comparables are not
available, then, TNMM on entity level should not be applied and the
international transaction of AMP should be viewed in a debundled or
a segregate manner. In separately determining the ALP of the AMP
expenses, the Hon'ble High Court held that the TPO is free to choose
any other suitable method and in making TP adjustment on account
of AMP expenses, appropriate set off/purchase price adjustment
should be allowed from the other transaction of distribution of the
products. The Hon'ble High Court also held in page 92 of its judgment
that 'it would not be proper and appropriate to apply the TNMM
method in case the Indian assessed is engaged in manufacturing

manufactured products as interconnected transactions. Import of raw
material      for   manufacture      would    possibly     be      an
independent transaction viz., marketing and distribution activities or
functions.' A careful perusal of the judgment of the Hon'ble
jurisdictional High Court divulges that though a number of closely
linked transactions can be aggregated, but, the transactions which
are not closely related to each other would require determination in
a segregated manner.

India (P.) <a href="/doc/1649238/" id="a_17">Ltd. v. Asstt</a>. CIT [2016] 380 ITR 307/[2015] 236 Taxman
318/63 taxmann.com 186, has held that in case of a package deal
where each item is not separately valued, but, all are given a
composite     price,    this    should   be    considered    as    one
international transaction and processed accordingly for the transfer
pricing purpose. It further held that where a number of transactions
are priced differently, but, on the understanding that the pricing was
dependent upon the assessee accepting all of them together (i.e.,
either take all or leave all), then also, the separate transactions be
considered as one international transaction. In such circumstance,
burden has been placed on the assessee to prove that although
each transaction is priced separately, but, they were provided under
one common understanding. It further laid down emphatically that :
'the contention that as the services and goods are utilized by the
assessee for the manufacture of the final product they must be
aggregated and considered to be a single transaction and the value
thereof ought to be computed by the TNMM is not acceptable. Merely
because the purchase of each item and the acceptance of each
service is a component leading to the manufacture/production of the
final product sold or service provided by the assessee, it does not
follow that they are not independent transactions for the sale of
goods or provision of services. The end product requires several
inputs. The inputs may be acquired as part of a single
composite transaction or by way of several independent transactions.
In the latter case, the sale of certain goods and/or the provision of
certain services from out of the total goods purchased or services
availed of by an assessee together can form part of a separate

</p>

<p id="p_130">independent international transaction. In such an event, the AO/TPO
must value this group of sale or purchase of goods and/or provision
of services as separate transaction.'
5.5 When we consider the ratio decidendi of the above referred two
judgments, the picture which emerges is that although closely
related transaction         can       be        aggregated,       but,
unrelated transaction cannot be clubbed for determining ALP on a
combined basis. The relevant criteria to determine whether
certain transaction be considered as one international transaction or
not is to see if such transactions were entered into a package deal or
were intended to be simultaneously accepted or these are so closely
linked that one cannot at all stand without the other. If the above
criteria is satisfied, then, two or more related transactions can be
considered as one international transaction for the purpose of
determining their ALP. On the contrary, if the above criteria is not
satisfied, then, these transaction are to be viewed separate from
each other and, accordingly, their ALP should also be determined in a
distinct     manner      as     if   these    are     two    separate
independent transactions. The mere fact that both the intra-group
services and goods are utilized by the assessee for the manufacture
of the final product, cannot be treated decisive to consider such
separate transactions as a single transaction."
15.7.    It is observed that, in     facts of present case Ld.TPO
arbitrarily, without any basis,    segregated    transaction without
analysing agreement under which such services has been applied
along with business support service. Further in preceding as well
subsequent assessment years revenue has accepted             approach
adopted by assessee. Under such circumstances we are inclined to
set aside this issue back to Ld.TPO to be analysed on          basis of
equipment entered into by assessee actual nature of       transaction
being interlinked with each other in the light of aforestated
principles laid down by Hon'ble High Courts and Coordinate bench of
