by presenting these arguments on issue basis to help the bench in dictation of the order
because in that situation, no argument will escape the notice of the bench at the time
of dictation of the order and it was made clear that the written submission should be
without enclosing any new document and without including any argument on the
basis of any new document and without including any new argument. The learned AR
of the assessee was allowed time to file written submissions up to 29.06.2020 with a
copy to the learned DR of the revenue to facilitate reply by him if he so desires and
learned DR of the revenue was allowed time to file the reply, if any, up to 06.07.2020
and it was made clear that his reply should contain the summary of the arguments
advanced by him orally which was very brief that in respect of the appeals of the
assessee, he supports the orders of both the lower authorities and in respect of the
appeals of the revenue, he supports the assessment order and it was made clear that
he can submit reply to the arguments made by the learned AR of the assessee in his
written submissions and he also should file the written submission without enclosing
any new document and without including any argument on the basis of any new
document and without including any new argument. . Accordingly, learned AR of
the assessee has filed the written submissions with a copy to the learned DR of the
revenue as admitted by learned DR of the revenue in his letter dated 02.07.2020 filed
by him to seek extra time to file reply and this letter is being reproduced by us after
reproducing the written submissions filed by the learned AR of the assessee. But
learned DR of the revenue sought time for the reply vide letters dated 02.07.2020,
29.07.2020 and 12.08.2020. On earlier two dates i.e. in response to the request for
allowing time as per letter dated 02.07.2020 and 29.07.2020, time was allowed by the
bench but in spite of this, as per letter dated 12.08.2020, the learned DR of the revenue
is submitting that he will file written submissions in the case of Shree Walter Neronha,
ITA No. 1630/Bang/2019 within 3 days and filed it on 18.08.2020 but for remaining
appeals, he submitted that Excel sheet was not brought on record based on which the
addition was made and the same is in the hard disk seized at Mumbai and this hard
disk can be opened only in the presence of the assessee or assessee's AR in order to
furnish the same before the tribunal and therefore, the assessee should be directed to
                                                            2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

extend cooperation to the department to facilitate the production of a cloned copy
with a certified copy to ITAT. It is also submitted by him in this letter that further
time should be granted to furnish detailed submissions and case may be heard after
the full submission is made by the department. As per this last request of the learned
DR of the revenue, it appears that he is making this request with this mistaken
understanding that hearing of these appeals is not yet over. This submission in this
request is also peculiar that some relevant documents are not available with the AO
and to obtain those documents, help of the assessee is required and therefore, the
assessee should be directed to provide such help and then only, written submissions
can be filed by him and thereafter, the appeals should be heard. We fail to understand
that if those documents are not with the AO then how in absence those documents,
addition was made by the AO which is stated to be on the basis of such seized
documents and if addition made by the AO is not based on those documents then how
the same is relevant for deciding these appeals. In our considered opinion, as per this
last letter of the learned DR of the revenue, it seems that the DR is either confused or
he wants to delay the order unnecessarily. Learned DR was only required to file reply
to the written submissions filed by the learned AR of the assessee and he was not
supposed to bring on record any other material which is not already on record of the
tribunal. Hence, we draw this inference that the learned DR of the revenue has
nothing to submit in writing in addition to his oral arguments and in reply to the
written submissions of the learned AR of the assessee. We will reproduce the letters
filed by the learned DR of the revenue seeking time to file written submissions and
will also reproduce the written submissions filed by him in respect of one appeal i.e.
in the case of Shree Walter Neronha, ITA No. 1630/Bang/2019 and will consider
those written submissions and we will also consider the oral arguments advanced by
both sides and written submissions filed by the learned AR of the assessee and will
decide all these appeals without waiting any more for the written submissions of the
learned DR of the revenue in respect of the remaining appeals.

undisclosed income/ assets/ expenditure was found. Search action was also taken in
the flat at Mumbai, which was being used as office premises. During the search action,
one Mr. Sanjay was present in the premises whose statement was recorded. He had
stated that the premise was being used as office premises for various firms. Therefore,
it is clear that the premise was not in direct possession and control of the assessee.

<p id="p_17">     1.   No incriminating material, undisclosed income/ assets/ expenditure was found
          in the Assessee's premises or in his possession or control.

</p>
<p id="p_19">     3.   The additions are based on digital evidence, allegedly stored in a pen drive
          belonging to a third person or documents found during survey in third party's
          premises. None of the digital evidences relied upon was in the possession or
          control of the assessee.

<p id="p_20">     4.   No evidence of any on-money exchange in any of the transactions was found

          of disclosure and the need for retraction has been explained, in detail. The A.0

II.     Submission on Principles:
</p>
<p id="p_24">1.    No addition can be made based on pen drive data, unless there are corroborative
      evidence. The contents of digital evidence created and stored in a pen drive of a
      third party cannot be imposed on the assessee, without any corroborative evidence
      to support the same.
</p>
<p id="p_25">2.    Loose documents have no evidentiary value, unless there are corroborative
      evidence

</p><p id="p_26">3.    Additions cannot be made, merely based on disclosure statement, unless there are
      corroborative evidences. Confessions extracted during search proceedings should
      be supported by collection of evidence of income

</p><p id="p_27">4.    Additions made based on alleged evidence found in possession of third party /
      statement of third party, without providing opportunity of cross examination to
      assessee is not tenable

</p><p id="p_28">5.    Absence of corresponding entries in the accounts/ confirmation of opposite party
      makes the addition untenable

</p><p id="p_32">10.         Om Sai Siddhi Riddhi Developers (OSSRD) is a partnership firm in which the
assessee and Mr. Kotian are partners, having share of 75 % and 25 % respectively.
This firm had constructed three projects, Exotica, Nakshatra and Paradise at Navi
Mumbai.
</p>
<p id="p_33">11.         By relying on the excel sheet found in the pen drive of Sanjay, the A.O has
surmised that there has been payment of cash for purchase of land for these three
projects. As corroboration of the excel sheet, the A.O has relied on another loose sheet
in A20, which was also found in the same premise and is only a printout taken from
the pen drive. (A20 was also the seized record of the same premise, as can be seen
from the details of seized records listed in the assessment order). Therefore, both the
sheets of documents referred in the assessment order are from the same premise and
from the files stored in the pen drive of Sanjay.
</p>
<p id="p_34">12.         From the two sheets, the A.0 has surmised that the cost of the plots was Rs
2,62,00,000 and since an amount of Rs 2,09,75,000 is shown in the Books of accounts,
the balance amount of Rs 52,25,000 has been assessed as the undisclosed investment
in the purchase of the plots. Out of this amount of Rs 52,25,000, an amount of Rs
39,18,750, being 75 %, has been assessed in the hands of the assessee and balance 25
% in the hands of Mr. Kotian.

</p><p id="p_36">      i)      Even a cursory look at the documents cited as evidence will show that
              the documents are unreliable. For instance, as per the assessment
              order itself, the cash component in the transaction is Rs 52,25,000.
              But the excel sheet has mentioned an amount of Rs 92,00,000 as cash
              amount. Also, the A.O has recorded that the sheet mentions the share
              of the assessee as 50 %, but the A.O has assessed 75% in the
              Assessee's hands.
</p>
<p id="p_37">      ii)     The addition has been made purely on assumptions and presumptions based
              on the pen drive data, belonging to Mr. Sanjay, without any corroborative
              evidence.

Cash receipts towards construction of projects

was having a proprietary concern by name, M/s Coastal Construction.
This has entered into an agreement with various developers for
construction of three commercial buildings and site development.

<p id="p_147">45.    Based on certain loose sheets found during search, the A.O had
surmised that the assessee has received cash from the developers as
consideration for the various projects constructed by the firms and these
amounts as undisclosed income in the hands of this assessee. As per the
A.0, the assessee had received cash towards construction of three
projects, namely,

considered these cash receipts as contract income and ordered taxing
these receipts © 8% of the receipts, thereby granting partial relief.

ITA No.2356 /Bang/2019 for the A.Y.2016-17 under Section143(3)
Conformance with the CBDT Circular No.17 of 2019:
</p>
<p id="p_176">54.   The Assessee's case falls directly under the CBDT Circular
No.17/2019 as the addition made by the Department is to a tune of
Rs.24,60,098, thereby keeping it out of the ambit of monetary limit set
for appeals to be made by the department.
</p>
<p id="p_177">55.   The Assessee brings to your kind notice, the Circular bearing
No.17 of 2019 dated 08th August, 2019 wherein the further enhancement
of monetary limit for filing of appeals by the Departments before the
Income-Tax Appellate Tribunals stands amended, and by the said
amendment the earlier monetary limit has been raised to Rs.50,00,000/-
(Rupees Fifty Lakhs).
</p>
<p id="p_178">Addition made towards adjustment of cash component in the developed projects

</p><p id="p_179">56.   Assessee is a company engaged in the real estate business.
Consequently, there was a search which was conducted in the premises
of Mr. M. N. Rajendra Kumar on 01.02.2017. During the course of
search, no incriminating material was found that would bear addition on
the assessee's Income.
</p>
<p id="p_180">57.   The Assessing Officer has made addition, by relying on Mr. M. N.
Rajendra Kumar's statement which he himself retracted later (copies of
oath statement is already enclosed in the Paper-book of Mr. M. N.
Rajendra Kumar). However, the Assessing Officer had not given an
opportunity to the Assessee to cross examine the material used against
him, which was also asked by the Assessee during the CIT (A)
proceedings and hence, the same is in violation of the Principles of
Natural Justice and against the law, as held by Hon'ble Apex Court in
the case of <a href="/doc/1808379/" id="a_1">Andaman Timber v. CIT</a> (in Civil Appeal No.4228 of 2006)
which was also considered by The Hon'ble Tribunal at Delhi in the case

<p id="p_181">58.   Further, it may be noted that the books are audited books of
accounts.
</p>
<p id="p_182">59.   No independent enquiry with regard to cash paid by the Assessee
was done by the Assessing Officer. If cash was paid by the Assessee, the
Assessing Officer would have seized that the cash from Global Star
Realtors Private Limited's director, Mr. M. N. Rajendra Kumar which
was not done for obvious reason that there was no cash component found
at all by the Assessing Officer during the course of search carried on in
Mr. M. N. Rajendra Kumar, and neither any unaccounted asset. The
Assessing Officer had made addition merely on assumption without
primary evidence. Further, Assessing Officer also failed to verify with
the other party whether he received cash or not.
</p>
<p id="p_183">60.   No independent valuation was done by Assessing Officer to state
that valuation of project was understated. The Assessing Officer also
failed to bring any evidence on record to support of his contention that
he paid cash over and above the value declared.
</p>
<p id="p_184">61.   Assessing Officer erred in alleging that additional income over and
above the consideration was made in cash by director of the assessee
company, Mr. Rohan Monteiro to directors of M/s. GSRL purely on
assumptions and presumptions.
</p>
<p id="p_185">62.   Further, the AO has erred in alleging that Mr. Rohan Monteiro has
undertaken the responsibility to sell the flat and pay back the proceeds
of the sale to Mr. M. N. Rajendra Kumar and the agreement is entered
into by Mr. Rohan Monteiro and Mr. M. N. Rajendra Kumar in fact there
is no such agreement at all.

party where he is in receipt of cash or generation of unaccounted cash
receipt/payment as alleged by AO.
</p>
<p id="p_188">64.   Further, it was also submitted that no material was found during
search or survey to make the addition by the AO. He did the same on
presumption basis without any evidence, by relying on statement of
Mr. M. N. Rajendra Kumar which was later retracted. Hence, in absence
of cogent evidence in support of entries in loose sheet, no adverse
conclusion can be drawn. Appreciating the same, the Hon'ble CIT (A)
deleted the same in page 16 para 5.13 of his Order.
</p>
<p id="p_189">65.   Further, we rely on the case of <a href="/doc/184449972/" id="a_2">Common Cause v. Union of India</a>
(77 Taxmann.com 245) wherein the Apex Court has held that loose sheets
found during the search were inadmissible as evidence.

(Ahd.)), the Hon'ble Tribunal has held that no name or date was
mentioned in the seized document. In such cases, it is very difficult to
say that the assesse purchased gold ornaments and therefore, he should
be assessed in respect of the amount mentioned therein as unexplained
investment by him. In the absence of cogent evidence on record, the
addition cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_191">67.   Further, the Mumbai Bench in <a href="/doc/1740469/" id="a_4">D. A. Patil v. D. CIT</a> ([2001] 70

assesse. The Hon'ble Tribunal held that the onus was on the AO to prove
that the loose sheet related to the assesse with the help of cogent
evidence supporting the same.

rightly deleted the additions of the AO, and held that when the Partner
had retracted the statement, the AO was to bring relevant cogent material
in order to substantiate the additions.
</p>
<p id="p_194">70.   The Hon'ble SC in the case of <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_7">State v. Ganeswara</a> (AIR 1963 SC

(263 ITR (AT) 75 Del) wherein it was also held that noting on loose

<p id="p_200">75.   It is most humbly submitted that the department did not unearth

agreement to sell flats between the assessee and any third party. The AO
has failed to prove the existence of any such agreement or show any
corroborating transactions.
</p>
<p id="p_201">76.   It was also held that evidence found in the premises of a third party
cannot be imposed on the assessee without any corroborating evidence,

search and seizure operation under section 132 conducted in the case of
Mr.M.N.Rajendra Kumar and others on 1.2.2017, search was also
conducted at the residential premises of the Appellant on 2.2.2017.There
was a survey under section 133A was also conducted on the appellant's
business premises of AH Homes at Presidium Complex, Attavar,
Mangalore and M/s.Coastal Construction on 2.2.2017. Once again survey
under section 133A was conducted at the said business premises on
8.3.2017. During the course of survey books and documents were also
impounded. Accordingly, notices were issued on 20/7/2018 under
section 153C in response to the same return were filed on 24/8/2018

</p><p id="p_208">81.     It is submitted that, though assessee could not reply to notices of
AO due to some personnel inconvenience and also to be noted that no
fresh evidence was also filed before CIT appeals even Appellant had
filed all return of income, audited financial statement and other details
were uploaded in portal for his reference

</p><p id="p_209">      1. Appellant begs to submit that, the Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals) while
         upholding the additions made has grossly overlooked the fact that, Additions
         made is purely on assumptions and presumptions based on the loose sheets and
         AO has multiplied the figures in the loose sheets with multiples of
         hundreds/thousands, even for transactions made through account payee cheques
         purely based on the assumptions and presumptions. While multiplying the
         figures with 100/1000, the AO totally failed to cross verify the same with the
         third party who have received either cash or cheque payments.
</p>
<p id="p_210">      2. The AO merely acted upon on the statement given by the appellant, which was
         subsequently retracted by him. It was a settled position of law that unless the
         statement is tested under the cross examination, the same cannot be considered
         as evidence against the assessee. The AO used the admission made in the
         statement recorded under section 132(4) of the Act. But the assessing officer
         failed to note that, admission itself cannot be considered as conclusive evidence
         against the assessee, unless there is corroborative evidence on record.
</p>
<p id="p_211">      3. There is no other evidence on record to prove that, on money is received. The
         AO, without bringing on record any evidence to prove that, on money is
         exchanged between the parties, merely harping upon the loose sheet, which
         cannot be considered as conclusive evidence against the assessee to bring on
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

         money to tax as undisclosed income. The AO is required to bring further
         evidence on record to show that, actual on money is exchanged between the
         parties, but literally failed to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_212">      4. The AO did not conduct any independent inquiry relating to exchange of money
         (sale) instead, merely relied upon the statement, which is not correct. Further,
         there is no proof of origin and destination of on money.
</p>
<p id="p_213">82.     The learned CIT (Appeals) has also overlooked the Supreme Court
decision relied on by the appellant in the case of <a href="/doc/1404484/" id="a_11">State v. Ganeswara</a>
(AIR 1963SC1850), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that,
absence of corresponding entry in the account of the opposite party
precludes the alleged transaction.
</p>
<p id="p_214">83.     According to the law declared by the Supreme Court, any
presumption of transaction on some vague, tenuous and dubious entries
in a sheet of paper is not rational and hence not legal unless there is
corroboration by corresponding entry in regular accounts of both the
parties to the transaction. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has also held
that the loose sheets cannot be account books of a party.
</p>
<p id="p_215">84.     Cash Receipts towards Construction (in Dept. Appeal):
</p>
<p id="p_216">        The A.0 has made the addition based on assumptions, based on
certain loose sheets, without bringing any corroborative or fresh
evidence on record. All the books of accounts were audited books of
accounts and were uploaded. The assesse has uploaded all relevant
documents in the e-portal and has also filed its Return of Income in reply
to the notice issued u/Section 153C of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_217">85.     Further, A.O. has grossly erred in estimating the income at 8% on
the figures noted/mentioned in the note book by multiplying the same
some by Rs100 or some by Rs. 1,000/- without any basis.
</p><p id="p_218">                                                                2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

</p><p id="p_219">86.         Investment in Jewellery (in Dept. Appeal):
</p>
<p id="p_220">            Based on certain purchase bills found during search, the A.0 had
surmised that the assessee has made undisclosed investment in jewellery
and added the same in various years, as detailed in the assessment order.
</p>
<p id="p_221">           However, the CIT(A) deleted the addition by accepting the
contention of the assessee that,

</p><p id="p_222">      i)       No gold was physically found during search, corresponding to the
               bills, thereby supporting the claim that these were purchased on
               behalf of family members

</p><p id="p_223">      ii)      The assessee had sufficient drawings to explain the purchases

</p><p id="p_224">87.         The decision of the CIT(A) is based on facts and nothing has been
brought on record to counter the same.
</p>
<p id="p_225">88.         Furthermore, we rely on the case of <a href="/doc/184449972/" id="a_12">Common Cause v. Union of
India</a> (77 Taxmann.com 245) wherein the Apex Court has held that loose
sheets found during the search were inadmissible as evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_226">89.         Further, the Mumbai Bench in <a href="/doc/1740469/" id="a_13">D. A. Patil v. D. CIT</a> ([2001] 70
TTR (Mum.) 969) held that in case of discovery of sheets of paper
disclosing loan given by an assesse and interest due thereon, during
search, the assesse could not be saddled with tax liability.
</p>
<p id="p_227">90.         The       Hon'ble        Tribunal            at        Vishakapatnam                 in
<a href="/doc/509508/" id="a_14">Smt. Bommana Swarna Rekha v. A. CIT</a> ([2005] 147 Taxman 59)
observed that a sheet of paper without any name or date was seized to
the premises of the husband of the assesse, using which an addition was
made on the hands of the assesse. The Hon'ble Tribunal held that the
onus was on the AO to prove that the loose sheet related to the assesse
with the help of cogent evidence supporting the same.

rightly deleted the additions of the AO, and held that when the Partner
had retracted the statement, the AO was to bring relevant cogent material
in order to substantiate the additions.
</p>
<p id="p_230">92.   We would also like to draw the lordship's attention to <a href="/doc/320053/" id="a_16">CBI v. V. C.

(263 ITR (AT) 75 Del) wherein it was also held that noting on loose

</p>
<p id="p_231">93.   Further, it is also humbly submitted that the onus lies upon the AO
to prove that a transaction as stated in the said loose paper. The same
concept was adjudicated in the case of <a href="/doc/162429595/" id="a_18">Smt. BommanaSwarnaRekha v.
A. CIT</a> (147 Taxman 59) wherein the Tribunal held in the favour of the

not mandatory or conclusive, and under Section 132 (4A), such
presumptions can be rebutted.

at 8% on the figures noted/mentioned in the note book by multiplying
the same some by Rs100 or some by Rs 1,000/- without any basis. Hence,
it is prayed that, appellant appeals be allowed for the assessment years

<p id="p_237">                        "May it please Your Honours
In the present case filed by the department, the Grounds of Appeal as raised by
the revenue has been broadly categorised into the following headings:
   (1) Whether in the facts and circumstances and in law of the case, the
      Ld.CIT(A) erred in deleting addition of Rs.1.83 crores made u/s 69A and
      failed to appreciate the fact that the addition was made on the basis of
      the declaration by the assessee in the statement recorded u/s 132(4) of
      the I.T.Act in respect of financial business and also based on the
      documents found and seized and further failed to appreciate the fact that
      the assessee could not substantiate the reasons for retraction of the
      statement rendered by him u/s 132(4) .
</p><p id="p_238"> Submission: The Ld.CIT(A) perused all the records and statements submitted
 by the assessee and the assessment records and case laws relied on by the
 assessee and the A.O. On perusal of the same, the Ld.CIT(A) concluded that
 there is no merit in making additions only based on the statement recorded
 during the search and loose sheets found when the statement is retracted,
 and details in the paper are not deciphered, confronted and details written
 therein established. In view of the above the Ld.CIT(A) deleted the addition
 made u/s 69<a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_19">A of the Act</a> and on the basis of statement recorded u/s 132(4)
 of the I.T.Act. The action of the Ld.CIT(A) is not accepted. The A.O. has sent
 the detailed facts and other statements recorded at the time of search and
 other case laws and chronological sequence of the events. I am submitting the
 same for kind consideration of the same and dismissal of the Ld.CIT(A) order.

     The Assessing Officer DCIT, Central Circle, Mangalore vide his letter dated
31-7-2020 has submitted that the excel sheet was not brought on record based on
which the addition was made and the same is in the hard disk seized at Mumbai.
</blockquote><p id="p_255">The said sealed hard disk can be opened only in the presence of the assessee or
assessee's representative in order to furnish the same before the Hon'ble ITAT. In
view of the prevailing pandemic situation the assessee's representative has
expressed his inability to vest the office to facilitate the opening of the hard disk
which contains the evidence.
</p>

<p id="p_256">      In view of this, it is requested to issue necessary directions to the assessee
to extend his cooperation to the Department to facilitate the production of a cloned
copy with a certified hard copy to the ITAT which will be a material evidence to be
considered by the ITAT.
</p>

<p id="p_257">      Further, it was intimated by the Assessing Officer that during the month of
July, he was in home quarantine for 14 days being a primary contact to a person
tested positive for Corona. In addition to this, there was a complete lockdown in
Dakshina Kannada District from 15.07.2020 to 23-7-2020.             Further as per the
orders                                        of                                   the
competent authority the officers and staff are directed to work on rotation as per
the specified roster with minimum staff. In view of this the Officials are reporting
for duty only on alternate days subject to the containment zone restrictions. Hence
there is a inevitable delay in culling out the details from assessment records, search
folders and seized materials in respect of the 24 cases for which the written
submissions are called for. The AO has filed the report in the case of Shri.
Mohammed Ameer which were subsequently transferred to "A" Bench.

</p><p id="p_272">98.   As per the chart of issues in Para 2 above, the bench has noted that the Issue No.
1 is alleged investment of Rs. 52.25 Lacs in ULWE Plots in A. Y. 2011 - 12 and out of
this amount, 75% addition is made by the AO in the hands of Sri M. N. Rajendra Kumar
and 25% addition is made by the AO in the hands of Sri S. D. Kotian. As per the
assessment order for A. Y. 2011 - 12 in the case of Sri S. D. Kotian, in Para 2, it is
noted by the AO that the assessee Sri S. D. Kotian is a partner in the firm M/s Om Sai
Riddhi Siddhi along with Sri M N Rajendra Kumar and this firm is engaged in the
development of Real Estate Projects. In Para 3.1 of the same assessment order, it is
noted by the AO that various incriminating materials including digital evidences
seized/impounded at the residence of the partner Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar in Mumbai
reveals that the firm M/s Om Sai Riddhi Siddhi had purchased three sets of plots for the
construction of residential complexes in Navi Mumbai. It is also noted that the real
estate projects Exotica, Nakshatra and Paradise sit on these particular pieces of lands.
Thereafter, in the same para of this assessment order, the AO has alleged that Evidences
conclusively prove that Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar also paid cash for purchase of these
lands and as per the seized material, land investment in three project is shown as Rs.
262 Lacs and when the evidence was posed to Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar, he accepted
that the cash was indeed paid for the projects. On page 7 of the same assessment order,
the AO has further noted that as per the Pen Drive, total investment is clearly written as
3.62 Crores and thereafter, the AO noted that on this account, only Rs. 209.75 lacs is
reflected in the books of account of the firm as investment in ULWE Property and
thereafter, for the difference of Rs. 52.25 lacs between these two figures Rs. 262 Lacs
and Rs. 209.75 lacs, the AO came to the conclusion that this amount is brought to tax
as unexplained investment in A. Y. 2011 - 12 and ultimately, he added 25% of Rs.
52.25 Lacs i.e. Rs. 13,06,250/- in the hands of Sri S. D. Kotian and balance 75% Rs.
39,18,750/- in the hands of Sri M N Rajendra Kumar. In ITA 2254/B/2019 filed by Mr.
S. D. Kotian and in ITA 2258/B/2019 filed by Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar, only issue
raised is about this addition of Rs. 13,06,250/- and Rs. 39,18,750/-. In the written
submissions filed by the learned AR of the assessee about this issue, although various
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

arguments are raised but this argument itself is conclusive in the facts of the present
case that since the AO has admitted that land purchases were made by the firm, the
alleged cash component cannot be taxed in the hands of the partners and therefore, we
first consider the acceptability of this argument and other arguments will be considered
in case the assessee does not succeed on this argument. We have noted that as noted by
the AO in the assessment order as noted above, the investment in lands in question is
reflected in the books of account of the firm. It proves that the owner of these lands in
question is the firm and not the partners of the firm. This is also not a finding of the AO
that the cash component is paid by the partners out of their own funds by giving a break
up of how much is from own source of which partner. Only this much is noted by the
AO tin Para 3.1 page 4 of the assessment order that Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar has
accepted that cash was indeed paid for the projects and thereafter on page 7 of the
assessment order, the AO has noted that submission was made before him vide letter
dated 18.12.2018 of which relevant portion is reproduced by him in which the assessee
has stated that actual investment in this regard is as per the regular books of accounts
maintained by the firm and he has not invested any cash as alleged in the notice and
request was made that the assessee can obtain confirmation from the vendor and the
assessee also requested for the opportunity for cross examination of the vendor but the
AO jumped to the conclusion on this basis that the assessee has not produced any
material to show that the admission made by the assessee was incorrect in any way other
than denying the payments stating that he was under stress. In our considered opinion,
even the so called admission as noted by the AO in para 3.1 of the assessment order is
this much only that cash payment was indeed made. Even if we accept this admission
as sacrosanct, the said cash payment can be added in the hands of the firm and not in
the hands of the partners without bringing cogent material on record to show that such
cash payment was made by the partners out of their own funds by giving a break up of
how much is from own source of which partner. Under these facts, in our considered
opinion, addition might have been made in the hands of the firm and not in the hands
of the partners and we delete the addition made by the AO in the hands of the partners.
We could have directed the AO to make addition in the hands of the firm but by now,
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

it has become time barred because more than 8 years have elapsed after the end of the
relevant assessment year 2011 - 12. This addition is deleted and Issue No. 1 is decided
in favour of the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_273">99.   Second issue in the appeals of the assesses as per Para 2 above is about alleged
investment in Om Sai Riddhi Siddhi Developers in A, Ys. 2013 - 14 to 2015 - 16 and
connected issue is issue No. 2 in the appeal of the revenue as per Para 3 above being
deletion of the protective addition of Rs. 510,98,250/- in A. Y. 2014 - 15. It appears that
in other two years i.e. 2013 - 14 and 2015 - 16, no appeal is filed by the revenue because
of low tax effect because in these two years, total alleged investment was only Rs. 150
Lacs and Rs. 25 Lacs respectively. This issue is raised by the assessee in A. Y. 2013 -
14 to 2015 - 16 in both the cases i.e. Mr. S. D. Kotian and Mr. M N Rajencdra Kumar.
On Page 17 of the assessment order for A. Y. 2013 - 14 in the case of Mr. S. D. Kotian,
it is noted by the AO that total investment in the lands of M/s Om Sai Riddhi Siddhi
Developers is Rs. 685,98,250/-. Year wise break up of this alleged cash investment is
also noted by the AO on the same page being Rs. 150 Lacs in A. Y. 2013 - 14, Rs.
510,98,250/- in A. Y. 2014 - 15 and Rs. 25 Lacs in A. Y. 2015 - 16. The AO has noted
on page 18 of the same assessment order that the partners have admitted the investment
in their individual hands and the same is assessed therein in the ratio of 25% in the
hands of Mr. S. D. Kotian and 75% in the hands of Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar in each
of these three years. Although the AO has referred to several seized materials including
digital evidence in this regard but ultimately, the AO has proceeded on the basis of
statements which were retracted later on but the retraction was not accepted by the AO.
Arguments about this issue are made by the learned AR of the assessee by considering
it as Issue No. 3 in the written submissions filed by him before the tribunal as
reproduced above. On this issue also, although various arguments are raised by the
learned AR of the assessee but this argument itself is conclusive in the facts of the
present case that since the AO has admitted that land purchases were made by the firm,
the alleged cash component cannot be taxed in the hands of the partners and therefore,
we first consider the acceptability of this argument and other arguments will be
                                                            2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                     ITA No.
                                                      2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                     Page 49 of 74</span>

considered if the assessee does not succeed on this argument. We find that this is
admitted position that the lands in question are owned by the firm M/s Om Sai Riddhi
Siddhi Developers and the AO also has made protective addition in the hands of the
said firm after making substantive addition in the hands of these two individuals who
are partners in the firm with share of 25% Mr. S. D. Kotian and 75% Mr. M N Rajendra
Kumar. Since protective addition is made by the AO in the hands of the firm also, this
argument is not decisive and therefore, we examine the acceptability of other
arguments. This is one of the arguments that this addition is made on surmises and
assumptions based on the excel sheet in the pen drive of MR. Sanjay without bringing
any corroborative evidence on record. Reliance was placed on the tribunal order
rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/63352040/" id="a_20">Anil Jaggi vs. ACIT</a> as reported in 168 ITD 612 (Mumbai), copy
on pages 1 to 14 of Case Law Compendium. Para 14 of this tribunal order is relevant
and the same reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             "14. We shall now take up the case of the assessee on merits and
          deliberate on the validity of the addition of Rs. 2.23 crore made by the A.O
          on the ground that the assessee had made a payment of "on money" for
          purchase of flats from M/s Lakeview developers. We have perused the facts
          of the case and the material available on record on the basis of which the
          addition of Rs. 2.23 crore had been made in the hands of the assessee. We
          have further deliberated on the material placed on record and the
          contentions of the ld. A.R to drive home his contention that no payment of
          any "on money" was made by the assessee for purchase of flats from M/s
          Lakeview Developers. We find that the genesis of the conclusion of the A.O
          that the assessee had paid "on money" of Rs. 2.23 crore for purchase of
          property under consideration is based on the contents of the pen drive which
          was seized from the residence of an ex-employee of Hiranandani group. We
          have perused the print out of the pen drive (Page 42 of APB) and find
          ourselves to be in agreement with the view of the ld A.R that though against
          the heading "Amount of on money paid" the name, address and PAN No. of
          the assessee is mentioned along with the details of the property purchased
          by him, viz. Flat no.2501 in "Somerset" building from Lakeview Developers
          (a Hiranandani group concern), however, the same would not conclusively
          prove suppression of investment and payment of "on money" by the assessee
          for purchase of the property under consideration. We find that the
          information as emerges from the print out of the pen drive falls short of
          certain material facts, viz. date and mode of receipt of „on money‟, who had
          paid the money, to whom the money was paid, date of agreement and who
                                                   2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                            ITA No.
                                             2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                            Page 50 of 74</span>

had prepared the details, as a result whereof the adverse inferences as
regards payment of "on money" by the assessee for purchase of the property
under consideration remain uncorroborated. We further find that what was
the source from where the information was received in the pen drive also
remains a mystery till date. We find that Sh. Niranjan Hiranandani in the
course of his cross-examination had clearly stated that neither he was aware
of the person who had made the entry in the pen drive, nor had with him any
evidence that the assessee had paid any cash towards purchase of flat. We
have deliberated on the fact that Sh. Niranjan Hiranandani in his statement
recorded on oath in the course of the Search &amp; seizure proceedings had
confirmed that the amounts aggregating to Rs. 475.60 crore recorded in the
pen drive were the on-money received on sale of flats, which was offered as
additional income under Sec. 132(4) and thereafter offered as such for tax
in the petition filed before the Settlement commission. We are of the
considered view that there is substantial force in the contention of the ld. A.R
that mere admission of the amounts recorded in the pen drive as the
additional income by Sh. Niranjan Hiranandani, falling short of any such
material which would inextricably evidence payment of "on money" by the
assessee would not lead to drawing of adverse inferences as regards the
investment made by the assessee for purchase of the property under
consideration. We rather hold a strong conviction that the very fact that the
consideration paid by the assessee for purchase of the property under
consideration when pitted against the „market value‟ fixed by the stamp
valuation authority is found to be substantially high, further fortifies the
veracity of the claim of the assessee that his investment made towards
purchase of the property under consideration was well in order. We are of
the considered view that though the material acted upon by the department
for drawing of adverse inferences as regards payment of "on money" by the
assessee formed a strong basis for doubting the investment made by the
assessee for purchase of the property under consideration, but the same
falling short of clinching material which would have irrefutably evidenced
the said fact, thus, does not inspire much of confidence as regards the way
they have been construed by the lower authorities for drawing of adverse
inferences in the hands of the assessee. We thus are of a strong conviction
that as the material relied upon by the lower authorities does not
corroborate the adverse inferences drawn as regards the investment made
by the assessee, therefore, the same cannot conclusively form a basis for
concluding that the assessee had made payment of "on money" for purchase
of the property under consideration. We thus in the backdrop of our
aforesaid observations are of the considered view that the adverse inferences
drawn by the A.O as regards payment of "on money" of Rs. 2.23 crore by the
assessee for purchase of Flat No. 2501 from M/s Lakeview Developers are
based on of premature observations of the A.O, which in the absence of any
clinching evidence cannot be sustained. We thus are unable to subscribe to
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

<p id="p_274">100.   In this case also, the tribunal noted that the genesis of the conclusion of the AO
that the assessee had paid "On Money" of Rs. 2.23 Crore for purchase of property under
consideration is based on the contents of the pen drive which was seized from the
residence of an of ex-employee of Hiranandani Group. On page 15 of the same
assessment order, the AO noted that the information noted by him on page 14 of the
assessment order regarding cash investment of Rs. 685,98,250/- was unearthed in the
digital evidence from the back up taken from Sanjay - Pen drive 2.               Although the
AO has referred to several printed sheets also but on page 23 of the same assessment
order, the AO while dealing with the assessee's claim about loose sheets, has observed
that these loose sheets are digital evidences retrieved from computers, pen drive and lap
tops. Hence, it is clear that even as per the AO, all the materials on which basis, addition
was made by him is digital evidences retrieved from computers, pen drive and lap tops.
Hence, in our considered opinion, in the facts of the present case, this tribunal order is
applicable. The tribunal also noted in that case that Shree Niranjan Hiranandani in his
statement recorded on oath in course of search proceedings has confirmed that the
amounts aggregating to Rs. 475.60 Crores recorded in the pen drive were the on -
money received on sale of flats which was offered as additional income u/s 132 (4) and
thereafter offered as such for tax in the petition filed before settlement commission. In
spite of this, the tribunal in that case held that though the material acted upon by the
department formed a strong basis for doubting the investment made by the assessee for
purchase of the property under consideration but the same is falling short of clinching
material and deleted the addition in that case. In the facts of the present case which are
similar to that case, we respectfully follow this tribunal order and hold that the adverse
inference drawn by the AO as regards payment of on money for purchase of various
properties in question is not sustainable and we delete the same in the hands of both the
partners i.e. Mr. S. D. Kotian and Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar and also in the hands of
the firm M/s Om Riddhi Siddhi Developers. Issue No. 2 in the appeals of the assessee
as well as issue No. 2 in the appeals of the revenue are decided in favour of the assessee.

investment in M/s K. D. Developers. In the written submissions filed by the learned AR
of the assessee, his arguments about this issue are contained in the arguments for Issue
No. 3 in his submissions. This issue is raised by the assessee in A. Y. 2011 - 12 and
2012 - 13 in the case of Mr. M N Rajencdra Kumar. In Para 11.7 on Page 14 of the
assessment order for A. Y. 2011 - 12 in the case of Mr. M N Rajencdra Kumar, it is
noted by the AO that M/s K. D. Builders (KDB) is a partnership firm (PAN :
AAIFK9762D) of Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar and Mr. Shrikant N Kotian and this firm
owns a land at Liberty Gardens, Malad Mumbai. He further noted that this firm was
incorporated Mr. Deepak Pandurang Pawar (DPP) and later Mr. M N Rajendra Kumar
(MNR) entered the firm as partner. Then the AO noted that the Balance Sheet of MNR
on 31.03.2016 shows that the amount of investment in KDB is Rs. 190.66 lacs and this
is a meagre amount as compared to the actual investments made as per evidences
gathered. Then he discussed about various digital evidences mainly back up taken from
Sanjay Pen drive - 2and referred to a statement of the Accountant of MNR Mr. Sanjay
Yaswant Katalkar (SYK)       in which he stated that an agreement was signed on
28.03.2016with DPP for the Liberty Garden Project, Malad, Mumbai and the approx.
value of the project is Rs. 10.19 Crores. Thereafter in Para 11.9 of the same assessment
order, the AO noted that during post search proceedings, the assessee submitted copy
of agreement signed on 28.03.2016 between DPP and KDB for Rs. 332,47,500/- and
observed that in spite of this agreement, the evidences speak differently. In para 11.10
of the same assessment order, the AO referred to the same pen drive of Sanjay and
observed that date wise payment to DPP up to 24.10.2011 was Rs. 445.37 lacs and
without indicating any basis for saying so, he stated that this cash was paid by Mr. MNR
over and above the agreement value of Rs. 332 Lacs. Thereafter in para 11.12 of the
same assessment order, the AO talks about payment of Rs. 40 lacs to DPP and states
that this payment is of personal nature and also mainly towards the land at Link Road
and Wasari Hill. He has noted down date wise details of various payments to DPP.
Thereafter the AO has stated about the statement of Mr. MNR u/s 132 (4) in which he
accepted about these alleged investments and also noted about the retraction of the
                                                             2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                      ITA No.
                                                       2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

assessee but rejected the retraction by saying that the assessee has not produced any
evidence in support of retraction and made additions in these two years. In our
understanding, these additions are only on the basis of statement which is later retracted
also and asking for evidence in support of retraction is like asking for impossible to
prove the negative. The assessee states in retraction that no payment in cash was made
by him and there cannot be any evidence about non payment.               On this issue also,
although various arguments are raised by the learned AR of the assessee but this
argument itself is conclusive in the facts of the present case that since the AO has
admitted that land purchases were made by the firm KDB, the alleged cash component
cannot be taxed in the hands of the partners and therefore, we first consider the
acceptability of this argument and other arguments will be considered if the assessee
does not succeed on this argument. We find that this is not the case of the AO that the
lands in question are owned by the Mr. MNR and not the firm M/s K. D. Builders.
Hence, we proceed on this basis that the owner of these lands in question is the firm and
not the partners of the firm. This is also not a finding of the AO that the cash component
is paid by the partners out of their own funds by giving a break up of how much is from
own source of which partner. Only this much is noted by the AO tin Para 11.10 to11.12
of the same assessment order that various cash payments were made to DPP on various
dates in respect of Liberty Garden Plot Work, Link Road Plot Work and Vasari Hill
Plot and some personal payments without any finding that these cash payments are
made by Mr. MNR out of his own sources and not out of the funds of the firm M/s
KDB. In our considered opinion, even if it is accepted that some cash payments are
made to DPP over and above the agreement value, the said cash payment can be added
in the hands of the firm and not in the hands of the partners without bring cogent
material on record to show that such cash payment was made by the partners out of their
own funds by giving a break up of how much is from own source of which partner.
Under these facts, in our considered opinion, addition might have been made in the
hands of the firm and not in the hands of the partners and we delete the addition made
by the AO in the hands of the partners Mr. MNR. We could have directed to make
addition in the hands of the firm but by now, it has become time barred because more
                                                             2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

than 7 &amp; 8 years have elapsed after the end of the relevant assessment year 2011 - 12
and 2012 - 13. This addition is deleted and Issue No. 3 is also decided in favour of the
assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_277">102. Fourth issue in the appeals of the assesses as per Para 2 above is about alleged
investment in M/s Global Star Realtors (P) Ltd. In the written submissions filed by the
learned AR of the assessee, his arguments about this issue are contained in the
arguments for Issue No. 4 in his submissions. This issue is raised by the assessee in A.
Y. 2013 - 14 and 2014 - 15 in the case of Mr. M N Rajencdra Kumar. In Para 14 on
Page 25 of the assessment order for A. Y. 2013 - 14 in the case of Mr. M N Rajencdra
Kumar, it is noted by the AO that the assessee Mr. MNR is a director of M/s Global
Star Realtors (P) Ltd. (GSRPL). The AO has observed that evidences in respect of
cheque and cash payments were found in the office of Mr. MNR during survey u/s 133A
on 27.12.2016over and above the sale consideration in respect of five pieces of land in
Kodialabail village, Padavu village purchased by that company. After discussing about
various entries in various digital evidences, in Para 14.2 of the same assessment order,
the AO summarized the alleged cash payments of Rs. 141.90 Lacs in A. Y. 2012 - 13
and Rs. 345 Lacs in A. Y. 2013 - 14. Thereafter in Para 14.1.1 of the same assessment
order, the AO observed again that these cash payments are for the land purchased for
its projects by M/s Global Star Realtors Pvt. Ltd. The AO has noted about the admission
by the assessee in statement recorded on 16.03.2017 and its retraction vide letter dated
28.07.2018 and 11.10.2018. Thereafter on page 34 of the same assessment order, the
AO has noted about this argument of the assessee also that the cash payment if any is
made by the concerned company and not by Mr. MNR personally and that the assessee
Mr. MNR is not actively involved in the regular operation of the company but the AO
brushed aside these arguments by stating that the company is floated by the assessee
himself with 90% being the assessee and his family members. The AO made the
addition in the hands of Mr. MNR without bringing any cogent material on record to
establish that the alleged cash payment is made by the assessee individual out of his
personal funds.

</p><p id="p_279">103.   On this issue also, although various arguments are raised by the learned AR of
the assessee but this argument itself is conclusive in the facts of the present case that
since the AO has admitted that land purchases were made by the company M/s GSRPL,
the alleged cash component cannot be taxed in the hands of the directors or shareholders
and therefore, we first consider the acceptability of this argument and other arguments
will be considered if the assessee does not succeed on this argument. We find that this
is not the case of the AO that the lands in question are owned by the Mr. MNR and not
the company M/s GSRPL. Hence, we proceed on this basis that the owner of these lands
in question is the company and not the directors of the company. This is also not a
finding of the AO that the cash component is paid by the directors out of their own
funds by giving a break up of how much is from own source of which director. There
is no specific finding of the AO by giving reference to any cogent evidence that these
cash payments are made by Mr. MNR out of his own sources and not out of the funds
of the company M/s GSRPL. In our considered opinion, even if it is accepted that some
cash payments are made over and above the agreement value, the said cash payment
can be added in the hands of the company and not in the hands of the directors without
bring cogent material on record to show that such cash payment was made by the
directors out of their own funds by giving a break up of how much is from own source
of which director. Under these facts, in our considered opinion, addition might have
been made in the hands of the company and not in the hands of the directors and we
delete the addition made by the AO in the hands of the director Mr. MNR. We could
have directed the AO to make addition in the hands of the company but by now, it has
become time barred in one year i.e. A. Y. 2013 - 14 because more than 6 years have
elapsed after the end of the relevant assessment year 2013 - 14. For A. Y. 2014 - 15,
although the reassessment of the company is not yet time barred but we do not feel it
proper to give such direction to the AO because in spite of this argument made by the
assessee before the AO that cash payment if any, is made by the company, the AO has
not taken required steps to ensure at least protective addition in the hands of the
company and therefore, providing second innings to the AO under these facts is not
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

proper in our humble opinion. This addition is deleted and Issue No. 4 is also decided
in favour of the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_280">104. Issue No. 5 in the appeals of the assessee as per Para 2 above is about alleged
undisclosed payment to Mr. Jayanti Lal Jain (JLJ) Rs. 191,86,765/- as per
Ground No. 4 in the appeal filed by Mr. MNR for A. Y. 2013 - 14 and in the written
submissions filed by the learned AR of the assessee, arguments on this issue are the
arguments in respect of Issue No. 5 as per him. The main argument raised is this that
file created and stored in pen drive of a third party or on the basis of loose sheets cannot
be the basis of addition without any corroborative evidence to support the same. At this
juncture we examine the basis adopted by the AO in respect of this addition. We find
that para 14.3 of the assessment order in the case of Mr. MNR for A. Y. 2013 - 14 is
relevant in this regard. In this para, the AO has noted that 25% of share of M/s Om Sai
Siddhi Developers which belonged to Mr. Jayanti Lal Jain was transferred in favour of
Mr. MNR and the amounts paid to JLJ was verified. He has noted that as per the
Retirement Deed date 10.09.2012, Rs. 74,13,235/- was paid to JLJ but as per the
evidences available which is mainly the pen drive of Sanjay, the total payment made to
JLJ is Rs. 209 lacs. The difference worked out is Rs. 134, 86,765/-. It is further noted
by the AO that an amount of Rs. 57 Lacs was paid to JLJ for the retirement from the
Wadhgar project. Total was worked out at Rs. 191, 86,765/-. On page 38 of this
assessment order, the AO noted that this fact was confronted to the assessee and reply
was received by the AO and he has reproduced the relevant portion of this reply
wherein, the assessee had submitted that the assessee had made no cash payment to JLJ
and the assessee had discussed this issue with JLJ and JLJ has also denied about any
such receipt. The assessee requested the AO to provide an opportunity to the assessee
to cross examine JLJ before the AO to establish the truth. After reproducing the reply,
the AO brushed aside it by stating that the assessee has not produced any evidence in
this regard and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary of the allegation of the
AO, this amount is brought to tax as unexplained expenditure. In our considered
opinion, this stand of the AO is like asking for an impossible because the assessee's
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

stand is this that he had not made any cash payment to JLJ and there cannot be an
evidence for negative and the stand of the AO to require the assessee to bring evidence
in support of negative is nothing but asking the assessee to do an impossible task.
Moreover, the evidence relied upon by the AO is the contents of the pen drive of Sanjay,
an employee of the assessee and before us, the learned AR of the assessee has placed
reliance on the tribunal order rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/63352040/" id="a_21">Anil Jaggi vs. ACIT (Supra</a>). Para
14 of this tribunal order is relevant and the same is already reproduced in para 9 above
and it is discussed in Para 10 above that this tribunal order is applicable in the facts of
the present case and Issue No. 2 was decided in favour of the assessee by respectfully
following this tribunal order as per Para 10 above. On the same line, for issue No. 5
also, we respectfully follow this tribunal order and decide this issue also in favour of
the assessee. Accordingly, Issue No. 5 is also decided in favour of the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_281">105. Issue No. 6 in the appeals of the assessee as per Para 2 above is about alleged
cash collected in developed projects with PIPL Rs. 207.05 lacs in A. Y. 2014 - 15, Rs.
527,96,670/- in A. Y. 2015 - 16, Rs. 340,00,004/- in A. Y. 2016 - 17 and Rs.
23,98,326/- in A. Y. 2017 - 18 in the appeals filed by Mr. MNR for these years and in
A. Y. 2016 - 17 in appeals filed by the revenue in the case of M/s Property Infotech
India Pvt. Ltd. and in the case of Shree Rohan Monterio. In the written submissions
filed by the learned AR of the assessee, arguments on this issue are the arguments in
respect of Issue No. 6 as per him. The main argument raised is this that file created and
stored in pen drive of a third party or on the basis of loose sheets cannot be the basis of
addition without any corroborative evidence to support the same. At this juncture we
examine the basis adopted by the AO in respect of this addition. We find that para 14
of the assessment order in the case of Mr. MNR for A. Y. 2014 - 15 is relevant in this
regard. In this para, the AO has noted relevant facts about MI CASA Project and he
noted that M/s PIPL and M/s GSRL entered into MOU on 10.06.2013 for the
development of 44 cents of land situated at Mangalore and as per this MOU, M/s PIPL
agreed to pay monetary consideration of Rs. 4.4 Crores to M/s GSRL for taking over of
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

its undivided rights in the said property for the proposed project of Multi Story
apartment called as MICASA.
</p>
<p id="p_282">106.   In the same para, the AO discussed about another project named VENTURA
Project and noted that similarly a MOU was signed on 30.11.2013 between the same
two companies for the development and construction of a multi story apartment on
51.75 cents of land at Mangalore for Rs. 3.93 Crores.
</p>
<p id="p_283">107.   In the same para, the AO discussed about another project named PREMIERO
Project and noted that similarly a MOU was signed on 08.05. 2014 between the same
two companies for the development and construction of a multi story apartment for Rs.
8 Crores and a supplementary agreement for MOU dated 26.10.2015 was executed to
reduce the monetary consideration payable by M/s PIPL as Rs. 4 Crores instead of Rs.
8 Crores. He noted that these agreements were found and impounded in survey
conducted u/s 33Aon 01.02.2017. He also noted that this is a property held in the
individual name of M/s GSRL and as per the MOU, the amount is payable by M/s PIPL.
As per these facts noted by the AO in the assessment order, these three projects are
being developed by two companies jointly i.e. M/s PIPL and M/s GSRL and in
subsequent paras, the AO discussed about various digital evidences about receipt of
cash of Rs. 1099 lacs in respect of these three projects and finally on page 67 of the
same assessment order, he noted year wise and project wise break up the alleged receipt
of cash in respect of these three projects which shows that in A. Y. 2014 - 15, the receipt
was of Rs. 207.05 Lacs including Rs. 127.35 lacs for MICASA Project and Rs. NIL for
PRIMERIO Project and Rs. 80.50 Lacs for VENTURA Project. Similarly, he noted
that in A. Y. 2015- 16, the receipt was of Rs. 527,96,670/- including Rs. 169.80.80 lacs
for MICASA Project and Rs. 116,66,670/- for PRIMERIO Project and Rs. 241.50 Lacs
for VENTURA Project. Similarly, he noted that in A. Y. 2016- 17, the receipt was of
Rs. 340,00,004/- including Rs. 42.85 lacs for MICASA Project and Rs. 140,00,004/-
for PRIMERIO Project and Rs. 157.15 Lacs for VENTURA Project. For A. Y. 2017 -
18, he noted that the alleged receipt is only Rs. 23,98,326/- for PRIMERIO Project. This
fact is admitted by the AO also that these three projects are owned and developed by
                                                             2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

two companies as per various MOUs and therefore, even if some on money in cash was
received in respect of sale of these projects, income will be of these two companies in
their agreed share but by no stretch of imagination, it can be considered as income of
an individual i.e. Mr. MNR. Hence the addition made in the hands of MR. MNR is
deleted for this reason alone and we do not discuss and examine other various arguments
of both sides.
</p>
<p id="p_284">108.   Now we discuss and decide Issue No. 3 in two appeals of the revenue for A. Y.
2016 - 17 i.e. in the case of M/s PIPL and Mr. Rohan Monerio. In para 5.1 of the order
of CIT (A) in the case of the company M/s PIPL, it is noted by CIT (A) that the AO has
stated in the assessment order that the assessee company is carrying on business of
builders and developers and noted that in course of survey, certain incriminating
material was found and impounded in the form of loose sheets pertaining to three
projects viz. MICASA, VENTURA and PREMIRO of the assessee company M/s PIPL
and M/s GSRL wherein Mr. MNR is managing director. The AO also noted that as per
such material, consideration over and above the agreement value of these three projects
was paid by M/s PIPL and the AO added Rs. 340,00,004/- in the hands of M/s PIPL in
A. Y. 2016 - 17 by alleging that this much cash was paid by M/s PIPL for these three
projects. As per para 5.13 of his order, learned CIT (A) deleted this addition by holding
that an opportunity of cross examination was not allowed by the AO and unless such an
opportunity is given, the addition cannot be sustained. He has given a categorical
finding in this para that the addition was made only on the basis of statement recorded
during the search of Mr. MNR which he retracted later vide his letter dated 28.07.2018.
Learned CIT (A) held that in the absence of any cogent evidence and corroboration in
support of entries in loose sheets, no adverse conclusion can be drawn against the
assessee and on this basis, this addition was deleted by CIT (A) and the revenue is in
appeal before the tribunal. This finding of CIT (A) could not be controverted by the
learned DR of the revenue. This is a settled position of law by now that in the absence
of cross examination, the adverse statement cannot be a basis of addition and loose
sheets alone in the absence of corroboration in support of entries in loose sheets also
                                                            2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

cannot be a basis of addition. In the present case of M/s PIPL, the addition was made
by the AO on the basis of statement of Mr. MNR and some loose sheets and the AO has
not provided the opportunity of cross examination and did not bring on record any
material for corroboration in support of entries in loose sheets and therefore, on this
issue, we find no infirmity in the order of CIT (A) as per which CIT (A) deleted the
addition in the hands of the company M/s PIPL.

<p id="p_285">109.   Now we decide the appeal of the revenue in the case of Shree Rohan Monterio.
In para 5.4 of his order in the case of Shree Rohan Monterio (RM) for A. Y. 2016 - 17,
it is noted by him that the AO added an amount of Rs. 580 lacs by giving a finding that
Shree Rohan Monterio is M. D. of the company M/s PIPL. The AO has also noted that
Mr. RM has sold Kadri Property and in addition to the agreed sale consideration of
Kadri Property, cash component of Rs. 580 lacs was adjusted against cash component
payable for the same three projects i.e. MICASA Project, PRIMERIO Project and
PRIMERIO Project. In Para 5.15 of his order, learned CIT (A) has noted about various
judicial pronouncements cited before him by the learned AR of the assessee and these
judgments included the judgment of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court rendered in the case
of <a href="/doc/87989093/" id="a_22">CIT vs. IBC Knowledge Park (P) Ltd</a>., 69 Taxman.com 108. In para 5.16 of his
order, learned CIT (A) decided this issue in favour of the assessee by following these
judgments included the judgment of Hon'ble Karnataka High Court rendered in the case
of <a href="/doc/87989093/" id="a_23">CIT vs. IBC Knowledge Park (P) Ltd. (Supra</a>). In para 5.17 of his order, this finding
is also given by CIT (A) that evidence found in the premises of third party cannot be
imposed on the assessee without any corroborative evidence by the AO. He also
observed that both the parties i.e. the searched party Mr. MNR and the assessee Mr. RM
have denied having exchanged the on money and he held that loose sheets alone in the
absence of corroboration in support of entries in loose sheets cannot be a basis of
addition. These findings of CIT (A) could not be controverted by the learned DR of the
revenue. This is a settled position of law by now that in the absence of cross
examination, the adverse statement cannot be a basis of addition and loose sheets alone
in the absence of corroboration in support of entries in loose sheets also cannot be a
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

basis of addition. In the present case of Mr. RM, the addition was made by the AO on
the basis of statement of Mr. MNR and some loose sheets and the AO has not provided
the opportunity of cross examination and did not bring on record any material for
corroboration in support of entries in loose sheets and therefore, on this issue, we find
no infirmity in the order of CIT (A) as per which CIT (A) deleted the addition in the
hands of Mr. RM.
</p>
<p id="p_286">110.   As per above discussion, all aspects of issue no. 6 in the appeals of the assessee
and issue no. 3 in the appeals of the revenue are decided in favour of the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_287">111. Issue No. 7 in the appeals of the assessee as per Para 2 above is about alleged
cash receipt on sale of shares in the company M/s MA Smart Builders &amp; Developers,
Mangaluru in A. Y. 2017 - 18 Rs.105 Lacs the appeals filed by Mr. MNR. In the written
submissions filed by the learned AR of the assessee, arguments on this issue are the
arguments in respect of Issue No. 7.       In Para 14 of the relevant assessment order,
the AO has noted that the assessee Mr. MNR sold several of his interests in the
commercial property developed by M/s MA Smart Developers (MASD) to Mrs.
Mubeena Banu in which he is a partner. Then the AO has stated that the agreement
value for this property is Rs. 354,97,500/- as per copy of agreement found and
impounded during survey u/s 133A in the case of SCDCC Bank Ltd. on 27.12.2016.
The AO further noted that in the copy of impounded document, an amount of Rs. 105
Lacs was written in addition to Rs. 95 Lacs which was received through Cheque. Then
he referred to the statement of one Mr. Rajesh Poojary who stated that this is cash receipt
in addition to cheque receipt of Rs. 95 lacs. The AO also referred to the statement of
Mr. NBR in which as per the AO, he confirmed that Rs. 105 Lacs received is in the
form of cash as on money and he agreed that this will be offered as additional income
in A. Y. 2017 - 18. The AO reproduced the relevant portion of the statement of Mr.
MNR in which, he made a declaration of this amount of Rs. 105 Lacs but from this
statement, this is not clear that whether the offer of Mr. MNR was as income of the firm
or his individual income but since, this is admitted position that the property in question
is developed by the firm MASD, the income on account of receipt of on money, if any,
                                                               2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                        ITA No.
                                                         2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                        Page 62 of 74</span>

will be of that firm only and not of the partner of the firm. In our considered opinion,
this addition is not sustainable for two reasons. First reason is this that when the property
sold is owned by the firm, the income on account of receipt of on money, if any, will
be of that firm only and not of the partner of the firm. The second reason is this that the
addition was made by the AO on the basis of the statement of the supervisor and material
impounded during the course of survey conducted at the head office of SCDCC Bank
on 27.12.2016 without bringing on record any material for corroboration in support of
entries in loose sheets or digital evidence. Hence, the receipt of on money itself is not
established beyond doubt. The value as per agreement is said to be Rs. 354,97,500/- and
alleged receipt is only Rs. 200 Lacs i.e. Rs. 95 Lacs by cheque and Rs. 105 lacs by cash
and hence, total alleged receipt is much less that value as per the agreement. Under these
facts and in view of this discussion, we decide this issue No. 7 also in favour of the
assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_288">112. Issue No. 8 in the appeals of the assessee as per Para 2 above is about alleged
cash receipts towards construction of Sahakari Sadan (MA Smart) of Rs. 86 lacs in A.
Y. 2014 - 15, of Rs. 87.50 lacs in A. Y. 2015 - 16, of Rs. 885.67 lacs in A. Y. 2016 -
17 and Rs. 538.55 Lacs in A. Y. 2017 - 18 in the case of Shree Mohammad Ameer.
Issue No. 9 in the appeals of the assessee as per Para 2 above is about alleged cash
receipts towards construction of Garden City Project (Hindustan Bawa) of Rs. 113.30
lacs in A. Y. 2014 - 15, of Rs. 219 lacs in A. Y. 2015 - 16, of Rs. 142,56,200/- in A.
Y. 2016 - 17 and Rs. 190 Lacs in A. Y. 2017 - 18 in the case of Shree Mohammad
Ameer. Issue No. 10 in the appeals of the assessee as per Para 2 above is about alleged
cash receipts towards construction of Oceanic View Project (Mamko Builders) of Rs.
157 lacs in A. Y. 2016 - 17 and Rs. 66,19,500/- in A. Y. 2017 - 18 in the case of Shree
Mohammad Ameer. Issue No. 11 in the appeals of the assessee as per Para 2 above is
about alleged cash receipts towards construction of Other Projects of Rs. 561,67,500/-
in A. Y. 2016 - 17 in the case of Shree Mohammad Ameer. Another connected issue is
issue No. 5 in the appeals of the revenue and this issue is this that as per the revenue,
CIT (A) was not justified in directing the AO to restrict the addition to the extent of
                                                             2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,

only 8% of the alleged cash receipts in these four years in the case of the same assessee
Mr. Mohammad Ameer. We take up these four issues in the appeals of the assessee and
one issue in the appeals of the revenue together as facts and arguments are similar.
Regarding Issue No. 8, para 5.3.7 of the order of CIT (A) for A. Y. 2014 - 15 in the
case of Shree Mohammad Ameer is relevant because in the remaining years also, the
finding and decision of CIT (A) is identical and therefore, we reproduce this para for
ready reference. Similarly, regarding Issue No. 9, 10 and 11, para 5.4 to para 5.4.8 of
the order of CIT (A) for A. Y. 2016 - 17 in the case of Shree Mohammad Ameer is
relevant because in the remaining years also, the finding and decision of CIT (A) is
identical and therefore, we reproduce these paras also for ready reference. These are as
under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">     "5.3.7. I have considered the facts of the case and case laws as well as
     board circular relied on by the AR. The fundamental issue is that since
     appellant did not appear before the AO, therefore, the entire receipt of
     contract had to be charged to tax, in the absence of explanation by the
     appellant. I find that the basis for multiplying the figures by 100 and 1000
     is not validly delineated. No Enquiries in this regard have been conducted.
     The logic for multiplying the figures, even those of cheques, is improper.
     Perhaps, this emanates for the statement of the accountant Shri. Makeem,
     in which case he should have been allowed to be cross examined. If it
     emanates from the statement recorded during search of the appellant, then
     he has in effect retracted it; AO has failed to explain why the retraction is
     inadmissible, specially in the face of the evidence gathered which is
     claimed to have zeros missing; but this conclusion is not based on valid
     gathering of evidence as the accountant Shri. Makeem has not been cross
     examined. The principles of natural justice have also been violated, in the
     sense that the cross examination opportunity has not been provided.
     Besides, receipt by cheque have been treated as being at par with receipt
     by cash without providing the reason thereof. Hence, there is no merit in
     making additions based merely on the verbal statement, which have since
     been in effect retracted. On the other hand, I find that, the appellant is a
     contractor. He is not the developer of the buildings himself. Even in his
     disclosure during search, he has disclosed the said "receipts", not income.</blockquote>
<p id="p_289">     Thus, the receipts on account of the project, even if unaccounted, are
     contract receipts, on which tax could be levied on the income, not on
     receipts. It would not be out of context to point out here that level of evidence
     required is preponderance of probabilities. Thus, based on the evidence
     available, the AO is directed to compute turnover, after deleting the
                                                            2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                     ITA No.
                                                      2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

accounted (cheque) amount from the above said amount. Income there from
could be computed @ 8% on the said amount. Credit should be given from
this income so computed of the income declared in the returns on account
of these projects declared in any year, if these receipts are included therein.
In the result, the appeal is partly allowed on this issue."
</p>
<p id="p_290">"5.4. I now proceed to decide the ground in respect of additions made of
cash receipts from following projects viz.,
</p><p id="p_291">       a)   Garden City Project -- M/s.Hindustan Bawa Rs. 1,42 ,56,2 00
</p><p id="p_292">       b)   O c e a n i c V i e w Project -- N a m k o B u i l d e r Rs.1,57,00,000
</p><p id="p_293">       c)   Othe r Projec ts                                        Rs. 5 ,61 ,67,500

5.4.1. The AO in the order of assessment has made above three additions
based on the loose sheets impounded during the survey conducted at M/s.
Coastal Construction, proprietary concern of the appellant, based on the
said loose sheets, and also based on the declaration in the statement
recorded during the survey conducted under <a href="/doc/129721/" id="a_24">Section 133A</a> of the Income
tax Act.
</p>
<p id="p_294">5.4.2. Further, AO while making addition of Rs.5,61,67,500/- as cash
receipts from other projects, has multiplied the figures in the loose sheets,
especially copies of the impounded materials at page numbers 1-13 and 17
vide document No.A/AAH/06 by observing that, details of cash receipts
were with respect of various projects. The AO further suspected that some
of the entries were made in code words- by virtue of these code words the
Appellant has deliberately reduced two decimals of number. Finally, while
concluding assessment she has stated that, only cash receipts brought to
tax and the fact that, cash payments are originate from these receipts no
disallowance is called for as the payments are also not brought to the books
as detected hence, appellant also not given the benefit of claiming the
expenses against the receipts since the expenses invariably calls for a
disallowance u/s.40A(3) and 40a(ia) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_295">5.4.3. On the other hand, in the AR's written submissions dated 09.09.2019.
the AR has forcefully argued in respect of entire cash receipts based on the
loose sheets impounded during survey, which is as under.
</p>

<p id="p_296">      AO is not correct in coming to the conclusion that. on money
       is exchanged between the parties based on a loose sheet found
       in the premises of M/s.Coastal Construction.
</p>
<p id="p_297">      To sustain the addition, the AO should have conducted an
       independent inquiry about the value of the project and
       ascertain whether any under valuation is done, if so what is
       the correct value of the project.
</p><p id="p_298">                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                       Page 65 of 74</span>

            Further, the AO did not bring on record any evidence to
             support her contention to say that there is on-money
             exchanged between the parties. In the absence of proper
             inquiry and sufficient evidences, there is no reason to confirm
             addition made by the AO towards on money.
</p>
<p id="p_299">            The AO merely acted upon the statement given by the
             appellant, which was subsequently retracted by him, It was a
             settled position of law that unless the statement is tested under
             the cross examination, the same cannot be considered as
             evidence against the assessee.
</p>
<p id="p_300">            The AO used the admission made in the statement recorded
             under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_25">section 132(4)</a> of the Act. But, the AO failed to note that.
             admission itself cannot be considered as conclusive evidence
             against the assessee, unless there is corroborative evidence on
             record.
</p>
<p id="p_301">            To tax any particular receipts, primary evidence is very much
             necessary and unless there is primary evidence,
             circumstantial evidence cannot be considered as conclusive
             evidence against any person to tax any particular receipts.
             Circumstantial evidence plays an important role in income
             tax proceeding. But the receipt of on money is purely a factual
             issue which cannot be decided based on circumstantial
             evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_302">   The AO without bringing on record any evidence to prove that. on money
    is exchanged between the parties, merely discussing upon the loose sheet,
    which cannot be considered as conclusive evidence against the assessee to
    bring on money to tax as undisclosed income.
</p>
<p id="p_303">                  The AO is required to bring further evidence on record to
                   show that, actual on money is exchanged between the
                   parties. but literally failed to do so.
</p>
<p id="p_304">                  The AO did not conduct any independent inquiry relating
                   to the value of the project instead, merely relied upon the
                   statement, which is not correct.
</p>
<p id="p_305">                  The AO made additions purely on assumptions and
                   presumptions.
</p>
<p id="p_306">                  The AO in the absence of any cogent evidences and
                   corroboration in support of the entries in loose sheets no
                                                         2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                  ITA No.
                                                   2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                  Page 66 of 74</span>

              adverse conclusion can be drawn against the Appellant
              on mere guess and pure suspicion.
</p>
<p id="p_307">             Further. there is no proof of origin and destination of on
              money. The AO failed to prove how the money was
              arranged and also failed to prove the deployment of
              unaccounted money by the payer by any form of evidence.
              Under these circumstances, based on paper jottings as
              conclusive evidence on money cannot be brought to tax
              as income from undisclosed sources.
</p>
<p id="p_308">5.4.4. Finally, during the appellate proceedings, the AR has produced
before me the following decisions and argued that, these decisions are
squarely applicable to appellant's case.
</p><p id="p_309">     1. Common Cause (A Registered Society) Vs. Union of India [2017] (77

</p>

<p id="p_317">5.4.5. I have considered the facts of the case and case laws as well as board
circular relied on by the AR, the ratio laid down in the said cases are
applicable to the appellant's case.
</p>
<p id="p_318">5.4.6. The AO merely acted upon on the statement given by the accountant
Mr. Makeem, which was subsequently retracted by him. It is a settled
position of law that unless the statement is tested under the cross
examination, the same cannot be considered as evidence against the
assessee. The AO also used the admission made in the statement recorded
under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_26">section 132(4)</a> of the Act. But, the assessing officer failed to note
that, admission itself cannot be considered as conclusive evidence against
the assessee, unless there is corroborative evidence on record; besides, the
appellant has in effect retracted this statement as well.
</p>
<p id="p_319">5.4.7. To tax any particular payments, primary evidence is necessary and
unless there is primary evidence, circumstantial evidence cannot be
considered as conclusive evidence against any person to tax any particular

     proceeding. The payment/receipt of on money is purely a factual issue
     which cannot be decided based on circumstantial evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_320">     5.4.8. I have considered the facts of the case and case laws as well as board
     circular relied on by the AR. The fundamental issue is that since appellant
     did not appear before the AO, therefore, the entire receipt of contract had
     to he charged to tax, in the absence of explanation by the appellant. I find
     that the basis for multiplying the figures by 100 and 1000 is not validly
     delineated. No Enquiries in this regard have been conducted. The logic for
     multiplying the figures, even those of cheques. is improper. Perhaps, this
     emanates for the statement of the accountant Shri. Makeem, in which case
     he should have been allowed to be cross examined. If it emanates from the
     statement recorded during search of the appellant, then he has in effect
     retracted it; AO as failed to explain why the retraction is inadmissible,
     specially in the face of the evidence gathered which is claimed to have
     zeros missing; but this conclusion is not based on valid gathering of
     evidence as the accountant Shri. Makeem has not been cross examined. The
     principles of natural justice have also been violated, in the sense that the
     cross examination opportunity has not been provided. Besides, receipt by
     cheque have been treated as being at par with receipt by cash without
     providing the reason thereof. Hence, there is no merit in making additions
     based merely on the verbal statement, which have since been in effect
     retracted. On the other hand, I find that, the appellant is a contractor. He
     is not the developer of the buildings himself. Even in his disclosure during
     search, he has disclosed the said "receipts", not income. Thus, the receipts
     on account of the project, even if unaccounted, are contract receipts, on
     which tax could be levied on the income, not on receipts. It would not be
     out of context to point out here that level of evidence required is
     preponderance of probabilities. Thus, based on the evidence available, the
     AO is directed to compute turnover, after deleting the accounted (cheque)
     amount from the above said amount. Income there from could be computed
     @ 8% on the said amount. Credit should be given from this income so
     computed of the income declared in the returns on account of these projects
     declared in any year, if these receipts are included therein. In the result,
     the appeal is partly allowed on this issue."
</p>
<p id="p_321">112. Now the first aspect to be decided is this as to whether extra amount was received
by this assessee or not in respect of these projects. If it is found that there was no such
receipt then there cannot be any addition but if it is found that extra receipt was there
then we have to decide the quantum of such receipts and how much is taxable out of
such extra receipts. Regarding the first aspect as to whether extra cash receipt was there
or not, we find that on pages 9 to 11 of the assessment order for A. Y. 2014 - 15 and
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                       Page 68 of 74</span>

A. Y. 2016 - 17, the AO has noted the entries found in seized material and these entries
are of cash and cheques both with dates. This is not the case of the assessee that these
cheques are not received by him. If entries in the seized material about cheque receipts
are correct then cash receipt noted on same documents should also be considered as
correct. Hence, we hold that in the facts of the present case, extra cash was in fact
received by the assessee for all these four years as alleged by the AO in all these four
years.
</p>
<p id="p_322">113.     Now the second aspect is about quantum of such receipts. The AO has worked
out the figures by multiplying the noted figures by 100 and 1000. On this aspect, this is
the finding of CIT (A) in these paras reproduced above that the basis for multiplying
the figures by 100 and 1000 is not validly delineated and he finally directed the AO to
consider such receipts as unaccounted turnover without any multiplication and to
compute unaccounted turnover based on the evidence available after deleting the
accounted cheques. In our considered opinion, the AO has been directed by CIT (A) to
consider the cash receipt entries and unaccounted cheque entries if any as it is without
multiplying it by 100 or 1000 and this finding and direction of CIT (A) has no infirmity
because for such multiplication by 100 or 1000, no valid basis is given by the AO in
the assessment order. Hence, we approve this finding of CIT (A) that unaccounted
receipt is unaccounted turnover in respect of these projects and it should be computed
by the AO by considering the entries in the seized materials about cash receipts by
taking the noted figures as it is without any multiplication and if any entry about receipt
of cheque is found as unaccounted then the amount of such cheques should also be
added in unaccounted turnover without any multiplication.
</p>
<p id="p_323">114.     Now the third aspect is about quantum of to be brought to tax in respect of such
unaccounted turnover. This is the issue no. 5 in the appeals of the revenue. Learned CIT
(A) has held that 8% of such unaccounted turnover should be considered as income and
from that, the income declared in the returns on account of these projects in respective
year should be reduced and only the balance should be brought to tax. On the second
aspect about reducing the income declared in the returns on account of these projects in
                                                              2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                       ITA No.
                                                        2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                       Page 69 of 74</span>

respective year from the income to be computed in respect of unaccounted turnover, we
find no infirmity in the order of CIT (A) and we confirm the same.
</p>
<p id="p_324">115.   Now the only aspect remains to be decided by us is about the percentage of
unaccounted turnover to be considered as income. The AO has added the whole amount
of alleged cash receipts but the CIT (A) held that only estimated income out of such
alleged cash receipts can be added. In our considered opinion, the alleged cash receipts
is unaccounted turnover only and 100% of turnover cannot be said to be income even
in respect of unaccounted turnover and hence, we hold that there is no merit in this issue
no. 5 raised by the revenue in its four appeals filed in the case of Mr. Mohammad
Ameer.
</p>
<p id="p_325">116.   Learned CIT (A) has directed the AO to compute the income @ 8% of
unaccounted turnover. Although no basis is indicated by CIT (A) for adopting 8% rate
but it appears to us that he has been guided by the provisions of section 44AD of I T
Act but the provisions of this section are applicable only in those cases, where the
annual turnover is below a specified amount. In the present case, turnover is much
higher and therefore, the rate specified in this section cannot be adopted. We find that
on page 14 of his order for A. Y. 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 both, learned CIT (A) has
noted the percentage of Net Profit declared by the assessee during A. Ys. 2011 - 12 to
2018 - 19 and that is in the range of 1.29 to 7.04 and average is 3.07 %. This is not the
case of the AO that the income declared by the assessee as per books is lower and it is
seen that no addition is made by the AO by alleging that the Net Profit declared by the
assessee in respect of accounted turnover is less. Under these facts, we feel that adopting
3% profit rate will meet the ends of justice in the facts of the present case and therefore,
we direct the AO to adopt 3% rate to compute net profit on unaccounted turnover to be
worked out by him in respect of these projects. Accordingly, Issue No. 8 to 11 in the
appeals of the assessee and issue no. 5 in the cross appeals filed by the revenue in the
case of Shree Mohammad Ameer for four assessment years i.e. A. Y. 2014 - 15 to
2017 - 18 are decided partly in favour of the assessee and the relevant grounds raised
                                                             2254 to 2264, 2457, 2334, 1630, 2356,
                                                      ITA No.
                                                       2357,2373 to 2376 &amp; 2453 to 2456/Bang/2019

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                      Page 70 of 74</span>

by the assessee are partly allowed and all grounds raised by the revenue in these four
appeals are dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_326">117. Now we find that all 11 issues in the appeals of the assessee as noted in para 2
above are decided and out of 5 issues involved in the appeals of the revenue, three issues
i.e. Issue No. 2, 3 and 5 are also decided and we have to decide now Issue No. 1 and 4
in the appeals of the revenue as noted in Para 3 above. First, we take up the issue No. 1
as noted in Para 3 above and this issue is raised by the revenue in the case of Shree
Walter Noronha for A. Y. 2015 - 16 in ITA No. 1630/Bang/2019 and this is about
deletion of addition made by the AO of Rs. 183 lacs added by the AO under <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_27">section
69A</a>. On this issue, learned DR of the revenue supported the order of AO and written
submissions are also filed by as reproduced above and learned AR of the assessee
supported the order of CIT (A)

</p><p id="p_327">118. We have considered the rival submissions and we find that Para 6.7 of the order
of CIT (A) in this case is relevant and hence, we reproduce the same for ready reference
as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">     "6.7 I have considered the facts of the case and case laws as well

     in para supra. Considering all the aspects, I hold that, retraction
     cannot be countered unless there are other supportive evidence. I
     find that no serious effort has been made to trace the persons named

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">119.     We find that in the above para, a categorical finding is given by the learned CIT
(A) that no serious effort has been made by the AO to trace the persons named in the
loose paper beyond merely asking the assessee to provide the address. This is also a
finding of CIT (A) that the details written on the loose sheet have not been properly
deciphered. He ultimately held that there is no merit in making addition only based on
the statement recorded during the search and loose sheets found when the statement is
retracted and details in the paper are not deciphered. These findings of learned CIT (A)
could not be controverted by learned DR of the revenue by bringing any additional
evidence on record in respect of identity and address of the persons named in loose
paper and by deciphering the loose paper. Hence the addition made by the AO is based
on the statement alone which is not sustainable as per settled position of law by now. In
the written submissions filed by the learned DR of the revenue as reproduced above,
this is the only submission that the addition was made by the AO on the basis of
statement made by the assessee u/s 132 (4). Along with these written submissions,
learned DR of the revenue has also enclosed a copy of note of 10 pages by the AO i.e.
DCIT, central circle - 1, Mangaluru along with copy of statement of the assessee u/s
132 (4). This note of the AO is mainly about retraction of the statement u/s 132 (4) by
the assessee. Now the question is as to whether addition can be made on the basis of
statement alone (even if retraction is not accepted) without bringing on record any
corroborative material on record. Learned DR of the revenue in his written submissions
or the AO in the assessment order or in the Note submitted before us through the learned
DR of the revenue has not indicated about this that the AO has brought on record any
corroborative material and hence, we decline to interfere in the order of CIT (A) on this
issue.

<p id="p_328">120. Now, we take up the remaining issue No. 4 as noted in Para 3 above and this issue
is raised by the revenue in the case of Mr. MNR for A. Y. 2016 - 17 in ITA No.

alleging that there is unexplained investment of the assessee in M/s Sai Siddhi

investment of the assessee in construction of factory premises of Kusuma Cashew. On
this issue, learned DR of the revenue supported the order of AO and learned AR of the
assessee supported the order of CIT (A).

was available with the AO to make these additions. This is a settled position of law that
any addition made only on the basis of statement of the assessee in course of search
without bringing on record any adverse cogent material to corroborate such statement,
the addition so made is not sustainable and therefore, we find no infirmity in the order
