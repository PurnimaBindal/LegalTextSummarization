(By Advocate-      Mr. S.R.K. Pratap, ACGSC)

       These applications having been heard on 10.01.2022, the Tribunal on

27.01.2022 delivered the following :

                                 ORDER

<p id="p_1">Per : Mr. P. MADHAVAN, JUDICIAL MEMBER -

in both cases.

<p id="p_5">
</p><p id="p_6">3.     The applicant has filed OA No. 180-517-2021 seeking the following

reliefs:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            -3-</span><p id="p_7">

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      (iv)   Pass such other orders or directions as deemed just fit and

</blockquote>

<p id="p_8">4.    The applicant in this case is working as Assistant Accounts Officer,

Group-B Gazetted in the Area Accounts Office (Navy), Kochi. The applicant

in this case is transferred from Cochin to Mumbai as per Annexure A1 order

dated 30.8.2021. Even though she had given representation to the competent

authority it was not considered. The applicant immediately approached this

Tribunal and filed OA No. 433 of 2021 seeking stay of the transfer order and

this Tribunal considering the pendency of the representation directed the

competent authority to consider the said representation in the light of

relevant rules and regulations and pass a speaking order and also ordered

that till that time the applicant will be permitted to continue in the same

station. The respondents, thereafter, considered the representation and

passed Annexure A14 order rejecting the representation of the applicant. As

per the impugned order, the transfer was made on administrative grounds

and it is exempted from the transfer policy. Aggrieved by the above order the

applicant came up with the present OA seeking the above reliefs.



</p><p id="p_9">5.    The case of the applicants is that they have commenced their service

as Lower Division Clerk and thereafter they were transferred to the

Controller General of Defence Accounts and applicant in OA No. 180-517-

2021 was posted at Bangalore on 19.7.2002. The applicant in OA No. 180-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       -4-</span>

516-2021 was posted at Coimbatore. Thereafter, the applicant in OA No.

180-517-2021 was promoted as Auditor in the year 2005 and Senior Auditor

in the year 2009. In the mean while the applicant was transferred and posted

to Kochi in the year 2007. The applicant in OA No. 180-516-2021 was also

promoted as Auditor in the year 2009 and transferred to Wellington and

thereafter to the Zonal Office at Kochi in the year 2013. Subsequently, the

applicant was transferred to the office of AO, GE, Fort Kochi where she

continued till 2014. In the meanwhile the applicant was also promoted as

Senior Auditor with Grade Pay of Rs. 4,200/- and she was also promoted as

Assistant Accounts Officer. Now both the applicants are working in the same

office as Assistant Accounts Officer, Group-B Gazetted. According to the

applicants while they were continuing as Assistant Accounts Officers they

were suddenly transferred to Mumbai by an arbitrary order Annexure A1.

According to them the said order was against the transfer policy issued by

the respondents. It is arbitrary and violative of constitutional guarantees

enshrined in Articles 14 &amp; 16 of the Constitution. Annexure A1 transfer

order is issued against the policy issued by the 2nd respondent. According to

the applicants there is no public interest or exigencies in service or

administrative interest warranting the transfer of the applicants at this

juncture. The transfer of the applicants is opposed to Annexures A2 to A4

and hence is liable to be set aside. The transfer of the applicants is not based

on the recommendations of the Defence Accounts Placement Board (DAPB)

and hence, it is liable to be set aside. According to the applicants the 5th

respondent herein is not the competent authority for issuing the transfer

order. The transfer orders issued in these cases is against the protection given

to the lady employees and against the policy of the Government that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                      -5-</span>

husband and wife should be placed in the same station. The transfer of the

applicants during the middle of the academic year is also against the

declared policy of the Government. The daughter of the applicant in OA No.

180-517-2021 is studying in 10th standard and the son of the applicant in OA

No. 180-516-2021 is studying in 10th standard and transfer at this juncture

will put many difficulties to the applicants as it is in the middle of the

academic year. They seek to quash Annexure A1 order to the extent it

applies to the applicants&#x27; herein.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.    The respondents filed a detailed reply statement denying the

allegations made in the OA. According to them the applicants are working as

Group-B Gazetted offices under the 3rd respondent. The Defence Accounts

Department have offices located throughout the country to cater the needs of

all elements of Indian Defence Service. The applicants being Group-B

Gazetted officers are working in defence related offices doing the

establishment work of the defence officials. The applicants have all India

transfer liability and bound to work anywhere where the Defence Accounts

Offices are situated. The respondents submitted that the transfer was effected

by the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Navy) in public interest

when faced with administrative exigency due to deficiency caused in

Mumbai office by promotion of Assistant Accounts Officer to the post of

Accounts Officer. It is only because of that persons like the applicants who

are senior were transferred to Mumbai. According to the respondents the

transfer of the applicants was recommended by the DAPB vide minutes on

26.8.2021 and approved by the competent authority on 30.8.2021. The

Controller General of Defence Accounts as per order dated 7.9.2015 has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                               -6-</span>

       decentralized the centrally controlled status of Kerala for transfer/posting of

       officials up to the level of Assistant Accounts Officer. Besides the applicants,

       two others from Vishakapatanam were also transferred to Mumbai as per

       Annexure A1 order and those two persons have already joined the Mumbai

       office. There is nothing arbitrary or discriminatory in the orders passed in

       this case by the respondents. The respondents have also given the details of

       the strength of Assistant Accounts Officers at Mumbai, Vishakapatanam and

       Kochi as under:
</p>
<p id="p_12">Posting regarding strength in the level of AAOs under PCDA(N) in tabulated below

Kochi

       The total authorized strength in Mumbai office is 75 whereas the present

       strength is only 47. Therefore, there exists a deficiency of 28 persons in

       Mumbai office as on 16.8.2021. The deficiency in Mumbai office is 48%

       and in order to make up the shortage of Assistant Accounts Officers in main

       office, the transfers became inevitable. The Cochin office had 13 Assistant

       Accounts Officers whereas the authorized strength is only 8. So there exists

       excess of 5 persons at Kochi. It is because of that two senior persons were

       transferred to Mumbai. The applicant in OA No. 180-517-2021 is the senior

       most at Cochin station. She was working in Cochin since 2007 onwards. The

       applicants are working in Cochin station for more than ten years and

       therefore, there is no arbitrariness or discrimination made against them due

       to transfer. The transfer policy as such is not applicable to transfers on

       administrative ground which is specifically made clear in the transfer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      -7-</span>

guidelines itself. Annexure A1 is issued by the Senior Accounts Officer by

virtue of the directions issued by the competent authority. The applicants are

expected to be aware of the delegation of powers of PCDA (Navy) as

regards transfer of persons are concerned. There is no merit in the case put

forward by the applicants.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">7.    We have perused the pleadings and various documents produced in

these cases. We have also heard Mr. T.C. Govindaswamy learned counsel

appearing for both the applicants and Mr. S.R.K. Prathap, ACGSC learned

counsel appearing for the respondents in both the matters. The counsel for

applicant mainly contends that the alleged transfers were made in an

arbitrary manner ignoring the guidelines issued by the respondents

themselves. The applicants in this case are ladies and they have to take care

of the family. The children of applicants are studying in 10th standard and

transfer in the middle of academic years will adversely affect the applicants

family. There was no proper consideration done by DAPB as regards the

transfer of the applicants. He had invited our attention to an earlier case

decided by this Tribunal in <a href="/doc/5774095/" id="a_1">Salini v. Union of India</a> ( in O.A 399/2020) and

to the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court in Mini K.T. v. Senior Division

Manager LIC, Kozhikode and Ors. ( in (2018) 1 KHC 307). The counsel

for respondents would contend that the Tribunal has only limited power to

interfere in the transfers issued by the employer in the exigencies of service.

The applicants have all India transfer liability being Group &#x27;B&#x27; Gazetted

Officers. There were continuing in Kochi for a long period and there is no

merit in the contention. He invited our attention to the decision of the

Hon&#x27;ble apex court in <a href="/doc/1850124/" id="a_2">B. Varadha Rao v. State of Karnataka and Ors</a>.( AIR
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       -8-</span>

1986 S.C 1955), <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_3">Gujarat Electricity Board &amp; Anr. V. Atmaram Sungomal

Poshani</a> (1989 AIR 1433) and <a href="/doc/1260269/" id="a_4">Shilpi Bose &amp; others v. State of Bihar &amp;

others</a> (1991 SC 532).
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">8.    The counsel for the applicants mainly challenges the orders issued as

Annexure A1 alleging that the order is arbitrary, discriminatory and contrary

to law. On a perusal of Annexure A1 order we find that two persons from

Vishakapatanam and two persons from Cochin were transferred to Mumbai.

Annexure A14 impugned order clearly narrates the reason for the transfer

ordered in Annexure A1. According to the respondents the applicants are

liable for all India transfer and the transfer order of the applicants was issued

on administrative grounds and in the overall organizational interest for

smooth functioning and also keeping in view the willingness of the Assistant

Accounts Officer to be transferred out of Cochin. Prima facie we cannot find

any arbitrariness or illegality in Annexures A1 or A14 orders issued by the

respondents. It has come out from the pleadings that the respondent

Department has offices at various places and the applicants were transferred

to the main office where there has occurred serious deficiencies in the

number of Assistant Accounts Officers. As per the statement filed by the

respondents, the main office of the respondents is having an authorized

strength of 75 Assistant Accounts Officers but there existed only 47 persons.

There had occurred promotions for the Assistant Accounts Officers and 8

persons were promoted. It is only because of shortage of Assistant Accounts

Officers that persons from Vishakapatanam and Cochin were transferred to

Mumbai. This clearly shows the administrative exigency faced by the

respondents and the urgency in issuing the transfer order. The transfer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                          -9-</span>

guidelines produced as Annexure A3 clearly shows in its first paragraph

itself as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      &quot;1.1   ................Transfers ordered in administrative/disciplinary or
      compassionate grounds and that of new recruits will be outside the
      purview of the transfer policy.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_17">So this clearly shows that as per the guidelines the employer is entitled to

transfer an employee if there exists administrative exigency. According to

the respondents the transfers are ordered only because of the shortage of

Assistant Accounts Officers at Mumbai which is the main office of the

respondents and hence they were compelled to transfer persons from where

there exists excess numbers of Assistant Accounts Officers. On going

through the reply and guidelines issued in these cases we find that there is no

arbitrariness or illegality seen in the order issued as Annexure A1. There is

also no merit in the contention that there is no public interest or service

exigency warranting the applicants&#x27; transfer at this juncture.



</p><p id="p_18">9.    Another contention put forward by the applicants is that the above

transfer was not based on the recommendations of the DAPB and approved

by the competent authority. It is also contended that the 5th respondent is not

the competent authority to transfer the applicants. He is neither the cadre

controlling authority nor the authority to whom powers to transfer a Group-

B Gazetted officer has been delegated. The counsel for the applicants has

produced an earlier order of this Tribunal in OA No. 180-399-2020 in

support of his case and argues that the proceedings of the DAPB is not

satisfactory as it does not contain the details of deliberations which took

place in the DAPB.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                      -10-</span><p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">10.   The main allegation in the OA is that the transfer was not at all

recommended by the DAPB. The respondents had produced Annexure R(b)

which clearly shows that the DAPB has considered the transfer of applicants

as well as of others in the meeting conducted on 26.8.2021 at 4 PM and

thereafter they had recommended to transfer the applicants in the present OA

along with the Assistant Accounts Officers from Vishakapatanam. Now the

contention raised by the applicants is that the details of the deliberations of

the DAPB are not available in the minutes produced before this Tribunal.

The counsel mainly relies upon the earlier order of this Tribunal in <a href="/doc/133875280/" id="a_5">A.K.

Salini v. Union of India - OA No</a>. 399 of 2020 dated 26th November, 2020.

That was a case where the applicant was promoted and posted at

Mangalapuram and it was not a case on administrative exigency as claimed

by the respondents in these cases. In A.K. Salini&#x27;s case (supra) the posting

was due to promotion and placement committee recommended the transfer

on promotion. But it was found that the placement committee has not

actually conducted the meeting and not considered the facts relevant to the

persons involved in that case it was directed by circulation of file. Even the

respondents have admitted that the placement committee deliberations were

done by circulating the file. It was in that circumstances this Tribunal

observed that there was no proper consideration of case of the applicant by

the placement committee and the transfer promoting the applicant was set

aside. In this case, DAPB had considered the case in a properly conducted

meeting on 26.08.2021 at 04:00 pm and the minutes of the same is produced

on Annexure R(b). The applicant has no case that the DAPB had not

considered the case of applicants deliberately with malafides in their

pleadings. In the absence of such a pleading it has to be presumed that they
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                          -11-</span>

had considered all aspects and came to such a conclusion. So we find that

the case <a href="/doc/133875280/" id="a_6">A.K. Salini v. U.O.I &amp; Others</a> has no direct application in this case.



</p><p id="p_21">11.   Another contention put forward by the counsel for the applicant is that

the transfer order was issued by the 5th respondent and he is not the

competent authority to issue transfer order. The respondents in their reply

statement had clearly stated that Annexure A1 was issued by the Senior

Accounts Officer. But according to them the authority to transfer the

Assistant Accounts Officer has been delegated to the Principal Controller of

Defence Accounts as per order dated 28.3.2014 and transfers were

recommended by the DAPB which was approved by the competent authority

i.e. the PCDA and the same was communicated to the applicants by

Annexure A1 by the Senior Accounts Officer. There is nothing illegal in this

case as the PCDA is the competent authority. Therefore, there is no merit in

the arguments raised by the counsel for the applicants that Annexure A1 was

issued without having appropriate authority. The counsel for the respondents

had invited our attention to the following decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

Court in the matter of transfer:-
</p>
<p id="p_22">a)    <a href="/doc/1850124/" id="a_7">In B. Varadha Rao v. State Of Karnataka And Ors</a>. - AIR 1986 SC

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">             &quot;It is well understood that transfer of a Government servant who is
             appointed to a particular cadre of transferable posts from one

             does not result in any alteration of any of the conditions of service
             to his disadvantage. That a Government servant is liable to be
             transferred to a similar post in the same cadre is a normal feature
             and incident of Government service and no Government servant
             can claim to remain in a particular place or in a particular post

Poshani</a> - 1989 AIR 1433 the Hon&#x27;ble apex court held as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">      &quot;Transfer of a Government servant appointed to a particular cadre
      of transferable posts from one place to the other is an incident of
      service. No Government servant or employee of Public
      Undertaking has legal tight for being posted at any particular
      place. Transfer from one place to other is generally a condition of
      service and the employee has no choice in the matter. Transfer from
      one place to other is necessary in public interest and efficiency in
      the Public administration. Whenever, a public servant is transferred
      he must comply with the order but if there be any genuine difficulty
      in proceeding on transfer it is open to him to make representation
      to the competent authority for stay, modification or cancellation of
      the transfer order. If the order of transfer is not stayed, modified or
      cancelled the concerned public servant must carry out the order of
      transfer. In the absence of any stay of the transfer order a public
      servant has no justification to avoid or evade the transfer order
      merely on the ground of having made a representation, or on the
      ground of his difficulty in moving from one place to the other. If he
      fails to proceed on transfer in compliance to the transfer order, he
      would expose himself to disciplinary action under the relevant
      Rules, as has happened in the instant case. The respondent lost his
      service as he refused to comply with the order of his transfer from
      one place to the other.&quot;

      malafide. A Government servant holding a transferable post has no
      vested right to remain posted at one place or the other, he is liable
      to be transferred from one place to the other. Transfer Orders
      issued by the competent authority do not violate any of his legal
      rights. Even if a transfer Order is passed in violation of executive
      instructions or Orders, the Courts ordinarily should not interfere
      with the Order instead affected party should approach the higher
      authorities in the Department. If the Courts continue to interfere
      with day-to-day transfer Orders issued by the Government and its
      subordinate authorities, there will be complete chaos in the
      Administration which would not be conducive to public interest.
      The High Court over looked these aspects in interfering with the
      transfer Orders.&quot;

<p id="p_26">d)    <a href="/doc/146531721/" id="a_10">In State of UP &amp; Ors. v. Gobardhan Lal</a> - (2004) 11 SCC 402

the Hon&#x27;ble apex court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      &quot;7.     It is too late in the day for any Government Servant to
      contend that once appointed or posted in a particular place or
      position, he should continue in such place or position as long as he
      desires. Transfer of an employee is not only an incident inherent in
      the terms of appointment but also implicit as an essential condition
      of service in the absence of any specific indication to the contra, in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                          -13-</span>

            the law governing or conditions of service. Unless the order of
            transfer is shown to be an outcome of a mala fide exercise of power
            or violative of any statutory provision (an Act or Rule) or passed by
            an authority not competent to do so, an order of transfer cannot
            lightly be interfered with as a matter of course or routine for any or
            every type of grievance sought to be made. Even administrative
            guidelines for regulating transfers or containing transfer policies
            at best may afford an opportunity to the officer or servant
            concerned to approach their higher authorities for redress but
            cannot have the consequence of depriving or denying the
            competent authority to transfer a particular officer/servant to any
            place in public interest and as is found necessitated by exigencies
            of service as long as the official status is not affected adversely and
            there is no infraction of any career prospects such as seniority,
            scale of pay and secured emoluments. This Court has often
            reiterated that the order of transfer made even in transgression of
            administrative guidelines cannot also be interfered with, as they do
            not confer any legally enforceable rights, unless, as noticed supra,
            shown to be vitiated by mala fides or is made in violation of any
            statutory provision.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">            8.      A challenge to an order of transfer should normally be
            eschewed and should not be countenanced by the Courts or
            Tribunals as though they are Appellate Authorities over such
            orders, which could assess the niceties of the administrative needs
            and requirements of the situation concerned. This is for the reason
            that Courts or Tribunals cannot substitute their own decisions in
            the matter of transfer for that of competent authorities of the State
            and even allegations of mala fides when made must be such as to
            inspire confidence in the Court or are based on concrete materials
            and ought not to be entertained on the mere making of it or on
            consideration borne out of conjectures or surmises and except for
            strong and convincing reasons, no interference could ordinarily be
            made with an order of transfer.&quot;

arbitrary or found to be malafide.
