CAV JUDGMENT

(Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SHIVA KIRTI SINGH)


                           Since both the Letters Patent Appeals arise

              out of the same judgement dated 4-5-2011 allowing

              CWJC no. 8141/2010, they have been heard together
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                    3</span>




and are being disposed of by this common judgment.

</p><p id="p_19">          2. The main dispute is on account of

appointment of appellant Subhash Prasad Sinha and

appellant Arvind Kumar on the post of Vice Chancellor

of Veer Kunwar Singh University, Ara and Magadh

University, Bodh Gaya vide orders of appointment

dated 9-4-2010 and 15-4-2010 respectively which have

been issued by the Principal Secretary to the Governor-

cum- Chancellor under the orders of the Chancellor, the

appointing authority u/s 10 (2) of the Bihar State

Universities Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as the

"Act"). The real controversy between the parties is

whether it is necessary or mandatory for the Chancellor

to appoint Vice Chancellor in consultation with the

State Government         and whether there was such a

consultation as provided u/s 10 (2) of the Act for

appointing the appellants as Vice Chancellors. The writ

court has held that the requirement of consultation is

mandatory    and       there   was   no   consultation   for

appointment of the appellants and, hence, their

appointments are fit to be quashed as void ab initio.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                       4</span>




</p><p id="p_20">             3.   Since the main controversy and vital

issues relate to Sub-section (1) and (2) of Section 10 of

the Act, it will be useful to extract the same for easy

reference.
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">             "10. The Vice Chancellor.- (1) No person
             shall be deemed to be qualified to hold the

             reputed for his scholarship and academic

</p><p id="p_22">             4.      Before adverting to the detailed

arguments advanced on behalf of appellants and the

respondents, the relevant facts may be noticed in brief.

</p><p id="p_23">             5.     The writ petition was filed on 6-5-2010

by two respondents herein, Dr. Pramod Kumar Singh

and Dr. Ram Tawakiya Singh, both University
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                   5</span>




Teachers under Veer Kunwar Singh University, Ara.

They prayed for cancellation of appointments of both

the appellants on the post of Vice Chancellor and also

for cancelling similar other appointments, if any, in the

Universities of Bihar on the allegation that they were

illegal appointments. They prayed to make fresh

appointments of genuine and reputed scholars in the

various Universities of Bihar on the basis of

recommendation of the State Government after

considering the inter-se merit of all the applicants. They

also prayed for directing the respondents to ensure that

all appointments on the post of University officers, that

is, Inspector of Colleges, Registrar etc. are also made in

compliance of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_1">Article 16</a> of the Constitution of India

after inviting applications from eligible candidates and

then selecting the best. According to writ petitioners the

merit for the post of Vice Chancellors and other

University Officers should be reckoned on the basis of

"published work" (books/ research papers). The main

point raised on behalf of writ petitioners was whether

the appointments made are illegal and against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                    6</span>




provisions of sub section (2) of Section 10 of the Act.

</p><p id="p_24">           6.    The writ petitioners claimed to be

aspirants for the post of Vice Chancellors and that they

had submitted application/ bio data for that purpose

before the concerned authorities of the State of Bihar as

well as the Chancellor of Universities. According to

them the appellants were illegal appointees and did not

deserve the post. Originally, the appellants were

impleaded in their official capacity by their designation

but later, after obtaining the orders of the Court they

were impleaded by name in their personal capacity.

Both the appellants claimed to be reputed scholars and

men of academic interest. Appellant Subhash Prasad

Sinha has claimed that he had also submitted his bio

data to the Minister, Human Resources Development

Department, Government of Bihar as well as to the

Chancellor and that his name was included in the panel

prepared    by    the   Minister,    Human     Resources

Development Department on        15-1-2010 and the panel

was sent to the Chief Minister, Bihar on 19-1-2010

where it remained pending till      14-4-2010. This stand
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                   7</span>




is supported by relevant letters and notes in the

connected files which have been brought on record as

annexures. While, admittedly, the panel or the names

which the State Government or the concerned Minister

wanted to be considered during consultation for filling

up the posts of Vice Chancellors in various Universities

of Bihar remained pending for approval of the Chief

Minister till 14-4-2010, a meeting between the

Governor and the Minister took place on 29-3-2010.

The agenda of that meeting is available on record and

has been extracted by the writ court at pages 20 and 21

of the judgement under appeal. It shows that the

relevant file related to a Bill for constitution of a

Tribunal for settling certain disputes and conflicts

among the employees and teachers of Universities and

Colleges. The Bill had been resent to the Governor for

considering the views of the government. On the

margin of the pages of relevant file bearing file no.

Act- 01/ 10 which had been called by the writ court for

perusal, the Governor/ Chancellor has recorded his

minutes in hand on 29-3-2010 at 7.30 PM. The typed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                      8</span>




copy of this minutes signed by the Governor, Bihar is

extracted as page 22 of the judgement under appeal.

These have been noticed because the learned counsels

for appellants, the Universities and for the Chancellor

have relied heavily upon the minutes in support of their

case that there was a consultation between the State

Government and the Chancellor as required by Section

10 (2) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_25">          7.   After appointment of Vice Chancellor of

Veer Kunwar Singh University, Ara on 9-4-2010, the

Chief Minister, Bihar made a query on the file relating

to panel of names under preparation for consultation, as

to who had been consulted in relation to the said

appointment. In reply, the Minister, Human Resources

Development Department gave a note on 19-4-2010

that the department had long back requested the

Chancellor to initiate the process but no consultation in

the light of the Act had taken place at any level of his

department and the Chancellor. The Minister in his

notes categorically mentioned that for filling up the

vacant posts of Vice Chancellors in the Universities of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                   9</span>




Bihar no talks had taken place between him and the

Chancellor. On the same date the Secretary of Human

Resources Development department issued an order

mentioning the fact that the Vice Chancellors of

Magadh University, Bodh Gaya and Veer Kunwar

Singh University, Ara had been appointed without

consultation as envisaged under the Act and, therefore,

the State Government was considering the validity/

procedural deficiency of the said appointments and the

issue   was   under    consideration.   Pending    such

consideration and till final view could be taken by the

State Government the two Vice Chancellors were not

to exercise any financial powers and they were not to

take any decision having any financial implications. On

26-4-2010 the Secretary issued another order reiterating

the earlier order and it was clarified that financial

decision shall be taken by the pro Vice Chancellors.

Payment of salary of both the newly appointed Vice

Chancellors was also ordered to be stopped.

</p><p id="p_26">          8. The relevant notings on the file show that

the Chancellor's office stuck to its stand that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                   10</span>




consultation had already taken place and there was no

need for reconsideration. For sending appropriate reply,

the Secretary of the department on 8-6-2010 placed the

matter before the Minister who in his note dated

9-6-2010 wrote that on 29-3-2010 discussion between

him and the Chancellor was confined to constitution of

University Tribunal and no talks had taken place for

filling up the vacancies for the vacant posts of Vice

Chancellors and pro Vice Chancellors.

</p><p id="p_27">          9.   Thereafter the Chief Minister met the

Chancellor on 10-6-2010 to ascertain the views of the

latter in respect of the appointments in question and

then on 12-6-2010 he recorded his minutes that the

Chancellor informed him that he had talked with the

Minister, Human Resources Development department

in respect of appointment of the two Vice Chancellors

although the Minister had informed the Chief Minister

differently and had also written in the file that he had

no talks with the Chancellor with respect to the related

matter. The Chief Minister further recorded that

considering the manner in which the Governor had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                   11</span>




described his talks with the Minister, there could be no

justification for keeping the matter alive and it would

be a proper step to accept the decision taken by the

Governor as Chancellor. This note has been subject of

rival interpretations and contentions and, hence, it will

be considered further while dealing with the detailed

submission of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_28">          10. In view of stand of the Chief Minister,

the letters issued by the Secretary, Human Resources

Development     department     dated   19-4-2010     and

26-4-2010 were withdrawn by order of the Principal

Secretary of that department on 13-6-2010. On the

basis of minutes of the Chief Minister and the letter

dated 13-6-2010 the appellants have seriously raised

another issue. According to them the Chief Minister's

views amount to an acceptance that there was a

consultation   earlier   on   29-3-2010   between    the

Chancellor and the Minister and in that view of the

matter the writ court had no occasion to decide the

issue any further because, according to appellants, the

lis came to an end. In the alternative, it was contended
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                      12</span>




that the talks between the Chief Minister and Governor

itself amounted to subsequent consultation and that

would cure the defect of consultation, if any. This

contention would also be considered later at appropriate

stage.
</p>
<p id="p_29">          11. The issues, as per their significance may

be noted in the following sequence:- (1). Whether the

consultation required u/s 10 (2) of the Act is directory

or mandatory, (2) Whether there was consultation

between the Chancellor and the State Government for

appointing the appellants as Vice Chancellors and (3)

whether the minutes of the Chief Minister dated

12-6-2010 would be conclusive for determining as to

whether the consultation required by law took place or

not or whether it shows fresh consultation so as to cure

the defect of lack of consultation, if any. Some other

ancillary issues were raised by the parties relating to the

aforesaid issues and they will be discussed at

appropriate stage.
</p>
<p id="p_30">            Issue No.1: Whether consultation u/s

10(2) of the Act is mandatory or directory-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                  13</span>




</p><p id="p_31">          12.   The stand of the appellants is that

although sub section (2) of Section 10 uses the word

"shall", it does not make the requirement of

consultation with the State Government in the matter of

appointment of Vice Chancellors mandatory for the

following reasons:-
</p>
<p id="p_32">  (i)     Under Section 10 (1), the Chancellor has

         been named as the sole authority for deciding

         who shall be deemed qualified to hold the

         post of Vice Chancellor,

</p><p id="p_33">(ii)      Under sub section (2) of Section 10 the

          Chancellor    has   been   made    the   sole

          appointing authority,

</p><p id="p_34">(iii)     The Act itself is self contained code wherein

          the University with Chancellor as its head

          has been created as an autonomous body.

          The State Government has been assigned a

          limited role in financial or budgetary matters

          including the matter of creation of teaching

          or non teaching posts. Although consultation

          with the State Government is required in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                  14</span>




          matter of appointment and removal of Vice

          Chancellors as well as in appointment of Pro

          Vice Chancellors, the Act grants primacy to

          the Chancellor and only his decision is

          important and binding.
</p>
<p id="p_35">(iv)      The Act does not lay down any consequence

          of non compliance with the requirement of

          consultation.
</p>
<p id="p_36">              Learned     counsels   for   the    two

Universities have adopted the aforesaid stand of the

appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_37">         13. Learned counsels appearing for the writ

        petitioners and learned AAG 1 appearing for

        the State, however, have taken a contrary

        stand. According to them the provision for

        consultation is mandatory because;- (1) The

        word "shall" generally as well as by its

        ordinary grammatical meaning       renders the

        required action mandatory,

  (2) There is no suitable or good reason why the

        ordinary grammatical meaning of the word
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                 15</span>




      "shall" should be replaced by reading it as

      "may",

(3) The words used, nature, context and object of

      the provision in Section 10 (2) make the

      requirement of consultation mandatory,

(4) The old Acts, that is, the Bihar State Universities

      (Bihar, Bhagalpur, Ranchi University) Act,

      1960, the Magadh University Act of 1961 and

      other    Acts    also   relating   to   different

      Universities which have been replaced by the

      Act of 1976 vested the power of appointment

      of Vice Chancellors in the Chancellor of the

      Universities    without any requirement       of

      consultation with the State Government. The

      Legislature, on account of experience, in its

      wisdom has now introduced the requirement of

      consultation under the Act as well as in the

      Patna University Act, 1976. Such deliberate

      introduction indicates that the consultation has

      been given clear importance and significance.

      It takes care of mischief or perceived mischief
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                   16</span>




        in the earlier Acts and, hence, must be treated

        to be mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_38">           14. Various judgements cited by the parties

on this issue show that there is no conflict of opinion so

far as general principles are concerned. The relevant

judgments cited for explaining the concept of Mandatory

and   Directory provisions     or   treating   "shall"   as

Mandatory are:- 1.(2009)7SCC 1 <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_2">N.Kannadasan V. Ajoy

cited on behalf of appellants in support of the proposition

that provision for consultation should not be treated as

mandatory have been dealt with separately hereinafter.

in support of the proposition that if the statutory

provision uses the word "shall" while prescribing a

procedure for appointment or for doing of any other

important work then such provision should be

considered as mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_40">          15. From the general principles it follows

that for forming a definite opinion as to whether a

particular provision such as one for "consultation" is

mandatory or not, the words of the Statute, the nature

of concerned duty and responsibility, the context in

which the provision appears and its object have to be

kept in mind. If the consultation is prior or it is to

secure a fair procedure and its disregard may affect

fundamental rights, the requirement of consultation is

mandatory. It is also mandatory where the advice or

opinion binds the authority who is to propose for

consultation to seek opinion or advice. However, if the

opinion or advice is not binding, the proposer after

seeking the opinion or advice by way of consultation

may take a contrary decision and in that eventuality,

the decision may not be illegal or void. It is also well

recognized in law that if a Statute lays down the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                   18</span>




manner of doing something, it must be done in that

manner or not at all.
</p>
<p id="p_41">           16. The mischief rule is well known as one

of the principles of interpretation. If the Legislature

changes the earlier law by providing safeguard like

consultation with another authority, clearly a mischief or

likely mischief in the estimate of the Legislature is

sought to be remedied. Such provisions introduced by

way of remedy cannot be easily disregarded as trivial or

unimportant and, hence, they are generally treated as

mandatory. In this context learned AAG 1 has relied

upon the following three judgements of the Supreme

Court:- 1. (1992) 4 SCC 80 <a href="/doc/710706/" id="a_8">Mohan Lal Tripathi V.

District Magistrate, Rai Bareilly</a>, 2. AIR 1974 SC 1708,

R.B.M.B Mills V. Govind Ram Bros. and 3. (1988) 4

SCC 108 <a href="/doc/886958/" id="a_9">Jayawant S. Kulkarni V. Minochar D. Shroff</a>.

These judgements support the aforesaid proposition put

forward on behalf of the State.
</p>
<p id="p_42">          17. The Universities under the Act are

autonomous bodies and the Act is a complete code in

which the Chancellor enjoys unique primacy having
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                   19</span>




administrative as well as adjudicatory roles. The

purpose of making the Universities autonomous and

free from day to day control of the State Government is

quite understandable. Day to day control and care of

higher education has been kept insulated and free from

political expediency and compulsions. The role of Vice

Chancellor is that of Chief Executive Officer of the

University. The Chancellor is superior but his powers

are generally supervisory. He grants approval to the

Regulations and Statutes framed by the bodies of the

Universities, reviews decisions where grievances are

brought to him by the teachers or other employees and

issues   necessary     directions   wherever     deemed

necessary. The Governor of the State is the ex-officio

Chancellor of the Universities. The Governor of a State

is head of the executive of the State and in all normal

situations he is required to act on the aid and advice of

the State Government. Any citizen of India who has

completed 35 years of age is eligible for appointment

as Governor. On the other hand the Vice Chancellor is

a whole time officer who has to take care of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                   20</span>




Academics, run the day to day affairs of the University

as well as plan its development. Hence, he is required

to be a person "reputed for his scholarship and

academic interest". The search for a suitable person to

head a University as its whole time officer, in the

context of the Act as well as Section 10 of the Act, is a

task of utmost significance and importance. That

appears to be the reason why need for consultation

with the State Government was introduced in the Act.

On applying well accepted canons of interpretation of

law including the Mischief Rule, and on consideration

of the words used, the nature of the Statute and context

relating to consultation and its object, the requirement

of consultation u/s 10 (2) of the Act has to be held as

mandatory.
</p>
<p id="p_43">           18. The word "shall" is only indicative. The

need of consultation is between two constitutional

authorities, one is the Chancellor whose role has been

noticed above and the other is the State Government

which has a high stake in ensuring that standard of

higher education in the State is maintained and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                     21</span>




hundreds of crores of rupees allocated to the

Universities    every      year   are   well   utilized   by

appointment of suitable persons who are not only

reputed for their scholarship and academic interest but

can   also     be   good     administrators,   capable    of

safeguarding the finances and interests of the

Universities. The Governor as Chancellor does not

have the elaborate requisite machinery to enable him to

form the appropriate opinion for appointing persons as

Vice Chancellors and this is adequately taken care of

by providing consultation with the State Government.

The nature of duty of both the Constitutional

authorities in this context is to promote public interest

and interest of higher education by selecting and

appointing best persons available out of eligible

candidates. To achieve this object the stipulated

consultation has to be effective. It is not only desirable

but clearly a must, before selection and appointment.

</p><p id="p_44">             19. Though the judgement of the Supreme

Court in the case of Indian Administrative Service

(S.C.S.) <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_10">Association vs. Union of India</a> (1993 )1 Supp.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                   22</span>




SCC 731 has been cited on behalf of the appellants, a

careful perusal shows that the settled principles as to

what shall constitute consultation and when it is

mandatory do not support the case of the appellants.

The judgement approves that prior consultation is

mandatory and more so if its violation would affect

fundamental rights or fair procedure. In the present

case, the dispute whether opinion or advice of the State

Government will bind the Chancellor or not is not at

all in issue. The controversy is in respect of earlier

stage- as to whether the State Government should have

adequate opportunity to give its opinion or advice in

respect of the appointees. The procedure and details as

to who shall be taken into consideration on account of

eligibility and who shall be selected out of eligible

persons has rightly not been prescribed by the Act

because the appointment and consultation process has

been left in the       hand of high Constitutional

functionaries. Nonetheless, like any selection process it

must be fair. Consultation with the State Government

has been introduced by the Legislature with the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                    23</span>




obvious aim of making the selection procedure wider

in ambit, deeper in contents, transparent and fair. The

State Government has the means to render intensive

and extensive information and input in course of

consultation. The consultation in such important matter

and at such high level needs to be effective so that after

the   Chancellor    has   made    tentative   choice   on

considering the entire information and input given by

the State Government, the latter may provide further

relevant information, if available, in respect of

tentatively selected persons, in order to avoid the risk

of Universities being placed in the hands of wrong

persons or unsuitable persons.
</p>
<p id="p_45">          20. The judgement of the Supreme Court in

the case of Administrator, Municipal Committee,

Charkhi Dadri and another Vs Ramjilal Bagla and

others (1995) 5 SCC 272 was cited for the well known

proposition of law that the word "shall" is not

determinative and even where this word is used by the

Legislature, generally the provision is treated as

directory if consequence of disregard of the provision
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                   24</span>




is not provided. This proposition is not absolute and is

only one of the known tests for deciding whether a

provision is mandatory or directory.
</p>
<p id="p_46">          21. In the leading case of <a href="/doc/138715291/" id="a_11">State of U. P. vs.

matter of penal action against a public servant in

accordance with <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_12">Article 311</a> of Constitution of India, it

was held that use of the word "shall" in <a href="/doc/1634786/" id="a_13">Article 320(3)</a>

did not make consultation with the Union Public

Service Commission in such a matter mandatory. That

Constitution Bench judgement also made it clear that

the word "shall" is generally taken in a mandatory

sense but sometimes the entire provision may not be

treated as mandatory considering the entire context

such as the effect of proviso to <a href="/doc/1634786/" id="a_14">Article 320(3)</a> of the

Constitution of India. It was subsequently explained by

another Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in

the case of Banwarilal Vs. the State of Bihar, AIR

1961 SC 849 (paragraph 16) that the relevant part of

<a href="/doc/1723820/" id="a_15">Article 320</a> was treated to be directory mainly       on

account of the contents of the proviso.

</p><p id="p_47">          22. Learned AAG 1 appearing for the State

has highlighted paragraph 6 of that judgement wherein

it was clarified that to decide whether a provision is

directory or mandatory, the Court has to decide the

Legislative   intent   in   each   case.   The   relevant

consideration should be not only the words used but

the scheme of the Statute, intended benefit to public

and the material danger to the public by the

contravention of the provision under consideration.

</p><p id="p_48">          23. Learned counsel for the Chancellor has

relied upon a judgement of the Supreme Court in the

case of State of A. P. Vs. Dr. Rahimuddin Kamal

(1997) 3 SCC 505. The facts of that case attracted the

principle laid down in the case of <a href="/doc/138715291/" id="a_16">State of U.P. vs.

Manbodhan Lal Srivastava (Supra</a>) which has already

been discussed. That judgement and other judgements

cited on behalf of appellants and the Universities do

not help the stand of the appellants. The provision for

consultation u/s 10 (2) of the Act had rightly been held

mandatory by the writ court. We find no good reasons

to take a different view.

</p><p id="p_50">           Issue        No.2:   Whether   there    was

</p><p id="p_51">          24.      On behalf of the appellants, the

Chancellor and the Universities the minutes of the

Chancellor extracted at page 22 of the judgement under

appeal was highlighted and some other circumstances

were pointed out to submit that in fact there was

consultation in respect of appointment of the appellants

as required by law. The foundation for this submission

is minutes of the Chief Minister dated 12-6-2010

available as annexure- 1/B to supplementary affidavit

in CWJC no. 8141/ 2010 which has been annexed as

annexure-3 to LPA no. 822/2011. That has already

been noticed earlier. It has been submitted that since

the meeting on 29-3-2010 between the Chancellor and

the Minister is admitted, the contents of the

consultation is not at all justiciable and it must be

presumed that there was sufficient consultation leading

to appointment of the appellants.
</p>
<p id="p_52">          25. It has further been submitted that the

orders dated 19-4-2010 and 26-4-2010 affecting the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                   27</span>




financial powers and functioning of the appellants

show that the issue of consultation was under

examination and subsequently those orders were

withdrawn by order dated 13-6-2010 issued by the

Principal Secretary of the department, hence, the

conclusion should be that the State Government was

satisfied about the consultation having taken place as

per minutes of the Chief Minister and, therefore, the

enquiry ended and the lis came to an end. It has further

been submitted that thereafter the State cannot take the

stand that there was no consultation as required by law

and the writ court should also have held accordingly.

</p><p id="p_53">          26. On the other hand learned counsels for

the writ petitioners and learned AAG 1 for the State

have taken a contrary stand. According to them, the

Chief Minister felt obliged to respect the stand of the

Chancellor but on facts he never came to a conclusion

that the stand of the Minister was factually incorrect. It

has further been submitted that the State was under

legal obligation to assist this court by placing all the

relevant facts to enable it to take a decision on the issue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                   28</span>




whether there was consultation as required u/s 10 (2) of

the Act and whether the appointment of the appellants

was in accordance with law or not. On their behalf it

was submitted that in order to decide this issue the writ

court rightly went into the question as to what amounts

to "consultation" and whether the materials on record

and, particularly, the minutes of the Chancellor amount

to consultation as understood in law. It was pointed out

that in paragraph 43 of judgement under appeal,

relevant part of judgement in the case of Union of

India Vs. Sankal chand Himatlal Sheth and another

reported in AIR 1977 SC 2328 was extracted. That part

of the judgement of the Constitution Bench of the

Supreme Court refers to several authorities and case

laws. It also noticed Supreme Court's judgement in the

case of S. P. Gupta and others Vs. President of India

and others reported in AIR 1982 SC 149. In the case

of Rollo and Anr. V. Minister of Town and Country

Planning (1948) 1 All E. R. 13 the Statute required the

Minister to consult some authorities. Bucknill J. held

that " the Minister, with receptive mind, must by such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                   29</span>




consultation seek and welcome the aid and advice

which those with local knowledge may be in a position

to proffer in regard to a plan which the Minister has

tentatively evolved". It was clarified that the Minister

must supply sufficient information in order to obtain

advice and sufficient opportunity should be given in

tendering proper advice. That would only amount to

meaningful consultation.
</p>
<p id="p_54">          27. It is worthwhile to notice the opinion of

Queen's Bench expressed by Justice Webster, J. in the

case of R Vs. Secretary of State for Social Services, ex

parte Association of Metropolitan Authorities (1986)

1 All E.R., 164. The passage extracted in paragraph 46

of the judgement of the writ court is so eloquent in

respect of general principle relating to the consultation

that it needs to be extracted again:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">               "But in any context the essence
        of consultation is the communication of
        a genuine invitation to give advice and
        a genuine consideration of that advice.
        In my view it must go without saying
        that to achieve consultation sufficient
        information must be supplied by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                    30</span>




       consulting to the consulted party to
       enable it to tender helpful advice.
       Sufficient time must be given by the
       consulting to the consulted party to
       enable it to do that, and sufficient time
       must be available for such advice to be
       considered by the consulting party.
       Sufficient, in that context, does not
       mean ample, but at least enough to
       enable the relevant purpose to be
       fulfilled. By helpful advice, in this
       context, I mean sufficiently informed
       and considered information or advice
       about aspects of the form or substance
       of the proposals, or their implications
       for the consulted party, being aspects
       material to the implementation of the
       proposal as to which the Secretary of
       State might not be fully informed or
       advised and as to which the party
       consulted        might   have      relevant
       information or advice to offer."</blockquote><p id="p_55">


</p><p id="p_56">         28. The learned writ court has also noticed

the judgement of the Supreme Court in the case of

Gauhati High Court and another Vs. Kuladhar

Phukan and another, reported in (2002) 4 SCC 524.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                   31</span>




In that case the consultation required was between the

Governor and High Court. The matter related to

subordinate judiciary. The effect of non consultation

was held to be so incurable that even an ex-post facto

approval would not cure the invalidity.

</p><p id="p_57">          29.    A perusal of the minutes of the

Governor dated 29-3-2010 shows that the agenda of

the meeting related to a Bill for constituting a Tribunal

for settlement of disputes among employees and

teachers of the Universities and Colleges. Only some

general talks took place regarding urgency of

appointing good and efficient Vice Chancellors in

Magadh University and Patna University. The only

name mentioned by the Minister was of one Dr.

Simadri for Patna University.
</p>
<p id="p_58">          30.   Since the minutes of the meeting have

been recorded by Hon'ble the Governor of Bihar

which may be taken to be that of the Chancellor, there

is no scope to presume that there was any consultation

in respect of names of eligible persons or at least the

appellants for appointment as Vice Chancellors of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                  32</span>




concerned Universities. Subsequent minutes of the

Minister is not in conflict with the minutes prepared by

the governor or the Chancellor and it is difficult to

reject the stand of the Minister that he had no

consultation with the Chancellor on 29-3-2010 for

appointment of the appellants on the post of Vice

Chancellors, as required by Section 10 (2) of the Act.

The minutes of the Chief Minister and the consequent

decision to cancel some earlier orders and allow the

appellants to continue as Vice Chancellors is clearly

an administrative decision as per convenience or

propriety and does not appear to be a stand taken on

the basis of merits of the matter. The minutes of the

Chief Minister in no way rejects the stand of the

Minister on account of any proven facts. In any case,

in the overall context, the view recorded by the Chief

Minister cannot and should not prevent the State

Government from placing all the facts before the court

in a fair manner to enable it to come to a proper

conclusion.
</p>
<p id="p_59">          31. The facts and circumstances available
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                  33</span>




on record clearly show that the State Government had

not finalized its own list or panel of deserving

candidates because the matter was pending for

approval of the Chief Minister till the meeting held on

29-3-2010. Further, the minutes of the Chancellor

noticed above as well as subsequent stand of the

Minister and correspondences show that the process of

consultation was      yet to begin and the State

Government's views were yet to be finalized.     From

the materials available on record before this court it

has to be held that there was no consultation as

required by Section 10(2) of the Act either on facts or

in law. As held earlier, the consultation must be

effective and it cannot be complete unless views of the

State Government are available in respect of the

proposed appointees. That never happened. .

</p><p id="p_60">          Issue No.3 : Whether the minutes of the

Chief Minister dated 12-6-2010 must be taken as a

binding determination on consultation or whether it

shows fresh consultation, taking care of lack of

consultation:-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                   34</span><p id="p_61">




</p><p id="p_62">           32. It has already been discussed and held that

consultation u/s 10(2) of the Act is mandatory. It has also

been discussed and held after noticing the submissions in

respect of order dated 13-6-2010 of the Principal

Secretary of the department and minutes of the Chief

Minister dated 12-6-2010 that in fact there was no

consultation either on facts or in law. Thus, in substance

the issue no. 3 has already been answered in the context

of issue no.2.
</p>
<p id="p_63">           33. It may further be observed that the minutes

of the Chief Minister dated 12-6-2010 do not show any

reasons for his deciding to respect the views of the

Chancellor and, hence, it cannot have even persuasive

value so far as this court is concerned, in the context of

all the relevant facts including the minutes of the

Chancellor and those of the Minister. The Chief Minister

rightly avoided to give any categorical finding. When a

challenge to the legality of appointment to a public and

Statutory post like that of Vice Chancellor came up for

decision before this court, the State Government rightly

placed all the materials and facts before the court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                    35</span>




because the findings, if any, by the Chief Minister or the

State Government cannot be binding on the court. In a

dispute of present nature, the State Government cannot

be held bound by principles of estoppel or waiver when

the issue is- whether the statutory requirement of

consultation was actually met or not. It is well settled

that there is no estoppel against the Statute.

</p><p id="p_64">           34. In the judgement of the Supreme Court in

the case of Waman Shriniwas V. R. B. &amp; Co. AIR 1959

689 a tenant raised the issue of waiver on the ground that

the landlord had agreed to allow the tenant to sublet the

premises. The Apex Court rejected the plea on various

grounds including the ground that rights under the

statutory provisions based on public policy must be

enforced by the courts. It was further held that an

agreement to waive an illegality is void on grounds of

public policy and would be unenforceable. Some

judgements of the Privy Council were also relied upon.

One may usefully refer to the case of <a href="/doc/599506/" id="a_17">Surajmull

Nagoremull V. Triton Insurance Co. Ltd</a>. AIR 1925 PC

</p><p id="p_65">83. The relevant principle of law enunciated by Lord
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                    36</span>




Sumner is in following words:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                         "-------------- No court
             can enforce as valid that which

             declared shall not be valid, nor is
             obedience to such an enactment a
             thing from which a Court can be
             dispensed by the consent of the
             parties, or by a failure to plead
             or to argue the point at the
             outset---------------"</blockquote><p id="p_66">


</p><p id="p_67">            35. The Supreme Court also noted the law as

to waiver in Corpus Juris Secundum Volume 92 at page

1068 and highlighted that a waiver in derogation of

statutory rights is not favoured, and it will be inoperative

and void if it infringes on the rights of others or would be

against public policy or morals. Thus, it is not possible to

accept that the lis must be deemed to have come to an

end with the views of the Chief Minister in his minutes

dated 12-6-2010 or with the issuance of an order by the

Principal   Secretary    on    13-06-2010    allowing    the

appellants to work as Vice Chancellors.             Even the

alternative argument that as per minutes of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                    37</span>




Chancellor, the Minister waived the right of consultation

must also be rejected for the aforesaid reasons. The

provision for consultation u/s 10 (2) of the Act is to serve

a public purpose and it cannot be waived by any

Government functionary.
</p>
<p id="p_68">           36. Having clarified the legal position that

mandatory requirement like the one u/s 10 (2) of the Act

cannot be waived by the Minister or the State

Government, it also needs to be highlighted that in fact

the Minister was aware that the panel containing the

names of candidates which the State Government was to

discuss in course of consultation with the Chancellor had

yet not been finalized by the Chief Minister. In such

facts and circumstances, it was not possible or proper for

the Minister to waive the requirement of consultation

between the Chancellor and the State Government. In

fairness to the Minister, it must be added herein that the

minutes of the Chancellor are not clear and it cannot be

safely concluded that the Minister had agreed to waive

the right of "consultation".
</p>
<p id="p_69">           37. One of the arguments on behalf of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                   38</span>




appellants was that contents of consultation are not

justiciable. For that reliance was placed upon the

judgement of the Supreme Court in the case <a href="/doc/1303996/" id="a_18">Mahesh

Chandra Gupta vs. Union of India</a> (2009) 8 SCC 273.

In the case at hand the subject of enquiry or the issue, as

noted above, is whether there was any consultation as

required by Section 10(2) of the Act or not and for that

purpose only the minutes of the Chancellor were noticed

by the writ court and also by us. The justiciability of

contents of consultation cannot arise as an issue when it

has been found that there was no consultation at all.

</p><p id="p_70">          38. Another contention of the appellants was

that in exercise of writ jurisdiction this court should not

decide whether there was any consultation because it is

an issue involving disputed questions of facts. This

contention is also devoid of any merits. Both the

concerned parties, that is, the Chancellor and the State

Government have placed all the materials which are

relevant for deciding the issue involved. The facts are not

much in controversy and the task before the court is

mainly of drawing deductions or inferences from the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                       39</span>




facts available on record of the case. It is not a case

which should be thrown out on the plea of disputed

questions of facts.
</p>
<p id="p_71">             39.    On behalf of the writ petitioners it was

pointed out that the Vigilance Department of Jharkhand

has filed an affidavit in which a report has been enclosed

which shows pendency of investigation into various acts

of financial and other irregularities against some others

and appellant Arvind Kumar in the capacity of erstwhile

Vice    Chancellor         of   Vinoba   Bhave   University,

Hazaribagh (Jharkhand). In reply, learned counsel for the

aforesaid appellant attempted to show that the allegations

were not relatable to Arvind Kumar or had no substance.

In reply, it was submitted on behalf of writ petitioners

that whatever be the worth of allegations and materials

under investigation, the State Government of Bihar

should have been afforded an opportunity by the

Chancellor to collect such materials for effective

consultation otherwise public interest would and has

suffered.

                         the allegations and materials against appellant Arvind

                         Kumar in the present proceeding. Since it has already

                         been held that prior consultation is mandatory and the

                         required consultation did not take place, such or other

                         materials and allegations must be left for consideration

                         by the Chancellor and the State Government at the

                         appropriate stage, if required.
