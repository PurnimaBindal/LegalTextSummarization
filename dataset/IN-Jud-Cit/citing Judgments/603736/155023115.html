                                                Prefatory Note

                M.SUNDAR, J.

                          It is often said that interpretation is a journey of discovery, which is

                not akin to a regular journey of discussion and dispositive reasoning which

                predominantly turns on &#x27;construction&#x27;. Interpretation (unlike construction) is

                more in the nature of determining the idea of legal meaning of a Statute.

                Interpretation is a jurisprudential journey as it is the process of sifting a

                statute and/or its provisions to seek the intention of the Legislature. In this

                order, we had embarked upon such a jurisprudential journey, which under

                the normal circumstances should have reached its destination before the

                dawn of December 2020, but that was not to be owing to the Corona virus

                pandemic and consequent lock down, which is now widely and commonly

                referred to as &#x27;Covid-19 situation&#x27;; Covid-19 was something which we did

                not portend or presage when this journey commenced on 17.02.2020 and

                thereafter we had no means of prophesying that it would impact one of us

                and personal staff of another of us.



                          2. We are much conscious over the joint effort to raise the efficiency

                and therefore, we feel it appropriate to state as to why there is a little delay

                in delivering this judgment, though it is not imperative for us to narrate the

                reasons, we believe that keeping a clear conscience is always better. We can

                speak only through our order with none to articulate these facts if this order

                is assailed in the Apex Court. Owing to conflict of judgments with regard to

                human rights violations, these batch of cases were referred to us by

                constitution of a Special Bench by the then Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice, for a firm

                judicial pronouncement on the said aspect. These matters were heard by us

                on several listings / days in virtual Courts (Web hearing on a video

                conferencing platform) and finally judgment in this case was reserved on

                29.09.2020.



                          3. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of Balaji Baliram Mupade

                and another vs. The State of Maharashtra and Others [Civil Appeal

                No</a>.3564 of 2020 (SLP(C) No.11626 of 2020), decided on 29.10.2020,

                referring to its earlier decision in <a href="/doc/1517737/" id="a_3">Anil Rai vs. State of Bihar</a> reported in

                2001 (7) SCC 318, was pleased to hold as under:

                                   &quot;3.... It is not necessary to reproduce the directions except
                           to state that normally the judgment is expected within two
                           months of the conclusion of the arguments, and on expiry of
                           three months any of the parties can file an application in the
                           High Court with prayer for early judgment. If, for any reason,
                           no judgment is pronounced for six months, any of the parties is
                           entitled to move an application before the then Chief Justice of
                           the High Court with a prayer to re-assign the case before
                           another Bench for fresh arguments.&quot;



                S.VAIDYANATHAN, J.

                          4. After reserving judgment in these batch of cases, one of us (Justice

                S.Vaidyanathan) was deputed to the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court

                for three months and thereafter, one of our Personal Assistants was affected

                with Covid-19 and there were sudden deaths of two parents of two Personal

                Staff, all of which made us postpone our dictation for a short while and

                continue thereafter. Thereafter, all of a sudden, one of us (Justice

                S.Vaidyanathan) was hospitalized for few days and soon after recovery,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
                another one of us (V.Parthiban, J.) tested Covid-19 positive and was
                                                        6

                hospitalized for a considerable period. Owing to such circumstances beyond

                our control, we have been forced to defer the continuation of our dictation

                consecutively, as each one of us has played a role in shaping the judgment,

                so as to put in all the finesse and felicity at our command in articulation. As

                Constitutional functionaries, we owe the responsibility of delivery of orders

                at the earliest, but there may be certain circumstances, which may be beyond

                the control of humans, like the present situation.



                          5. We have thought it appropriate and pertinent to write this prefatory

                note in the light of matters now before different Hon&#x27;ble Division Benches

                which are awaiting this verdict. Suffice to say that pronouncing of this

                order which should have happened before the dawn of December 2020, is

                happening now owing to circumstances narrated herein which we could

                neither foretell nor foreshadow.

                to be traced to divergent views expressed by two Hon&#x27;ble Judges of this

                Court, in their respective decisions as under.

                Rights Act</a>, 1993&#x27; (hereinafter, referred to &#x27;H.R.Act&#x27;) and comparing the

                same to the similar provisions of the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_6">Commission of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952

                by the Human Rights Commissions are recommendatory in nature. The

                learned Judge has come to the conclusion on the premise that from the

                Statement of Objects and Reasons of H.R.Act, it was noticed that the

                Commission will be a fact finding body with powers to conduct inquiry into

                the complaints of violation of human rights. Based on the said premise, the

                learned Judge has drawn parallel to several provisions of H.R.Act and

                C.I.Act and found that many of the provisions of both the Acts are pari

                materia to each other and therefore, the learned Judge founded his

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                    8</span>

                conclusion that the provisions of H.R.Act being &#x27;pari materia&#x27; to the

                provisions of C.I.Act, the recommendations of the Human Rights

                Commission under Section 18 of H.R.Act cannot be enforced. The learned

                Judge in his judgment, compared Section 13 of H.R.Act which deals with

                the powers relating to the inquiries, namely, the Commission shall have all

                the powers of a Civil Court summoning and enforcing the attendance of

                witnesses and examining them on oath, discovery and production of any

                document, receiving evidence on affidavits, and requisitioning any public

                record or copy thereof from any Court of office, etc. is &#x27;pari materia&#x27; to

                Section 4 of C.I.Act. wherein similar powers are vested in the Commission

                under C.I. Act as well. Likewise, the learned Judge has compared Section 14

                of H.R. Act which deals with investigation and utilization of services of

                certain officers, with that of Section 5A of the C.I. Act, which is &#x27;pari

                materia&#x27;. Further, Section 15 of H.R. Act which states that no statement

                made by a person during the course of giving evidence before the

                Commission shall subject him to, or be used against him in any civil or

                criminal proceeding except a prosecution for giving false evidence by such

                statement. In fact, this provision is a replica of Section 6 of the C.I.Act,

                though not specifically referred to by the learned Judge. Section 16 of

                H.R.Act which states that the &#x27;persons likely to be prejudicially affected to

                be heard&#x27;. It also states that he should be allowed to cross examine the

                witnesses who speak adverse to him and also produce evidence in his

                defence. So is section 8-B of the C.I. Act being pari materia to Section 16

                of H.R.Act, provides such right to the persons likely to be affected. The

                learned Judge has also compared <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_7">Section 18</a> (a)(i) of H.R.Act which states

                that the Commission shall make a recommendation to the concerned

                Government or authority to make payment of compensation or damages to

                the complainant or to the victim or to the members of his family with that of

                Section 3 of the C.I.Act which also state that the Commission shall submit

                its report. The learned Judge compared H.R.Commission to the Commission

                functioning under similar enactments like, National Commission for

                <a href="/doc/192325206/" id="a_8">Minorities Act</a>, 1992, National Commission for <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_9">Women Act</a>, 1990, National

                Commission for Backward Classes, 1993, etc., and concluded that the

                reports/recommendations to the Government are not binding on the

                Government. The learned Judge, in furtherance of comparative analysis of

                the provisions of both H.R. Act principally with C.I. Act and other Acts, has

                summed up in paragraph 41 as under:

                                   accepted the recommendation of the SHRC. Therefore, it

                                   law with impugnity. Such undue sympathies or liberal
                                   approach on this issue will only further embolden a

                Supreme Court of India, in the matter of D.K.Basu versus State of West

                Bengal reported in (1997) 1 SCC 416 which decision was extracted in

                extenso, particularly paragraphs 40, 42, 44, 45 and 54 in his order. In that

                decision, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has relied upon <a href="/doc/1050521/" id="a_17">Article 9(5)</a> of the

                International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 which stated that

                any victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have enforceable right to

                compensation. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has reasoned that the claim in

                public law for compensation for unconstitutional deprivation of fundamental

                right to life and liberty, the protection of which is guaranteed under the

                Constitution and such claim is based on strict liability and in addition to the

                operation of private law for damages for tortuous acts of the public servants.



</p><p id="p_14">                          11. On the basis of the above findings, the learned Judge has

                concluded that the concerned Government is bound to give effect to the

                Human Rights Commission&#x27;s recommendations. The learned Judge has also

                made it clear that the conclusion reached in Rajesh Das&#x27; case, cannot be

                followed as according to the learned Judge, the decision in Rajesh Das&#x27; case

                has been rendered without reference to various decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court, particularly, in D.K.Basu&#x27; case (cited supra) and of this

                Court on this issue. The leanred Judge also held that no reference was made

                same learned Judge (Shri Justice S.Nagamuthu) in the matter of Abdul

                Sathar versus The Principal Secretary to Government and others in

                W.P.No.41791 of 2006, wherein, the learned Judge vide his order, dated

                discipline and decorum, referred the matter to a Division Bench to resolve

                the conflict of views expressed by the learned Judges.

                wherein, it has been held in paragraphs 15 and 16 as under:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                    &#x27;15. Thus, the power of the SHRC to award compensation
                              in case of violation of Human Rights by a state agency is beyond
                              doubt. In fact, on the inability of the Commission to execute its
                              own orders and recommendations, the former Chief Justice has
                              made a passionate plea to the State in this regard in his lecture

                              (cited above) and the relevant passage is extracted below:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                                     &#x27;Before I conclude, I must say that no purpose is served
                                     by the Commission engaging the other agencies of the
                                     State in adversarial litigation to secure enforcement of
                                     its recommendations. In this context, I would like to
                                     impress upon the State executive that by augmenting the
                                     human rights protection machinery in the State, the
                                     Government is, in fact, acquiring a partner in good
                                     governance. The law casts an obligation on each State
                                     Government to sustain the human rights apparatus by
                                     acting in its aid rather than at cross-purposes. I hope and
                                     trust that the State Government would do all it can to
                                     reinforce this partnership for the common good of the
                                     people of the State and would abide by the provisions of
                                     protection of the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_18">Human Rights Act</a> in letter and spirit.&#x27;
                                          &#x27;16. In the light of the above, the grievance projected by
                                   the writ petitioner has no substance and the writ petition is liable
                                   to be dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs. As
                                   the writ petition is dismissed, there is no impediment for the
                                   State Government in implementing the order of the SHRC. As
                                   the writ petitioner is under the services of the State, we direct
                                   the Government to implement the orders of the SHRC and
                                   recover the amount from the writ petitioner and pay the same to
                                   the husband of the second respondent within a period of eight
                                   weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. The State
                                   will also consider making the necessary amendments in the Act
                                   so as to provide necessary power to execute the orders of the
                                   SHRC. A copy of this order will also be marked to the
                                   Secretary, Home Department, Government of Tamil Nadu, for
                                   further actions and compliance of our order. Consequently,
                                   connected Miscellaneous Petition will also stand dismissed.&#x27;

                amendments in the Act to provide power to the Commission to execute its

                orders/recommendation. The Division Bench order was, in fact, authored by

                Shri Justice K.Chandru, and he relied upon this order in his subsequent

                said Division Bench, the Hon&#x27;ble The Chief Justice after constituting this

                Bench, has referred the same to us to answer the Reference. A short

                trajectory of development thus far is a fore-runner to the understanding of

                the judicial minds reflected in the above decisions and this Bench shall pick

                up the thread from this point and proceed to examine the reference, in detail.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                         21</span>


</p><p id="p_29">                          18. This Bench, after going through all the decisions/judgments which

                culminated into the present reference, in fact, does not apparently see any

                conflict of views in respect of the Division Benches&#x27; decision as found in

                paragraph 8 as extracted above, yet there appeared to be conflict of views in

                respect of two learned single Judges of this Court, viz., Shri Justice

                S.Nagamuthu in Rajesh Das&#x27;s case and Shri Justice K.Chandru in

                T.Vijaykumar&#x27;s case. In any event, there is a need to give a quietus to the

                divergent judicial perception; after all, uniform judicial disposition is the

                hallmark of the justice delivery system in dispensing hallowed justice in the

                realm of Human Rights Laws.

                uncertainty in implementing the recommendations of the State Human

                Rights Commission hereinafter referred to as &#x27;SHRC&#x27; and adjudicating the

                rights of the parties who are affected by the recommendations etc., this

                Bench has been bestowed upon to discharge seminal duty towards finding

                plausible answers to the lack of clarity as it perceived in understanding the

                scheme of the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_27">Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, 1993 and the status as to the

</p><p id="p_32">                          20. The task which is assigned to this Bench is a momentous one as

                the issues that are referred to this Bench are of great public importance

                touching upon the entire scheme of H.R.Act. In search of answers, this

                Bench has to tread cautiously with circumspection on the judicial terrain, as

                it finds that after coming into force of H.R.Act, there is no authoritative

                judicial pronouncement either by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India or the

                High Courts which can be taken as a precedent and as a guide for our

                endeavour to answer the reference from a single comprehensive source. The

                judicial journey of Courts thus far as in relation to the scheme of H.R. Act,

                has not yet crystallized into any authoritative ruling on the issues referred to

                this Bench. This Bench, therefore, in the little charted territory, has to go

                through the maze of judicial pronouncements that are already rendered, with

                reference to the human rights or with reference to allied issues which may

                help the Bench to widen the horizon of understanding the issues and its

                complexity. The purpose and meaning of the provisions of H.R.Act in the

                context of fundamental right to life, liberty and dignity guaranteed by the

                Constitution of India and the position, status of the Commission in taking

                forward to the avowed objects of H.R.Act need an exploratory study with an

                incisive approach in order to discharge the arduous onus conferred upon this

                Bench.

                the scope and the object of the provisions of H.R.Act and the shortcomings

                or lacunae in implementation of the recommendations of the Human Rights

                Commissions, this Bench as stated above, has to necessarily traverse

                through various provisions of H.R.Act and C.I.Act and also through various

                decisions of the High Courts and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India,

                rendered with reference to the provisions of these Acts. Such elaborate

                laying down a definite judicial driveway for the stake holders in their

                H.R.Act. According to the learned counsel, the Objects and Reasons of any

                enactment can only be a tool to understand the history of legislation and

                cannot be the basis for interpreting the substantial provisions of the Act. In

                this regard, the learned counsel would rely on two decisions, viz., 1997

                Supp (6) SCR 282 (Devadoss (Dead), by L.Rs., and another versus Veera

                Makali Amman Koil Athalur) and 1963 AIR (SC) 1356 (S.C.Prashar,

                                   and Reasons can be referred to for the purpose of

<blockquote id="blockquote_19">                            29. According to the learned counsel, the comparison between the

                Human Rights Commission appointed under H.R.Act and the Commission

                appointed under the C.I.Act is completely misplaced and misconceived for

                the simple reason that the Commission under the C.I.Act draws its

                jurisdiction from the terms of reference by the appropriate Government

                appointing it, unlike the Commission under H.R.Act which is a permanent

                body, a standing legal forum drawing its jurisdiction from the Statute itself.

<p id="p_58">                In this regard, the learned counsel would rely on a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court reported in 1984 (1) SCC 684 (State of Gujarat versus

                Consumer and Education Research Centre and others), wherein, the

                Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that the Government&#x27;s power under Section

                7(1)(a) of the C.I.Act ordering discontinuance of Inquiry Commission,

                cannot be interfered with unless it is tainted with legal malice. The learned

                counsel would emphasize that the Government which orders formation of

                to the continuance of the Commission under the C.I.Act. Such is not the

                case with the Commission constituted under H.R.Act. Therefore,

                comparison between the Commission constituted under the C.I.Act and

                                   and the State is vicariously liable for their acts. The claim of

                                   wrong doer. In the assessment of compensation, the

                placing of annual/special reports along with recommendations before the

                House of Parliament or State Legislature. Reading of the provisions can lead

                to only one conclusion, namely, that placing of Annual reports/Special

                reports along with recommendations before the Parliament or Legislature as

                the case may be, may not be in relation to a particular case of violation of

                human rights. On the other hand, in case of specific complaints against

                human rights violations, Section 18 of H.R.Act comes into play and is

                pressed into service. Therefore, there are two types of recommendations by

                the Human Rights Commission under the Act, one is advisory/academic in

                nature given under <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_39">Section 12</a> (c) to (f) and another is mandatory in nature

                given under Section 18 of H.R.Act. The scope of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_40">Section 18</a> and its ambit

                are evidently distinguishable from the relevant Sub Clauses of <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_41">Section 12</a>

                referred to above draw for such conclusion.

</p><p id="p_81">                          36. According to the learned counsel, so far there has been no

                authoritative pronouncement regarding the critical difference between the

                recommendations made under <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_45">Section 12</a> and under Section 18 of H.R.Act.

                The learned counsel would reiterate that the recommendations as

                contemplated under <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_46">Section 12</a> are only in relation to Sub Clauses (c) to (f)

                as Sub Clauses (a) &amp; (b) are different and in fact, have nexus with Section

                18 of H.R. Act. The learned counsel would further submit that as far as the

                Commission constituted under C.I. Act, its power to make recommendation

                is very limited, it cannot even recommend any punishment on the basis of its

                findings. In this regard, he would refer to a decision rendered by a

                Constitutional Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India reported in

                MANU/SC/0024/1958           (Rama      Krishna     Dalmia     versus     Justice

                S.R.Tendolkar and Others).           He would refer to the ruling of the

                Constitutional Bench in regard to the power of the Commission under

                C.I.Act and to bring out the material difference between Commissions

                constituted under C.I.Act 1958 and under H.R.Act, 1993 respectively in

                                   who are appellants in Civil Appeals Nos. 456 and 457 of
                                   1957, goes as far as to say that while the Commission may
                                   find facts on which the Government may take action,
                                   legislative or executive, although he does not concede the
                                   latter kind of action to be contemplated, the Commission
                                   cannot be asked to suggest any measure, legislative or
                                   executive, to be taken by the appropriate Government. We
                                   are unable to accept the proposition so widely enunciated.
                                   An inquiry necessarily involves investigation into facts and
                                   necessitates the collection of material facts from the
                                   evidence adduced before or brought to the notice of the
                                   person or body conducting the inquiry and the recording of
                                   its findings on those facts in its report cannot but be regarded
                                   as ancillary to the inquiry itself, for the inquiry becomes
                                   useless unless the findings of the inquiring body are made
                                   available to the Government which set up the inquiry. It is,
                                   in our judgment, equally ancillary that the person or body
                                   conducting the inquiry should express its own view on the
                                   facts found by it for the consideration of the appropriate
                                   Government in order to enable it to take such measure as it
                                   may think fit to do. The whole purpose of setting up of a
                                   Commission of Inquiry consisting of experts will be
                                   frustrated and the elaborate process of inquiry will be
                                   deprived of its utility if the opinion and the advice of the
                                   expert body as to the measures the situation disclosed calls
                                   for   cannot   be   placed    before   the   Government     for
                                   consideration notwithstanding that doing so cannot be to the
                                   prejudice of anybody because it has no force of its own. In

                                   are of great importance to the Government in order to enable
                                   it to make up its mind as to what legislative or administrative
                                   measures should be adopted to eradicate the evil found or to
                                   implement the beneficial objects it has in view. From this
                                   point of view, there can -be no objection even to the
                                   Commission of Inquiry recommending the imposition of
                                   some. form of punishment which will, in its opinion, be
                                   sufficiently deterrent to delinquents in future. But seeing that
                                   the Commission of Inquiry has no judicial powers and its
                                   report will purely be recommendatory and not effective
                                   proprio vigore and the statement made by any person before
                                   the Commission of Inquiry is, under S.6 of the Act, wholly
                                   inadmissible in evidence in any future proceedings, civil or
                                   criminal, there can be no point in the Commission of Inquiry
                                   making recommendations for taking any action &#x27; as and by
                                   way of securing redress or punishment&#x27; which, in agreement
                                   with the High Court, we think, refers, in the context, to
                                   wrongs already done or committed, for redress or
                                   punishment for such wrongs, if any, has to be imposed by a
                                   court of law, properly constituted exercising its own
                                   discretion on the facts and circumstances of the case and
                                   without being in any way influenced by the view of any
                                   person or body, howsoever august or high powered it may
                                   be. Having regard to all these considerations it appears to us
                                   that only that portion of the last part of cl. (10) which calls
                                   upon the Commission of Inquiry to make recommendations
                                   about the action to be taken &#x27; as and by way of securing
                                   redress or punishment&#x27;, cannot be said to be at all necessary
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/   for or ancillary to the purposes of the Commission. In our

                                   view the words in the latter part of the section, namely, &#x27; as
                                   and by way of securing redress or punishment &#x27;, clearly go
                                   outside the scope of the Act and such provision is not
                                   covered by the two legislative entries and should, therefore,
                                   be deleted. So deleted the latter portion of cl. (10) would
                                   read and the action which in the opinion of the Commission
                                   should be taken to act as a preventive in future cases’.&#x27;

                Government or authority cannot reject or ignore the report of the

                proposed to be taken leaving no other option to the concerned Government

                or authority. This conscious omission is particularly visible and patent since

                generality. <a href="/doc/61275374/" id="a_65">Section 18(b)</a> provides for an opportunity for the Commission to

                approach the Supreme Court or the High Court concerned and such right to

                approach the High Court by SHRC can be resorted to, if the Government sit

                over the inquiry report beyond the period provided in the Statute or fixed by

                the Commission. The salient features of various Sections of H.R.Act,

                particularly, <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_66">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_67">18</a>, <a href="/doc/302919/" id="a_68">20</a> and <a href="/doc/1394637/" id="a_69">28</a> have not been dealt with

                H.R.Act, in Rajesh Das&#x27;s case. According to the learned counsel, complete

                import and amplitude of Section 18 of H.R.Act have not been appreciated by

                the learned Judge in proper perspective. He would therefore submit that the

                view expressed in Rajesh Das&#x27;s case is not tenable and is incorrect.

                constituted under the CI Act, under Section 18(b) of H.R.Act, the

                Commission can approach the Hon’ble Supreme Court or the High Court

                concerned for seeking directions/orders/writs.        The learned counsel

                submitted that <a href="/doc/61275374/" id="a_70">Section 18(b)</a> clearly makes the Commission under H.R.Act a

                different from the Commission constituted under the C.I.Act. Moreover,

                under <a href="/doc/46143524/" id="a_71">Section 18(e)</a>, time is stipulated for the Government to forward its

                comments on the action taken or proposed to be taken thereon to the

                discretion, can fix further time as it deems fit. Therefore, the Commission

                constituted under H.R.Act does not become functus officio, as it is

                imperative on the part of the Government to forward the action taken report

                or proposed to be taken report to the Commission within the stipulated time.

                On the other hand, <a href="/doc/302919/" id="a_72">Section 20</a> or 28 as the case may be, provided that the

                concerned Government to assign reasons for non-acceptance of the

                for such leeway for the Government to refuse to accept the

                                   that it has the power of inquiry set up under the C.I.A.

                                   the status of the Human Rights of the country or the
                                   State, as the case may be. It has no power to give a
                                   definitive judgment and is constituted with the object
                                   of creating awareness of Human Rights at the
                                   Governmental level and the public at large. In fact,
                                   N.H.R.C. and S.H.R.C. are conceived as Standing

</p><p id="p_207">                                   Human Rights movement in India has suffered so far,
                                   due to the activists adopting a negative attitude to
                                   highlight the violations only and demanding punitive
                                   action. So much so, the term Human Rights has
                                   become synonymous with punitive action. This has
                                   resulted in taking evasive action by the concerned to
                                   prevent violations coming to light than making efforts
                                   to implement human rights. This has to change and a
                                   positive content should be injected into the movement.
                                   In India, keeping in tune with the social philosophy of
                                   the Constitution, the fundamental rights and the
                                   directive principles, hundreds of pieces of social
                                   legislation have been enacted, which cover the entire
                                   gamut of Human Rights. Unless the bureaucracy in the
                                   field, who are to implement these social legislations,
                                   are aware of their import, their enforcement would lack
                                   fervour and substance. Therefore, it is imperative that
                                   &#x27;&#x27;Human Rights&#x27;&#x27; teaching should be made part of the

                                   at all levels of bureaucracy. Field workers, particularly
                                   those involved in developmental activities are to be

                                   role in ensuring human dignity.

                              in Sec. 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_98">Copyright Act</a>? The word is not defined in the
                              <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_99">Copyright Act</a> though it is defined in the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_100">Customs Act</a>. But the
                              same word may mean different things in different enactments
                              and in different contexts. It may even mean different things at
                              different places in the same Statute . It all depends on the
                              sense of the provision where it occurs. Reference to
                              dictionaries is hardly of any avail, particularly in the case of
                              words of ordinary parlance with a variety of well known
                              meanings. Such words take colour from the context. Appeal to
                              the Latin root won&#x27;t help. The appeal must be to the sense of
                              the Statute . Hidayatullah J in Burmah Shall etc v. Commercial
                              Tax Officer, [1961] 1 SCR 902 has illustrated how the
                              contextual meanings of the very words import&#x27; and export&#x27; may
                              vary.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">                                   28. We may look at Sec. 53, rather than elsewhere to
                            discover the meaning of the word &#x27;import&#x27;. We find that the
                            meaning is stated in that provision itself. If we ask what is not to
                            be imported, we find the answer is copies made out of India
                            which if made in India would infringe copyright. So it follows
                            that &#x27;import&#x27; in the provision means bringing into India from out
                            of India. That, we see in precisely how import is defined under
                            the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_101">Customs Act</a>. Sec. 2(23) of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_102">Customs Act</a>, 1962 defines the

                                   &#x27;Import, with its grammatical variation and cognate
                                   expression means bringing into India from a place

                            respondents that where goods are brought into the country not for
                            commerce, but for onward submission to another country, there
                            can, in law, be no important. It was said that the object of the
                            <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_107">Copyright Act</a> was to precious authorised reproduction of the
                            work or the unauthorised explosion of the reproduction of a work
                            in India and this object would not be frustrated if infringing
                            copies of a work were allowed transit across the country. If goods
                            are brought in only to go out, there is no import, it was said. It is
                            difficult to agree with this submission thought it did find favour
                            with the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, in the
                            judgment under appeal. In the first place, the language of Sec. 53
                            does not justify reading the words &#x27;imported for commerce for the
                            words imported&#x27;. Nor is there any reason to assume that such was
                            the object of the legislature. We have already mentioned the
                            imported attached by International opinion, as manifested by the
                            various International Conventions and Treaties, to the protection
                            of Copyright and the gravity with which traffic in industrial,
                            literary or artistic property is viewed, treating such traffic on par
                            with traffic in narcotics, dangerous drugs and arms. In
                            interpreting the word import&#x27; in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_108">Copyright Act</a>, we must take
                            note that while positive requirement of the Copyright
                            Conventions is to protect copyright, negatively also, the Transit
                            Trade Convention and the bilateral Treaty make exceptions

                            enabling the Transit State to take measure to protect Copyright. If
                            this much is borne in mind, it becomes bear that the word import&#x27;
                            in Sec. 53 of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_109">Copyright Act</a> cannot bear the narrow
                            interpretation sought to be placed upon it to limit it to import for
                            commerce. It must be interpreted in a sense which will fit the
                            <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_110">Copyright Act</a> into the setting of the International Conventions.&#x27;

                Court in the above two decisions, has laid down the principle of

                construction and interpretation of the words and expressions in different

                sections in the contextual settings. Taking cue from the above, the

                ‘Commission’ as mentioned in the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_111">Human Rights Act</a>, cannot be compared

                with the ‘Commission’ defined in the C.I.Act. Therefore, the comparison by

                the learned Division Bench of this Court in its decision reported in CDJ

                1997 MHC 793 (cited supra) is flawed and invalid.

                Bench’s ruling that the finding of the Commission is not final ‘because

                natural justice is not complied with’ is also incorrect and such ruling of the

                Division Bench is contrary to Section 16 of H.R.Act. He would refer to

                Section 16 of H.R.Act, which reads as under:

                              is likely to be prejudicially affected by the inquiry;
                              it shall give to that person a reasonable opportunity of being
                              heard in the inquiry and to produce evidence in his defence:
                              Provided that nothing in this section shall apply where the credit

</p><p id="p_229">                          53. The above provisions clearly envisage providing of opportunity of

                being heard to the individual concerned in the enquiry by the Commission.

                Therefore, the conclusion reached by the Division Bench without reference

                to Section 16 of H.R.Act is incorrect and unsustainable. According to the

                learned counsel, the Division Bench neither dealt with <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_112">Section 16</a> nor

                Section 18 of H.R.Act to premise its ultimate finding rendered in the

                the international treaties and covenants, being a signatory and it has the

                power and obligation as well to enact laws for enforcing the rights of its

                citizens in terms of the international treaties, covenants, etc. Therefore,

                enacting H.R.Act is an essential part of the constitutional duty to protect and

                enforce the right of citizens in regard to the human rights.

                                   that the Commission has no unlimited jurisdiction nor does

                                   should necessarily act within the parameters prescribed by

                                   rights. Even if it is not in a position to take up the inquiry

                                   incorrect premise that the person wronged by violation of

                                   petitioner had referred to the decision of the Apex Court in

                                   against private wrongs. It is used for enforcement of various

                                   counsel for the petitioner strenuously submits that since the

                                   petitioner for compelling the State Government to discharge
                                   their duties within the ambit of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_149">Section 18</a> of the Protection
                                   of Human Rights Act, 1993. Para 29 of the SCC in <a href="/doc/261493/" id="a_150">Binny

                                  ‘29. Thus, it can be seen that a writ of mandamus
                           or the remedy under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_151">Article 226</a> is pre-eminently a
                           public law remedy and is not generally available as a
                           remedy against private wrongs. It is used for
                           enforcement of various rights of the public or to
                           compel public/statutory authorities to discharge their
                           duties and to act within their bounds. It may be used to
                           do justice when there is wrongful exercise of power or
                           a refusal to perform duties. This writ is admirably
                           equipped to serve as a judicial control over
                           administrative actions. This writ could also be issued
                           against any private body or person, specially in view of
                           the words used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_152">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.
                           However, the scope of mandamus is limited to
                           enforcement of public duty. The scope of mandamus is
                           determined by the nature of the duty to be enforced,
                           rather than the identity of the authority against whom it
                           is sought. If the private body is discharging a public
                           function and the denial of any right is in connection
                           with the public duty imposed and the denial of any
                           right is in connection with the public duty imposed on
                           such body, the public law remedy or otherwise and the
                           source of such power is immaterial, but, nevertheless,
                           there must be the public law and private law remedies.

                                   particularly <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_158">Article 21.</a> Denial of this right undermines
                                   public confidence in the justice delivery system and
                                   incentivises people to look for short cuts and other fora
                                   where they feel that justice will be done quicker. In the
                                   long run, this also weakens the justice delivery system
                                   and poses a threat to the rule of law.

                                   access to justice must not be understood in a purely
                                   quantitative dimension. Access to justice in an
                                   egalitarian democracy must be understood to mean
                                   qualitative access to justice as well. Access to justice
                                   is, therefore, much more than improving an individual&#x27;s
                                   access to courts, or guaranteeing representation. It must
                                   be defined in terms of ensuring that legal and judicial
                                   outcomes are just and equitable [see United Nations
                                   Development Programme, Access to Justice —

                                    &#x27;22. Human rights violations in the States that are far
                              removed from NHRC Headquarters in Delhi itself make
                              access to justice for victims from those States is an illusion.
                              While theoretically it is possible that those affected by
                              violation of human rights can approach NHRC by addressing
                              a complaint to NHRC for redressal, it does not necessarily
                              mean that such access to justice for redressal of human rights
                              violation is convenient for the victims from the States unless
                              the States have set up their own Commissions that would look
                              into such complaints and grant relief. We need to remember
                              that access to justice so much depends upon the ability of the
                              victim to pursue his or her grievance before the forum
                              competent to grant relief. The North-Eastern parts of the
                              country are mostly inhabited by the tribals. Such regions
                              cannot be deprived of the beneficial provisions of the Act
                              simply because the States are small and the setting up of
                              Commissions in those States would mean financial burden for
                              the exchequer. Even otherwise there is no real basis for the
                              contention that financial constraints prevent these States from
                              setting up their own Commissions. At any rate, the provisions

                              with the consent of Chairperson or Member concerned but it
                              is nobody&#x27;s case that any attempt had in that direction been

                              1997) suggested that if financial constraint was really one of
                              the reasons for not setting up of the Commission in the North-
                              Eastern regions, the State Governments could consider setting
                              up such Commissions by resorting to <a href="/doc/1915618/" id="a_160">Section 21(6)</a>, which
                              permits two States having the same Chairperson or Members
                              thereby   considerably   reducing     the   expenses   on   the

                              violation of human rights would be looked down upon. Some
                              provisions of the international law although may not be a part of
                              our municipal law but the courts are not hesitant in referring
                              thereto so as to find new rights in the context of the
                              Constitution. Constitution of India and other ongoing Statutes
                              have been read consistently with the rules of international law.
                              Constitution is a source of, and not an exercise of, legislative
                              power. The principles of International Law whenever applicable
                              operate as a statutory implication but the Legislature in the
                              instant case held itself bound thereby and, thus, did not legislate
                              in disregard of the constitutional provisions or the international
                              law as also in the context of Articles 20 and 21 of the
                              Constitution of India. The law has to be understood, therefore,
                              in accordance with the international law. Part III of our
                              Constitution protects substantive as well as procedural rights.
                              Implications which arise therefrom must effectively be
                              protected by the judiciary. A contextual meaning to the Statute
                              is required to be assigned having regard to the Constitutional as
                              well as International Law operating in the field. [<a href="/doc/1147125/" id="a_176">See Liverpool

                establish that the Constitution and the statutory laws should be enforced

                advancing the international law operating in the field. H.R.Act, in fact, deals

                with the International Covenants. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_177">The Act</a> defines ‘human rights’ which

                from life, liberty, equality and dignity to the individual guaranteed by the

                Constitution. Therefore, the learned counsel would submit that there cannot

                would rely upon paragraphs 56 and 57 of the above judgment, in support of

                his contention that the Statute should be interpreted in line with the

                payable by the State Government can be recovered from the delinquent.

                Therefore, any aggrieved delinquent need not wait till the acceptance of the

                recommendation. The Commission’s recommendations are binding on the

                concerned Government or authority and in which case, a delinquent Officer

                aggrieved by the recommendations of the Commission, need not wait for its

                acceptance and it is always open to him/her to invoke the jurisdiction of this

                Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_178">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The Government can

                recover any compensation payable on the recommendation of the

                Rules.

                in order to elucidate the scope and ambit of Section 18 of H.R. Act. He

                State of Bihar Vs. Lal Krishna Advani reported in AIR 2003 SC 3357,

                wherein, Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has observed in paragraph 10 as

                                   contention of the learned counsel for the appellant may
                                   perhaps would have been entertainable. The government
                                   actually takes action or it does not or the fact that the report
                                   is yet to be considered from that angle, cannot be a reason to
                                   submit that it won&#x27;t be appropriate stage to approach the
                                   Court. There may be occasions where after consideration of
                                   report the government may not decide to take any action
                                   against the person concerned yet the observation and
                                   remarks may be such which may play upon the reputation of
                                   the person concerned and this aspect of the matter has been
                                   fully taken care of under clause (b) of <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_185">Section 8B</a> of the Act.
                                   It is not, therefore, necessary that one must wait till a
                                   decision is taken by the government to take action against
                                   the person after consideration of the report. We have already
                                   dealt with the point about the right to have and protect one&#x27;s
                                   reputation. We, therefore, find no force in the submission
                                   that the respondent no.1 had approached the Court at pre-
                                   mature stage.&#x27;

                of those persons to approach the Court for appropriate remedy without

                in holding that the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court were made in

                exceptional circumstances. In effect, according to the learned counsel, in

                &#x27;Rajesh Das&#x27;s case, it was held that the inquiry report and recommendations

                are inseparable. But the position is that they are two different parts. The

                learned Judge has over looked the above distinction between the two. The

                learned counsel would also refer to the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

                Court of India in the matter of Ram Krishna Dalmia versus Justice

                S.R.Tendolkar and others reported in MANU/SC/0024/1958.



</p><p id="p_314">                          88. In fact, the above decision has already been cited by the counsel

                Mr.P.Sreenivas, learned counsel appearing for SHRC. Para 11 of the

                decision has already been extracted supra in order to emphasis that the

                Commission under the C.I.Act cannot recommend punishment which the

                Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held as completely out side scope of the C.I.Act, as

                above. However, the learned counsel would submit that the Commission

                established under the C.I. Act can suggest punishment as a matter of

                deterrent to delinquents in future. Comparing the power of the Commission

                under the C.I. Act, the learned counsel would draw the reference to Sub

                Clauses (a) (i) and (ii) of Section 18 of H.R.Act, which provide the power to

                the Commission to initiate proceedings for prosecution and as such other

                suitable action the Commission may deem fit against the concerned person

                or persons and also to recommend for payment of compensation towards

                damages to the complainant or to the victim etc. Therefore, the

                recommendation in such context has to be construed as legally enforceable.



</p><p id="p_315">                          89. The learned counsel would further elaborate his submissions that

                in the matter of recommendations that there are four possible scenarios

                when the Commission concludes its inquiry followed by recommendations.

</p><p id="p_316">                (i) no violation of human rights was found and on such conclusion either

                complainant or the victim can approach the Constitutional Court for

                redressal. (ii) The Commission finding violation of human rights and the

                Constitutional Court is approached and the Court confirms the

                recommendations, in which case, the recommendation merges with the

                decision of the Constitutional Court and becomes a command. iii) The

                Commission holding violation in part and even in that situation, the decision

                of the Constitutional Court accepting such recommendation becomes a

                mandate to be implemented by the concerned Government or authority. iv)

                The Commission holding the Government guilty of violation and no one

                approached the Court at all, in that event, the Commission may invoke

                Section 18(b) of H.R.Act for enforcement of its recommendation and once

                again that becomes binding on the concerned Government. Lastly, the

                learned counsel would quote a Latin maxim sublato fundamento cadit opus

                meaning thereby that ‘foundation being removed, the structure would fall.

                The recommendation being the foundation, if removed, the structure of the

                Act would fall. He would therefore, sum up that the Commission is not a

                toothless body and its recommendations are the result of the adjudication of

                the complaint preferred before it and therefore binding on the concerned

                Government.

                                   collaborate with them in furthering the work of the [UN]
                                   Commission on Human Rights. These -local human rights
                                   committees were not envisaged to be independent
                                   monitoring and investigation institutions that NHRIs are, but
                                   the ECOSOC resolution recognised the need for domestic
                                   human rights groups and anticipated the later development
                                   of NHRIs. However, there was little evidence of States
                                   rushing to respond to this request.
</p><p id="p_340">                                   Fourteen years later, in 1960, ECOSOC went further and
                                   was more specific. It recognized that national institutions
                                   could play a unique role in the promotion and protection of
                                   human rights and invited States to establish and strengthen
                                   them. There were some stirrings in that direction but little
                                   action.
</p><p id="p_341">                                   After another 18 years, in 1978, the UN Commission on
                                   Human Rights took up the challenge of promoting domestic
                                   monitoring by specialised domestic institutions.
                                   As standard-setting in the field of human rights gained
                                   momentum during the 1960s and 1970s, discussions on
                                   national institutions became increasingly focused on the
                                   ways in which these bodies could assist in the effective
                                   implementation of these international standards. In 1978, the
                                   Commission on Human Rights decided to organize a seminar
                                   on national and local institutions to draft guidelines for the
                                   structure and functioning of such bodies. Accordingly, the
                                   Seminar on National and Local Institutions for the
                                   Promotion and Protection of Human Rights was held in
                                   Geneva from 18 to 29 September 1978, during which a
                                   series of guidelines was approved. These guidelines
                                   suggested that the functions of national institutions should
                                   be:
</p><p id="p_342">                                   (a) To act as a source of human rights information for the

</p><p id="p_343">                                   (b) To assist in educating public opinion and promoting

                                   regarding any particular state of affairs that may exist
                                   nationally and that the Government may wish to refer to

                       matters referred to them by the Government;
</p><p id="p_346">                       (e) To study and keep under review the status of legislation,

                       human rights to which it is party.
</p><p id="p_348">                       In regard to the structure of such institutions, the guidelines
                       recommended that they should:
</p><p id="p_349">                       (a) Be so designed as to reflect in their composition, wide
                       cross-sections of the nation, thereby bringing all parts of that
                       population into the decision-making process in regard to
                       human rights;
</p><p id="p_350">                       (b) Function regularly, and that immediate access to them
                       should be available to any member of the public or any
                       public authority;
</p><p id="p_351">                       (c) In appropriate cases, have local or regional advisory
                       organs to assist them in discharging their functions.
                       The guidelines were subsequently endorsed by the
                       Commission on Human Rights and by the General
                       Assembly. The Commission invited all Member States to
                       take appropriate steps for the establishment, where they did
                       not already exist, of national institutions for the protection
                       and promotion of human rights, and requested the Secretary-
                       General to submit a detailed report on existing national
                       institutions.
</p><p id="p_352">                       With this international encouragement, States began to
                       establish NHRIs. However, in spite of the international
                       encouragement, progress was slow. In 1990, there were
                       fewer than 20 NHRIs.18 Two events in the early 1990s led
                       to the rapid increase in NHRIs over the following 20 years.
                       1.4. The Paris workshop and the Paris Principles
                                 The first significant event was a workshop of NHRIs,
                                 convened by the UN Commission on Human Rights in Paris,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/ France, from 7 to 9 October 1991. The workshop was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">                                                   123</span>

                       attended by representatives of NHRIs and of States, the UN
                       and its agencies, intergovernmental organisations and NGOs.
                       The key participants for the first time were the NHRIs
                       themselves. The workshop was to review and update
                       information on existing NHRIs, review patterns of
                       cooperation of NHRIs with international institutions and
                       explore ways of increasing the effectiveness of NHRIs.
                       The workshop did what it was told to do but, in addition, and
                       far more importantly, it drafted the Principles relating to the
                       Status of National Institutions for the Promotion and
                       Protection of Human Rights (the Paris Principles). The Paris
                       Principles were endorsed by the UN Commission on Human
                       Rights in 1992 and by the General Assembly in 1993. They
                       are the standard against which NHRIs are assessed for
                       recognition and participation in the international human
                       rights system and are -the test of an institution‘s legitimacy
                       and credibility.
</p><p id="p_353">                        The Paris Principles are not lengthy – only about 1,200
                       words. They are quite general overall, though some parts are
                       very specific. -They provide a broad normative framework
                       for the status, structure, mandate, composition, power and
                       methods of operation of the principal domestic human rights
                       mechanism.

                       Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna, Austria, in
                       June 1993. The Vienna World Conference saw the
                       participation of NHRIs for the first time in such an important
                       international forum. They participated in their own rights,
                       not as members of their governments‘ delegations, as they
                       had until then in meetings of the UN Commission on Human
                       Rights. They had designated seating and independent
                       speaking rights in the Conference plenary sessions. They
                       played a major role in drafting and negotiating the
                       Conference statement, the Vienna Declaration and
                       Programme of Action (VDPA)
                                  Most importantly for NHRIs, the VDPA gave strong
                                 endorsement for the establishment and strengthening of

                                   Over the past 20 years, the most important UN bodies with
                                   human rights responsibilities have regularly passed
                                   resolutions on NHRIs. These resolutions continue the
                                   VDPA‘s recommendation to States for the establishment of
                                   NHRIs and, where established, their strengthening. They
                                   take account of developments each year. In particular, they
                                   have expanded the role of NHRIs within international human
                                   rights system, including the participation rights of NHRIs
                                   within the official inter-governmental forums, such as the
                                   UN Human Rights Council. It has now been proposed that
                                   NHRIs have recognition and status, including participation
                                   rights, in the General Assembly itself.
</p><p id="p_359">                                   The former Commission on Human Rights adopted an
                                   annual resolution on NHRIs for many years before its
                                   abolition in 2006. When the Human Rights Council was
                                   established to replace the Commission, it implemented
                                   Commission decisions relating to NHRI participation but it
                                   did not at first continue the practice of annual resolutions.
                                   That practice has now been revived and the Council has
                                   given the strongest endorsement yet to the important roles
                                   and functions of NHRIs established in accordance with the

                                   NHRIs has increased more than fivefold, from less than 20

                                   growth is due to the work of the High Commissioner for

                NHRIS in Human Rights matters in comparison with the regular Courts, she

                would particularly rely on the following two paragraphs in the Manual under

                Chapter &#x27;the Nature and Concept of NHRIs.
</p>
<p id="p_364">                                     &#x27;NHRIs do not compete with the courts. They complement
                                   the courts. Formally, they have similarities with the status of
                                   courts. Courts are set up under the State‘s constitution and
                                   laws. They too are independent institutions. Courts and
                                   NHRIs are both subject to and limited by the provisions of
                                   the laws that establish them. Both courts and NHRIs must
                                   operate according to the rule of law and the principles of
                                   natural justice and due process. The members of courts and
                                   of NHRIs are appointed through executive or legislative
                                   processes or some mix of the two. The funding of courts and
                                   NHRIs is determined through the ordinary budgetary
                                   processes of the State and requires some form of
                                   parliamentary approval and allocation. Both courts and
                                   NHRIs have responsibilities for the promotion and
                                   protection of human rights. Courts and NHRIs may have
                                   some    overlapping   responsibilities.    Most NHRIs,       for
                                   example, have jurisdiction to receive and investigate
                                   individual complaints of human rights violations and some
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/   NHRIs     have   power    to   make       binding,   enforceable

                                   determinations on those complaints, much as courts do. For
                                   the most part, however, courts and NHRIs have different but
                                   complementary roles and functions. NHRIs do things that
                                   courts cannot do or cannot do well.

                Commission to inflict punishment on the delinquent as a substitute for

                disciplinary proceedings to be initiated by the department concerned, nor it

                can hand out conviction or punishment under criminal law, but it can

                certainly make recommendation towards that and the same is enforceable.

                She would also draw the attention of this Court to the ‘Paris Principles’

                which according to the learned counsel, were the minimum international

                standards prescribed for NHRIs.

                                   functions effectively. The Paris Principles set out some of
                                   those powers, including:</blockquote><p id="p_369">

                                   * Certain additional powers that are implied in the broad
                                   mandates of NHRIs include the power to enter premises,
                                   including prisons and detention centres, for the purpose of
                                   inspection and investigation. These powers are necessary
                                   means of exercising NHRIs‘ broader responsibilities under
                                   the Paris Principles. It may also be that additional powers
                                   arise under other international law, for example, the Optional
                                   Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
                                   Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
                                    NHRIs with quasi-judicial competence necessarily require
                                   powers related to the performance of those responsibilities.
                                   Those powers are not specified in the Paris Principles but
                                   they are necessary to the responsibilities set out there. The
                                   powers are basic powers of investigation, including:
                                   * to take evidence from victims and witnesses
                                   * to compel the attendance of a witness for questioning,
                                   even if in custody
                                   * to obtain documents and information
                                   * to enter premises.
</p><p id="p_371">                                   The existence of a power requires the imposition of a penalty
                                   if any person or organisation fails to comply with an order
                                   issued pursuant to that power. NHRIs should be able to issue
                                   orders under their investigative powers and have the courts
                                   enforce the orders and penalise those who do not comply.&#x27;

                Commissions have been established to carry out the international

                obligations and also to fulfill the Constitutional goals. According to the

                of Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions whose Statute was

                adopted by the U.S.General Assembly and accredition was granted to the

                carrying out the mandate on the basis of &#x27;Paris Principles&#x27; adopted.

                Therefore, she would submit that so much importance has been given to the

                Human Rights Institutions and elaborate guidelines as to how those

                institutions should function in the realm of Human Rights Laws.

                therefore, submit that viewing from such Global perspective, the Human

                Rights Commission cannot be reduced to a helpless state and its

                                           [5] Several South Africans, including a Member of
                                   Parliament, lodged complaints with the Public Protector
                                   concerning aspects of the security upgrades that were being
                                   effected at the President’s Nkandla private residence. This
                                   triggered a fairly extensive investigation by the Public
                                   Protector into the Nkandla project.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_128">                                              [6] The Public Protector concluded that several
                                   improvements were non-security features. Since the State
                                   was in this instance under an obligation only to provide
                                   security for the President at his private residence, any
                                   installation that has nothing to do with the President’s
                                   security amounts to undue benefit or unlawful enrichment to
                                   him and his family and must therefore be paid for by him.

                                   the evolution of its powers over the years were dealt with in
                                   two judgments of the Supreme Court of Appeal.46 I do not
                                   think that much benefit stands to be derived from rehashing
                                   that history here. It suffices to say that a collation of some

                                   Public Protector was created to &#x27;strengthen constitutional
                                   democracy in the Republic&#x27;.47 To achieve this crucial
                                   objective, it is required to be independent and subject only to
                                   the Constitution and the law. It is demanded of it, as is the
                                   case with other sister institutions, to be impartial and to
                                   exercise the powers and functions vested in it without fear,
                                   favour or prejudice.48 I hasten to say that this would not
                                   ordinarily be required of an institution whose powers or
                                   decisions are by constitutional design always supposed to be
                                   ineffectual. Whether it is impartial or not would be irrelevant
                                   if the implementation of the decisions it takes is at the mercy
                                   of those against whom they are made. It is also doubtful
                                   whether the fairly handsome budget, offices and staff all
                                   over the country and the time and energy expended on

                                   decisions     were   meant    to   be       inconsequential.    The

                                   meaningless if institutions purportedly established to
                                   strengthen our constitutional democracy lacked even the
                                   remotest possibility to do so. [50] We learn from the sum-

                                   and personalities likely to be investigated, as with other
                                   Chapter Nine institutions, the Constitution guarantees the
                                   independence, impartiality, dignity and effectiveness of this
                                   institution as indispensable requirements for the proper
                                   execution of its mandate. The obligation to keep alive these

                                   impact is placed on organs of State. And the Public Protector
                                   is one of those deserving of this constitutionally-imposed
                                   assistance and protection. It is with this understanding that
                                   even the fact that the Public Protector was created, not by
                                   national legislation but by the supreme law, to strengthen our
                                   constitutional democracy, that its role and powers must be

                                   She is the embodiment of a biblical David, that the public is,

                                   is therefore to help uproot prejudice, impropriety, abuse of

                                   government and State-controlled institutions. The Public

</p><p id="p_440">                                   And the fact that her investigative and remedial powers
                                   target even those in the throne-room of executive raw power,
                                   is just as revealing. That the Constitution requires the Public
                                   Protector to be effective and identifies the need for her to be
                                   assisted and protected, to create a climate conducive to
                                   independence, impartiality, dignity and effectiveness,67
                                   shows just how potentially intrusive her investigative powers
                                   are and how deep the remedial powers are expected to cut.
                                   [67] The obligation to assist and protect the Public Protector
                                   so as to ensure her dignity and effectiveness is relevant to the
                                   enforcement of her remedial action. The Public Protector
                                   would arguably have no dignity and be ineffective if her
                                   directives could be ignored willy-nilly. The power to take
                                   remedial action that is so inconsequential that anybody,
                                   against whom it is taken, is free to ignore or second-guess, is
                                   irreconcilable with the need for an independent, impartial
                                   and dignified Public Protector and the possibility to
                                   effectively strengthen our constitutional democracy. The
                                   words &#x27;take appropriate remedial action&#x27; do point to a
                                   realistic expectation that binding and enforceable remedial
                                   steps might frequently be the route open to the Public
                                   Protector to take. &#x27;Take appropriate remedial action&#x27; and
                                   &#x27;effectiveness&#x27;, are operative words essential for the
                                   fulfilment of the Public Protector’s constitutional mandate.
                                   Admittedly in a different context, this Court said in Fose:
                                     &#x27;An appropriate remedy must mean an effective
                                     remedy, for without effective remedies for breach, the
                                     values underlying and the rights entrenched in the
                                     Constitution cannot properly be upheld or enhanced.
                                     Particularly in a country where so few have the means
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
                                     to enforce their rights through the courts, it is essential
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">                                                                149</span>

                                     that on those occasions when the legal process does
                                     establish that an infringement of an entrenched right
                                     has occurred, it be effectively vindicated.&#x27;
                                    [68] Taking appropriate remedial action is much more
                                   significant than making a mere endeavour to address
                                   complaints as the most the Public Protector could do in terms
                                   of the Interim Constitution. It connotes providing a proper,
                                   fitting, suitable and effective remedy for whatever complaint
                                   and against whomsoever the Public Protector is called upon
                                   to investigate. However sensitive, embarrassing and far
                                   reaching the implications of her report and findings, she is
                                   constitutionally empowered to take action that has that
                                   effect, if it is the best attempt at curing the root cause of the
                                   complaint. Remedial action must therefore be suitable and
                                   effective. For it to be effective in addressing the investigated
                                   complaint, it often has to be binding. In SABC v DA the
                                   Supreme Court of Appeal correctly observed:
</p><p id="p_441">                                     &#x27;The Public Protector cannot realise the constitutional
                                     purpose of her office if other organs of State may
                                     second-guess her findings and ignore her
                                     recommendations. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_202">Section 182(1)(c)</a> must accordingly
                                     be taken to mean what it says. The Public Protector
                                     may take remedial action herself. She may determine
                                     the remedy and direct the implementation. It follows
                                     that the language, history and purpose of <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_203">section
                                     182(1)(c)</a> make it clear that the Constitution intends for
                                     the Public Protector to have the power to provide an
                                     effective remedy for State misconduct, which includes
                                     the power to determine the remedy and direct its
                                     implementation.&#x27;
                                   [72] It has been suggested, initially by both the President and
                                   the National Assembly, that since the Public Protector does
                                   not enjoy the same status as a Judicial Officer, the remedial

                                   action she takes cannot have a binding effect. The President
                                   has since changed his position but it appears, only in relation
                                   to this case, not necessarily as a general proposition. By
                                   implication, whomsoever she takes remedial action against,
                                   may justifiably and in law, disregard that remedy, either out
                                   of hand or after own investigation. This very much accords
                                   with the High Court decision in DA v SABC to the effect
                                   that:
</p><p id="p_442">                                      &#x27;For these reasons I have come to the conclusion that
                                      the findings of the Public Protector are not binding and
                                      enforceable. However, when an organ of state rejects
                                      those findings or the remedial action, that decision
                                      itself must not be irrational.&#x27;
                                   It is, of course, not clear from this conclusion who is
                                   supposed to make a judgement call whether the decision to
                                   reject the findings or remedial action is itself irrational. A
                                   closer reading of this statement seems to suggest that it is the
                                   person against whom the remedial action was made who may
                                   reject it by reason of its perceived irrationality. And that
                                   conclusion is not only worrisome but also at odds with the
                                   rule of law.

                                   of 1993 arising out of SLP (Civil) No. 659 of 1991 the
                                   Commission directed the Bangalore Development Authority
                                   to pay Rs 2446 to the consumer for the expenses incurred by

                                   him. No misfeasance was found. The moment the authority
                                   came to know of the mistake committed by it, it took
                                   immediate action by alloting alternative site to the
                                   respondent. It was compensation for exact loss suffered by
                                   the respondent. It arose in due discharge of duties. For such
                                   acts or omissions the loss suffered has to be made good by
                                   the authority itself. But when the sufferance is due to mala

                                   then the nature of liability changes. The Commission under
                                   the Act could determine such amount if in its opinion the

                                   The jurisdiction and power of the courts to indemnify a
                                   citizen for injury suffered due to abuse of power by public
                                   authorities is founded as observed by Lord Hailsham in
                                   Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Broome13 on the principle that, an
                                   award of exemplary damages can serve a useful purpose in
                                   vindicating the strength of law&#x27;. An ordinary citizen or a
                                   common man is hardly equipped to match the might of the
                                   State or its instrumentalities. That is provided by the rule of
                                   law. It acts as a check on arbitrary and capricious exercise of
                                   power. In Rookes v. Barnard14 it was observed by Lord
                                   Devlin, &#x27;the servants of the government are also the servants
                                   of the people and the use of their power must always be
                                   subordinate to their duty of service&#x27;. A public functionary if
                                   he acts maliciously or oppressively and the exercise of power
                                   results in harassment and agony then it is not an exercise of
                                   power but its abuse. No law provides protection against it.
                                   He who is responsible for it must suffer it. Compensation or
                                   damage as explained earlier may arise even when the officer
                                   discharges his duty honestly and bona fide. But when it
                                   arises due to arbitrary or capricious behaviour then it loses
                                   its individual character and assumes social significance.
                                   Harassment of a common man by public authorities is
                                   socially abhorring and legally impermissible. It may harm
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/
                                   him personally but the injury to society is far more grievous.

                                   Crime and corruption thrive and prosper in the society due to
                                   lack of public resistance. Nothing is more damaging than the
                                   feeling of helplessness. An ordinary citizen instead of
                                   complaining and fighting succumbs to the pressure of
                                   undesirable functioning in offices instead of standing against
                                   it. Therefore the award of compensation for harassment by
                                   public authorities not only compensates the individual,
                                   satisfies him personally but helps in curing social evil. It may
                                   result in improving the work culture and help in changing
                                   the outlook. Wade in his book Administrative Law has
                                   observed that it is to the credit of public authorities that there
                                   are simply few reported English decisions on this form of

                                   includes     malicious      use     of     power,      deliberate
                                   maladministration and perhaps also other unlawful acts
                                   causing injury. One of the reasons for this appears to be

                                   The ratio of this decision has been applied and extended by
                                   English Courts in various situations. In Roncarelli v.
                                   Duplessis, the Supreme Court of Canada awarded damages
                                   against the Prime Minister of Quebec personally for
                                   directing the cancellation of a restaurant-owner&#x27;s liquor

                                   Witnesses, which was then unpopular with the authorities. It
                                   was observed that, &#x27;what could be more malicious than to
                                   punish this licensee for having done what he had an absolute
                                   right to do in a matter utterly irrelevant to the Alcoholic
                                   Liquor Act? Malice in the proper sense is simply acting for a

                                   the clerk of a local authority personally on the ground that he
                                   had procured the compulsory purchase of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                                   property wrongfully and in bad faith. In Farrington v.
                                   Thomson18 the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded
                                   damages for exercising a power the authorities knew they
                                   did not possess. A licensing inspector and a police officer
                                   ordered the plaintiff to close his hotel and cease supplying
                                   liquor. He obeyed and filed a suit for the resultant loss. The

                                   These notices were void, and the farmer was awarded
                                   damages on the ground that the notices were invalid and that
                                   the plaintiff was entitled to damages for misfeasance. This

                                     has undergone tremendous change with passage of time
                                     and change in socio economic outlook. The authority
                                     empowered to function under a Statute while
                                     exercising power discharges public duty. It has to act to
                                     subserve general welfare and common good. In
                                     discharging this duty honestly and bona fide, loss may
                                     accrue to any person. And he may claim compensation
                                     which may in circumstances be payable. But where the
                                     duty is performed capriciously or the exercise of power
                                     results in harassment and agony then the responsibility
                                     to pay the loss determined should be whose? In a
                                     modem society no authority can arrogate to itself the
                                     power to act in a manner which is arbitrary. It is
                                     unfortunate that matters which require immediate
                                     attention linger on and the man in the street is made to
                                     run from one end to other with no result. The culture of
                                     window clearance appears to be totally dead. Even in
                                     ordinary matters a common man who has neither the
                                     political backing nor the financial strength to match the
                                     inaction in public oriented departments gets frustrated

                                   administration, no doubt involves a vast amount of
                                   administrative discretion which shields the action of
                                   administrative authority. But where it is found that
                                   exercise of discretion was mala fide and the
                                   complainant is entitled to compensation for mental and
                                   physical harassment then the officer can no more claim
                                   to be under protective cover. When a citizen seeks to
                                   recover compensation from a public authority in
                                   respect of injuries suffered by him for capricious
                                   exercise of power and the National Commission finds
                                   it duly proved then it has a statutory obligation to
                                   award the same. It was never more necessary than
                                   today when even social obligations are regulated by
                                   grant of statutory powers. The test of permissive form
                                   of grant is over. It is now imperative and implicit in the
                                   exercise of power that it should be for the sake of
                                   society. When the court directs payment of damages or
                                   compensation against the State the ultimate sufferer is
                                   the common man. It is the tax payers&#x27; money which is
                                   paid for inaction of those who are entrusted under the
                                   Act to discharge their duties in accordance with law. It
                                   is, therefore, necessary that the Commission when it is
                                   satisfied that a complainant is entitled to compensation
                                   for harassment or mental agony or oppression, which
                                   finding of course should be recorded carefully on
                                   material and convincing circumstances and not lightly,
                                   then it should further direct the department concerned
                                   to pay the amount to the complainant from the public
                                   fund immediately but to recover the same from those

                India appearing for the Government of India as well as for NHRC would at

                the out set submit that the scope of H.R. Act and the recommendations of

                the Human Rights Commission cannot be enlarged beyond what is provided

                in the scheme of the Act. He would therefore, venture to draw the attention

                of this Court to the important provisions of H.R. Act in support of his

                principal contention. He would first rely on Section 12 of H.R.Act under

                Chapter III providing for &#x27;Functions and the powers of the Commission.

                According to the learned Additional Solicitor General, the said Section can

                be dissected into three categories.        The first one being <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_206">Section 12</a> in

                relation to receipt of complaint under Sub Clauses (a) (i) and (ii). The

                second part of it is Sub Clause (b) which is advisory and the third one is Sub

                Clauses (c) to (j) which are completely academic.       If these provisions are

                spilt into three categories and from that, perspective examining the functions

                and the powers of the Commission, it cannot be concluded that the inquiry

                undertaken by the Commission would be an adjudicatory exercise. It can at

                best be only a recommendation and recommendatory in nature.

                the violation of Human Rights is relatable only to Commission by a public

                servant which is not defined in the Act. However, &#x27;public servant&#x27; is defined

                under <a href="/doc/1052367/" id="a_207">Section 21</a> of Indian Penal Code.        In effect, the learned Additional

                Solicitor General is attempting to impress upon this Court that the

                Commission of violation of human rights must always mean that it is by a

                servant in the service of the Government or under the service of the local

                authority, Corporation etc., which has a characteristics of the State.

                refer to Section 13 of H.R. Act which delineates the powers relating to the

                inquiries by the Commission. He would draw the attention of this Court

                parallel to similar provisions in Section 4 of the C.I. Act. Likewise, he

                akin to Sub Clauses of Section 5 of C.I. Act. The learned Addl.Solicitor

                General would therefore, submit that cumulatively taken together, the

                akin to the trial of the criminal Court or any other Court and the inquiry by

                the Commission is some kind of investigation and nothing more than that.

                In effect, the Commission is not exercising adversarial jurisdiction, but it is

                only exercising inquisitorial jurisdiction. According to the learned ASG,

                both the Sections 15 and 16 of H.R. Act negate <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_211">Sections 145</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_212">155</a> of the

                Evidence Act. The learned ASG would also draw the reference to Section

                17 of H.R.Act to elaborate on the use of expression over &#x27;inquiry into

                complaints&#x27;. ‘Inquiry’ by no stretch of legal standards can be equated to

                ‘trial’ or ‘adjudication’. It is, in fact, &#x27;inquiring into complaints&#x27; would mean

                collecting of facts and presenting the same to the Government as

                recommendations. No further meaning could be attached to such inquiry

                contemplated under the provisions of H.R. Act.

</p><p id="p_474">                (ii) and (iii). According to him, Sub Clause (ii) is a residuary Clause, Sub

                Clause (i) provides payment of compensation or damages. Compensation

                can mean equivalence like solatium payable under the provisions of the

                <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_214">Land Acquisition Act</a> for acquisition of land by the State from its owners.

                On the other hand, damages is a tortious claim. The learned Addl.Solicitor

                General would underscore that no specific provisions have been

                incorporated in the Act to determine the quantum of compensation, nor any

                method or standard         has been found in the scheme of the Act for

                determination of damages payable. According to the learned Addl.Solicitor

                General, there has to be a proper mechanism of taking evidence for the

                purpose of arriving at the quantum of compensation or damages payable.

                No such procedure is available in the <a href="/doc/1652403/" id="a_215">Scheme of the Act</a> and therefore, the

                recommendation for payment of compensation for damages as found under

                <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_216">Section 18</a> (a)(i) can never be construed as a result of adjudicatory process

                binding on the Government. The learned Addl.Solicitor General would also

                submit that the enactments, like <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_217">Arbitration Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_218">Consumer Protection

                Act</a> have provided comprehensive procedure for determination of

                compensation and damages payable while in H.R. Act, such procedure is

                conspicuously absent. Therefore, in the absence of any proper procedure

                contemplated in the Act, any recommendation towards compensation or

                damages can never said to be binding and enforceable.

                of human rights violation, only Human Rights Courts as provided under

                Section 30 of H.R. Act would have jurisdiction. It is the Government alone

                which can prosecute the offender of human rights violation pursuant to any

                recommendation by the Commission.           Likewise, for compensation and

                damages, the Commission is not the proper forum for determination of

                either compensation or damages.          Therefore, the contention that the

                Commission’s recommendations are binding is not a valid submission,

                which can draw support from the <a href="/doc/1652403/" id="a_219">Scheme of the Act</a>.



</p><p id="p_476">                          127. The learned Addl.Solicitor General would also refer to various

                provisions contained under Chapter II of National Human Rights

                Commission (Procedure) Regulations 1997. In fact, he has taken this Court

                through almost all the provisions contained in the Regulations as to the

                procedure contemplated in the Regulations while dealing with complaints.

                He would submit that from the entirety of the Regulations it could be easily

                understood that no standard or effective procedure is outlined for

                quantifying compensation or damages. In fact, <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_220">section 18</a> itself does not

                deal        with the expression &#x27;determination&#x27; but it only deals with the

                &#x27;recommendation&#x27; for making payment of compensation and damages.

                Cumulatively, one looks at both the Regulations and the scheme of the Act,

                the recommendation made under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_221">Section 18</a> is not a result of adjudicatory

                proceeding of the Commission and consequently, it cannot be said it is

                binding on the concerned Government or authority. He would also submit

                that once the Commission assumes the role of a party before the Hon’ble

                Supreme Court of India or High Court as the case may be under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_222">Section 18</a>

</p><p id="p_477">                (b) of H.R. Act, the question of                  its recommendation binding on the

                Government would not arise at all. If the recommendation is based on the

                adjudication, the Commission is not under any legal obligation to approach

                the Constitutional Court for enforcement of the same.                          Therefore, the

                framers of the Act, have clearly intended that the recommendations of the

                Commission under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_223">Section 18</a> are ‘recommendatory’                           simpliciter and

                nothing more.              He would refer National Human Rights Commission

                with the stand of the Government. But before making her submissions on

                the merits of the terms of Reference, she submitted that the very Reference

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_177">                                                          182</span>

                itself was not necessary as there were no conflict of views as to the power of

                the H.R.Commission. The foremost of her submission is that the

                recommendation of the Commission is neither an order nor the same is in

                the nature of adjudicated decision and hence it is not binding on the

                concerned Government. It is only an obligation on the Government to

                consider the recommendation and not necessarily that the Government is

                bound by the recommendation. According to her, when a recommendation

                is made and a report is submitted, the Government can call for explanation

                from the delinquent servant and thereafter, the Government can pass orders

                and till such orders are passed,           no cause of action would arise for

                delinquent to feel aggrieved. In case, the Government decides to launch

                prosecution on the basis of the recommendation of the Commission, it has

                to resort to Section 173 of Cr.P.C.

                compensation, recovery of such compensation paid or payable to the victim,

                would have to be recovered from the delinquent/Government servant after

                initiating appropriate proceedings under the relevant Service Rules.

                which formed the basis of the enactment ought to be the guiding force in

                understanding the scheme of the Act. The scope of the enquiry by the

                Commission and its recommendations are to be interpreted by the provisions

                of the Statute as contained therein. She would also submit regarding the

                According to her, the Act was brought into force to instill more confidence

                in the minds of the people at large, as the Government does not want to be a

                                   v. Texas (Vide Weaver on Constitutional Law, p.404), &#x27;laws
                                   are not abstract propositions...but are expressions of policy
                                   arising out of specific difficulties addressed to the attainment
                                   of specific ends by the use of specific remedies.&#x27; In my
                                   opinion, if the legislative policy is clear and definite and as
                                   an effective method of carrying out that policy a discretion is
                                   vested by the Statute upon a body of administrators or
                                   officers to make selective application of the law to certain
                                   classes or groups of persons, the Statute itself cannot be
                                   condemned as a piece of discriminatory legislation. After all
                                   &#x27;the law does all that is needed when it does all that it can,
                                   indicates a policy.... and seeks to bring within the lines all
                                   similarly situated so far as its means allow&#x27;&#x27;. In such eases,
                                   the power given to the executive body would import a duty
                                   on it to classify the subject- matter of legislation in
                                   accordance with the objective indicated in the Statute. The
                                   discretion that is conferred on official agencies in such
                                   circumstances is not an un- guided discretion; it has to be
                                   exercised in conformity with the policy to effectuate which
                                   the direction is given and it is in relation to that objective
                                   that the propriety of the classification would have to be
                                   tested.&#x27;

<blockquote id="blockquote_184">                                   &#x27; .....This is where the draftsmen of Acts of Parliament have
                                   often been unfairly criticized. A judge, believing himself to
                                   be fettered by the supposed rule that he must look to the
                                   language and nothing else, laments that the draftsmen have
                                   not provided for this or that, or have been guilty of some or
                                   other ambiguity. It would certainly save the judges trouble
                                   if Acts of Parliament were drafted with divine prescience
                                   and perfect clarity. In the absence of it, when a defect
                                   appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the
                                   draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive task of
                                   finding the intention of Parliament, and he must do this not
                                   only from the language of the Statute, but also from a
                                   consideration of the social conditions which gave rise to it,
                                   and of the mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then
                                   he must supplement the written word so as to give &#x27;force
                                   and life&#x27; to the intention of the legislature. That was clearly

                                   his second volume Eyston v Studd. Put into homely
                                   metaphor it is this: A judge should ask himself the question:
                                   If the makers of the Act had themselves come across this
                                   ruck in the texture of it, how would they have straightened
                                   it out? He must then do as they would have done. A judge
                                   must not alter the material of which it is woven, but he can
                                   and should iron out the creases. Approaching this case in
                                   that way, I cannot help feeling that the legislature had not
                                   specifically in mind a contingent burden such as we have
                                   here. If it had would it not have put it on the same footing
                                   as an actual burden? I think it would. It would have
                                   permitted an increase of rent when the terms were so
                                   changed as to put a positive legal burden on the landlord. If
                                   the parties expressly agreed between themselves the amount
                                   of the increase on that account the court would give effect
                                   to their agreement. But if, as here, they did not direct their
                                   minds to the point, the court has itself to assess the amount
                                   of the increase. It has to say how much the tenant should
                                   pay &#x27;in respect of&#x27; the transfer of this burden to the landlord.
                                   It should do this by asking what a willing tenant would
                                   agree to pay and a willing landlord would agree to accept in
                                   respect of it. Just as in the earlier cases the courts were able
                                   to assess the value of the &#x27;fair wear and tear&#x27; clause, and of a
                                   &#x27;cooker.&#x27; so they can assess the value of the hot water clause
                                   and translate it fairly in terms of rent; and what applies to
                                   hot water applies also to the removal of refuse and so forth.</blockquote><p id="p_565">

                                   Rights Act, 1993, the power of review conferred on the civil
                                   court was available to the Commission. As the earlier order
                                   was not a decision on merits but merely an order abstaining
                                   from further enquiry the Commission felt that there was no
                                   bar to reconsider the entire issue in the interest of justice.
                                   The second objection based on Regulation 8(1)(b) of
                                   NH.R.C (Procedure Regulations) which bars complaints
                                   with regard to matters that are &#x27;subjudice&#x27; was rejected with
                                   the observation that the question of violation of human

                                   Statute, is bound by its provisions. Its duties and functions
                                   are defined and circumscribed by the Act. Of course, as any
                                   other statutory functionary, it undoubtedly has incidental or

                                   should necessarily act within the parameters prescribed by

                                   and to afford redressal on account of certain statutory fetters
                                   or handicaps, the aggrieved persons are not without other

                                      for assessment is not a period of limitation. The

                                   contention is clearly erroneous, inasmuch as the question of
                                   law does arise for consideration squarely. Apart from that, it
                                   is not necessary for the purpose of law reference to a Full

                                    on the one hand and those of the courts on the other. The role
                                    ofthe Commission should, therefore, be confined to those
                                    which do not conflict with the role of the investigative
                                    agencies and the courts. Violation of human rights is

                                    would also be a gross negligence not being able to take
                                    preventive measures. It would be actionable under the

                                    statutory functions of the courts, there is going to be a greater
                                    confusion and duplication where the victims or the

                                    both. If in each case it is going to result in a parallel inquiry,
                                    it mayeventually result in more harassment of the
                                    complainant because he has got other bodies as well to cope

                          pre-adjudicatory activity, the Commission would be able to
                          play a meaningful role. The significant role which the

                          the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is the sole prerogative of
                          the concerned Government to either grant sanction or to
                          withhold it to prosecute judges and public servants. The
                          concerned Government acts in the best publicinterest in
                          granting or withholding the sanction. If the grant or
                          withholding of sanction is brought within the purview of the
                          Commission, it would avoid overlapping of conflict between
                          the functions of the Commission on the one hand and the
                          investigative and adjudicatory machinery on the other.&#x27;

                                 namely civil, criminal and public law. The Society as well as
                                 the victims of Human rights violations should be able to

                                 commission and the consequent reports should be regarded

                         made available in terms of Clause 11(1) of the bill. The idea
                         is that this commission should become a part of the system
                         of administration of justice so that the work of this
                         commission can be of actual use for the society and the
                         victims of Human Rights violations. I feel that the work of
                         this Commission can be useful in the three areas of law.
                         Wherever there is violation of Human Rights, the three areas
                         of law at once come into picture. The Supreme Court has
                         also now held that apart from the Criminal and Civil
                         liability, whenever there is an injury caused due to human
                         rights violation, the public law springs into action and the
                         courts can even award compensation.

                         associated with the work of the commission should not be
                         below the rank of the Director General of Police. So, the
                         investigations to be carried on by the police officers not
                         below the rank of D.G. should be capable of being made use

                         Court can then proceed in accordance with the law.
                         Similarly, in the field of civil law, I feel the evidence
                         collected by the commission in exercise of the powers of
                         Clause 13 should be made admissible in courts of civil or
                         public law. Under this Clause, the Commission has vast
                         powers.</blockquote><p id="p_602">
</p><p id="p_603">                                 I make this suggestion because this Commission is
                                 conceived of only as an investigation body. That is why, I
                                 did not want that the work of this Commission would not be
                                 capable of being used and it would, like all similar bodies,
                                 only produce reports which would contain recommendations,
                                 which would lie in the shelves, to be read or not to be read
                                 and if read, may be or may not be acted upon. Since we are
                                 engaged in a very serious exercise of reinforcing our resolve
                                 to uphold Human Rights, I examined the whole thing from
                                 the perspective of our freedom struggle through which we
                                 went and which was nothing but a struggle for upholding
                                 basic human rights. Our constitution provides for all these
                                 human rights. Our law courts are there to enforce these
                                 human rights. We are only making the enforcement
                                 machinery for protection of these human rights which we

                                   country i.e. Our Constitution. We are merely reiterating our
                                   resolve and making it more effective and that is why I
                                   suggested that the work of the Commission must be capable
                                   of being used in the courts of civil, criminal and public law
                                   jurisdiction. Clause 19 should, therefore, be suitably
                                   amended providing therein __ the investigation by the
                                   Commission shall be regarded as an investigation conducted
                                   under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_268">Section 173(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure
                                   because unless because this is done the investigation will be
                                   an exercise incapable of being used in law.&#x27;
                                   &#x27;8. Steps after Inquiry (Clause 18):
</p><p id="p_604">                                   The powers given to the Commission under this clause is
                                   like the one given to any other Commission. Every litigant
                                   can approach the Supreme Court. But as you know, unlike
                                   the foreign courts, our Supreme Court has gone much
                                   further. Anybody can move the Supreme Court for human
                                   rights violations and get relief. Now, what is not adequate
                                   here is the power of the Commission to award compensation
                                   on violation of human rights. This is the most important part
                                   and without this power it will be nothing and will serve no
                                   purpose at all. You give powers to the Commission to
                                   adjudicate and award compensation. Parliament has already
                                   passed laws like the MRTP Act, the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_269">Consumer Act</a>. They
                                   have the authority to adjudicate and award compensation.
                                   There is no doubt that the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_270">Consumer Act</a> has proved to be
                                   very effective. This Commission also should have the power
                                   to adjudicate and award compensation. You are having a
                                   very high-powered Commission with a Supreme Court Judge
                                   as their Chairman. There is no reason why you should deny
                                   the right to this Commission to award compensation,
                                   because it you do not do that, they will merely be a
                                   recommendatory body. What do they do? Therefore, I think
                                   this power must be provided to the Commission.&#x27;

                be vested with the Commission was discussed extensively by the Experts

                and suggestions were also made in the Standing Committee&#x27;s discussion to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_200">                                                            205</span>

                provide            tooth to the Commission, ultimately those suggestions for

                providing effective power to the Commission were not accepted and

                specifically incorporated eventually, when the Bill became an Act. In fact,

                the learned counsel would refer to a discussion, wherein, it was observed

                that the Commission will be a &#x27;fact finding body&#x27; in regard to the steps to be

                taken after inquiry. According to him, in the Standing Committee, several

                measures were suggested to strengthen the Commission&#x27;s judicial power and

                jurisdiction in order to bring it on par with the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction. But

                ultimately, the measures suggested had been watered down and the Act was

                passed by the Parliament and in effect, making recommendation of the

                Commission only as a &#x27;recommendatory&#x27; and not beyond that. There cannot

                be any other conclusion, since various suggestions for strengthening the

                Commission as found in the discussion of the Standing Committee,

                ultimately have not been accepted when the Bill was finally passed. He

                would, in that context, refer to debate which took place in the Parliament at

                the time of enacting H.R.Act in the Eighth Session of Parliament on

                14.12.1993. He would refer to the following paragraphs in regard to the

                status of the Commission.

                                   the beginning, the Commission had been conceived as a fact
                                   finding body, and there appeared to be general consensus,
                                   even in the preparatory Committee, that there should be no
                                   duplication with existing structure and the Judiciary. The
                                   Commission is not conceived as a stand alone institution but
                                   as a body which, through its multiple function, including
                                   inquiry into specific cases, can bring about a much sharper

                                   greater accountability into the system. Even so, a number of
                                   provisions have been made in the Bill to enhance the
                                   effectiveness of the Commission, viz its power to publish its
                                   reports immediately, reduction in the time period within
                                   which the concerned Government will report to the
                                   Commission, its ability to approach the higher judiciary for
                                   writs and order on its findings, and the power to intervene in
                                   on-going judicial proceedings. There are now additional
                                   provisions to enable the constitution of Special Investigation
                                   Teams, setting up of Human Rights Courts and appointment

                beginning, the Commission was conceived only as a &#x27;fact finding body&#x27;. He

                would also refer to the other Debate as to the status of the Commission.

                                   body, this could have been brought under the purview ofthe

                                   amendments with respect to the functioning of the
                                   Commission. The function of the Commission is only to
                                   inquire into and ask the respective Governments to take
                                   action against offenders. As many of my Hon. Friends have
                                   pointed out here, I am of the view that the Commission must
                                   be given sufficient power of initiate proceedings against the
                                   offenders. Unless such power has given to the Commission,
                                   the Commission will be only a fact finding body, as rightly
                                   or wrongly Interpreted in the Statement of Objects and

                                   Sir, the idea that we have is that it being such a highbody, the
                                   decisions are not taken by majority. It is a consensus decision
                                   that they have to take. They will create a very healthy

                Debates in the Parliament which preceded the passing of the Bill, the frame

                work of H.R. Act was envisaged only as an advisory body, a fact finding

                institution. In fact, when suggestions were made by certain members of the

                Parliament in order to provide tooth to the Commission, it was not agreed to,

                but there was a general consensus that the Government would be under the

                obligation to consider the recommendation of the Commission. According

                to the learned counsel, the Hon&#x27;ble Home Minister, who moved the Bill, in

                fact, compared the Human Rights Commission to the Finance Commission,

                and assured the members that the recommendations of the Finance

                Commission though were not binding on the Government, but as a matter of

                healthy convention invariably, the recommendations of the Finance

                Commission were accepted by the Government of India.                       Likewise,

                Governments are expected to follow the healthy convention and would also

                accept the recommendation of the Human Rights Commission though the

                recommendations are not binding by the very nature of the scheme of the

                                   as a result the Commission is nicknamed as &#x27;toothless tiger&#x27;. At
                                   the one hand the <a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_276">Section 2(d)</a> of the Protection of Human
                                   Rights Act, 1993, defined these rights as enforceable by the
                                   court of Law, and the Section I 3(5) provides that every
                                   proceeding before the Commission shall be deemed to be a
                                   judicial proceeding, and the Commission has also been
                                   equipped with the powers of a Civil Court while enquiring a
                                   complaint, as per <a href="/doc/661535/" id="a_277">Section 13(1)</a>, but when it is concluded that
                                   human rights arc violated, and there should be remedial
                                   measures to protect the human rights and grant of
                                   compensations to the victims, the powers of the Commission
                                   as per <a href="/doc/95528664/" id="a_278">Section 18(c)</a> of the Protection of Human Rights Act,
                                   1993 are confined to make recommendations to the
                                   government. Sometimes it is felt that the recommendations are
                                   left to the sweet will of the government, and they arc a liberty
                                   to ignore the Commission&#x27;s recommendations. It is a fact that
                                   the recommendations are not simple opinions and advices, or
                                   consultancy, but these are orders in proceedings where the
                                   Commission after giving all possible opportunities to the State
                                   authorities has taken view to recommend monetary
                                   compensation to the victims or the family members of the
                                   deceased victims, as the case may be, or to initiate prosecution
                                   of the violator of human rights of the victim. The aforesaid
                                   provisions of the Act indicate that the compliance of the
                                   recommendations made the Commission, under the Act,
                                   cannot be left to the discretion of the government, but the
                                   government is under obligation to pay regard to the
                                   recommendations.&#x27;




</p><p id="p_630">                          171. To further fortify the position, finally, the learned counsel would

                refer to two of the paragraphs of N.H.R.C. Reports wherein, N.H.R.C

                concluded that there are decisions of the Courts defining the power of the

                Commission, however, the Commission felt that suitable amendment is

                required in the Act for greater clarity. Para nos.19.5 and 19.6 are extracted

                                      &#x27;19.5 Though the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in

                                   Others (WRIT - C No. - 15570 of2016), while upholding the
                                   view that due regard should be paid by the State
                                   Governments to the recommendations made by the
                                   Commission, has observed as follows:-
</p><p id="p_632">                                        &#x27;&#x27;.... the Commission is not merely a body which is to
                                      render opinions which will have no sanctity or efficacy
                                      in enforcement, cannot be accepted. This is evident
                                      from the provisions of clause (b) of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_279">Section 18</a> under
                                      which the Commission is entitled to approach the
                                      Supreme Court or the High Court for such directions,
                                      orders or writs as the Court may deem fit and
                                      necessary. Governed as we are by the rule of law and
                                      by the fundamental norms of the protection oflife and
                                      liberty and human dignity under a constitutional order,
                                      it will not be open to the State Government to disregard
                                      the view of the Commission. The Commission has
                                      directed the State Government to report compliance.
                                      The State Government is at liberty to challenge the
                                      order of the Commission on merits since no appeal is
                                      provided by the Act. But it cannot in the absence of the
                                      order being set aside, modified or reviewed disregard
                                      the order at its own discretion. While a challenge to the
                                      order of the Commission is available in exercise of the
                                      power of judicial review, the State Government subject
                                      to this right, is duty bound to comply with the order.
                                      Otherwise the purpose of enacting the legislation would
                                      be defeated. The provisions of the Act which have been
                                      made to enforce the constitutional protection of life and
                                      liberty by enabling the Commission to grant
                                      compensation for violations of human rights would be
                                      rendered nugatory. A construction which will produce
                                      that result cannot be adopted and must be rejected.&#x27;
                                   &#x27;19.6 But there have been some contrary decisions of High
                                   Courts to the effect that acceptance of recommendations of
                                   the Commission may be left to the discretion of the
                                   concerned government. It is therefore felt the position in the
                                   matter be clarified by a suitable amendment in the Act.&#x27;

                observations of the N.H.R.C would make the position extremely clear that

                the recommendation of the Human Rights Commission is not an order to be

                binding on the concerned Government or authority. He would therefore,

                submit that the N.H.R.C itself has understood that its recommendation was

                versus Bihar Human Rights Commission), wherein, a Division Bench of

                the Patna High Court dealt with the power of the Commission and held that

                it is not a judicial body. He would particularly refer to paragraph no.30 of

                whether the Commission can give a direction or mandate for payment of

                                   raised by the petitioner, we are of the view that the Commission
                                   has no jurisdiction and power to give any mandate or direction
                                   for payment of money which will be clear from the provisions
                                   of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_283">Section 18</a> (a) of the Act, which empowers the Commission
                                   to make recommendation to the concerned Government or

                                   its inquiry report together with its recommendations to the
                                   concerned Government or authority and they in their turn shall

                                   the Commission. Thus, it is clear that neither the Government
                                   nor the authority is bound to take action as per the
                                   recommendations of the Commission. It is for them either to
                                   accept or not to accept the recommendations and the
                                   Government authority concerned will forward its comments on
                                   that report. It is clear from clause (f) of the said Section that
                                   the Commission will publish its inquiry report together with the
                                   comments of the concerned Government or authority, if any,
                                   and the action taken or proposed to be taken by the concerned
                                   Government or authority on the recommendations of the

                                   optional measure, which might be taken by the Commission
                                   instead of inquiry or order, the Commission itself can approach
                                   the Supreme Court or the High Court for any directions, orders
                                   of writs as that Court may deem necessary. In view of the
                                   above discussion, we are of the view that this matter requires a

            Single Judge has clearly analyzed <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_285">Section 18</a> thoroughly and coherently that

            the Commission has no power of enforcement of its recommendation. In

            fact, the learned Judge has held that the statutory body like the Commission,

            its recommendations need to be given due respect and ought to be

            graciously accepted. However, it held that it cannot said to be binding.

                                   proceedings in such cases. Reading these two clauses
                                   together it is obvious to us that ‘inquire’ is not making note
                                   on the file but something more. We are dealing with children
                                   who cannot complain. The Commissions are meant to protect
                                   children who have no voice. It is these Commissions who
                                   have to give voice and feelings to the distress calls of
                                   children. The Commission can, thereafter, take action by
                                   itself if permitted under law or can recommend initiation of
                                   proceedings in accordance with law.&#x27;

                                   action which a Commission can take is also clearly set out in
                                   Section 15 of the CPCR Act which empowers the Commission
                                   to make recommendations to the concerned Government or
                                   authority for initiation of proceedings including prosecution or
                                   such other action as the Commission may deem fit. This is a
                                   recommendatory power but normally we would expect that the
                                   Government would accept the recommendation of the
                                   Commission in this regard. The second power given to the

                                   Court for an appropriate writ, order or direction. The
                                   Commission can also recommend the grant of interim relief to
                                   a victim under Section 15(iii) of the CPCR Act. The aforesaid
                                   provisions which set out the powers relating to inquiries and
                                   steps to be taken thereafter clearly indicate that the inquiry
                                   contemplated is more than only gathering of information, and
                                   is more in the nature of an investigation or inquisition.&#x27;

                                   Rights Commission, it is contended before me by learned

                                   Rights Commission. The submissions of the learned Senior
                                   Counsel for the Petitioners is that the State Human Rights
                                   Commission is a Judicial Forum and therefore the executive
                                   authorities cannot ignore the same and there cannot be a
                                   further proceeding before any other Court or Forum.

                                   Rights Commission is summary in nature and the conclusion
                                   arrived at by the Commission cannot deprive the aggrieved
                                   persons to take appropriate action either before a Civil Court
                                   or before a Criminal Court. Just as the learned Senior
                                   Counsel had commented about the Revenue Divisional
                                   Officer&#x27;s enquiry and witnesses having been examined
                                   behind the back of the petitioners, the manner of enquiry
                                   before the Commission is also summary. The witnesses have
                                   not been subjected to any cross-examination. The official
                                   status of the two authorities are certainly different, but the
                                   nature of enquiry does not differ. Therefore, persons feeling
                                   aggrieved by the Commission· s finding that there is no
                                   violation of Human Rights, cannot be deprived of
                                   appropriate remedies before the appropriate Court. To hold
                                   so, would be in fact violation of human rights, it is also
                                   necessary to bear in mind that even in cases where
                                   Commission awards any compensation or finds any one
                                   guilty of violation of human rights, there is no specific
                                   power to execute the award or to punish. The Commission

                                   enquiry and proceedings before the Commission, in cases
                                   where the commission finds that there is no violation of
                                   human rights or custodial regulations, such a finding cannot
                                   be a bar for the Government or the victims to approach the
                                   regular Civil or Criminal Courts for appropriate action or

                regard to the recommendation of the Commission holding that there was no

                human rights violation. The learned Judge however, held that the finding

                was not binding on the persons still feel aggrieved and held that if there was

                human rights violation, such person can always seek remedies before the

                appropriate Court.            The learned Judge further held that even if the

                Commission awards any compensation and finds any one guilty of violation

                of human rights, no specific power is found in the Act for execution of the

                award or to impose punishment.                   The learned Judge held that the

                Commission can only recommend and nothing beyond that. The learned

                Judge, in fact, also held that the proceedings before the Commission is

                summary in nature and therefore, the learned counsel would submit that

                what flows from the observations of the learned Judge is that the proceeding

                Government. On the same line of his submission, the learned counsel would

                also refer to paragraph no.16 of a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of

                                   scheme to the Minister of Transport, who may confirm it
                                   with or without modifications. Similarly the Minister of
                                   Transport comes to no decision. He submits the order to the
                                   Houses of Parliament, who may approve it with or without
                                   modifications. The Houses of Parliament may put anything
                                   into the order they please, whether consistent with the Act
                                   of 1919, or not. Until they have approved, nothing is
                                   decided. and in truth the whole procedure, draft scheme,
                                   inquiry, order, confirmation, approval, is only part of a
                                   process by which Parliament is expressing its will, and at
                                   no stage is subject to any control by the Courts. It is
                                   unnecessary to emphasize the constitutional importance of
                                   this contention. Given its full effect, it means that the
                                   checks and safeguards which have been imposed by Act of
                                   Parliament, including the freedom from compulsory taking,
                                   can be removed, and new and onerous and inconsistent
                                   obligations imposed without an Act of Parliament, and by
                                   simple resolution of both Houses of Parliament. I do not
                                   find it necessary to determine whether, on the proper
                                   construction of the Statute, resolutions of the two Houses
                                   of Parliament could have the effect claimed. In the
                                   provision that the final decision of the Commissioners is
                                   not to be operative until it has been approved by the two
                                   Houses of Parliament I find nothing inconsistent with the
                                   view that in arriving at that decision the Commissioners
                                   themselves are to act judicially and within the limits
                                   prescribed by Act of Parliament, and that the Courts have

                                   that it is the order of the Commissioners that eventually
                                   takes effect; neither the Minister of Transport who
                                   confirms, nor the Houses of Parliament who approve, can
                                   under the Statute make an order which in respect of the
                                   matters in question has any operation. I know of no
                                   authority which compels me to hold that a proceeding
                                   cannot be a judicial proceeding subject to prohibition or
                                   certiorari because it is subject to confirmation or approval,
                                   even where the approval has to be that of the Houses of
                                   Parliament. The authorities are to the contrary.&#x27;

                              on such complaint, the Commission had directed him to appear
                              for an enquiry and these proceedings were put to challenge before
                              the Division Bench in W.P(MD).No.11900 of 2009. The Court
                              after taking into consideration the nature of the complaint pointed
                              out that the only allegation in the complaint is that no arrest has
                              been made by the Police for more than a month and this is
                              because of political influence. The petitioner as Deputy
                              Superintendent of Police has given an explanation as to what
                              steps has been taken pursuant to the registration of the case.
                              However, the Court thought fit not to go into the sufficiency of
                              the explanation offered as it was fully satisfied that there was no
                              specific allegation against the petitioner therein that he had
                              exceeded in exercise of his official power or in any manner acted
                              in violation of human rights. Furthermore, it was pointed out that
                              the Commission without embarking upon the independent
                              enquiry through its agency had mechanically issued summons to
                              the petitioner and for such reasons, the writ petition was allowed
                              and the proceedings were quashed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_249">                                      6.The said decision would equally apply to the case of the
                              petitioner herein. In fact, the case of the petitioner is far better in
                              the sense that there is absolutely no allegation of any violation of
                              human rights in the complaint dated 10.10.2009. Taking the
                              allegations in the complaint as it is and reading the same would
                              clearly establish that the complainant has not pointed out any
                              violation of human rights, more particularly, to fall within the
                              definition of Human Rights as defined under <a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_332">Section 2(d)</a> of the
                              Act. Furthermore, the delay in the instant case is also fatal
                              because no explanation has been offered by the complainant as to
                              why for more than two years, he had not raised any grievance
                              against the petitioner/Doctor. Further, the complaint does not
                              point out any violation committed by the petitioner in discharge
                              of her official duties. However, the admitted position is that the
                              petitioner had only conducted autopsy and the report has been
                              made available. Thus, in the absence of any specific allegation
                              against the petitioner for allegedly having violated any of the
                              human rights, the Commission without undertaking proper
                              exercise ought not to have issued summons to the petitioner.
                              Thus, we are fully satisfied that the complaint deserves to be
                              rejected at the very threshold and consequently, the summons
                              issued by the Commission is held to be bad in law&#x27;&#x27;.

                the basis of illegality and irrationality. In fact, the Division Bench has held

                Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court reported in (2016) 15 SCC 525 (Anitha Thakur

                and Others Vs. Government of Jammu and Kashmir and Others). This

                case was relied on by the learned counsel in order to impress upon this

                Bench as to the State’s liability in the realm of public law. He would rely on

                the observations made by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_250">                                     &#x27;The ratio of these precedents can be explained thus:
                              First, it is clear that a violation of fundamental rights due to
                              police misconduct can give rise to a liability under public law,
                              apart from criminal and tort law. Secondly, that pecuniary
                              compensation can be awarded for such a violation of
                              fundamental rights. Thirdly, it is the State that is held liable and,
                              therefore, the compensation is borne by the State and not the
                              individual police officers found guilty of misconduct. Fourthly,
                              this Court has held that the standard of proof required for
                              proving police misconduct such as brutality, torture and
                              custodial violence and for holding the State accountable for the
                              san1e, is high. It is only for patent and incontrovertible violation
                              of fundamental rights that such remedy can be made available.
                              Fifthly, the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not apply to
                              cases of fundamental rights violation and hence, cannot be used
                              as a defence in public law&#x27;&#x27;.</blockquote><p id="p_699">



</p><p id="p_700">                          202. According to the learned counsel, that as a vicarious obligation,

                the Government would have to bear liability in the first instance and

                thereafter, it can recover the compensation/damages paid by the Government

                to the victim, from the delinquents. In this regard, he would rely on a

                decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India reported in 2019 (13) SCC

                595 (Amol Vitthal Rao Kadu versus State of Maharashtra and others). He

                would rely on paragraph nos.4 to 7 which are extracted hereunder:

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_252">                                        &#x27;54. Thus, to sum up, it is now a well- accepted
                                        proposition in most of the jurisdictions, that
                                        monetary or pecuniary compensation is an
                                        appropriate and indeed an effective and sometimes
                                        perhaps the only suitable remedy for redressal of the
                                        established infringement of the fundamental right to
                                        life of a citizen by the public servants and the State
                                        is vicariously liable for their acts. The claim of the
                                        citizen is based on the principle of strict liability to
                                        which the defence of sovereign immunity is not
                                        available and the citizen must receive the amount of
                                        compensation from the State, which shall have the
                                        right to be indemnified by the wrongdoer. In the
                                        assessment of compensation, the emphasis has to be
                                        on the compensatory and not on punitive element.</blockquote>

                submit that the Commission in the case, NHRC had to approach the

                Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in regard to the large scale of human rights

                violation, as obviously the Commission had understood its limitation in

                passing any directive against any human rights violation on a mass scale.

                According to the learned counsel, in fact, the above decision was referred to

                by Mr.R.Sreenivas, learned counsel for SHRC in support of his contention

                that the Commission has the power to enforce its recommendation, but on

                the contrary it does not have such power as could be deduced from this

                decision. The learned counsel would then refer to a decision reported in

                (2004) 8 SCC 610 (National Human Rights Commissioner versus State of

                                   is, however, pointed out to us by the learned amicus curiae

                                   should be according to the one formulated by this Court in

                to highlight that in regard to riots in the State of Gujarat, the NHRC had to

                approach the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India for quantifying the payment of

                compensation to the victims of riot. Therefore, the learned counsel would

                submit that the Commission on its own, felt that its power was inadequate to

                deal with such situation and had to approach the Court under Section 18(b)

                of H.R. Act.

                other enactments where the appeal provision is provided. He would, in fact,

                refer to the <a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_341">Consumer Protection Act</a>, the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_342">Information Act</a> and also

                and only when such provisions are made available in the Statute,

                enforcement is possible. In fact, analogy drawn to the Arbitration and

                <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_346">Conciliation Act</a> appeared to be misplaced which was pointed out by the

                arbitral Tribunal is final and binding. However, the learned counsel would

                submit that the analogy was drawn only for the purpose of highlighting the

                point that even in the realm of private contractual law, the award rendered

                absence of any mechanism for complainant or delinquent to file an appeal

                when the Commission dismisses the complaint or pass the recommendation

                adverse to the delinquent, the recommendation remains recommendation

                simplicitor and nothing more. Moreover, the learned counsel would also

                submit that in certain cases of human rights violation both the SHRC and

                NHRC can take note of the violations simultaneously as fact finding bodies

                as there were no recognised hierarchy between the two. The learned counsel

<blockquote id="blockquote_261">                                           &#x27;13. The interpretative function of the Court is to
                                   discover the true legislative intent. It is trite that in
                                   interpreting a Statute the Court must, if the words are clear,
                                   plain, unambiguous and reasonably susceptible to only one
                                   meaning, give to the words that meaning, irrespective of
                                   the consequences. Those words must be expounded in their
                                   natural and ordinary sense. When a language is plain and
                                   unambiguous and admits of only one meaning no question
                                   of construction of Statute arises, for the Act speaks for
                                   itself. Courts are not concerned with the policy involved or
                                   that the results are injurious or otherwise, which may
                                   follow from giving effect to the language used. If the words
                                   used are capable of one construction only then it would not
                                   be open to the Courts to adopt any other hypothetical
                                   construction on the ground that such construction is more
                                   consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act. In
                                   considering whether there is ambiguity, the Court must
                                   look at the Statute as a whole and consider the
                                   appropriateness of the meaning in a particular context
                                   avoiding absurdity and inconsistencies or unreasonableness
                                   which may render the Statute unconstitutional.

                                   a purpose and the legislative intention is that every part of

                illustrate         as to how the interpretative function of the Court has to be

                exercised by discovering true legislative intent and efforts should be made

                to give effect to each and every word used by the legislature. According to

                the learned counsel, when the provisions of the Act are very clear and

                unambiguous, the question of any interpretation filling any gap would not

                arise at all as in the present case. The learned counsel would refer to an

                another decision reported in (2011) 11 SCC 334 (Grid Corporation of

                Orissa Limited and others versus Eastern Metals and Ferro Alloys and

                                    words of a Statute have to be read and understood in their
                                    natural, ordinary and popular sense. Where however the

                observation of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court regarding golden rule of

                interpretation. He would emphasise the legal position that interpretation for

                advancing the object of the provisions, can be exercised only when the

                language used in the Statute is capable of more than one understanding,

                meaning &#x27;construction&#x27;. In this case, the Act as such does not suffer from

                any ambiguity at all for this Court to indulge in interpretative exercise. The

                learned counsel therefore, would sum up that when the scheme of the Act is

                free from any lacunae or from any ambiguity, reading something more into

                the Statute may not be called for.

                WP.No.22760 of 2017 would make her submissions contending that the

                containing certain provisions relating to Settlement Commission, Finance

                Commission, Competition Commission of India, Central Vigilance

                Commission, Central Information Commission, Security Enforcement

                Bureau of India, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India,             Insurance

                Regulatory and Development Authority of India. According to the learned

                counsel, these enactments provide specific ambit of power to the

                Commission and other quasi judicial bodies under the respective statutues

                and those enactments have come into force just prior or immediately after

                H.R. Act, 1993. According to her, when the legislative intent is clearly

                reflected in those enactments of providing specific provisions clarifying

                their powers and the scope of their exercise, as far as H.R. Act is concerned,

                there is a concious omission to include any such provisions. Therefore, it is

                needless to emphasise that the power of the Commission is restricted only to

                make recommendations and nothing more can be read into the Act.

                would also suffer from human rights violation as they become defenceless.

                Commission under H.R. Act is only a fact finding body and only from that

                perspective, the decisions were rendered. According to the learned counsel,

                there is a material difference between two enactments and unfortunately, the

                judgements rendered earlier by various Courts in interpreting the provisions

                of H.R. Act, have lost sight of the most important and crucial provision as

                contained in <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_364">Section 18</a> (e) of H.R. Act. The learned counsel, as a matter of

                comparison, would refer to Sub Section (4) of Section 3 of the C.I. Act and

                Section 18(e) of H.R. Act.       As far as the C.I.Act is concerned, the

                recommendation made by the Commission constituted under the said Act is

                to be placed before the Legislature of the State along with memorandum of

                action taken there on. The Commission therefore, has no further role after

                making its recommendation.       As far as Section 18(e)    of H.R. Act is

                concerned, the Government is under a legal obligation to forward its

                comments on the report including the action take and proposed to be taken

                thereof to the Commission. Therefore, the scope and the ambit of &#x27;inquiry&#x27;

                and the recommendation of the Commission under H.R. Act can never be

                compared to the status and position of the Commission under C. I. Act.

                or modify the recommendations of the Commission. The learned counsel

                painstakingly explained the import and the contextual meaning of the words

                &#x27;&#x27;comments&#x27;&#x27; and &#x27;proposed to be taken&#x27; as found in Section 18(e) of H.R.

                Act. According to the learned counsel, that the expression &#x27;&#x27;comments&#x27;&#x27; as

                found in the said Section means that the Government is under legal

                obligation to provide remarks as to the action to be taken by it on various

                aspects, like payment of compensation, initiating criminal action against the

                violators and also departmental action if any. He would also add that the

                expression &#x27;proposed to be taken&#x27; may have to be read in conjunction and in

                tune with the entirety of Section and must receive liberal construction.



</p><p id="p_736">                          221. The learned counsel would further elaborate that the first limb of

                <a href="/doc/46143524/" id="a_366">Section 18(e)</a> i.e., &#x27;action taken&#x27;, is affirmative action and the second limb,

                i.e. &#x27;proposed to be taken&#x27; is positive reaction to the recommendation for

                timely response. The learned counsel would submit that the expression

                &#x27;proposed to be taken&#x27; must connote positive action and not any negative

                response. The learned counsel would therefore, submit that the fundamental

                premise of the said difference was not appreciated by the Courts which

                rendered the decisions, holding that the Commission&#x27;s recommendations

                were only recommendatory. The learned counsel would also submit that

                to     approach    the Constitutional   Court, does   not   mean that     the

                contemplated under <a href="/doc/46143524/" id="a_368">Section 18(e)</a> are altogether different and cannot be

                contained in <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_369">Section 18</a> (e) should be interpreted to give thrust and force to

                the scheme of the Act and not to defeat its purpose by literal or ordinary

                construction.

                                   Government of Uttar Pradesh instead of making the payment
                                   of monetary compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- to the next-of-
                                   kin of deceased, who had died in custody due to lack of
                                   proper and timely medical care, challenged the
                                   Commission’s        recommendations,       in    Case     No.
                                   16187/24/57/2012-JCD for the said payment of monetary
                                   compensation. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition
                                   and observed that &#x27;the State Government is at liberty to
                                   challenge the order of the Commission on merits since no
                                   appeal is provided by the Act. But it cannot in the absence
                                   of the order being set aside, modified or reviewed, disregard
                                   the order at its own discretion. While a challenge to the
                                   order of the Commission is available in exercise of the
                                   power of judicial review, the State Government subject to
                                   this right is duty bound to comply with the order. Otherwise,
                                   the purpose of the enacting the legislation would be
                                   defeated.&#x27;

                                   probably for the reason that the orders/recommendations of
                                   the Commission do not have a binding force. This adversely

                as a whole and give meaning to the words on the basis of its appropriateness

                with reference to the scheme of the Act. The learned counsel would also

                submit that the comparison of H.R. Commission with the National

                Commission for Protection of Child Rights is misplaced and the reliance

                placed on a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India reported in 2020

                SCC On-Line SC 27 (National Commission For Protection of Child

                Rights and Others versus Dr.Rajesh Kumar and others), wherein, an

                observation has been made in paragraph no.16 (already extracted supra) that

                the Commission constituted        under the said enactment has only

                recommendatory power. The comparison is impermissible for the simple

                reason that <a href="/doc/1294089/" id="a_389">Section 15</a> as per Sub-Clause (3) merely provides

                recommendation to be made to the concerned Government or authority for

                recommendation of the Commission, he would submit that in view of the

                binding nature of the recommendation, the person aggrieved could approach

                the Constitutional Courts at any stage. He would further submit that even at

                the very preliminary stage of the Commission going into the inquiry of the

                complaint, the Courts can be approached on the aspect of limitation as

                provided under the Act and in case of serious violation of principles of

                natural justice, while initiating inquiry under the Act. Therefore, the view

                taken by the learned single Judge in &#x27;Rajesh Das&#x27; case that unless a decision

                is taken by the Government on the recommendation, the Courts cannot be

                approached, is not correct view considering the scheme of the Act.

                a delinquent need not be extended any further opportunity before the

                one of the Judges, rendered judgment holding as such that &#x27;further remedy

                available to delinquent in service regulations, would amount to providing

                basis of reference before this Bench, did not in fact, render any divergent

                views. However, those Division Benches dealt with only one or two aspects

                of the Act and there was no consideration of the entire scheme of the Act.

                Therefore, he would submit that the Division Benches&#x27; decisions of this

                Court rendered in the past, may not be the guiding factors as this Bench in

                terms of the reference is called upon to consider the entire scheme of the

                even directions after receipt of comments from the Government for

                enforcing its recommendations.               These Regulations have not been the

                remuneration than minimum wages would constitute human rights violation

                or not? In that context, the Court held that the Commission cannot exceed its

                jurisdictional limit. He would therefore, submit that such observations

                made in the light of a different subject matter, cannot be relied upon for the

                purpose of canvassing that the Commission has only a very limited

                jurisdiction and its recommendations are merely advisory. On the other

                hand, he would submit that the Commission is an adjudicatory body and the

                recommendation of the Commission is not to be ignored or rejected by the

                Government and no such discretion could be formed in the scheme of the

            Court of India in a decision reported in 2014(10) SCC 406. In the said case,

            the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court was concerned with the filling up of vacancy of

                                   functions thereto. State Commission consists of a
                                   Chairperson who has been a Chief Justice of a High Court
                                   and four Members. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_394">The Act</a> has put in place various

                                   The Statute has conferred wide range powers upon
                                   NHRC/SHRC. The Commission is therefore required to be
                                   constituted with persons who have held very high
                                   constitutional offices earlier so that all aspects of good and
                                   adjudicatory procedures would be familiar to them. Having
                                   regard to the benevolent objects of the Act and the effective
                                   mechanism for redressal of grievances of the citizens against
                                   human rights violations, the office of Chairperson of SHRC
                                   cannot be allowed to remain vacant for a long time. State of
                                   Tamilnadu has always shown zero tolerance towards human
                                   rights violations and has always sent clear message of its
                                   commitment towards protection of human rights. We see no
                                   reason as to why the post of Chairperson, SHRC which is to
                                   be headed by a person who has been the Chief Justice of a
                                   High Court should remain vacant for more than three years.
                                   In our view, pending the State Government&#x27;s request for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_269">                                                     274</span>

                inquiry. <a href="/doc/47323/" id="a_405">Section 17</a> also provides an elaborate procedure describing the

                Governments or any other authority in receipt of the inquiry to be conducted

                by the Commission into complaints of human rights violation. All these

                Sections would cumulatively demonstrate that the Commission has all the

                powers of deciding the reliefs to be granted to the victims and the

                recommendations to be made in pursuance of the complaint are no inferior

                to any decision in that regard by any other judicial forum. Therefore, it

                cannot be contended that the Commission lacks any power of quantifying

                the damages or compensation.

                he would submit that this Bench can always take cue from the subsequent

                amendments to the Act in order to appreciate the intention of the Parliament

                in its exercise of the interpretation of Statute. He would also submit that

                <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_407">Section 18</a> and Sub Classes (a) to (f) are self-contained code, meaning that

                the power of the Commission exercising under the Act does not suffer from

                any inadequacy. He would also submit that the inquiry report, which is

                contemplated under <a href="/doc/1998581/" id="a_408">Sections 20(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/954372/" id="a_409">28(2)</a> is materially different from

                the inquiry report contemplated under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_410">Section 18</a>. In fact, he would submit

                that no where in the Statute, it is explicitly stated that the recommendation

                of the Commission is recommendatory in nature. The learned counsel would

                submit that the common fabric runs through all the decisions rendered by

                the Courts holding that the Commission&#x27;s power was limited and

                circumscribed by the Act and it can only make recommendations by

                comparing the Commission of H.R. Act to that of Commission under the

                C.I. Act which comparison is thoroughly mis-placed. Those decisions have

                not analysed <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_411">Section 18</a> of the Act decisively and incisively.          Those

                decisions fundamentally suffer from the principle of sub-silentio. More

                over, those decisions have also not read the distinction, scope and meaning

                rendered on the provisions of H.R. Act have dissected and examined

                critically, the power of the Commission with reference to various provisions

                of the Act. In those judgments, the findings were rendered on the basis of

                superficial consideration of the Act and its provisions. The learned counsel

                would also submit that the debates in the Parliament which preceded to

                passing of the Human Rights Bill, as cited and relied on by the learned

                counsel, Mr.Sharath Chandran, the debates were grossly insufficient to be

                taken as a guide for interpreting the Statute.       When internal aids are

                available, no external aids are required for interpretation of H.R. Act. The

                learned counsel would make this submission specifically with reference to

                the other provisions of H.R. Act and also the amendments which have been

                brought introduced in 2006 after the original enactment in 1993. He would

                also refer to <a href="/doc/1974118/" id="a_415">Section 36</a> of the Act for the reason that when the State

                Commission is inquiring into the matters relating to the human rights

                violation, neither National Commission nor any other Commission

                constituted any other law, would entertain any complaint. Such power of

                exclusivity is vested in the Commission and in that view of the matter, it

                cannot be gainsaid that the Commission is a toothless tiger.



</p><p id="p_794">                          244. The learned counsel finally would submit that the present legal

                trend is that the rule of construction will also include creative interpretation.

                He would submit that other interpretations namely liberal interpretation and

                strict interpretation which are also part of the concept of             rule of

                construction have limited application to the reference on hand as the scheme

                of H.R. Act requires a creative interpretation, without offending the basic

                structure of the Act. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_416">If the Act</a> is to be construed with reference to each and

                                   according to the intention of the legislature and the courts
                                   should act upon the true intention of the legislation while
                                   applying law and while interpreting law. If a statutory

                                   choose the interpretation which represents the intention of

                                     and in construing a Statute, it is necessary, to seek the
                                     intention of its maker. A Statute has to be construed
                                     according to the intent of them that make it and the
                                     duty of the court is to act upon the true intention of the
                                     legislature. If a statutory provision is open to more than
                                     one interpretation the court has to choose that
                                     interpretation which represents the true intention of the
                                     legislature. This task very often raises difficulties
                                     because of various reasons, inasmuch as the words

                                     or definite meaning and the language may be an
                                     imperfect medium to convey one&#x27;s thought or that the
                                     assembly of legislatures consisting of persons of
                                     various shades of opinion purport to convey a meaning
                                     which may be obscure. It is impossible even for the
                                     most imaginative legislature to forestall exhaustively
                                     situations and circumstances that may emerge after
                                     enacting a Statute where its application may be called
                                     for. Nonetheless, the function of the courts is only to
                                     expound and not to legislate. Legislation in a modern
                                     State is actuated with some policy to curb some public
                                     evil or to effectuate some public benefit. The
                                     legislation is primarily directed to the problems before

                                      future. But, from the very nature of things, it is
                                      impossible to anticipate fully the varied situations

                                      chosen to communicate such indefinite referents are
                                      bound to be in many cases lacking in clarity and

                                      of construction. The process of construction combines
                                      both literal and purposive approaches. In other words,
                                      the legislative intention i.e. the true or legal meaning of
                                      an enactment is derived by considering the meaning of
                                      the words used in the enactment in the light of any
                                      discernible purpose or object which comprehends the
                                      mischief and its remedy to which the enactment is
                                      directed.

                                   necessary to expound those words in their natural and

                                   Creative interpretation is when the court looks at both the

                                   confronted with a body of case law which stated that as
                                   penal consequences ensue, the provisions of such Statutes
                                   should be strictly construed. Here again, the modern trend in
                                   construing penal Statutes has moved away from a
                                   mechanical incantation of strict construction. Several
                                   judgments were referred to and it was held that a purposive
                                   interpretation of such Statutes is not ruled out. Ultimately, it
                                   was held that a fair construction of penal Statutes based on
                                   purposive as well as literal interpretation is the correct
                                   modern day approach.

                                   clear and unambiguous. Para 43 of the said judgment was

                                     literal rule, then any number of interpretations can be
                                     put to a statutory provision, each Judge having a free
                                     play to put his own interpretation as he likes. This
                                     would be destructive of judicial discipline, and also the
                                     basic principle in a democracy that it is not for the
                                     Judge to legislate as that is the task of the elected
                                     representatives of the people. Even if the literal
                                     interpretation results in hardship or inconvenience, it
                                     has to be followed (see G.P. Singh&#x27;s Principles of
                                     Statutory Interpretations, 9th Edn., pp. 45-49). Hence
                                     departure from the literal rule should only be done in
                                     very rare cases, and ordinarily there should be judicial

                                   would be outside the judicial ken. The task of a Judge, when

                                   object and purpose of the Statute, is not to interpret the
                                   provision as he likes but is to interpret the provision keeping

                                   had in mind. With this caveat, it is clear that Judges are not

                                   doing as each Judge likes. They are bound by the text of the

                                   independent enquiry conducted by the respondent State or not.

                the State. Extending her arguments, she would submit that when the

                recommendation is made and is adverse to the interest of the

                delinquent/Government servant, the Government is under the obligation to

                act on that recommendation and no further opportunity need be given to the

                delinquent employee. However, she would make a slight distinction in her

                submission in this regard, contending that if the recommendation of the

                Commission does not specifically apportion any quantum of compensation

                payable to the victims or it does not make any specific recommendation

                taking action against the delinquent employee, in that circumstances, the

                Government need to conduct a separate enquiry to prove as to whether the

                Government servant was involved in the act of human rights violation, but it

                can issue a second show cause notice seeking explanation from the

                delinquent Government employee in regard to the proportionality of the

                punishment to be inflicted              acting on the recommendations of the

                law. She would submit that whatever the interpretation, the Courts may give

                in the context of any enactment, such interpretation is normally read into

                                     could not reflect the inarticulate mental processes lying

                                     recommendation of the Drafting Committee and he has
                                     referred us to the speeches of several members of the
                                     Assembly who played an important part in the shaping
                                     of the Constitution. As an aid to discover the meaning
                                     of the words in a Constitution, these debates are of
                                     doubtful value. &#x27;Resort can be had to them&#x27; says

                                     of the provision. But when the question is of abstract
                                     meaning, it will be difficult to derive from this source
                                     much material assistance in interpretation.&#x27;
                                            The learned Attorney-General concedes that
                                     these debates are not admissible to explain the meaning
                                     of the words used and he wanted to use them only for
                                     the purpose of showing that the Constituent Assembly
                                     when they finally adopted the recommendation of the

                                     expression and the new. In my opinion, in interpreting
                                     the Constitution, it will be better if such extrinsic
                                     evidence is left out of account. In matters like this,
                                     different members act upon different impulses and
                                     from different motives and it is quite possible that

                                     was the object which was sought to be attained in

                Parliament when the interpretation of the Courts are supported by such

                debates and not vice versa.       Therefore, she would implore this Court to

                adopt the principles and observations made by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court

                of India in appreciating the exchange of wisdom among the members of the

                Parliament, particularly, with reference to the Hon&#x27;ble Home Ministers&#x27;

                assurance to the members of the Parliament that when the doubts were

                raised by some members as to the enforceability of the recommendations of

                the Human Rights Commission, the Hon&#x27;ble Home Minister assured the

                members that the Human Rights Commissions were like Finance

                Commissions, and the Government had               never disagreed with the

                recommendations of the Finance Commission and always implemented the

                same. Taking guidance from such statement made on the floor of the

                Parliament, this Court can safely interpret the provisions of the Act       to

                provide tooth to the Commission. In fact, the statement of the Hon&#x27;ble

                Minister was in-line with the Paris Principles which were one of the

                underlying International treaties which impelled the Government to come up

                with the present enactment.

                compensation even by the Civil Courts, there is no hard and fast rule or any

                standard set of guidelines, to be followed, nevertheless compensation or

                damages have always been ordered on the basis            of various factors

                connected to the claims and also on the basis of various principles laid down

                by the Superior Courts. More so, NHRC or SHRC is headed by the high

                Dignitaries, viz., the Chief Justices, Judges of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of

                India and High Courts and the compensation arrived at by the Commission

                headed by such high Dignitaries can never said to be arbitrary or

                unreasonable.

                Commission are only recommendatory in nature. According to the learned

                of the Act, the Government has to simply assign reasons and therefore, by

                no stretch of legal standards, the recommendations of the commission could

                be an adjudicatory order. The learned Senior counsel would refer to a

                decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.5112 of 2012

                batch dated 10.01.2019 that even till 2019, many of the States have not

                designated Judges as Human Rights Courts to be constituted under the

                <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_475">Human Rights Act</a>.        In that circumstances, the Hon’ble Supreme Court

                issued notices to Chief Secretaries of all the States as to why appropriate

                direction should not be issued for designating of Human Rights Courts in

                each State in terms of <a href="/doc/1549134/" id="a_476">Section 30</a> of Human Rights Act. In this regard, the

                learned Senior Counsel would also refer to the expressions used in <a href="/doc/1549134/" id="a_477">Section

                30</a> which states that the State Government may with the concurrence of

                Chief Justice of High Court, specify each District Court of Sessions to be

                Human Rights Courts.         According to the learned Senior counsel, the

                expression ‘may’ means recommendatory in nature. In fact, on the same

                lines, the learned counsel would also refer to the expression ‘may’ used in

                <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_478">Section 18</a>, which clearly meant that the recommendation made under

                <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_479">Section 18</a> also cannot be binding and can only be recommendatory.

                reading of the expression ‘may’ in terms of the provisions of the Act would

                only mean, that it is a discretion vest with the Government to accept the

                recommendation or not. In fact, the learned Senior counsel would elaborate

                his arguments on interpretation of the expressions ‘may’ and ‘shall’ as per

                Maxwell Law of Interpretation (12th Edition). The learned Senior counsel

                would also draw a reference to a decision reported in AIR 1965 SC 895 as to

                the interpretation of expression of ‘may’ and ‘shall’ in the context of the

                statutory schemes. The learned Senior counsel would also refer to <a href="/doc/1460739/" id="a_480">Section

                35</a> of the Advocates Act. According to the learned Senior counsel, that

                <a href="/doc/872325/" id="a_481">Section 35</a> provides for punishment for misconduct of advocate and such

                provision is not available in the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_482">Human Rights Act</a>. Therefore, it cannot be

                gainsaid that recommendations of the Commission are binding on the

                concerned Government. He would also refer to <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_483">Section 13</a> of the Human

                Rights Act which deals with the power of the Commission to make inquiry

                which has a limited scope. For this, he would invoke the principle of legal

                interpretation on ‘ejusdem’ generis’ maxim. The learned Senior counsel

                would therefore submit that the recommendation can never be compared to

                an order passed through an adjudicatory process.

                add that in 2006, there was an amendment to the Act. With reference to the

                amendment, the learned counsel would draw reference to the Debates which

                took place in both Houses of the Parliament. He would particularly refer to

                the most crucial discussion which is extracted hereunder:-

                                   needs to be thought out, is a little technical. But I must
                                   address that. The interim relief could be given by the
                                   NHRC earlier also, and it is being continued by the
                                   amendment.      There is no change, which is good.

                                   specifically given.       Now, we have provided that
</pre><p id="p_864">                                   compensation can be awarded. It seems to be a good

                                   can be easily met by amendments to make it
                                   efficacious. We must not forget that the NHRC, as it
                                   today stands before and after the amendment, has only
                                   recommendatory powers; it has no enforcement
                                   powers. Secondly, the compensation can normally be
                                   awarded    after   full     adjudication    by      a     decree.

                                   NHRC does not do and cannot do under the present
                                   Act. It does not do a full adjudication. It cannot pass a
                                   full decree and whatever order it ultimately passes is
                                   not enforceable. If that be so, to merely provide that
                                   compensation may be granted may create two problems
                                   of a serious nature, which may not have been foreseen.&#x27;

</p>
<p id="p_877">
</p><p id="p_878">                          271. The conceptualized development of modern Human Rights Laws

                could be traced to the Universal declaration of Human rights, 1948 which

                was adopted and proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations

                vide its resolution dated 10th December, 1948. The said declaration was an

                affirmation of faith in the fundamental human rights globally and the

                Member Nations were bound to respect the Human rights in terms of various

                Articles contained in the declaration.

                required to be stated, since all the Member Nations including India, over the

                decades, have taken guidance from the declaration and enacted their own

                Municipal laws to protect fundamental Rights/Human rights in their

                respective countries. In fact, in the Statement of Objects to the Protection of

                the Human rights Act, 1993, it is stated that India being the party to the

                International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 1966 and the

                influenced the policy framers of India while bringing in the enactment in

                1993 i.e., <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_485">The Protection of Human Rights Act</a>, 1993. The Universal

                Declaration of Human Rights was a pioneering crusade of global

                community, resulting in codification of human rights that were to be

                mandatorily to be protected by all the Member Nations. Preamble to the

                Universal declaration would highlight the paramount importance to the

                Rights,            1966   envisaged    a   legal   mechanism      for   redressal   of

                report on the measures they adopted within a period of one year to the

                Secretary General of United Nations. Secondly, that any person claiming

                remedy shall be enforceable, when granted. Thirdly, the Covenant also talks

                about enforceable right to ‘compensation’. The sum and substance of the

                International Covenants, is that the human rights are sacrosanct and any

                violation is to be viewed sternly and any remedy sought as a consequence of

                traversed through the various developments that took place on International

                of National Human Rights Institution by the Member States and its scope

                and functionality. She, in this regard, referred to the Manual on Asia Pacific

                Forum advancing human rights which dealt with the setting up of National

                Human Rights Institution (NHRI) and the working of such institution, as

                recorded in the Manual. According to the Manual, the first NHRI was

                established in the late 1970 and 1980s but ultimately, it was only after Paris

                Principles which came to be adopted in 1993 and subsequently endorsed by

                the United Nations, a benchmark was evolved with a view to set of

                minimum requirements for NHRIs.             In fact, in the earlier part of this

                Debates in Parliament that preceded to the making of <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_499">Human Rights Act</a>,

</p>
<p id="p_922">                          282. Mr.Sharath Chandran, learned counsel has referred to

                deliberation/discussions that took place prior to the enactment, among

                Hon&#x27;ble Ministers of Cabinet, Hon&#x27;ble Chief Ministers and the eminent

                persons representing cross section of Society including jurists, lawyers,

                journalists, academicians, administrators, Human Rights activists etc.

                Particularly, the learned counsel referred to the Chief Ministers Conference

                on Human Rights held in September, 1992.               Various portions of the

                deliberation of the Conference have also been extracted supra which

                highlighted as to how it became imperative to bring <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_500">Human Rights Act</a>

                taking note of various developments globally on the concept of human

                rights protection. The learned counsel, in fact, referred to the Report of the

                Standing Committee on Human Rights Bill, 1993 and he particularly relied

                on the Chapter relating to the Functions of the Commission and also relied

                on further Reports of the Standing Committee regarding &#x27;Powers and

                Procedures of the Commission. Those Reports of the Standing Committee

                have also been extracted supra as relied on by the learned counsel. The

                learned counsel, after taking a note of those reports of the discussions and

                discourse, submitted that the power of the Commission was in fact, intended

                to be restricted to only making recommendation and certainly not intended

                to be an order on adjudication.

<p id="p_923">

</p><p id="p_924">                          283. Apart from the Standing Committee Reports, the learned counsel

                also relied on the debates which actually took place during passing of the

                Human Rights Bill and during the debates, various concerns were raised by

                various Members of Parliament cutting across party lines as to the power

                and enforceability of recommendations of the Commission. The debates and

                discussions in the Parliament were centered around the enforceability and

                the related power of the Commission. But ultimately, when the Act was

                passed, some of the suggestions to make the recommendations enforceable,

                were not accepted by the Hon&#x27;ble Minister in-charge, but on the other hand,

                an assurance is given that the Human Rights Commission was akin to the

                Finance Commission and the Government had never rejected the Finance

                Commission&#x27;s recommendations in the past. Therefore, the assurance by the

                Hon&#x27;ble Minister is not a law. He summed up saying that going by the

                debates            and   discussions   in   the    Parliament,   the   power   and   its

                recommendation of the Commission was clearly intended to be

                unenforceable and not binding on the Government.



</p><p id="p_925">                          284. In order to bolster his submissions, the learned counsel also

                referred to the Protection of Human Rights Amendment Bill, 2012 which

                was a private Bill by the Member of Parliament and in that a suggestion was

                made among many amendments, that the Commission should be given more

                power to take penal action etc., but the amendment was not carried through.

                The learned counsel submitted that a similar suggestion was made even at

                the time of enactment of the principal Act, but ultimately, did not fructify

                and those suggestions were not included in the Act.                     Therefore, the

                interpretation of the Courts to the scheme of the Act cannot go beyond the

                intention of the framers.

                developments that took place globally in the realm of human rights law and

                its protection, the Government of India felt obligated and compelled to bring

                in a specific enactment to deal with the protection of human rights by

                providing a specific judicial mechanism namely, National Human Rights

                Commission and State Human Rights Commissions.

                protection of the same. Human rights have been constitutionally recognized

                and protected under Para III of the Constitution of India. Earlier to the

                rights had been dealt with through common law remedy and also through

                access to Constitutional Courts. Despite those remedies, a specific judicial

                face of growing incidents of human rights violations over a period of time.



</p><p id="p_931">                               288.   As the Statement of Objects and Reasons declare that the

                and Political Rights, 1966 and the International Covenant on Social,

                Economic and Cultural Rights, 1966, the scheme of the Act must be

                interpreted and understood in the said backdrop to begin with. Our quest,

                therefore began with the above preliminary understanding and to further

                discover plausible answers to the terms of the reference, several rival

                contentions and submissions have to be considered with the reference to the

                provisions of principal Act under consideration vis-a-vis similar enactments

                like the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_501">Commission of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952, the Commission for <a href="/doc/506243/" id="a_502">Protection of

</p><p id="p_933">                          289. The term &#x27;Human Rights&#x27; is defined under Section 2(d) of the

                H.R. Act, which reads as under:
</p>

</p><p id="p_935">                                          (d) &#x27;human rights&#x27; means the rights relating to
                                   life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual
                                   guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the
                                   International Covenants and enforceable by the Courts
                                   in India;&#x27;



</p><p id="p_936">                          290. There are two aspects of Human Rights, defined in the Act. One

                relating to the rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution of India and

                the other rights which are embodied in the International Covenants and

                enforceable by the Courts in India. As rightly argued by the learned SHRC

                counsel Mr. R.Srinivas, that the definition &#x27;Human Rights&#x27; is nothing but an

                extension of what is guaranteed under Articles 14, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of Part-

                III of the Constitution of India. The Human Rights, as such, are in effect

                guaranteed by the Constitution to be enforced by a judicial mechanism

                created under the Act. What is the type of judicial mechanism created under

                the Act is to be seen hereunder:

                the Section, has been argued both for and against by the learned counsel.

                The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_539">Section 13</a> of the

                Human Rights Act would not improve the status of the Commission and

                make it an exception as a special Commission, as <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_540">Section 13</a> is exactly pari

                other hand emphasized the fact that while conducting an inquiry into the

                human rights violation, the Commission enjoys all the powers of Civil Court

                as provided under Sub Clauses (4) and (5) of <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_542">Section 13</a> and          every

                Commission is not inquisitorial, but a quasi judicial adjudication. In this

                connection, the learned Amicus Curiae also referred to Regulation 25

                (extracted supra) of State Human Rights Commission Tamil Nadu

                The arguments that availability of similar provisions in the C.I.Act would

                make the Human Rights Commission as yet another Commission under the

                C.I.Act appear to be a misplaced comparison. One or two Sections of

                H.R.Act, having parallels in the C.I.Act may not make the Human Rights

                Commission less in status without reference to the constitution of the

                Commission, its composition, the stature of recommending Committee, an

                appointment of the Chairperson and the Members of the Commission and

                the actual appointment by the President of India as provided under <a href="/doc/1911574/" id="a_549">Section 4</a>

                of the Act.        The submissions have been made, in our opinion, on the

                peripheral understanding of the Act ignoring the fundamental structure of

                the Commissions which is composed of with high dignitaries appointed by a

                Selection Committee comprising no less dignitaries than the Hon&#x27;ble Prime

                Minister of India and others as detailed in <a href="/doc/1911574/" id="a_550">Section 4</a> and the appointment is

                by warrant under the hand and seal of His Excellency the President of India.

                Therefore, comparison of two Commissions, which, in the opinion of this

                Bench, is too far fetched and due to fallacious understanding and reading of

                the scheme of both the Acts. The next provision deals with the status of the

                extracted supra. In terms of <a href="/doc/1294089/" id="a_554">Section 15</a> of the Human Rights Act, when a

                Commission, the same cannot be used against him in Civil or Criminal law

                proceedings, which would only mean that such statements made by any

                person is valueless and such statements cannot be used to impeach the

                persons in terms of <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_555">Sections 145</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_556">155</a> of the Evidence Act. Therefore,

                he submitted that inquiry by the Commission can only be in the realm of

                inquisitorial jurisdiction. On the other hand, the learned Amicus Curiae has

                pointedly submitted that evidentiary value in any quasi judicial proceeding

                is always different from the evidence tendered before the Criminal or Civil

                Courts.            In fact, the learned Amicus Curiae has drawn analogy to the

                evidence given in the departmental proceedings and the evidence tendered

                in Criminal Court, which cannot be compared at all. According to him, that

                on a matter of expediency, no strict rules of evidence will be followed in

                quasi judicial proceedings, but however, basic principles of evidence would

                always be followed.

                Amicus Curiae on this aspect, appears to be well founded. Merely because

                the Statements made to the Commission do not satisfy the requirements of

                <a href="/doc/1110615/" id="a_557">Sections 145</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_558">155</a> of the Evidence Act, may not make the Commission&#x27;s

                findings as less valuable or to be ignored altogether. As rightly contended

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_338">                                                   343</span>

                by the learned Amicus Curiae, the evidentiary value of statements made

                before the Criminal or Civil Courts cannot be equated with the evidence

                tendered by persons to the Commission or quasi judicial bodies.

                Nevertheless, any findings/recommendations on the basis of such evidence

                cannot lose its value on such narrowed consideration. If the arguments of

                the learned Additional Solicitor General were to be accepted, then the very

                recommendations of the Commission premised on its findings in furtherance

                of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_559">Sections 13</a> to <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_560">16</a> would lose its sanctity at all and

                the Commission would be only embarking upon a futile exercise of

                conducting an inquiry and coming up with a recommendation as an

                academic endeavor. The power and the scope of inquiry of the Commission

                need to be evaluated not with reference to one or two provisions of the

                <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_561">Evidence Act</a> or <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_562">Cr.P.C</a>., but with reference to the frame work of the Act

                itself. Evidentiary value with reference to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_563">Evidence Act</a>, 1872 may not be

                the correct legal yardstick to discredit the value of Commission&#x27;s

                recommendations. If such is the consideration, then the very existence of

                the Commission itself becomes meaningless. Therefore, we are not able to

                appreciate the arguments of the learned Addl.Solicitor General in this regard

                as we find the same are immoderate and lopsided.

                the status of the Commission, particularly, both the Sections, according to

                the Evidence Act. But as far as <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_569">Section 16</a> is concerned, arguments were

                advanced by the learned counsel as to how detailed opportunities are to be

                afforded to the persons likely to be affected by the inquiry undertaken by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_340">                                                    345</span>

                Commission.        An argument was also advanced that when adequate

                opportunity is contemplated under <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_570">Section 16</a> of the Act, when the

                Commission finds that a delinquent is involved in violation of human rights

                Act, no further opportunity need be given to him by his/her employer under

                the relevant service Rules. When the delinquent is given ample opportunity

                to face a full fledged inquiry with opportunity extended to him to examine

                and cross examine the witnesses, no further remedy is left open to the

                delinquent in the form of any separate disciplinary action atleast with

                reference to the compensation ordered by the Commission and to be

                recovered from him.       In fact, the learned counsel, Ms. Nagasaila, has

                submitted that in respect of imposition of penalty, a show cause notice may

                have to be issued to the delinquent servant only on the aspect of

                proportionality of the punishment and no detailed departmental inquiry is

                required. In fact, the learned Judge of this Court Shri Justice K.Chandru, in

                his Judgment         in T.Vijayakumar&#x27;s case&#x27;, held that providing further

                departmental opportunities in such matters would amount to extending

                &#x27;paradise of remedies&#x27; to the delinquent Government servants.



</p><p id="p_1012">                          309. Whether the departmental remedy should be extended to the

                delinquent or not would be a matter of discussion hereunder, but at the same

                time, what flows from <a href="/doc/669686/" id="a_571">Section 16</a> is that the persons likely to be affected are

                given adequate opportunity to participate in the inquiry process and the said

                provision is enacted in full compliance with the established principles of

                natural justice. Therefore, a delinquent who is aggrieved by the finding of

                the Commission, cannot legitimately come up with any complaint that his

                rights have been violated on the premise of not adhering to the principles of

                natural justice.

                submitted that the word &#x27;inquiry&#x27; as found in <a href="/doc/994266/" id="a_573">Section 2</a> (g)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_574"> of the Criminal

                other than a trial conducted under this Code by a Magistrate or Court&#x27;&#x27;. The

                learned counsel elaborated that the word &#x27;inquiry&#x27; is found only in Sub

                Clause (a) of <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_575">Section 12</a> and such inquiry is relatable to <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_576">Section 18</a> only.

                He has also referred to Sub-Clauses (b) to (j) of <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_577">Section 12</a> the Act, which

                do not contain the word &#x27;Inquiry&#x27;. In fact, Mr.R.Srinivas, learned counsel for

                in order to appreciate the Commission&#x27;s power, jurisdiction and its ultimate

                reports and recommendations under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_581">Section 18</a> of the Act. In fact, he

                submitted that the inquiry contemplated under <a href="/doc/47323/" id="a_582">Section 17</a> was not an

                inquiry simplicitor, because as a conjoint reading of other Sections would

                demonstrate that such an inquiry has an adjudicatory character. Here again,

                we find that giving a restrictive meaning to word &#x27;inquiry&#x27; with reference to

                the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_583">Cr.P.C</a>. provisions is incorrect, as the words &#x27;inquiry and trial&#x27; as defined

                the ambit of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_586">Section 18</a>.          Rival submissions have been made one towards

                amplifying the ambit of the Section by cumulative construction of all the

                Sub Clauses and in contrast, another towards the limited scope of the

                Section as being evident from the very expression itself, as found in all the

                Sub Clauses. The interpretation of almost every expression as found in

                <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_587">Section 18</a> in relation to the Sub Clauses would be most germane and

                pivotal to the ultimate conclusion to be reached by this Bench in response to

                the terms of reference. Sub clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_588">Section 18</a> is what ultimately falls

                for consideration as to the enforceability of its recommendation.             The

                learned counsel Mr. R. Srinivas, laid great emphasis on this Sub Clause and

                submitted that the Sub Clause provides, for &#x27;action taken&#x27; or &#x27;proposed to be

                emphasized that <a href="/doc/1998581/" id="a_600">Section 20(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/954372/" id="a_601">28(2)</a> would have application only in

                respect of the recommendation made under <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_602">Section 12</a>, since they were more

                advisory in nature. In fact, he also illustrated that when the Commission

                makes a recommendation in the cause of its consideration under            the

                provisions of <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_603">Section 12</a> that all prisons must be air conditioned, those

                recommendations may have to be placed before the Parliament or

                Legislature concerned and acceptance of those recommendations is always a

                policy matter of the Government. That is why, according to the learned

                counsel, the reasons for non-acceptance is specifically included in the

                Section and correspondingly, conspicuously absent in <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_604">Section 18</a> of the

                or in the form of non-acceptance with reasons and the same to be placed

                before the Parliament or the Legislature concerned, leaving to the wisdom

                of the Houses to take a final call in the matter. This is because when the

                recommendation made in the realm of policy matters of the Central

                Government or the State Government concerned, the law framers are put on

                notice to respond to such recommendations towards policy initiatives.

                and <a href="/doc/1394637/" id="a_618">28</a>, but by very inclusion of those recommendations, the expressions

                for the Constitutional Court to read down a provision, enhance or expound

                the meaning of words in the Act to make it workable or to prevent it from its

                inane function and existence. But it is certainly not open to the Courts to

</p><p id="p_1029">                          321.     In fact, Mr.R.Srinivas, learned counsel for SHRC, has

                extensively made his submissions, pointing out the distinguishing features

                in regard to the implementable differences with reference to <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_622">Sections 12</a> and

                <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_623">18</a> of the Act read with Sub Clauses 2 of Sectins 20 and 28. The Sub

                Clauses (c) to (f) of <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_624">Section 12</a> which have been extracted supra provide for

                making a recommendation on the basis of generic consideration in order to

                improve the standards of human rights, protection and promotion of the

                same. The Commission is also under obligation to create awareness of

                human rights literacy. By very nature of the recommendations as provided

                under the Sub clauses, are to be construed only as advisory or academic and

                not enforceable at all. Whereas, the recommendation under <a href="/doc/46143524/" id="a_625">Section 18(e)</a> of

                the Act is on a specific complaint being inquired into and a finding is

                &#x27;recommendation&#x27; as found in <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_626">Sections 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_627">18</a> cannot be considered to

                have the same connotation.        In fact, the word, &#x27;recommendation&#x27; in its

                natural and plain construction, is to be construed to have nexus with

                reference to Sub Clauses (2) of <a href="/doc/302919/" id="a_628">Sections 20</a> and <a href="/doc/1394637/" id="a_629">28</a> of the Act.

                importantly the distinguishing aspects of recommendation made under

                or placed for consideration before any Court in India so far. Thanks to

                Mr.R.Srinivas for expounding the salient difference as key to unpuzzling the

                expression, &#x27;reasons for non-acceptance&#x27; as found in Sub Clause (2) of

                <a href="/doc/302919/" id="a_644">Sections 20</a> and <a href="/doc/1394637/" id="a_645">28</a> of the Act.

                on the distinguishing features as between recommendations made under Sub

                Clauses (c) to (f) of <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_646">Section 12</a> and <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_647">Section 18</a> of the Act. The plausible

                exposition of the differential nature of recommendation is a pointer to

                understand the scheme of Act with more clarity and insight.            When a

                general recommendation is made by the commission by exercising its power

                under <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_648">Section 12</a>, particularly with reference to Sub Clauses (c) to (f), the

                recommendation being advisory from the very nature of the provisions of

                Sub Clauses, it is always open for the concerned Government to provide

                reasons for its non-acceptance when the reports are to be submitted to the

                Parliament /Legislature under <a href="/doc/302919/" id="a_649">Section 20</a> (2) and 28 (2) of the Act. Such

                latitude is not to be found under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_650">Section 18</a> of the Act.           The crucial

                expression namely &#x27;reasons for non-acceptance of recommendation&#x27; which

                in <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_653">Section 18</a> of the Act. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the reasons

                for non-acceptance must relate only with reference to Annual/Special

                reports contemplated under Sub Clauses (c) to (f) of <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_654">Section 12</a> of the Act

                and not with reference to <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_655">Section 18</a> of the Act. By conjoint reading of

                International Covenants and the conscious omission of expression of ‘non

                acceptance’ would in fact, clothe the recommendation of the Human Rights

                Commission made under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_656">Section 18</a> of the Act with some measure of

                casting obligation on the part of the Government or authority to accept the

                illustrated four possible scenarios when the Commission       concludes its

                inquiry followed by recommendations under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_657">Section 18</a>, viz., (i) no violation

                of human rights was found and on such conclusion either complainant or the

                victim can approach the Constitutional Court for redressal. (ii) The

                Commission holding violation of human rights and the Constitutional Court is

                approached and the Court confirms the recommendations, in which case, the

                recommendation merges with the decision of the Constitutional Court and

                becomes a command. iii) The Commission holding violation in part and even

                in that situation, the decision of the Constitutional Court accepting such

                recommendation becomes a mandate to be implemented by the concerned

                Government or authority. iv) The Commission holding the Government guilty

                of     violation and   no one approached the Court at all, in that event, the

                Commission may invoke Section 18(b) of H.R.Act for enforcement of its

                recommendation and once again that becomes binding on the concerned

                Government.         The learned counsel relied on a Latin maxim Sublato

                fundamento cadit opus meaning that the foundation is removed, the

                structure falls and he compared the &#x27;foundation&#x27; to the &#x27;recommendation of

                the point that Sub Clauses (e) and (f) of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_658">Section 18</a> do not provide any

                option for the Government to refuse as in the case of Sub Clauses (2) of

                learned Amicus Curiae would submit that if Sub Clauses (e) of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_661">Section 18</a>

                are closely examined, no discretion is vested with the Government to reject

                learned counsel, the expression &#x27;comments&#x27; as found in the said Section,

                of the Section and must receive liberal construction. He also submitted that

                under <a href="/doc/46143524/" id="a_662">Section 18(e)</a>, the Commission is not denuded of its jurisdiction after

                making recommendation, as the Government is under an obligation to

                origin of the dispute, which culminated into the present reference.      The

                starting point of divergence of the judicial opinions began with the decision

                rendered in W.P.Nos.21604 to 21607 of 2000 in the matter of Rajesh Das

                versus Tamil Nadu State Human Rights Commission and others&#x27; which was

                reported in 2010 (5) CTC 589. This decision was penned by Shri Justice

                S.Nagamuthu, before whom, an important question was raised as to,


                                         &#x27;Whether the Human Rights Commissions
                                   constituted under the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_665">Protection of Human Rights

                conclusion that recommendation of the Commission under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_666">Section 18</a> was

                neither an order nor an adjudication and it remains as recommendation only

                and as a corollary, the learned Judge has held that the recommendation was

                not binding on the parties to the proceedings including the concerned

                Government. Consequential conclusions have been summed up in para 41

                of the judgment which were already extracted in the earlier part of the

                judgment. Shortly, after the above judgment of the learned Judge in Rajesh

                Das’s case, another learned single Judge, Shri Justice K.Chandru had

                differed and disagreed with the views expressed in Rajesh Das’s case while

                rendering his decision in the case of T.Vijayakumar versus State Human

                Rights Commission, Tamil Nadu and others in W.P.(MD) No.12316 of 2010

                vide his order dated 29.09.2010, and thereafter few Division Benches which

                have been referred to supra, had upheld the views of the learned Judge in

                Rajesh Das’s case. Although there was no apparent conflict of views by the

                Division Benches referred to supra, yet the Division Bench comprising Shri

                Justice M.Venugopal and Shri Justice Audikesavulu has made certain

                observations in its order dated 25.07.2017 in W.P.No.41791 of 2006 in the

                matter of Abdul Sathar versus The Principal Secretary to Government, Home

                Department and others, after having felt that there have been divergent

                views on the status of the &#x27;recommendation&#x27; made by Human Rights

                Commission under Section 18 of H.R.Act. In pursuance of the same, the

                case by the learned judge, Shri Justice S.Nagamuthu was on the premise that

                the provisions of the Human rights Act, 1993 are pari materia to the

                provisions of the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_667">Commission of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952 (C.I.Act). The learned

                Judge has also premised his finding on the Statement of Objects and

                Reasons which stated in Sub para 3 of Para 4 that &#x27;the Commission will be a

                fact finding body with powers to conduct inquiry into the complaints of

                violation of human rights&#x27;. According to the learned Judged, when the

                decision of the Human Rights Commission has been accorded the same

                status as that of the Commission under C.I.Act, the Human Rights

                Commission cannot enjoy the power of adjudication and enforce its

                recommendation. When the State of Objects and Reasons have clearly spelt

                out that the Human Rights Commission is only a fact finding body and in

                that capacity, it inquires into the complaints of human rights violation, it

                cannot be clothed with any power over than what is circumscribed by the

                provisions of the Act.        In fact, the learned Judge has compared the

                provisions of C.I.Act and H.R.Act and ultimately summed up his conclusion

                as found in para 41 of his judgment(extracted supra).

                not an ‘order or any ‘adjudication’, has compared similarities between

                certain provisions of C.I.Act and H.R.Act, like Section 4 of C.I.Act and

                Section 13 of H.R.Act, in regard to the Commission’s power of Civil Court

                in the matters of summoning and enforcing the attendance of witnesses,

                examining them on oath, etc. He has also drawn parallel as between <a href="/doc/1606536/" id="a_668">Section

                5(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/309576/" id="a_669">13(2)</a>; 5(3) and 13(3), 5(4) and 13(4) and <a href="/doc/214677/" id="a_670">Section 5</a> (5) and 13 (5)

                of C.I. Act and H.R.Act respectively. Likewise, the learned Judge also

                compared 5A of C.I.Act with Section 14 of H.R.Act. Finding that these

                provisions are pari materia to each other and also coupled with the fact that

                the Statement of objects <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_671">Human Rights Act</a>, it is stated that in Sub para 3 of

                Para 4 that the Commission will be &#x27;a fact finding body&#x27;, has held that the

                status of the Commission under <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_672">Human Rights Act</a> is no more than the

                Commission under the C.I.Act.

                two of Acts, the learned Judge has also referred to decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court of India and the same if perused, it could be gathered that

                the majority of the decisions relied on by the learned Judge were rendered

                by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the context of Commission’s

                power and its functioning with reference to C.I. Act, 1952. Many of the

                decisions referred to by the learned Judge were prior to H.R.Act, 1993 and

                those decisions were factually dealing with various Commissions

                established under the C.I. Act, 1952.

                Section 18(a)(i) of H.R.Act is parri materia to Section 3 of the C.I. Act and

                thus held that the report submitted by the Commission can only be

                recommendatory. From the judgment, it is found that hardly any decision

                was referred to in respect of the recommendation and the status of the report

                of the Human Rights Commission under <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_673">Human Rights Act</a>, 1993. In fact,

                the learned Judge though referred and extracted the entire <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_674">Section 18</a>, but

                to consider certain important aspects which escaped from his critical

                attention. Firstly, the comparison of the Commission under H.R.Act with

                that of the Commission under Commission of C.I. Act, itself appears to be

                misplaced. To illustrate this position, it is enough to refer two provisions of

                under the C.I. Act, 1952 derives its power and jurisdiction from the terms of

                reference as notified by the Governments while the Commission is so

                appointed. The Commission on its appointment, has to function within the

                frame work assigned to it by the appointing authority. In all respects, it is a

                fact finding body entrusted with a particular task of conducting investigation

                in order to gather facts. The composition of the Commission may also vary

                and depend on the discretionary will of the appointing authority. In fact, the

                commission need not be even headed by any judicial members.

                Commission which is appointed under <a href="/doc/842137/" id="a_676">Section 3</a> could be wound up by

                under <a href="/doc/942879/" id="a_677">Section 7</a> of the Act. In fact, the power is with the appointing

                authority to discontinue the functioning of the Commission at any stage.

                The Commission under the C.I. Act owes its birth to Government orders and

                the same Government on the presumed policy can write its obituary as well

                on exercise of its power under Section 7 of the C.I.Act.

                Therefore, the life of the Commission appointed under the C.I. Act is solely

                dependent on the appropriate Government’s discretion and its functioning

                even during its existence is to be confined within the dictates and directives

                of the appointing authority. By no stretch of legal standard or implication,

                the Commission under the C.I. Act is said to be an independent body, much

                less a judicial forum. Moreover, the Commission under the C.I. Act can be

                appointed to conduct inquiry to any issues of public importance by the

                appropriate Government to collect materials and facts and to assist the

                Government to take policy decisions on issues which are directed to be the

                form than by their attributes in substance. Therefore, comparing of these two

                Commissions is fundamentally fallacious and the conclusion premised on

                such comparison, may have to be discarded, as being wholly without

                substance.         This Bench therefore, finds that the legal summations of the

                learned Judge that are found in paragraph 41 of the judgment are edified on

                a faulty premise by comparing H.R. Commission with that of the

                Commission under C.I.Act, 1952 and therefore, the same is to be held not a

                that the Statement of Objects and Reasons may not be used to determine the

                true meaning at the effect of the substantive provisions of the Statute, it can

                at best be referred for the purpose of ascertaining the circumstances which

                led to the legislation. In fact, the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

                Court are extracted supra in the earlier part of the judgment. The Statement

                of Objects and Reasons are mere guidelines as being introductory to the

                statutory text. As held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, the Objects and

                Reasons cannot determine the scope, the extent and the reach of the Act.

                The scheme of the Act needs to be understood with reference to conjoint

                reading of all provisions of the Act, while interpreting the Statute and such

                interpretation cannot be on the sole basis of the Statement of Objects and

                Reasons. Even on this aspect, the learned Judge appeared to have faulted

                for according undue emphasis to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for

                the purpose of interpreting the entire scheme of the Act. In a matter of

                purposive interpretation, Courts would have to examine every layer and

                limb of the text and not to be confounded on fragmentary understanding of a

                Statute.

                Bengal reported in (1997) 1 SCC 416 wherein, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court

                Commission and others, wherein the learned Judge was a party to the

                Division Bench, has held a similar view, much earlier to Rajesh Das’s case.

</p><p id="p_1072">                          343. The above decision of the learned Judge in T.Vijayakumar

                versus State Human Rights Commission, Tamil Nadu and others was though

                perceived as a conflicting view, however, we are of the opinion that the said

                decision was rendered within the narrow confines as to whether a delinquent

                employee affected by the Commission&#x27;s report and recommendation, was to

                be given a further opportunity by his employer while recovering of the

                compensation amount from him. The decision of the learned Judge was only

                in that specific context. Either in the Division Bench wherein the said Judge

                was a party in T.Loganathan’s case nor in the T.Vijakumar’s case, the

                scheme of H.R.Act was never under consideration. However, the fact

                ramains that the decision of the Division Benches referred to earlier in the

                judgment, which have been apparently found expressing different views,

                had no occasion to consider the entire scheme of the Act, as the respective

                learned single Judges and Division Benches had to deal with the specific

                issues in piecemeal relating to a particular singular aspect of the

                implementation of the Commission’s recommendations.

                with a view to interpret the scheme of the Act towards serving the larger

                purpose of the Act. Such germinal exercise is the constitutional imperative

                when almost virgin answers are to be found on various questions,

                misgivings raised on the power, the functional/jurisdictional limitations of

                the Commission under H.R.Act. Being a creature of the statue, the power of

                the Commission and the scope of its function and the status of the

                recommendation whether the same is enforceable or to remain as

                recommendatory, as it widely understood till date, is a matter of momentous

                semantic construct within the broad frame work of the Act. Such benign

                consideration primarily involve exercise of purposive interpretation of the

                statutory provisions on the basis of various legal precedents in order to

                the submissions were made by the learned counsel. By highlighting those

                reports, has clearly spelt out the limitation imposed on it by the scheme of

                the Act and in fact, suggestions were repeatedly made for amending the Act

                to provide more power to it, but ultimately, it did not materialize in reality.

                Therefore, the question of reading something more in the Section by this

                Bench may not be permissible at all. The learned counsel, specifically

                added that one of the Annul Reports of the NHRC for the year 2015-2016,

                has clearly mentioned number of recommendations made for that year and

                those recommendations made under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_691">Section 18</a> were part of the Annual

                of the present Act was reported in CDJ 1997 MHC 793 (cited supra). The

                decision rendered by a Division Bench of this Court which had extensively

                gone into various aspects of the Act and ultimately held that the

                Commission has a limited power under the Act and its recommendations are

                &#x27;recommendatory&#x27; alone. The extracts of the Division Bench&#x27;s findings and

                the observations have been incorporated in extenso supra.         However,

                Ms.Naga Saila, learned counsel clarified that the Division Bench judgment

                was rendered in the context of human rights as provided under <a href="/doc/1549134/" id="a_701">Section 30</a> of

                the Act. According to the learned counsel, the Division Bench held that

                only the Human Rights Courts (HRC) can convict the persons involved in

                human rights violations and not Human Rights Commissions. She, in fact,

                referred to paragraph nos.98, 99 and 100 of the judgment. According to the

                learned counsel, when the decision was rendered by the Division Bench on

                23.06.1997, the Rules/Regulations framed under the Act were not placed for

                consideration and in the absence of any procedure, the Division Bench felt

                that no definite judgment could possibly be rendered passed by the

                Commission. Therefore, she submitted that the decision of the Division

                Bench need not be taken as significant material source of precedent or

                guidance.

                relied on a decision in C.A.No.5112 of 2012 batch, wherein, the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court vide its judgment dated 10.01.2019 found that many States

                had not designated the Judges as Human Rights Courts under <a href="/doc/1549134/" id="a_702">Section 30</a> of

                the Act. Therefore, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court issued notice to the Chief

                Secretaries of the States, where Human Rights Courts have not been

                established in this regard. The learned Senior counsel stated that in <a href="/doc/1549134/" id="a_703">Section

                30</a>, the expression &#x27;may&#x27; used for designating any Court of Session as

                Human Rights Court which means it is only recommendatory and the same

                meaning to be given to <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_704">Section 18</a> as well. As a final submission, learned

                Senior counsel made a fervent plea to this Full Bench to amend the Statute.

                We are unable to persuade ourselves to the submission made by the learned

                of the Act need to be understood in the combined reading of the other Sub

                Clauses as well. The expression &#x27;&#x27;may&#x27;&#x27; is used specifically in order to give

                an option to the State Government to specify the Human Rights Court at

                District level or otherwise or Special Court etc. Therefore, the discretion is

                given to the State Government only on that aspect and the same cannot be

                the Human Rights Courts or not at all in the State. Further, it could be seen

                that any violation of human rights is already triable normally by the

                Criminal Courts or the Civil Courts as the case may be. Therefore, in that

                consideration, expression &#x27;may&#x27; has been used quite appropriately. This

                takes us to the concluding submission of learned senior counsel where he

                made a fervent plea to this Full Bench to amend the Statute.          We are

                constrained to hold that this is completely against the basic tenets of

                separation of powers and we are reminded of Dr.Durga Das Basu who said

                &#x27;So far as the courts are concerned, the application of the doctrine (the

                theory of separation of powers) may involve two propositions, namely, none

                of the three organs of Government, Legislative Executive and Judicial, can

                exercise any power which properly belongs to either of the other two and

                that the legislature cannot delegate its powers&#x27; which is simplistic but lucid

                summation without compromising on profundity compared to Montesquieu,

                who had a far more complex approach to this issue in 18 th century which is

                recorded by historians as &#x27;Century of Philosophy&#x27; in Europe.

</p><p id="p_1091">                          To put it differently, this Court cannot and will not legislate when

                gradual separation of judicial and legislative function emerged across 13th

                and 14th centuries after which a more formal sense of law making evolved

                with writing of preambles for statutes and keeping journals beginning with

                the House of Lords and House of Commons in earlier part of 16th century.

                Be that as it may, under the English model, even then the judges continued

                to sit in the legislature i.e., the House of Lords, House of Commons and

                were senior partners in a collaborative exercise. This is clearly not the case

                now in India and therefore, this fervent plea to amend the Statute cannot but

                be rejected as completely untenable. Therefore, the submissions advanced

                by the learned Senior Counsel does not appeal to us.

                the learned Senior counsel that the option is with the State Government for

                establishing the Human Rights Courts is incorrect. When the expression

                &#x27;Public Prosecutor&#x27; shall be appointed specifically for Human Rights Courts,

<p id="p_1093">                The provisions of the Act as it could be seen, cover the entire gamut of

                we need to satisfy and strengthen ourselves by drawing guidance from

                various decisions of the High Court and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of

                India touching up different aspects of the Act. Such consideration would

                have to include Parliamentary debates, intention of the framers, proclaimed

</p><p id="p_1097">                          359. On behalf of the learned counsel, several decisions have been

                cited which have been rendered by various High Courts in India and the

                Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India. The relevant portions of the observations

                made by the Courts and the rulings have already been extracted when legal

                contentions were raised by the learned counsel. But, we strangely find that

                none of the judgments which has been placed for consideration before us,

                have dealt with the entire scheme of H.R.Act. Many of the judgments of the

                Courts have been rendered on consideration of limited issues that have been

                placed for consideration and not the interpretation of the scheme of the Act.

                Therefore, our essential task is to engage with the judgments and to pick up

                relevant threads from these judgments as value additions for the purpose of

                the Reference on hand. The citations relied on by the learned counsel, can be

                broadly divided into two categories, viz., i) &#x27;status of the Commission, its

                recommendation and its enforceability&#x27; and ii) &#x27;purposive interpretation of

                the provisions of the Statute and construction of provisions thereof.

                earliest decision after enactment of H.R.Act, was rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court of India, which is reported in ‘D.K.Basu’s case reported in

                (1997 (1) SCC 416). Relevant portions as found in paragraphs 51 to 54 have

                been extracted supra on the basis of submissions of the learned counsel for

                SHRC, Mr.R.Srinivas. However, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the said

                judgment, was only considering the issue pertaining to the compensation

                towards damages that were to be awarded to the victims of the human rights

                violation. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held in that context that &#x27;in public

                law sphere, such is permissible apart from regular remedies which were

                available under other laws&#x27;.

                there was no in-depth analysis of various provisions of the Act though they

                were referred to in the judgment. More particularly, <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_708">Section 18</a> which is the

                most pivotal of all the provisions in the Act, has not been given its due

                consideration or appreciation. In fact, as correctly submitted by the learned

                counsel Ms.Nagasaila, the entire judgment of the Division Bench was with

                reference to <a href="/doc/1549134/" id="a_709">Section 30</a> of the Act. More over, as submitted by her, that at

                the time the judgment was rendered by the Division Bench, Rules or

                several decisions have been rendered by the Courts with reference to the Act

                earlier to H.R.Act and in the context of the C.I.Act, 1952 may not be of a

                great relevance or significance for the task entrusted to us, as answers to the

                terms of Reference would have to be eventually culled out from the frame

                work of H.R.Act only. Our position on this aspect, we have indicated earlier

                that in all fours, the Commission under H.R.Act cannot be equated with the

                Commission constituted under the C.I.Act. In our opinion, except the

                nomenclature &#x27;Commission&#x27; as found in both the enactments along with few

                similar provisions, comparison of the two Commissions is like treating chalk

                and cheese as the same. We therefore, proceed to deal with post 1993

                precedents.

                unique expert body and entrusted with the important functions of protecting

                the human rights. Ofcourse, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has also observed

                that the Commission being a creature of the Statute, has to function within

                its limitations. But what is the limitation within which the Commission has

                to function has to be seen with reference to other provisions of the Act as

                                   prevailing in most of the States cannot support the

                                      that access to justice must not be understood in a
                                      purely quantitative dimension. Access to justice
                                      in an egalitarian democracy must be understood
                                      to mean qualitative access to justice as well.
</p><p id="p_1110">                                      Access to justice is, therefore, much more than

                                   an illusion. While theoretically it is possible that those

                                   to justice for redressal of human rights violation is
                                   convenient for the victims from the States unless the
                                   States have set up their own Commissions that would
                                   look into such complaints and grant relief. We need to
                                   remember that access to justice so much depends upon

                                   before the forum competent to grant relief. The North-
                                   Eastern parts of the country are mostly inhabited by the
                                   tribals. Such regions cannot be deprived of the
                                   beneficial provisions of the Act simply because the
                                   States are small and the setting up of Commissions in
                                   those States would mean financial burden for the
                                   exchequer. Even otherwise there is no real basis for the
                                   contention that financial constraints prevent these
                                   States from setting up their own Commissions. At any
                                   rate, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1915618/" id="a_717">Section 21(6)</a> clearly provide
                                   for two or more State Governments setting up
                                   Commissions with a common Chairperson or Member.
                                   Such appointments may be possible with the consent of
                                   Chairperson or Member concerned but it is nobody&#x27;s

                                   but the same had failed on account of the persons
                                   concerned not agreeing to take up the responsibility
                                   vis-à-vis the other State. Even NHRC had in its Annual
                                   Report (1996-1997) suggested        that if    financial
                                   constraint was really one of the reasons for not setting
                                   up of the Commission in the North-Eastern regions, the
                                   State Governments could consider setting up such
                                   Commissions by resorting to <a href="/doc/1915618/" id="a_718">Section 21(6)</a>, which

                                   ignored with impunity. In our view, to place such a
                                   construction on the expression &#x27;recommend&#x27; would
                                   dilute the efficacy of the Commission and defeat the

                                   This is evident from the provisions of clause (b) of

                                   Commission has directed the State Government to
                                   report compliance. The State Government is at liberty
                                   to challenge the order of the Commission on merits
                                   since no appeal is provided by the Act. But it cannot in

                                   While a challenge to the order of the Commission is
                                   available in exercise of the power of judicial review,
                                   the State Government subject to this right, is duty
                                   bound to comply with the order. Otherwise the purpose

                complied with. The High Court has also held that the recommendation under

                H.R.Commission was binding on the State Government and it has to be

                implemented. The observation as found in paragraph 3 read as under:

                Rights Commission versus State of Manipur and others).                         The

                observations of the High Court in relevant paragraphs of the judgment have

                already been extracted supra. In the above ruling, the High Court has held

                that jurisdiction of Constitutional Court is pre-eminently a public law

                remedy which is available to enforce authorities to perform their public

                functions with reference particularly to <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_734">Section 18</a> of the Act. The High

                Court in the said decision, has also held that the affected party can approach

                the Constitutional Court for issue of Mandamus, compelling the

                Government to discharge their duty contemplated in <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_735">Section 18</a> of the Act.

                According to the High Court once the recommendation is made, a public

                duty is cast upon the Government to implement the same. Ms.Nagasaila,

                the petition       filed by SHRC, the Court has made certain important

                observations in few paragraphs which have been extracted supra. The crux

                of the ruling of the High Court in the case is that in a conflict between the

                general enactment and the special enactment, it was held that the <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_736">Human

                Rights Act</a> being a special enactment, will have an over riding effect on the

                function in derogation of the statutory limitations. We find that the judgment

                limitation for entertaining a complaint. But the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the

                same judgment observed that &#x27;the Commission which is a unique expert body is

                                   empowers the Human Rights Commissions to take
                                   various steps during and after completion of inquiries.
                                   Should an inquiry disclose commission of violation of
                                   human rights or negligence in the prevention of human
                                   rights by a public servant, the Commission has the
                                   authority in terms of clause (a) to recommend to the
                                   concerned Government or authority the initiation of
                                   proceedings for prosecution or such other action the
                                   Commission may deem fit against the concerned
                                   person or persons. However, clause (e) leaves it to the
                                   discretion of the concerned Government or authority
                                   the action to be taken on the inquiry report, once it is
                                   forwarded to it. The recommendation contemplated
                                   under clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_742">section 18</a> is thus in the nature of an
                                   advice of the Commission and has no binding effect.
                                   This has been the main defence of the respondents. To
                                   my mind, not too frequently has this question emerged
                                   before the Courts for decision. I presume, by and large,
                                   the recommendations of the Commissions are accepted
                                   by the concerned Government or authority and
                                   instances are scarce where the writ Court had to be
                                   approached for reaping the fruits of a recommendation
                                   of the Commission. To an extent, a hitherto unexplored
                                   question has arisen for decision.</blockquote><p id="p_1137">

                                   Rights Commissions have no power to enforce its own
                                   recommendations. However, having regard to the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/

                                   Commission makes after conducting a fact finding
                                   inquiry and satisfying itself of violation of human
                                   rights of an individual by a public servant has to be
                                   seriously considered and given the respect it deserves,
                                   coming as it does from a statutory body comprising of
                                   experts in the field, and not simply ignored for no
                                   better reason than that it has no binding effect. Save
                                   and except for very cogent reasons, the
                                   recommendation ought to be gracefully accepted by the
                                   concerned Government or authority. In a case of the
                                   present nature where the recommendation has not been
                                   accepted, it is not the end of the road for the victim. My
                                   understanding of the relevant law is that a writ petition
                                   would indeed be maintainable seeking relief for
                                   compensation and direction for initiation of
                                   departmental proceedings against the delinquent public
                                   servant found responsible for violation of human
                                   rights, either based on the inquiry report of the
                                   Commission or the materials collected by it in course
                                   of inquiry/investigation. The writ Court may in such a
                                   case entertain the claim and examine for itself as to
                                   whether the Commission after maintaining the
                                   procedural safeguards and upon proper and reasonable
                                   appreciation of the evidence before it, was justified in
                                   holding the concerned public servant guilty of human
                                   rights violation, and whether and to what extent
                                   compensatory relief is called for. If required, for
                                   satisfaction of its conscience, there is no legal bar
                                   precluding the writ Court to even take recourse to re-
                                   appreciation of evidence. After all, such re-
</p><p id="p_1139">                                   appreciation would be necessitated because of the
                                   refusal of the concerned Government or authority in
                                   agreeing to implement the recommendation. Should re-
                                   appreciation of the evidence require returning of
                                   findings somewhat inconsistent with or even contrary
                                   to what have been found by the Commission, there is
                                   no reason as to why the writ Court should not feel free
                                   to return the same. If the defence of the concerned
                                   Government or authority appears to be sound and
                                   worthy of being accepted, enforcement of such
                                   recommendation may not be insisted upon resulting in
                                   dismissal of the writ petition. On the contrary, the writ

                                   accepting the recommendation are found to be
                                   frivolous and disagreement is not only an arbitrary
                                   exercise but also a ruse to avoid an uncomfortable
                                   situation. The frivolity of the reasons for disagreement
                                   cannot be allowed to override well-considered, well-
                                   written and well-meaning reports/recommendations of
                                   the Commission. If indeed the concerned Government
                                   or authority is conceded to have a final say in the
                                   matter and the report/recommendation is to remain only
                                   on paper and shelved only for gathering dust, much of
                                   the exercise undertaken by the Commission would be
                                   an act of futility rather than of utility for the victims of
                                   human rights violation. It requires no reiteration that
                                   the lofty ideals of providing succour to victims of
                                   human rights violation ought to be steadfastly pursued
                                   and any hole providing an escape route must be
                                   immediately plugged, or else the Statute is likely to be
                                   reduced to a mere dead letter. The concerned
                                   Government or authority cannot be allowed a free run
                                   despite proved violation of human rights by a
                                   delinquent public servant because of absence of teeth
                                   in the concerned legislation. If someone has been
                                   wronged, his grievance must be redressed.&#x27;

                                   may not be maintainable for enforcing such
                                   recommendation, but that would not detract from the
                                   writ Court&#x27;s power to entertain a writ petition, examine
                                   the Commission&#x27;s report and if it is found free from any
                                   legal infirmity and the recommendation based thereon
                                   is found to be justified, and the response of the
                                   concerned Government or authority is found to be
                                   frivolous and unsound, to pass such order as the

                well intentioned wish could have been transformed into reality, if only he

                clearly understood its limitation in passing any directive against the

                violators of human rights. On the same lines, the learned counsel also relied

                on a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India, reported in (2004) 8

                SCC 610 (National Human Rights Commissioner versus State of Gujarat

                which do not arise on a day to day basis for providing speedy, effective and

                extraordinary       remedies,   approaching    Constitutional   Courts,   is   not

                uncommon. Such instances have happened quite often even outside the

                realm of any statutory enactment. Therefore, such exceptional instances,

                upon permissible and purposive interpretation of the scheme of the Act in

<p id="p_1155">                           One of the earliest judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India

                on the law of interpretation was referred to, which is reported in AIR 1957

                SC 23 (Shamrao Vishnu Perulekar versus District Shamrao Parulekar).

                The said decision was relied on by the learned counsel Mr.R.Srinivas. In the

                said decision, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that expressions used

                have different meaning even within the same Act, in different context. In

                this case, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court took guidance from Maxwell&#x27;s

                Interpretation of Statute, which clarified that the same would may be used in

                different senses in the same Statute and even in the same section. Another

                learned counsel reported in (1984) 2 SCC 534 (Gramophone Company of

                India Ltd. versus Birendra Bahadur Pandey and others). Our attention

                has been drawn to paragraph nos.27 to 29 (extracted supra). According to

                the learned counsel, the above decision as well as the former one laid down

                the principle of construction and             interpretation of the words in the

                contextual settings. In the above case, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has dealt

                with interpretation of the word &#x27;import&#x27; found in <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_750">Copyright Act</a> and <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_751">Customs

                that ultimately, it boils down to the simple appreciation as to the purpose of

                the Section in which, the particular word or expression is found.

                                   say, the court must see that the thing charged as an
                                   offence is within the plain meaning of the words
                                   used, and must not strain the words on any notice that
                                   there has been a slip; that there has been a casus

                                   mischief that it must have been included if though of.
                                   On the other hand, the person charged has a right to
                                   say that the thing charged although within the words,

                                   but the Legislature in the instant case held itself bound
                                   thereby and, thus, did not legislate in disregard of the

                the Juvenile Justice Act, has held that such interpretation must be in-line

                with the principles of the International law and its statutory implication and

                also the statutory provisions need to be understood in terms of Part-III of

                the Constitution. The above important observation of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

                may not help us for the reason that the words and expressions must be

</p><p id="p_1181">                          395. On the other side, the learned Addl.Advocate General relied on

                a Constitutional Bench             decision reported in AIR 1952 SC 123 (Kathi

                Raning Rawat versus State of Saurashtra) wherein, this Court&#x27;s attention is

                drawn to para no.34 (extracted supra).               According to the learned

                Addl.Advocate General, an interpretative exercise must be in conformity

                with the legislative policy and should be in accordance with the objective

                indicated in the Statute. She also relied on a decision of an English Court,

                1857 Halsbury’s Law in the matter of John Grey versus William Pearson

                and others and drawn reference to certain observations made by the English

                Court (extracted supra). This decision is not appropriate as the same was

                with reference to interpretation of the words in a Will. This is what has now

                come to stay as &#x27;Armchair Rule&#x27;, which is intended to be an aid to interpret a

                his/her life.       It is our considered view that this Armchair Rule has no

                application whatsoever qua interpretation of public law, which we are now

                concerned with in this legal drill which is a jurisprudential journey as

                mentioned in our prefatory note. It is our further considered view that an

                attempt to use this Armchair Rule as a tool to interpret a statute in public

                law domain would tantamount to attempting to fit a square peg in a round

                hole in this jurisprudential journey. Therefore, we have no hesitation in

                holding that this John Grey English case law and the case on hand are like

                chalk and cheese. To put it differently, it would tantamount to comparing

                apples and oranges which is forbidden in an interpretative exercise and

                therefore, we reject this submission of learned Additional Advocate General

                as untenable. She also relied on a Latin maxim &#x27;mens&#x27; &amp; ‘Sententia legis’

                means, intention and presumption that the Legislature did not make a

                mistake. According to her, the role of the Courts is to carry out the obvious

                intent of the Legislature in the matter of construction of a Statute. She

                further relied on an English decision of King&#x27;s Bench dated 10.07.1933 in

                the matter of The Assam Railways &amp; Trading Co.Ltd., versus The

                Commissioner of Inland Revenue, wherein, a particular passage was

                referred to namely,

                May, 1949 and the relevant observation of the English Court is extracted

                supra.         She particularly, emphasized the famous quote from salient

                She therefore, submitted that the job of this Bench is to iron out the creasess

                and not to alter or expand the material itself.                Apart from the English

                decision, she also relied on a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court

                Board versus Indraprastha Gas Limited and others), and our attention is

                                   legislature has not given the said power to the Board. It is

                                   can speak on behalf of the legislature. It is the court which

                that while exercising the interpretative function, each and every word used

                by the Legislature must be given effect to by discovering the true legislative

                                   The Court has evolved the principle that the legislative
                                   intention must be gatherable from the text, content and
                                   context of the Statute and the purposive approach
                                   should help and enhance the functional principle of the
                                   enactment. That apart, if an interpretation is likely to
                                   cause inconvenience, it should be avoided, and further
                                   personal notion or belief of the Judge as regards the
                                   intention of the makers of the Statute should not be
                                   thought of. And, needless to say, for adopting the
                                   purposive approach there must exist the necessity. The
                                   Judge, assuming the role of creatively constructionist

                                   suit his thought and idea and drive his thinking process
                                   to wrestle with words stretching beyond a permissible

                and absurdity, the court is entitled to determine the meaning of the word in

                the context in which it is used keeping in view of the legislative purpose.

                laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court are all in black and white. The

                legal precedents on that issues are sacrosanct and no departure could be

                made, but at the same time, we could see that permissible latitude is found in

                all these judgments that the interpretation of a scheme of Act can be

                unertaken in order to inject purpose and meaning to the Act within the

                contours of the legislative intent as expressed in the language of the text.



</p><p id="p_1199">                          402. As rightly emphasized by the leaned counsel that a fair amount

                of creativity is required in modern times to take forward the legislative

                intent, after all, the legislative intent is in furtherance of larger public

                purpose and interest and to serve such purpose, the Court being the final

                interpreter of the Statute, has a momentous role in constructing and

                interpreting the deep sense of purpose and direction. The dominant purpose

                and the intent is the fulcrum of the consideration of this Bench while

                interpreting the provisions of the Statute and as held by the Hon&#x27;ble

                Supreme Court. The Courts cannot approach the subject of rule of

                construction and interpretation with ossified mind, but with a vibrant

                thinking in order to make the Statute workable in every sense in the

                contextual settings of the modern times and expectations.



</p><p id="p_1200">                           403. The reliance placed by the learned counsel on the decisions as

                to the limited application of rule of construction and interpretation when the

                Statute does not suffer from any ambiguity is a settled legal principle against

                which, no Court could have any difference of opinion.               But while

                undertaking such exercise without doing any palpable harm to the intent or

                to the language of the Act, it is always possible for the Constitutional

                Courts to embark upon correctional exercise towards plugging the holes in

                the text to strengthen it for its effective functional presence to measure up to

                the expectation of the people at large.     The intendment apart, this Bench

                has to necessarily take into consideration a larger public purpose and

                interest which the Legislature or       Parliament seek to represent in our

                democratic polity. The rule of interpretation and the law of construction

                would have to enliven the words and expressions of the Statute to attain its

                purposeful workability and its active relevance to the times. <a href="/doc/87575/" id="a_779">When the Act</a>

                was conceived and enacted, the framers possibly would not have foreseen

                the pitfalls and shortcomings of the Act in its practicable application and

                to the occasion and to provide certain dynamics to the working of the

                Statute, so that the Act does not become a dead letter and inept in addressing

                the avowed pr otection of human rights as intended and professed by the

                                       observed by Crawford in his book on Statutory
                                       Constructions that the entire legislative process
                                       is influenced by considerations of justice and
                                       reason. Justice and reason constitute the great

                                       legislation. Consequently where the suggested
                                       construction operates harshly, ridiculously or in
                                       any other manner contrary to prevailing

                                       ridiculous effect was actually intended by the

                                       people. Blackstone tells us that the fairest and
                                       most rational method to interpret the will of the
                                       legislator is by exploring his intentions at the
                                       time when the law was made, by signs most
                                       natural and probable. And these signs are either

                                       and give effect to the true meaning of what
                                       Parliament has said in the enactment to be
                                       construed. But that is not to say that attention
                                       should be confined and a literal interpretation
                                       given to the particular provisions which give
                                       rise to difficulty. Such an approach not only
                                       encourages immense prolixity in drafting, since
                                       the draftsman will feel obliged to provide
                                       expressly for every contingency which may
                                       possibly arise. It may also (under the banner of
                                       loyalty to the will of Parliament) lead to the
                                       frustration of that will, because undue
                                       concentration on the minutiae of the enactment
                                       may lead the court to neglect the purpose
                                       which Parliament intended to achieve when it
                                       enacted the Statute. Every Statute other than a
                                       pure consolidating Statute is, after all, enacted
                                       to make some change, or address some
                                       problem, or remove some blemish, or effect
                                       some improvement in the national life. The
                                       court&#x27;s task, within the permissible bounds of
                                       interpretation, is to give effect to Parliament&#x27;s
                                       purpose. So the controversial provisions should
                                       be read in the context of the Statute as a whole,
                                       and the Statute as a whole should be read in the
                                       historical context of the situation which led to

                observations of the Constitutional Court (extracted supra).



</p><p id="p_1221">                            411. Ultimately, the Constitution Court of South Africa held that

                though the Institution of Public Protector may not enjoy the same status of a

                judicial officer and remedial action taken by the Public Protector may

                justifiably in law be disregarded, but the Court eventually held that such

                conclusion was worrisome but also at odds with the rule of law. The

                Constitutional Court has finally held that the National Assembly of South

                Africa was duty bound to hold the President accountable by facilitating and

                ensuring compliance with the decision of the Public Protector. In fact, the

                Constitutional Court went on to hold that there was everything wrong with

                the National Assembly stepping into the shoes of Public Protector by

                passing a resolution that purported effectively to nullify the findings made

                and remedial action taken by the Public Protector and replacing them with

                its own findings and &#x27;remedial action&#x27;. According to the Constitutional

                Court, the rule of law is dead against such action and it is another way of

                taking the law into one’s hands and thus constitutes self-help.       Before

                                   were optional, then very few culprits, if any at all,
                                   would allow it to have any effect. And if it were, by
                                   design, never to have a binding effect, then it is
                                   incomprehensible just how the Public Protector could
                                   ever be effective in what she does and be able to
                                   contribute to the strengthening of our constitutional
                                   democracy. The purpose of the office of the Public
                                   Protector is therefore to help uproot prejudice,
                                   impropriety, abuse of power and corruption in State
                                   affairs, all spheres of government and State-controlled
                                   institutions. The Public Protector is a critical and
                                   indeed indispensable factor in the facilitation of good
                                   governance and keeping our constitutional democracy
                                   strong and vibrant.&#x27;

                Principles concerning the Status of Commissions with quasi-jurisdictional

                Ms.Naga Saila has contended that none of the enactments which are similar

                in nature, substantially has a provision like Section 18(e) of H.R.Act. As far

                as <a href="/doc/46143524/" id="a_804">Section 18(e)</a> is concerned, the concerned Government or authority is

                under a legal obligation to forward its comments including action taken or

                proposed to be taken within the time stipulated. Such mandate is not

                provided in other enactments. Moreover, she also submitted that the other

                provisions of H.R.Act need to be conjunctively read in order to distinguish

                between the Commission established under H.R.Act with that of the

                National Commisison for <a href="/doc/131273063/" id="a_806">Women Act</a>,1990 and its Regulations, National

                dealing with particular category or class of victims, viz., either a child, a

                woman or a member of SC or ST, whereas, the Protection of Human Rights

                Therefore, the comparison of the H.R.Commission established under

                H.R.Act with the Commissions constituted for other purposes, merely

                because certain provisions appear to be similar may not be a proper analysis.

                The most crucial and paramount difference is the composition of the

                Commission.         In all other Commissions, the selection and method of

                appointment is simple and the Members appointed in those Commissions

                its very composition, stands on an exalted judicial footing. In this regard, the

                Bench has dealt with relevant provisions of the Act to highlight the

                incomparable status of the occupants of the H.R.Commission.

                amendments which have been introduced into H.R.Act in 2006. According

                to him, Sub Clauses (i) to (iii) to <a href="/doc/60876489/" id="a_808">Section 18(a)</a> were introduced in 2006.

                An argument was advanced by him that the subsequent amendments could

                also be a source of guidance to appreciate the scheme of the Act. According

                to the learned counsel, the intention of the Parliament, by vesting the

                Commission with more power as a consequence to 2016 amendment, was

                revealed. In this connection, the learned counsel has referred to a decision

                of the Hon’ble Supreme Court reported in (2011) 14 SCC 1 (Om Prakash

                versus Union of India), particularly, paragraph 40 (extracted supra). The

                learned counsel submitted that subsequent amendment was a demonstration

                of thinking of the Legislature. We cannot have any quarrel with the

                submissions made by the learned counsel in this regard. When the scheme

                of the Act is to be understood in the present context, in the process of such

                understanding, the amendments that have been introduced in the Act, have

                also to be taken into consideration while interpreting the framework of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_452">                                                   457</span>

                Act. As far as 2006 amendments are concerned, as emphasized by the

                learned counsel, the amendments to <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_809">Section 18</a> are quite significant and

                may think fit. The framers while amending the provisions, have obviously

                taken note of the functional limitation of the Commission over the years and

                to remedy the shortcoming, additional power has been vested in the

                Commission.

                submitted that one private Member moved a Bill in the Parliament to

                provide more power to the Commission as at that time, it was felt that the

                Commission’s recommendation was not binding on the Government.

                However, the private Member’s Bill suggesting suitable amendments fell

                through and did not become a law.          We are conscious of the said

                development and in fact, the same was also referred to in earlier part of the

                judgment. However, what is more important for this Bench is to have a

                comprehensive understanding of the collective wisdom of the Parliament

                and not the aim of a private Member of the Parliament. When subsequent

                amendments were brought about in 2006, it was a positive nature of

                amendments making the Commission pro-active. When such amendments

                have been introduced on taking note of the working of the Act from 1993 till

                2006, certainly, the framers had intended to make the Commission a self-

                contained judicial forum with sufficient power for its effectual functioning.

                several decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and various High Courts,

                one factor could be conclusively established is that none of the judgments

                has taken into account the entire provisions of the Act, starting from the

                ‘definition of human rights’, ‘constitution of Commission’ ‘functions and

                powers of the Commission, ‘procedure laid down for conducting inquiry

                into complaints’, ‘human rights Courts’, etc. Moreover, the distinguishing

                features of recommendations by the H.R.Commission, one under <a href="/doc/958544/" id="a_811">Section 12</a>

                and the other under <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_812">Section 18</a> of the Act, have also been not part of the

                judicial discourse undertaken by the Courts earlier. In such view of the

                matter, it is the constitutional duty of this Bench to penetrate through all the

                provisions contained in the Act so that the ultimate answers to the Reference

                would be on the basis of the comprehensive understanding of the Act in its

                what is provided in the Indian Constitution and defined as fundamental

                rights and which are embodied in the International Covenants and

                enforceable in India. The definition provides a key to the understanding of

                the Act, its purpose, scope and enforceability. By the very definition of

                ‘human rights’, H.R.Act becomes a statutory extension of the constitutional

                rights. In that view of the matter, the interpretation of H.R.Act is not be

                confined within the statutory boundaries as it perceived, but the rights which

                are to be protected under the Act require to be examined and appreciated

                to the human rights. Likewise, Chapter-II deals with constitution of National

                the Supreme Court, another Member who is or has been the Chief Justice of

                a High Court and the Member Experts of human rights. The composition of

                these Commissions itself is self-evident to describe the Commission

                unmistakably a full-fledged judicial body. Despite its unique composition,

                the Commissions are not be recognized as Judicial bodies because they are

                nomenclatured as Commissions and functions as statutory creature under the

                the Act.           Firstly, the Commissions are presided by high Constitutional

                functionaries appointed for particular tenure by the Hon’ble President of

                India on the basis of the recommendations of high power Committee.

                Secondly, their appointments are on the basis of recommendations of high

                power Committee headed by the Hon’ble Prime Minister and the Hon’ble

                Chief Minister as the case may be and other Hon’ble Constitutional

                dignitaries. This particular procedure of appointment of the Members of the

                Commission is not followed in other similar Commissions, viz.,

</p><p id="p_1250">                          429. Thus, the framers of the Act, have attached great importance to

                the status of the Commission by appointing the most experienced judicial

                minds of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court or High Court and the selection is

                scrutinized by a Committee headed by no less than the authority than the

                Hon&#x27;ble Prime Minister and other high Constitutional functionaries.

                Therefore, a clear and himalayan distinction has been made in the matter of

                appointment of the Chairperson and Members of the H.R.Commission. In

                that sense, the Commission under H.R.Act is jurisdictionally and

                functionally different from the Commission established under other similar

                enactments. We have not come across any judgment or any arguments

                touching up these factors as to how the composition of the Committee which

                is entrusted with the important task of making recommendation towards

                appointment of the Commission&#x27;s Chairperson and Members and also its

                composition that would be a singular paramount distinction to accord the

                H.R.Commission an exalted position with a clear legal mandate. If the

                Commissions are to be assigned the role of a mere fact finding bodies and

                high power (highest) Committee which is entrusted with the task of making

                recommendation for appointment of Chairperson and Members of the

                Commission is not required at all. Therefore, there is some thing more to be

                recommendatory at best. The recommendations under the above provisions

                being generic and suggestive with regard to state of affairs of the public

                administration in relation to human rights, such recommendations per se are

                to be construed as recommendatory only. As rightly contended by the

                learned counsel for SHRC, Mr.R.Srinivas, those recommendations are to be

                part of the Annual or Special Reports to be placed before the House of

                provisions of the Civil Procedure Code,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_821"> Indian Penal Code</a>,<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_822"> Criminal

                Procedure Code</a>, etc. The Commission is vested with the power of the Civil

                Court under <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_823">Section 13</a> of the Act. Therefore, the Commission enjoys as a

                whole the status of a Civil Court while conducting inquiries into the

                complaints. In fact, there are references to Courts rulings that because the

                Commission exercises the power of the Civil Court, it does not become as

                Court as such, as the Commission is incapable of rendering judgments

                within the frame work of the Act. We are of the view that such interpretation

                of <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_824">Section 13</a> falls from a narrow perspective and also such interpretation is

                without proper understanding of the other Sections, particularly <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_825">Section 18</a>

                of the Act.        When <a href="/doc/1348169/" id="a_826">Section 13</a> provided a judicial character to the

                proceedings in complete sense giving constricted meaning to such power

                enjoyed by the Commission, in our opinion, amounted to split understanding

                of the Act, ignoring conjunctive and holistic consideration.

                enjoys only a limited power and jurisdiction because of the fact that the

                statement made before the Commission cannot be used as evidence before

                any Court of law and therefore, the Commission cannot said to be a judicial

                body and consequently, its recommendation cannot be a binding order. Such

                interpretation is premised on a faulty understanding that by reason of non-

                admissibility of evidence tendered before the Commission, before the Courts

                of law, one cannot conclude that the Commission’s recommendation is not

                binding on the Government. For that matter, any evidence tendered outside

                the frame work of <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_829">Cr.P.C</a>. or C.P.C. may not be admissible in a Court of

                law, though the principles of law of evidence are normally adopted and

                followed. But that does not mean that the finding based on such evidence

                quintessence of the entire Act. Making and unmaking of a Statute lies on

                the purposive understanding of the enactment. If the normative standard of

                principle is the underlying consideration, it may invariably lead to the

                beaten path and eventually may hit the road block. If the principle of

                seminal, exploratory and creative understanding is the underscoring effort,

                then it would fruitfully result in interpretation and construction aimed at

                providing manifest thrust to the latent intent and the spirit of the Act. In

                order to achieve the purpose, we cannot allow the Act to remain standstill,

                every section of the Act must be reasonably and permissively accorded

                expansive meaning to infuse vibrancy in the letter of the enactment. While

                relief to the victim. When the Commission is vested with the power of

                making recommendations for grant of immediate relief, such provision

                would have to be construed on a natural corollary construct that the

                Government for payment of interim relief as recommended by the

                Commission. The word ‘immediate’ used in the provision would have to be

                understood as ‘immediate compliance’. The attributes of the word

                relevance in the context. Therefore, the word &#x27;immediate&#x27; in the provision

                defines the recommendation of the Commission as to its binding nature.

                The only option for the Government is to move the appropriate legal forum

                recommend for making payment of compensation or damages or to initiate

                proceedings for prosecution or such other suitable action as the Commission

                may deem fit.        The word ‘recommendation’ in the context of these

                provisions, ought not to be given its ordinary or literal sense of the meaning.

                Merely because the framers used the word ‘recommendation’, the binding

                decision of the Commission cannot be whittled down to mere

                recommendation as it understood in common parlance. When the

                We are unable to persuade ourselves to this specious argument for the

                reference to other provisions of the Section, one cannot but come to an

                inexorable conclusion that the concerned Government or Authority is legally

                bound to either inform the Commission within the stipulated time, ‘the

                action taken’ or ‘proposed to be taken’ on the recommendation of the

                Commission.         For illustration, the concerned Government may offer its

                comments to the Report as to the action taken in implementation of the

                recommendation or may inform the Commission that it proposed to

                challenge the Commission’s recommendation before the competent Court.

                On such action taken or proposed to be taken being revealed to the

                Commission, Sub Clause (f) is pressed into service, namely, publication of

                the inquiry report together with the comments. But the Section mandatorily

                without enforceable consequence, the provisions would have been drafted

                more clearly and lucidly, giving expression to the intendment of the framers.

                part of <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_848">Section 18</a> also. The deliberate and conscious omission was in fact

                the expression of the legislative intent to classify the recommendation as (i)

                complaint specific, when the Commission goes through the rigmarole of

                inquiry, investigation and trial and (ii) not related to complaint specific, but

                related to the policy matter of the Government on human rights. Therefore,

                any constricted sense of understanding of <a href="/doc/46143524/" id="a_849">Section 18(e)</a> or comparison to

                enactment an assurance was meted out by the Hon’ble Home Minister,

                assuring the Members of the Parliament that the recommendations of the

                Government had never failed to implement the recommendations of the

                Finance Commission. Therefore, the intention of the framers was to make

                Constitutional Court to remedy the unintentional shortcomings in the Act

                framers, the debates around the enactment could have been only on the

                letters of law as it framed and expressed in the form of the Act. But when

                the Act is put into practice and in the process of implementation, when

                certain unintended lacunae and pitfalls noticed, the Constitutional Court

                cannot come up with a barren, naïve and inane construction of the Act and

                the Act must relate to enforcing of the constitutional rights as guaranteed

                under Part III of the Constitution. Examining H.R.Act through the lens of

                the Constitution, which is enacted for protecting human rights is to be

                interpreted in order to provide thrust to the to the rights guaranteed in the

                Constitution relating to life, liberty, equality, dignity, etc.           In that

                perspective, the Act being extended arm of the Constitution in the sphere of

                the human rights and the Commission created by the Act as a Protector of

                human rights, the remedial action of the Commission must be capable of

                attaining its fruition. To recall the words of South Africa Constitution Court

                in one of its judgments, &#x27;an appropriate remedy must mean an effective

                remedy, for without effective remedies for breach, the values underlying and

                the rights entrenched in the Constitution cannot properly be upheld or

                enhanced.&#x27; We are therefore, of the view that enforceable remedial action

                through Commission is in fulfillment of constitutional mandate and not

                mere addressing the complaints for ideational purpose.

                that the remedies recommended by the Public Protector cannot be replaced

                by the powers with their own remedial action if any.

                to be slighted or ignored. If the recommendations are open to be ignored or

                empty promise and a mirage, betraying its core purpose. It is needless to

                mention that any act done by the agents/officials of the Government in

                violation of the human rights, is purported to be at the behest of the

                inquiry. Firstly, it can recommend for payment of compensation to the

                complainant or to the victim. Secondly, it can initiate proceedings for

                as it may think fit. These amended provisions reinforce the fact that the

                Commission has been clothed with additional powers.            In its decision

                reported in (2011) 14 SCC 1 (Om Prakash versus Union of India), the

                Honble Supreme Court has held that subsequent amendments can be taken

                into consideration to appreciate the thinking of the Legislature. When the

                Commission is endowed with the jurisdiction of recommending payment of

                compensation or damages, initiating proceedings for prosecution and also to

                take further action as it may think fit, all that powers which are exercisable

                by the Commission are not meant to be a vain or fruitless exercise. When

                the expression ‘action’ used in Sub Clause (iii), the natural meaning of the

                same is something more than what means as a recommendation simplicitor.

                The word ‘action’ in <a href="/doc/1753082/" id="a_859">Section 18</a> is akin to the Government or Authority

                taking action in discharge of its duties.          It denotes command and

                observance. It is defined in Lexicon as &#x27;a thing done: Deed&#x27;. In Merriam-

                Webster Dictionary, one of the meanings of ‘action’ is defined as &#x27;the

                initiating of a proceeding in a court of justice by which one demands or

                enforces one&#x27;s right&#x27;. Therefore, the expression ‘action’ in the provision is to

                be understood that recommendation to be made by the Commission either

                ‘during’ or ‘after’ inquiry has an actionable force and is binding on the

                Government. The only way to avoid implementation of the Commission’s

                having the power of enforcement, our answer is that any creature of a

                Statute is not empowered to interpret the very scheme of the Act which gave

                its birth. Further, it is up to the Constitutional Court to interpret the

                the subject matter and also on the basis of the principles laid down on the

                Interpretation is an artistic tool by which the true sense of any form of words

                conclusion that leaps beyond the bland words of the text for achieving its

                purposeful existence.         Therefore, the caged understanding of the

                Commission of its power and scope of inquiry and its recommendation may

                not be the basis of our critical understanding and we cannot simply endorse

                Constitutional Court can expand its vistas by our interpretation of the

                scheme of the Act. NHRC or SHRC has to necessarily function within the

                apparent provisions of the Act and it cannot overreach its statutory

                limitation as perceived by it being a creature of the Statute. Any statutory

                creature has to mandatorily fall in line with the limited confines of the letter

                of the Act. Whereas, the role of the Constitutional Court is to bridge the

                gulfs in the working of the Act and make it effectual and potent. In that

                process, semantic innovation and construction can be resorted to, to infuse

                completeness and amplitude to the Act vis-à-vis Commission and its

                unintended shortcomings are impeding the effective functioning of the

                State of Jharkhand and another), the Hon’ble Supreme Court, while

                interpreting the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act has held that the

                also the provisions need to be understood in terms of Part III of the

                the words in the Statute are plain and unambiguous, it is mandatory to

                expound those words in the natural and ordinary sense.            We have no

                problem with that arguments. While holding as such, the Hon’ble Supreme

                Court has also held that &#x27;if the plain language resulted in absurdity, the

                Court is entitled to determine the meaning of the word in the context in

                which it is used keeping in view of the Legislative purpose&#x27;. In a decision

                reported in (2009) 7 SCC 1 (N.Kannadasan versus Ajoy Khose and others)&#x27;,

                the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that- &#x27;in order to give a complete and

                some words can be subtracted. Provisions of a Statute can be read down to

                make it effective as to its purpose.&#x27;

                unambiguous, it must be understood by literal, plain and ordinary sense of

                the meaning, and no latitude is permitted, in our opinion, these arguments

                are run of the mill submissions divorced from the contextual nature of the

                task assigned to us when we are considering the most sacrosanct of all

                rights, namely, ‘human rights’ which rights inhere to every human being as

                being natural rights fundamental to his existence and such rights are to be

                preserved and protected and enforced.         The Commission which was

                conceived by the Parliament as a Protector of such rights must not be

                hamstrung by pedestrian construction of the scheme of the Statute. Great

                activism has been expanding progressively by passage of time to stay

                relevant as a sentinnel and watchdog in protecting the basic structure of the

                Constitution which includes fundamental rights of the citizens. When a

                specific legal mechanism is created with a professed purpose under the Act

                to carry out the mandate of the Constitution, that legal mechanism cannot be

                allowed to be an institution with a theoretical power of making

                recommendations only.        It is said that &#x27;law without justice is a wound

                without cure&#x27; and it is also said that &#x27;justice without force is, powerless&#x27;.



</p><p id="p_1300">                          460. The legal principles as evolved over the years can be summed up

                in a nutshell, that the words and the expressions used in a Statute which do not

                suffer from any ambiguity and the words and expressed are lucid and clear, the

                Courts can interpret those words and expressions with no other meaning than

                the words to receive the meaning as understood in common parlance

                (ordinary sense).      But interpretation of the provisions of the Statute is

                permissible only when there are glaring ambiguities in the expressions or the

                words are unclear of expressive intent of the framers.



</p><p id="p_1301">                          461. The words and expressions as used in the Act are required some

                times, to be understood and interpreted not because they suffer from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_482">                                                    487</span>

                ambiguities or lack of clarity, but because these ordinary expressions may

                not effectively transform the true ideas and policies as intended by the

                framers of the Constitution when an Act is put into practical

                implementation. The word ambiguity itself has a limited meaning, in the

                sense, that the word or expression suffering from ambiguity if the same is

                capable of denoting more than one meaning. Likewise, unclear usage of

                words may also necessarily invite mandatory interpretation into the

                contextual settings of the Act. However, in our opinion, words and

                expressions of the provisions of the Act are to be given different shades of

                meaning in the ultimate implementation of the Act shedding its ordinary

                meaning, to provide legal wherewithal to make the legislation workable. In

                such view of the matter, lack of clarity or ambiguity is not with reference to

                the plain words and expressions, in the lexicon sense but with reference to

                the spirit of the enactment and its destined purpose.

                is to be relegated to a subservient position to the executive. The fundamental

                guaranteed by the Constitution of India. When a Commission is constituted

                for securing the fundamental rights of the citizens, such Commission being a

                Protector of the human rights, cannot function with emasculated enforceable

                power. The human rights, as it universally understood, are inherent in every

                human being, such rights are non-negotiable and inalienable. The recent

                history witnessed several developments towards evolving advancement of

                human rights, globally. The natural rights have finally taken a legal shape

                by Universal Declaration on human rights on 10th December, 1948 by the

                United Nations General Assembly.           In the Declaration, the rights are

                encapsulated and the Nation States which are committed to the Declaration,

                are bound to provide domestic institutions for remedial action for human

                rights violations and protection of it.

                human rights against the concerned Government or Authority, the

                Commission cannot be placed in a position of hand-maid of the executive

                and the Government can ignore it. In fact, it is submitted that the majority

                of the recommendations have been accepted and statistics have also been

                made available before this Bench. However, when we decide on the larger

                issue of whether the Commission’s recommendation is an adjudicatory order

                and that it is binding or its recommendations are only recommendatory

                of human rights laws, namely, the Commission must be held that its

                recommendations are binding on the concerned Government or Authority

                and the only option which may open to the concerned Government or

                Authority          is    to     approach    the      competent    Court    assailing   the

                delinquent/Government employee to be given opportunity under the relevant

                service Rules/Regulations, we are of the view that the issues need to be

                divided into two aspects. In case of compensation/damages being ordered

                by the Commission, if it is recoverable from the delinquent, the concerned

                Government or authority is under obligation to call for the remarks or

                explanation from the delinquent concerned before proceeding to recover the

                compensation/damages recommended by the Commission. This procedure

                may have to be followed as a compliance to the rudimentary of principles of

                natural justice that any action visiting the delinquent with civil

                consequences, he/she is to be provided with a basic opportunity of

                explaining his/her conduct.

                being extended to the delinquent official, yet an opportunity that has been

                contemplated in the Act is from the point of view of the Commission versus

                the concerned Government or authority in conducting inquiry into the

                complaint of human rights violation. Any such finding or recommendation

                of inquiry, may not be implemented directly without even affording an

                opportunity to the delinquent under the relevant service Regulations. This is

                not to say that the concerned Government has to conduct any departmental

                inquiry while implementing the recommendations of the Commission

                against the delinquent official, that show cause notice is a minimum

                requirement which in our opinion, is to be complied with.

                or authority takes a decision to impose major penalty on finding a serious

                violation of rights indulged in by the delinquent official in discharge of

                his/her duties. In such cases, we are of the view that the finding of the

                Commission may be used as the basis for initiating departmental

                proceedings, but it is not necessary to go through the entire rigmarole of

                major penalty proceedings contemplated in the service Rules.         When a

                Chief Justice of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court as far as NHRC is concerned, its

                finding cannot be ignored as the same is binding, as held by us.

                delinquent to prove the extent of his/her culpability in the violation, on the

                issue of proportionality of punishment, an inquiry may be conducted. This is

                to take care of the interest of the delinquent employee who may have

                adequate defence explaining his/her conduct as against his employer and

                he/she may convince the Government for a reprieve.



</p><p id="p_1335">                          485. As far as the finding/recommendation of the Commission is

                concerned, such finding/recommendation is entirely based on two

                dimensional approach on the alleged violation of human rights. The criteria

                and the objective factors which would weigh the consideration before the

                Commission would be materially different when the Commission render

                finding against the delinquent official. One facet is award of compensation

                or damages and the other facet is to facilitate initiation of criminal action

                against the delinquent officer.

                administrative instructions and parameters would come up for consideration

                when a finding to be rendered by an Inquiry Officer.             Further, the

                proportionality of punishment is a very import legal principle that has been

                adopted in service jurisprudence and to deal with same, an inquiry is

                required to be undertaken departmentally. As laid down by our Court, when

                administrative action is questioned and assailed before the Constitutional

                Courts, such action would have to be tested among other, Wednsebury

                Principles. The scope of the Commission testing the validity of the action of

                the official (public servant) is only confined with reference to human rights

                violation, whereas any action by the employer is resulting in inflicting the

                major penalty on their servants, a different legal requirements may have to

                be followed.

                to be fastened with liability towards damages or compensation

                recommended by the Commission, in which case, no inquiry is necessary at

                all. In fact, even in any service regulation for imposition of minor penalty,

                regards imposition of major penalty, the delinquent employee ought to be

                given a reasonable opportunity which, in our opinion, should go beyond

                mere issuing show cause notice, in order to find out the nature of

                involvement and extent of culpability of the employee concerned to arrive at

                quantum of punishment to be imposed on him/her. This is necessary for the

                reason that the Commission&#x27;s inquiry and departmental inquiry operate on

                different perspectives and from different stand points. As far as Commission

                of Inquiry is concerned, it is Commission vis-a-vis the concerned

                Government, but as regards the departmental inquiry, it is delinquent vis-a-

                vis employer. Therefore, for implementation of major penalty, such

<p id="p_1348">                            Ans: As our answer is in the affirmative in respect of the first point

                of Reference, the same holds good for this point of Reference as well. We

                having held that the recommendation is binding, the State has no discretion

                to avoid implementation of the recommendation and in case the State is

                aggrieved, it can only resort to legal remedy seeking judicial review of the

                recommendation of the Commission.

                Ans: As far as the initiation of disciplinary proceedings under the relevant

                notice is sufficient in regard to the quantum of compensation recommended

                and to be recovered from the Officers/employees of the concerned

                Government. However, in regard to imposition of penalty as a consequence

                of a delinquent official being found guilty of the violation,              a limited

                departmental enquiry may be conducted only to ascertain the extent of

                culpability of the Official concerned in causing violation in order to

                formulate an opinion of the punishing Authority as to the proportionality of

                the punishment to be imposed on the official concerned. This procedure may

                be followed only in cases where the disciplinary authority/punishing

                authority comes to the conclusion on the basis of the inquiry proceedings

                and the recommendations of the Commission that the delinquent official is

                required to be visited with any of the major penalties enumerated in the

                express our considered opinion that despite all the provisions in the Act,

                covering wide spectrum of human rights concerns in consonance with the

                Rule of Law governing our polity, in the absence of an inbuilt and integral

                provision within the explicit frame work of the Statute, a perception has

                been gaining ground in the corridors of the implementing authorities that the

                recommendation of the H.R.Commission lacks legal sanctity and hence can

                be trifled with. Such perception and point of view on the part of the

                implementing authority may not augur well towards addressing the

                complaints of human rights violation in the country where the written

                Constitution reigns supreme and is placed at the altar of our governance.



</p><p id="p_1360">                          493. Although the history after the introduction of the Act, reveals

                that by and large the recommendations of the Commission have been

                implemented, any discretion to the implementing authorities to either accept

                or not accept the recommendation would only lead to avoidable delay,

                forcing the Commission to invoke <a href="/doc/61275374/" id="a_886">Section 18(b)</a> of the Act.

                are always in a state of fluidity depending on expectations resulting in shifts

                and changes of perspective framework of the policy makers.            In such

                circumstances, at the time of enactment of the Act, an assurance given on

                behalf of the Treasury Bench by the Hon’ble Minister concerned that

                recommendation of the H.R.Commission would be accorded due respect as

                in the case of recommendation of the Finance Commission and the

                Government in the past had never declined to accept the recommendation of

                the Finance Commission as matter of healthy convention.



</p><p id="p_1362">                          495. The history of politics and governance has been witnessing

                constant change through evolution of different policies and as a

                consequence of such change any convention observed in the past has its

                breaking point in tune with the time. Therefore, the Act which was

                introduced providing a public law remedy, cannot be operated on the basis

                of the assurance of the Hon’ble Minister concerned, unless the assurance is

                transformed into a letter of law for all the time to be followed.



</p><p id="p_1363">                          496. The avowed intention of the policy framed at that point of time

                was clear but at the same time, following any convention after all is a only a

                matter of choice at the end of the day. If in this context, we are of the

                considered opinion that the intention of the framers may be given a statutory
