<p id="p_1">Thottathil B.Radhakrishnan, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">         We have heard learned counsel for the appellant

and   learned    Senior     Government        Pleader for the

Department of Commercial Taxes.
</p>
<p id="p_3">    2.   Under challenge is the judgment, whereby the

learned single Judge refused to interfere with the condition

imposed by the first appellate authority in an appeal under

the KVAT Act. That authority ordered payment of 30% of

the outstanding demand to sustain the order of stay

granted. The petitioner/writ appellant contends that no

amount should have been imposed for deposit as a

condition for stay.
</p>
<p id="p_4">    3. The petitioner is a dealer in bakery and

confectionery products. There are two components in the

assessment order. One is for payment of tax at the rate of

12.5%, on the basis that the dealer has a registered trade

mark. The second is denial of 'input tax credit'.

</p><p id="p_5">      4. We sustain the impugned order of the appellate

authority for payment of 30% to the extent it relates to

30% of input tax credit component of the appeal pending

before the appellate authority.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      5. Regarding the issue of payment of tax at 12.5%, on

the ground that the dealer has a registered trade mark,

Ext.P1 certificate shows that the trade mark application

was on 26.6.2009; but it was issued by the Registrar of

Trade Marks, only on 27.7.2013. The provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a> provide a deeming provision whereby the

effect of registration certificate is made applicable from a

retrospective date. It is trite law that such provision is

based on the principle of deemed equivalence to public

user of such mark, as held by the Honourable Supreme

Court      in     <a href="/doc/292181/" id="a_2">Meghraj Biscuits    Industries   Ltd.   v.

Commissioner of Central Excise, U.P</a>. [2007 (210)

ELT 161 (SC)] and followed by Their Lordships in

<a href="/doc/1336596/" id="a_3">Commissioner of Central Excise, Bangalore v.

M/S.Meyer Health Care (Pvt.) Ltd. &amp; Ors. (Civil

Appeal Nos</a>.4052-4054 of 2003, judgment dated

24.7.2011). With the availability of these judgments, we

are unable to insist on the appellant as a dealer paying the

30% component of the demand based on the rate of tax

being 12.5% on the goods. That portion of the impugned

order of the first appellate authority is liable to be

quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      In the result, this writ appeal is allowed, vacating the

impugned judgment and modifying Ext.P4 order, and

ordering that stay of collection of the disputed amount for

the year 2011-12 will be subject to the condition that the

appellant pays 30% of the amount in dispute under the

head "Input Tax Credit" and furnishes adequate security

for the balance amount of the input tax credit component

before the assessing authority within a period of three

weeks from today. Ext.P4 will stand modified accordingly.

If any of the conditions of this judgment, as stated above, is

not fulfilled, the effect of Ext.P4 order will stand vacated.
