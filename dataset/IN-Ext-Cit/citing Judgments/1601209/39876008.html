    daughter Prachi, since deceased.   It was a love marriage performed in
                                
    August, 2000 despite the parents of Prachi initially not willing for the

    same to give consent and on her insistence gave consent.   Prachi was
      


    Architect   and   appellant   was   in   private   service.     After   marriage,   they
   



    resided with his parents for about three months. Thereafter they started

    residing in a rented house at Flat No.4 at Anadam Co-operative Housing





    Society   at   Koparkhairane.   Within   3   to   4   months,   P.W.2   Dinkar

    purchased the said flat in the name of his   wife Sandhya and daughter





    Prachi.   P.W.6 Rashmi, the elder sister of Prachi was also residing in the

    same building, on the 4th floor. Within few days after the marriage, the

    appellant became addicted to liquor and started illtreating   Prachi. He

    also developed an affair with his ex-colleague Preeti Surange. She used

    to visit his house in the absence of Prachi.   That created a rift in the

    informed   her   parents   on   phone   that   the   appellant   was   in   drunken

    condition and beating her. They reached her home to find the appellant




                                             
    under the influence of liquor. They took Prachi to their home. On the
                               
    next day, the appellant apologised toher for that incidence and therefore,

    Prachi again returned to his house. However, there was no improvement
                              
    in   the   conduct   of   appellant.   He   was   also   arrested   by   Vashi   Railway

    Police,  in connection with robbery. P.W.2 Dinkar, Prachi's father  got
      


    him released on bail. This conduct of the appellant ultimately drove the
   



    parties to take decision of divorce by mutual consent. The petition to that

    effect was filed in the Civil Court at Thane in April, 2002. On filing such





    petition, Prachi shifted to the house of her parents; whereas appellant left

    for Delhi. His girl friend Preeti followed him. The appellant's father then





    approached     P.   W.2   Dinkar,   to   make   efforts   for   Prachi   to   resume

    cohabitation with appellant. Hence Prachi went to  Delhi to convince the

    appellant. In November, 2002, appellant returned to Navi Mumbai and

    both of them started residing together on the assurance of appellant that

    he will improve his conduct.

    with antemortem injuries thereon was found in the cabinet   leaves no

    and again to the appellant not to beat her, not to abuse her and  get over

    with his obsession  for  Preeti makes it clear  that it was  not merely a





    marital discord between the parties but it was a clear case of harassment

    and cruelty. Prachi was beaten, assaulted and abused in filthy language





    by   appellant.   These   notes   also   make   it   clear   that   the   appellant   was

    addicted   to   liquor   and   was   having   an   affair   with   Preeti,   the   another

    deeply frustrated state of mind. An attempt is made to submit that the

    suicide   and   therefore,   it   rules   out   the   possibility   of   her   death   being

    cabinet, with injuries   to her head and attempted throttling, does not in

    any   way   probabilise   the   theory   of   suicide.   The   person   committing




                                                            
    suicide   will   not   cause   24   injuries   to   oneself,   including   attempt   of




                                                           
    throttling and head injuries and thereafter put body in the cabinet. We

    have already held that the presence of these multiple injuries on her body




                                              
    and   presence   of   evidence   proving   attempted   throttling,   coupled   with
                               
    unequivocal opinion of P.W.4 Dr. Bhushan Jain, leaves no manner of

    doubt that her death was homicidal one. The motive for the same may be
                              
    because of Prachi's mentally disturbed condition and resistance which

    was     coming   in   the   way   of   appellant's   relations   with   Preeti.   Her
      


    constantly   objecting   his   relations   with   Preeti   and   his   unruly   conduct
   



    must have prompted the appellant to eliminate her from his life. These

    hand   written   notes,   thus,   also   explain   the   cause   and   motive   for   the





    appellant to commit murder.

    appellant as to the timing of death. It is urged that according to P.W.4

    Dr. Bhushan Jain, who has conducted postmortem on the dead body of

    Prachi, the   death might have occurred 12 to 24 hours prior to time of

    circumstantial evidence. The tests laid down are to the effect that  (i) the

    circumstances from which inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must
      
   



    be cogently and firmly established; (ii) those circumstances should be of

    a definite tendency and unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused;

    under   <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_20">Section   313</a>   of   Code   of   Criminal   Procedure,   the   appellant   has

    urged possibility of some intruder coming to the house in his absence




                                                           
    and Prachi hiding herself in the cabinet out of fear of injuries from that




                                                          
    person. He has stated that, such person might have come to their flat to

    commit certain theft or for some other reason. However, to say the least,




                                             
    in our opinion this possibility is totally ruled out from the evidence of
                               
    Prachi's parents, who have deposed that after the incident on 7th  April,

    when they visited the flat of Prachi and appellant, they found that none
                              
    of the articles in the flat, including gold ornaments was missing or stolen

    therefrom.  Therefore, the possibility of some third person entering into
      


    the house with the intention of committing theft is totally ruled out. 
</p>   



<p id="p_99">    48.             Secondly, if at all any intruder has entered into flat, Prachi

    would   have   raised   hue   and   cry,   called   watchman   or   tried   to   escape





    herself   from   the   flat,   instead   of   confining   herself   in   the   cabinet.
</p>
<p id="p_100">    Moreover, in that case she would not have antemortem injuries on her





    person like attempted  throttling. Thus, this defence is so farfetched that

    it hardly deserves any merit.

<p id="p_101">    49.             Indisputably the incident had taken place in the house where

    the appellant and Prachi were cohabiting together. The spot panchnama

    the blood stains were seen on the curtain, on the floor, wall and also on

    the  cover of keyboard of computer. Hair were also seen on the floor. All




                                                          
    these articles including cigarette butt were seized  by the police  under




                                                         
    panchnama. The flower-pot with dents thereon was also seized under

    panchnama. Therefore, when the incident has taken place very much in




                                            
    the  house   where   the   appellant  and  Prachi  were  residing   together   and
                               
    nothing is brought on record to show that during this span of 12 to 24

    hours   in   which   Prachi's   death   might   have   occurred,   there   was   no
                              
    possibility of the appellant not being in the house, the onus naturally was

    shifted on the appellant to explain the circumstances under which her
      


    homicidal death has occurred; especially in the light of the fact that when
   



    her dead body was found, he was very much present there and in the

    light of  his conduct, as deposed by Rashmi and her parents that he was





    confirmed   that   Prachi   was   already   dead.     On   phone   itself,   he   has

    informed   her   parents   that   Prachi   was   no   more   and   she   was   dead.
</p>




<p id="p_102">    Thereafter   even   when   Rashmi  urged  appellant   that   Prachi   should   be

    taken to the Doctor, the reluctance on the part of the appellant to do so

    makes it very clear that he was aware and certain about her death. If it is

    so, then it was for him to explain the circumstances in which her death

    has occurred.

    about alleged error in framing of charge by the trial Court. It is submitted

    that in the charge, time of the offence is mentioned as, "In the night

    learned   counsel   for   appellant,   the   evidence   on   record   does     not

    necessarily prove that incident has taken place in the night and therefore,

    of trespassing  the house of "P" with intent to assault "P" and for having

    assaulted   her   by     outraging   her   modesty.   However,   appellant   was

    convicted for outraging modesty of "S", who was also present at the time

    authority also, it was held that "there will be no prejudice or failure of
                              
    justice, where there was any error in the charge and accused was aware

    of the error. Such knowledge can be inferred from the defence of the
      


    accused and if defence of accused showed that he was defending himself
   



    against real and actual charge and not erroneous charge, it will not result

    into causing any prejudice to him". It was further held that, "In  judging





    the question of prejudice, as of guilt, the courts must act with a broad

    vision and look to the substance and not to the technicalities.  The Court





    has   to   see   whether   accused     knew   for   what   he   was   being   tried   for,

    whether the main facts sought to be established against accused were

<p id="p_109">    54.             The net result of our discussion is that the prosecution has




                                                             
    succeeded in proving its case against the appellant beyond reasonable




                                                            
    doubt. The trial Court, has therefore, rightly convicted and sentenced

    him, for the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_26">Section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/386021/" id="a_27">201</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

    <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_28">Section 498A</a> of IPC, by the trial Court, we find that said acquittal needs

    to be altered into conviction as the finding recorded by the trial Court to
                              
    that effect falls in the category of "perverse".

    Revision   also   made   a   prayer   to   the   effect   that   the   life   imprisonment
   



    awarded by trial Court be converted into death penalty.     We are not

    inclined to grant the said prayer because the facts  of this case do not fall





    in the category of "rarest or rare" and in the parameters laid down by the

    Apex Court from time to time.
