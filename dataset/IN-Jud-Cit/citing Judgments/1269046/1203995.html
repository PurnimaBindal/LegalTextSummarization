</p><p id="p_2">     These  writ   potitions  under   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article  32</a>   of	 the
Constitution of	 India brought	in public interest, to begin
with, did  not appear to have the potential of escalating to
the dimensions	they reached  or to  give  rise	 to  several
issues of considerable significance to the implementation of
rule of	 law, which   they have, during their progress. They
began as  yet another  complaint of  inertia by	 the Central
Bureau	of   Investigation  (CBI)   in	matters	  where	 the
accusation made was against high dignitaries. It was not the
only matter  of its kind during the recent past. The primary
question was:  Whether it  is within  the domain of judaical
review	and   it  could	  be  an  effective  instrument	 for
activating the	investigative process  which  is  under	 the
control of executive? The focus was on the question, whether
any judicial  remedy  is  available  in	 such  a  situation?
However, as the case progressed, it required innovation of a
procedure  within  the	constitutional	scheme	of  judaical
review to permit intervention by the count t find a solution
to the problem. This case has develop to develop a procedure
within the  discipline of  law for  the conduct	 of  such  a
proceeding in  similar	situation.  It	has  also  generated
awareness of the need of probity in public life and provided
mode of	 enforcement of	 accountability in public life. Even
though the  matter was	brought	 to  the  court	 by  certain
individuals claiming  to represent  public interest,  yet as
the case  progressed, in  keeping with	the  requirement  of
public interest,  the procedure	 devised was  to appoint the
petitioners' counsel  as the  amicus curiae and to make such
orders from  time to   time  as were  consistent with public
interest. Intervention	in the	proceedings by everyone else
was shut  out but  permission was  granted to  all,  who  so
desired, to  render such  assistance as	 they could,  and to
provide the  relevant material	available with	them to	 the
amicus curiae  for being  placed before	 the court  for	 its
consideration. In short, the proceedings in this matter have
had great  educative value  and it  does appear	 that it has
helped in  future decision  making and	functioning  of	 the
public authorities.
</p><p id="p_3">     We must  at  the  outset  place  on  record  our  great
appreciation  of  the  assistance  rendered  by	 the  amicus
curiac, Shri  Anil Divan  and  the  lawyers  assisting	him,
namely, Shri  Abani Kumar  Sahu. Shri Anil Kumar Panda, Shri
Mukul  Mudgai,	 Shri  Anil   Nauriya  and  also  Ms.  Latha
Krishnamurthy. We also place on record equal appreciation of
the law	 officers and  the team	 which has  assisted them in
these proceedings.  At the  commencement of the proceedings,
the then  Solicitor General  Shri Dipankar P. Gupta appeared
for the	 Union of  India and  the government agencies. Later
after Shri  depankar P.Gupta  demitted office,	the Attorney
General Shri Ashok H.Desai appeared in this case throughout.
The law	 officers and their team of assistants, namely, Shri
K.N.Bhat,  Additional	Solicitor   General,   Shri   Pallav
Shishodia,  Shri   Parmeswaran	and   Ms.  Anuradha  Bindra,
rendered very  able assistance throughout and discharged the
duty expected of law officers. All of them at great personal
inconvenience and  expence, rose to extraordinary heights in
keeping with  the true	traditions of  the Bar.	 In essence,
everyone of  them discharged  the  role	 of  animus  curiae,
without, at  any stage,	 adopting the adversarial stance. If
it has	been possible  to  achieve  some  success  in  these
proceedings  to	 improve  and  innovate	 the  procedure	 and
fructify new  ideas for betterment of the polity, it is only
because	 of  the  positive  response  of  the  Bar  and	 the
assistance  rendered   by  it.	 We  must  also	 record	 our
appreciation of	 the officers  of the  CBI and	the  Revenue
Department who	actively participated  in these	 proceedings
and showed a definite improvement in their perception of the
rule of	 law as	 the case  progressed; and  their ability to
perform improved once they were assured of protection in the
honest discharge of  their duties.
</p><p id="p_4">     This  experience  revealed	 to  us	 the  need  for	 the
insulation of  these agencies  from any extraneous influence
to ensure  the	continuance  of	 the  good  work  they	have
commenced. It  is this need which has impelled us to examine
the  structure	 of  these  agencies  and  to  consider	 the
necessary steps	 which would provide permanent insulation to
the agencies against extraneous influences to enable them to
discharge their	 duties in  the manner	required for  proper
implementation of  the rule  of law.  Permanent measures are
necessary to avoid the need of every matter being brought to
the court  for taking ad hoc measures to achieve the desired
results. This  is the  occasion for  us	 to  deal  with	 the
structure, constitution and the permanent measures necessary
for having  a fair  and	 impartial  agency.  The  faith	 and
commitment to  the rule of law exhibited by all concerned in
these proceedings is the surest guarantee of the survival of
democracy of  which rule  of law  is the  bedrock. The basic
postulate of  the concept of equality: "Be you ever so high,
the law	 is above  you" , has governed all steps taken by us
in these proceedings.
</p><p id="p_5">Facts
     A brief  narration	 of  the  facts	 of  this  case	 sis
necessary; On  25th March,  1991, one  Ashfak Hussain  Lone,
alleged to  be an  official of	the  terrorist	organisation
Hizbul Mujahideen,  was arrested  in Delhi.  Consequent upon
his interrogation,  raids  were	 conducted  by	the  Central
Bureau of  Investigation (CBI)	on the premises of Surrender
Kumar Jain,  his brothers,  relations and  businesses. Along
with Indian and foreign currency, the CBI seized two diaries
and  two  note	books  from  the  premises.  They  contained
detailed  accounts   of	 vast	payments  made	 to  persons
identified only	 by initials.  The initials  corresponded to
the initials  of various  high ranking politicians, in power
and our	 of power,  and of high ranking bureaucrats. Nothing
having been done in the matter of investigating the Jains or
the contents  of their	diaries, the  present writ petitions
were filed  on 4th  October, 1993,  in the  public  interest
under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_2">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of the India.
</p><p id="p_6">     The gist  of the  allegations in  the writ petitions is
that Government	 agencies  like	 the  CBI  and	the  revenue
authorities had	 failed to  perform their  duties and  legal
obligations inasmuch  as  they	had  failed  to	 investigate
matters arising	 out of	 the seizure  of the  "Jan diaries";
that the apprehension of terrorists had led to the discovery
of financial  support to  them by  clandestine	and  illegal
means  using   tainted	funds	obtained  through   `havala'
transactions; that  this had  also disclosed a nexus between
politicians, bureaucrats  and criminals, who were recipients
of  money   from  unlawful   sources,  given   for  unlawful
consideration that the CBI and other Government agencies had
failed to  investigate the  matter, take  it to	 its logical
conclusion and	prosecute all persons who were found to have
committed and  offence; that  this was	done with  a view to
protect the  persons involved, who were very influential and
powerful; that	the matter  disclosed a	 nexus between crime
and corruption	at high places in public life and it posed a
serious threat to the integrity, security and economy of the
nation; that probity in public life, the rule of law and the
preservation  of  democracy  required  that  the  Government
agencies  the	compelled  to	duly  perform	their  legal
obligations and	 to proceed  in accordance  with law against
every person  involved, irrespective  of where he was placed
in the political hierarchy. The writ petitions prayed, inter
alia, for the following reliefs:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     "[a] that	the above  said offences
     disclosed by the facts mentioned in
     the  petition  be	directed  to  be
     investigated  in	accordance  with
     law;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     [b] that  this Hon'ble Court may be
     pleased to	 appoint officers of the
     police   or    others   in	   whose
     integrity.	    independence     and
     competence	      this	 Hon'ble
     Court has confidence for conducting
     and/or   supervising    the    said
     investigation;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     [c]  that	suitable  directions  be
     given by  this  Hon'ble  Court  and
     orders issued  to ensure  that  the
     culprits are  dealt with  according
     to law;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     xx	       xx	      xx
     [f] that  directions  be  given  so
     that such	evil actions on the part
     of the  investigating agencies  and
     their political  superiors are  not
     repeated in future."</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">     It will  be seen  that the	 reliefs sought	 in the writ
petitions fall	into two  broad	 classes.  The	first  class
relates	 to  investigations  in	 the  matter  of  the  'Jain
diaries". The  second class  [prayer  (f)[  relates  to	 the
manner in  which investigations	 of offences  of  a  similar
nature that may occur hereafter should be conducted.
Procedure adopted
     We have  taken  the  view	that,  given  the  political
personalities of  the propel to be investigated in the "Jain
diaries" case  and the	time already  lost in commencing the
investigation it  was advantageous  not to  hear the  matter
through and  issue a  writ of  mandamus, leaving  it to	 the
authorities to	comply with   it,  but to  keep	 the  matter
pending while  the investigations  were	 being	carried	 on,
ensuring that  this was done by monitoring them from time to
time and  issuing orders  in this behalf. Our reasoned order
are dated.   18.4.1995,16.1.1996  [1996 (2)  Scale (SP) 42],
30.1.1996 [1996 (2) SCC 199], 22.2.1996 [1996 (2) Scale
(SP) 84],  1.3.1996 [1997  (4) SCC 778], 13.3.1996 [1996 (4)
Scale (SP)  3], 1.5.1996 [1996 (4) Scale (SP) 56], 26.7.1996
(6) Scale (SP) 24], 9.7.1997 [1997 (5) Scale 254]. Orders in
similar matters,  being the orders dated 12.2.1996 [1996 (3)
Scale (SP)  35], 2.14.1996,  26.4.1996 [1996  (4) Scale (SP)
71], 26.7.1996	[1996 (6) Scale (SP) 23] and 7.10.1996 [1996
(6) SCC	 354] in  Writ Petition	 (Civil) No.  640 of  1995 -
<a href="/doc/1670642/" id="a_3">Anukul Chandra	Pradhan vs.  Union of  India and Others</a>- and
orders	dated  24.2.1997  and  18.3.1997  in  Writ  Petition
(Civil) No. 38 of 1997 - <a href="/doc/5804954/" id="a_4">Dr. Subramaniam Swamy vs. Director,
CBI &amp; Ors</a>., are also relevant.
</p><p id="p_8">     The sum  and substance  of these orders is that the CBI
and other  Governmental agencies  had not  carried out their
public duty to investigate the offences disclosed; that none
stands above  the law  so that	an alleged offence by him is
not required  to be  investigated; that we would monitor the
investigations, in  the sense  that  we	 would	do  what  we
permissibly could  to see  that the  sense that	 we would do
what we	 permissibly could  to see  that the  investigations
progressed while  yet ensuring	that we	 did not  direct  or
channel	 those	 investigations	 or   in  any  other  manner
prejudice the  right of those who might be accused to a full
and fair  trial. We  made it  clear that  the  task  of	 the
monitoring court  would and  the moment	 a charge-sheet	 was
filed in  respect of a particular investigation and that the
ordinary processes  of the  law would then take over. Having
regard to  the direction  in which  the investigations	were
leading, we  found it  necessary to  direct the	 CBI not  to
report the  progress of	 the investigations  to	 the  person
occupying the highest office in the political executive this
was done  to eliminate	any impression	of bias	 or lack  of
fairness or  objectivity and  to maintain the credibility of
the investigations.  In short,	the procedure adopted was of
"continuing mandamus".
</p><p id="p_9">     Even  after  this	matter	was  brought  to  the  court
complaining of	the incrtia of CBI and the other agencies to
investigate  into   the	 offices   because  of	the  alleged
involvement of	several persons	 holding high offices in the
executive, for	quite some  time the  disinclination of	 the
agencies to precede with the investigation was apparent. The
accusation, if	true, reveled  a nexus	between high ranking
politicians and	 bureaucrats who  were alleged	to have been
funded by  a source  linked  with  the	source	funding	 the
terrorists. In	view of	 the funding  also  through  foreign
currency, some	undesirable foreign  elements appeared to be
connected. This revealed a grave situation poising a serious
threat even  to the  unity and	integrity of the nation. The
serious threat	posed to  the Indian  polity  could  not  be
underscored.  The   obvious  need  for	an  expeditious	 and
thorough probe	which had  already been	 delayed for several
years could  not but be countenanced. The continuing inertia
of the	agencies to  even commence  a  proper  investigation
could  not   be	 tolerated   any  longer.  In  view  of	 the
persistence of	that situation,	 it becomes necessary as the
proceedings progressed	to  make  some	orders	which  would
activate the CBI and the other agencies to at least commence
a fruitful  investigation. Merely  issuance  of	 a  mandamus
directing the agencies to perform their task would be futile
and, therefore, it was decided to issue directions from time
to time	 and keep  the matter pending requiring the agencies
to report  the progress	 of investigation so that monitoring
by the	court could ensure continuance of the investigation.
It was,	 therefore, decided  to direct	the  CBI  and  other
agencies  to   complete	 the   investigation  expeditiously,
keeping the court informed from time to time of the progress
of the	investigation so  that the  court retained siesin of
the matter  till the  investigation was	 completed  and	 the
chargesheets were  filed in  the competent  court for  being
dealt with, thereafter, in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_10">     The first	order to  this effect  was made on 5.12.1994
when the  CBI Director	was required to personally supervise
the investigations  carried on	by the	CBI as	the  overall
incharge and  to report	 to the court the progress made from
time to	 time. The true scope of the matter was indicated in
an order  dated 30th January, 1996 [reported in 1996 (2) SCC
199] as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "The  true	  scope	 of   this  writ
     petition has  been indicated during
     the  carlicr   hearings.  At   this
     stage, when some charge sheets have
     been filed in the Special Court and
     there is  considerable publicity in
     the medin	regarding  this	 matter,
     with  some	 speculation  about  its
     true scope,  it is	 appropriate  to
     make this	order to  form a part of
     the record.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     The gist  of the allegations in the
     writ petition  are that  Government
     agencies,	like  the  CBI	and  the
     revenue authorities  have failed to
     perform  their   duties  and  legal
     obligations inasmuch  as they  have
     failed  to	  properly   investigate
     matters arising  out of the seizure
     of the  so called "Jain Diaries" in
     certain raids conducted by the CBI.
     It is alleged that the apprehending
     of certain	 terrorists led	 to  the
     discovery of  financial support  to
     them  by  clandestine  and	 illegal
     means,  by	 use  of  tainted  funds
     obtained	   through	'havala'
     transactions;   that    this   also
     disclosed a  nexus between	 several
     important politicians,  bureaucrats
     and   criminals,	 who   are   all
     recipients of  money from	unlawful
     sources	given	 for	unlawful
     considerations; that  the	CBI  and
     other  Government	 agencies   have
     failed to	fully  investigate  into
     the  matter  and  take  it	 to  the
     logical end  point of the trail and
     to prosecute  all persons	who have
     committed any  crime; that	 this is
     being done	 with a	 view to protect
     the persons  involved, who are very
     influential  and  powerful	 in  the
     present set  up;  that  the  matter
     discloses a  definite nexus between
     crime and corruption in public life
     at high  places  in  the	 country
     which poses a serious threat to the
     integrity, security  and economy of
     the nation;  that probity in public
     life, to  prevent	erosion	 of  the
     rule of law and the preservation of
     democracy in  the country, requires
     that  the	Government  agencies  be
     compelled	to  duly  perform  their
     legal obligations	and to person in
     accordance with  law  against  cach
     and    every    person    involved,
     irrespective of the height at which
     he is placed in the power set up.
     The facts	and circumstances of the
     present case do indicate that it is
     of utmost	public	importance  that
     this matter  is examined thoroughly
     by this  Court to	ensure that  all
     Government agencies, entrusted with
     the   duty	  to   discharge   their
     functions	 and	obligations   in
     accordance with law, do so, bearing
     in mind  constantly the  concept of
     equality	 enshrined     in    the
     Constitution and the basic tenet of
     rule of law : "Be you ever so high,
     the    law	    is	  above	   you".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">     Investigation into	 accusation made
     against each  and every person on a
     reasonable basis,	irrespective  of
     the position  and	status	of  that
     person,  must   be	 conducted   and
     completed	expeditiously.	This  is
     imperative	  to	retain	  public
     confidence in the impartial working
     of the Government agencies.
     In	 this	proceeding  we	are  not
     concerned with  the merits	 of  the
     accusations  or   the   individuals
     alleged to	 be involved,  but  only
     with the  performance of  the legal
     duty by  the Government agencies to
     fairly,   properly	  and	   fully
     investigate   into	   every    such
     accusation	 against  every	 person,
     and  to   take  the  logical  final
     action in accordance with law.
     In case  of persons  against whom a
     prima facie  case is made out and a
     charge  sheet   is	 filed	 in  the
     competent court,  it is  that court
     which will then deal with that case
     on merits, in accordance with law.
     However, if  in respect of any such
     person the	 final report after full
     investigation  is	 that  no  prima
     facic case	 is made  out to proceed
     further, so  that the  case must be
     closed  against  him,  that  report
     must be  promptly submitted to this
     Court for its satisfaction that the
     concerned	authorities   have   not
     failed  to	  perform  their   legal
     obligations  and	have  reasonably
     come to  such conclusion.	No  such
     report having been submitted by the
     CBI or any other agency till now in
     this Court, action on such a report
     by this  Court would be considered,
     if and  when that	occasion arises.
     We also  direct that  no settlement
     should  be	  arrived  at	nor  any
     offence compounded by any authority
     without prior leave of this Court.
     We may  add that  on account of the
     great public  interest involved  in
     this  matter,  the	 CBI  and  other
     Government agencies  must	expedite
     their action  to complete	the task
     and prevent pendency of this matter
     beyond the	 period necessary. It is
     needless  to   observe   that   the
     results  achieved	so  far	 do  not
     match  the	  available   time   and
     opportunity     for      a	    full
     investigation ever since the matter
     came to  light. It	 is   of  utmost
     national	significance   that   no
     further time  is lost in completion
     of the task. "</blockquote>

     in this  matter by	 this Court,  we
     make it  clear that  no other court
     including	any   High  Court   will
     entertain or  deal with the same in
     any direct or indirect manner.</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">     It is  significant that  the machinery of investigation
started moving	as  a  result  of  these  orders  and  after
investigation  of   the	 allegations  made  against  several
persons the  basis of  the contents  of	 the  Jain  Diaries,
Chargesheets were  filed in the competent court in the first
instance against  14 persons,  as reported  to the  court on
22.2.1996. Chargesheets	 against  many	other  persons	were
filed in  the competent	 court thereafter  as reported later
from time  to time.  In	 all,  34  Chargesheets	 against  54
persons have  been filed  on this  basis. Thus, as indicated
earlier, the purpose of these proceedings to the
extent of  the complaint  of inertia  of  the  investigating
agencies  came	 to  an	  end  with   the  filing  of  these
chargesheets, since  the merits	 of the	 accusation  against
each individual	 has, thereafter, to be considered and dealt
with by the competent court at the trial, in accordance with
law. Trial  i n	 the  competent	 court	is  now	 a  separate
proceeding.
</p><p id="p_13">     After the commencement of these proceedings, some other
matters of  a similar nature came to this Court in which the
inaction of  the investigating	agencies to investigate into
some serious  offences was  alleged.  Two  such	 significant
matters are  Writ Petition  (Civil) No. 640 of 1995 - Anukul
Chandra Pradhan	 vs. Union  of India  and Others  - and Writ
Petition (Civil)  No. 38 of 1997 - <a href="/doc/5804954/" id="a_5">Dr. Subramaniam Swamy vs.
Director,  CBI	 &amp;  Ors.  These</a>	 cases	revealed  a  serious
situation eroding  the rule of law, where the accusation was
against persons	 holding high  offices and  wielding  power.
Relevant portions  of some  significant orders	made in	 the
above two cases read as under :-
</p><p id="p_14">Anukul Chandra Pradhan

     expeditious disposal  of the matter
     and to  avoid the focus on the crux
     of the  matter getting  diffused in

     within the	 domain of the concerned

     necessary for  the ends  of justice

     appropriate.  No	occasion  should

     publicity	 attaching    to   these
     matters has  tended to  dilute  the
     emphasis on  the  essentials  of  a
     fair trial and the basic principles
     of	 jurisprudence	 including   the
     presumption  of  innocence	 of  the
     accused unless  found guilty at the

     undoubtedly has  to be kept in view
     during  the  entire  trial.  It  is

<p id="p_20">In-camcra proceedings
     During  the   monitoring  of  the	investigations,	 the
Solicitor  General/Attorney  General,  from  time  to  time,
reported  the	progress   made	  during   the	 course	  of
investigation, in order to satisfy us that the agencies were
not continuing	to  drag  their	 feet  and  the	 "continuing
mandamus" was  having the  effect  of  making  the  agencies
perform their  statutory function.  The procedure adopted by
us was	merely to  hear what  they had	to report or the CBI
Director and  the Revenue  Secretary had  to tell  us to  be
satisfied that	the earlier  inaction was not persisting. We
maintained this	 stance throughout.  We also ensured that no
observation of	any kind was made by us nor was any response
given which may be construed as our opinion about the merits
of the	case or	 the accusation against any accused. We also
did not	 identify or  name any accused during performance of
this task.  At the  very outset,  the then Solicitor General
Shri Dipankar  P. Gupta	 requested  that  a    part  of	 the
proceedings be	held `in  camera' to  enable  him  to  state
certain facts  and, if	necessary, place before us material,
the secrecy  of which  was required  to	 be  maintained	 for
integrity  of  the  investigation  and	also  to  avoid	 any
prejudice to  the concerned  accused. In these circumstance,
such a	procedure was  adopted only  to the extent necessary
for this  propose, in  the interest  of justice, and that is
how a  part of	some  hearings	was  held  in  camera.	This
innovation  in	the  procedure	was  made,  on	request,  to
reconcile the interest of justice with that of the accused.
</p><p id="p_21">     It is  settled that the requirement of a public hearing
in a court of law for a fair trial is subject to the need of
proceedings being  held in camera to the extent necessary in
public interest	 and to	 avoid prejudice  to the accused. We
consider it  appropriate to  mention these  facts in view of
the nature  of	these  proceedings  wherein  innovations  in
procedure were required to be made from time to time to sub-
serve the  public  interest,  avoid  any  prejudice  to	 the
accused and  to advance	 the cause of justice. The medium of
"continuing mandamus",	was a new tool forged because of the
peculiar needs of this matter.
</p><p id="p_22">     Inertia  was  the	common	rule  whenever	the  alleged
offender was a powerful person. Thus, it became necessary to
take measures to ensure permanency in the remedial effect to
prevent	 reversion  to	inertia	 of  the  agencies  in	such
matters.
</p><p id="p_23">     Everyone against  whom there is reasonable suspicion of
committing a  crime has	 to be treated equally and similarly
under the  law and  probity  in	 public	 life  is  of  great
significance.  The   constitution   and	  working   of	 the
investigating agencies	revealed the lacuna of its inability
to perform whenever powerful persons were involved. For this
reason, a  close examination  of the  constitution of  these
agencies and  their control  assumes significance. No doubt,
the overall  control of	 the agencies  and responsibility of
their functioning  has to  be in  the exhaustive, but then a
scheme	giving	 the  needed   insulation  from	  extraneous
influences even of the controlling executive, is imperative.
It  is	 this  exercise	 which	became	necessary  in  these
proceedings for	 the future.  This is the surviving scope of
these writ petitions.
</p><p id="p_24">Point for consideration
     As a result of the debate in these proceedings and into
experience gained thereby the Union of India came to realise
that an	 in-depth study	 of the	 selection of  personnel  of
these agencies,	 particularly the  CBI and  the	 Enforcement
Directorate of the Revenue Department, and their functioning
is  necessary.	 The  Government   of  India,  sharing	this
perception, by an Order No. S/937/SS(ISP)/93 dated 9th July,
1993  constituted  a  Committee	 headed	 by  the  then	Home
Secretary Shri	N.N.Vohra to  take stock  of  all  available
information about  the activities  of crime syndicates/mafia
organisations which  had development  links with,  and	were
being protected	 by, government	 functionaries and political
personalities.	It   was  stated   that	 on   the  basis  of
recommendations	 of   the  Committee  the  Government  shall
determine  the	 need,	if   any,  to  establish  a  special
organisation/agency to	regularly  collect  information	 and
pursue cases against such elements. The Committee was headed
by the	then Home  Secretary Shri  N.N. Vohra and had as its
Members	 -   Secretary	(Revenue),   Director,	Intelligence
Bureau, Director,  CBI, Joint  Secretary (PP),	Ministry  of
Home Affairs.  The Committee  gave its recommendations dated
5.10.1993. It  has made	 scathing comments and has painted a
dismal picture	of the	existing sene.	It has said that the
network	 of  the  mafia	 is  virtually	running	 a  parallel
government pushing the State apparatus into irrelevance. The
Committee recommended  the creation  of a nodal agency under
the  Ministry	of  Home   Affairs  for	 the  collation	 and
compilation of	all information	 received from	Intelligence
Burcau (IB),  Central  Bureau  of  Investigation  (CBI)	 and
Research and  Analysis Wing  (R&amp;AW) and the various agencies
under the  Department of  Revenue. The report is significant
for the	 dismal	 picture  of  the  existing  scenario  which
discloses a  powerful  nexus  between  the  bureaucracy	 and
politicians  with   the	 mafia	 gangs,	 smugglers  and	 the
underworld. The report of the Vohra Committee is the opinion
of  some   top	bureaucrats   and  it  confirmed  our  worst
suspicions focusing  the need of improving the procedure for
constitution and  monitoring the functioning of intelligence
agencies. There is, thus, no doubt that this exercise cannot
be delayed further.
</p><p id="p_25">     The same  perception of  the Government of India led it
to constitute another Committee by Order No. 226/2/97-AVD-II
dated 8th  September, 1997 comprising of Shri B.G. Deshmukh,
former	Cabinet	  Secretary,  Shri   N.N.  Vohra,  Principal

Vigilance  Commissioner,   called  the	 Independent  Review

<p id="p_26">     Before we	refer to  the report of the Independent Puri
Committee (IRC),  it would  be appropriate  at this stage to
refer to the Single Directive issued by the Government which
requires prior	sanction  of  the  designated  authority  to
initiate  the	investigation  against	 officers   of	 the
Government  and	  the  Public  Sector  Undertakings  (PSUs),
nationalised  banks   above  a	certain	 level.	 The  Single
Directive is  a consolidated  set of  instructions issued to
the  CBI  by  the  various  Ministries/Departments  in	this
behalf. It  was first  issued in 1969 and thereafter amended
on many	 occasions. The	 Single Directive  contains  certain
instructions to	 the CBI  regarding modalities of initiating
an inquiry  or registering a case against certain categories
of civil  servants. Directive No. 4.7(3) in its present form
is an under :-
</p><p id="p_27">"4.7(3)(i)  In regard to any person who is or has been a
     decision making level officer (Joint Secretary or
     equivalent of above in the Central government or such
     officers as are or have been on deputation to a Public
     Sector Undertaking; officers of the Reserve Bank of
     India of the level equivalent to Joint Secretary of
     above in the Central Government, Executive Directors
     and above of the SEBI and Chairman &amp; Managing Director
     and Executive Directors and such of the Bank officers
     who are one level below the Board of Nationalised
     Banks), there should be prior sanction of the Secretary
     of the Ministry/Department concerned before SPE takes
     up any  enquiry (PE or RC), including ordering search
     in respect	 of them. Without such sanction, no enquiry
     shall be initiated by the SPE.
</p><p id="p_28">(ii)   All    cases   referred	  to   the    administrative
     Ministries/Departments by	CBI for	 obtaining necessary
     prior sanction as aforesaid, except those pertaining to
     any   officer of  the rank	 of Secretary  or  Principal
     Secretary,	  should be  disposed of  by them preferably
     within a  period of two months of the receipt of such a
     reference. In  respect of	the officers  of the rank of
     Secretary or  Principal Secretary	to Government,	such
     references should	be made	 by the Director, CBI to the
     Cabinet Secretary	for  consideration  of	a  Committee
     consisting of the Cabinet Secretary as its Chairman and
     the Law  Secretary and the Secretary (Personnel) as its
     members. The  Committee  should  dispose  of  all	such
     references preferably  within two	months from the date
     of	 receipt   of  such   a	 reference  by	the  Cabinet
     Secretary.
</p><p id="p_29">(iii) When  there is  any difference  of opinion between the
     Director, CBI  and the  Secretary of the Administrative
     Ministry/Department in  respect of an officer up to the
     rank of Additional Secretary or equivalent, the matters
     shall be  referred by  CBI to Secretary (Personnel) for
     placement before  the Committee  referred to  in Clause
</p><p id="p_30">     (ii) above.  Such a  matter should	 be  considered	 and

</p><p id="p_31">(iv) In	 regard to  any person	who is	 or has been Cabinet
     Secretary, before	SPE  takes  any	 step  of  the	king
     mentioned in  (i) above the case should be submitted to
     the Prime Minister for orders."
</p><p id="p_32">     We were  informed that  the  above	 Directive,  in	 its
application, is	 limited to  officials	at  decision  making
levels	in   the  Government   and  certain   other   public
institutions like the RBI,SEBI, nationalised banks, etc. and
its scope  is limited to official acts. The stated objective
of  the	 Directive  is	to  protect  decision  making  level
officers from  the threat  and ignominy	  of  malicious	 and
vexatious inquiries/investigations.  It is  said  that	such
protection to  officers at  the	 decision  making  level  is
essential ton  protect them  and  to  relieve  them  of	 the
anxiety from  the likelihood of harassment for taking honest
decisions. It  was also	 stated that  absence  of  any	such
protection to them could adversely affect the efficiency and
efficacy of  these institutions	 because of  the tendency of
such officers  to avoid	 taking any  decisions	which  could
later lead  to harassment  by any  malicious  and  Vexatious
inquiries/investigations.  It	was  made   clear  that	 the
Directive does	not extend to any extraneous or non-official
acts of	 the government	 functionaries and  a time frame has
been prescribed	 for grant  of sanction	 in  such  cases  to
prevent any avoidable delay.
</p><p id="p_33">     Two questions arise in relation to Directive No. 4.7(3)
of the	Single Directive, namely, its propriety/legality and
the extent of its coverage, if it be valid.
</p><p id="p_34">     The learned  Attorney General  categorically stated  in
response to  our repeated  query that  the Single  Directive
acts as	 a restriction	only on	 the CBI but is inapplicable
against the  general power  or the  State Police to register
and investigate	 any such  offence under  the  general	law,
i.e., <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_7">Code  of</a> Criminal	 Procedure. He added that it is also
not an inhibition against a complaint being lodged under the
Cr. P.C.  before the  competent court  for any such offence.
The Single  Directive was  sought to  be  supported  by	 the
Attorney General  on the ground that the CBI being a special
agency created by the Central Government, it was required to
function according  to the mandate of the Central Government
which has  constituted this  special  agency  for  specified
purpose. The   desirability  of	 the  Single  Directive	 was
supported by the learned Attorney General on the ground that
the  officers	at  the	 decision  making  level  need	this
protection against  malicious or vexatious investigations in
respect of  honest decisions  taken by	them. We  were	also
informed that during hearing of this matter when this aspect
was being debated, the Ministry of Finance has set up a High
Power Board  of experts in finance and a retired High  Court
Judge to  examine the merits in every case for he purpose of
grant of  sanction to  the CBI for recording the information
and investigating  into any  such offence,  and a time frame
for the	 devision has also been specified. Similarly, in the
case of	 government servants,  the authority  for  grant  of
sanction with a provision for appeal in case the sanction is
declined has  been provided.  It was  submitted that  such a
structure to  regulate the  grant  of  sanction	 by  a	high
authority together  with a  time frame to avoid any delay is
sufficient to  make the	 procedure reasonable and to provide
for an	objective decision  being taken	 for  the  grant  of
sanction within	 the  specified	 time.	It  was	 urged	that
refusal of  sanction  with  reasons  would  enable  judicial
review of  that decision  in case  of any  grievance against
refusal of  the sanction. Reliance was placed by the learned
Attorney General  on the  decisions  of	 this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_8">K.

Report of IRC
     The IRC  has in its report accepted the legality of the
Single Directive  placing reliance  on the  decision of this
Court  in  K.  Veeraswami  (supra).  After  considering	 the
functions of  the CBI and the Directorate of Enforcement, it
has made certain recommendations which are as under :-
"MEASURES FOR SPEEDY INVESTIGATIONS AND TRIALS
4.1   The Committee  recommends that  the following measures
should be taken to ensure speedy investigations and trials :
</p><p id="p_43">a)   Special Courts  should be got established at identified
     stations to deal exclusively with FERA offences so that
     cases ca be decided speedily.
</p><p id="p_44">b)    To ensure against delays in investigations abroad, the
     Revenue Secretary	should be the competent authority to
     approve filing of applications for Letters Rogatory.
</p><p id="p_45">c)    The  Directorate of  Enforcement should  be  delegated
     powers  to	 appoint  special  counsels  for  conducting
     trials, who  may also  act as  legal advisers  for	 the
     Department in respect of the cases entrusted to them.
</p><p id="p_46">d)   In many  of the  major cases  of the  Directorate,	 the
     suspects have  been able to abuse the process of law by
     stalling  the  investigations  at	the  initial  stages
     through litigation	 at various  levels, obtaining	stay
     orders from  High	Courts	and  injunctions  on  flimsy
     grounds. In consultation with the Attorney General, the
     Revenue  Department  may  examine	the  possibility  of
     making a  representation to  the Apex Court to consider
     issuing appropriate  directions so	 that the  pace	 and
     progress of  cases is  not	 thwarted  by  interlocutory
     procedures or stay orders issued by the Courts below.
</p><p id="p_47">e)   Taking into  account the  instances in  which suspected
     persons have  been	 able  to  stall  investigations  on
     alleged health  grounds, the  Revenue Department should
     approach the  Ministry of	Health to establish standing
     medical boards  in identified  cities to  examine	such
     persons.  Such   boards  should   comprise	 outstanding
     medical experts  of unimpeachable integrity. The Courts
     can be requested to refer the prayer of the accused for
     staying proceedings  on health  grounds to such medical
     boards before passing judgement."
</p><p id="p_48">"CHECKS AND BALANCES
5.1  The Directorate must be provided adequate financial and
administrative delegations to enable it to exercise autonomy
in the	conduct and pursuit of investigations without let or
hindrance.  Side   by  side,  it  is  necessary	 to  provide
appropriate  checks   and   balances   to   ensure   against
miscarriage of	justice.  In  this  context,  the  Committee
recommends the following :
</p><p id="p_49">a)    The Revenue Department should undertake regular review
     of the  progress of  cases before	the Directorate.  To
     enable this,  the Directorate  should regularly furnish
     information regarding  the number	of cases instituted,
     progress	of    investigations,	cases	settled	  in
     adjudication and  those put  to Courts.  The  Committee
     note that	while  such  information  is  already  being
     supplied in  reply to Parliament Questions, information
     to	   be	  placed    before     the     Parliamentary
     Committee/Standing	 Committee,   etc.,  there   is	  no
     established procedure  for the  Directorate to  furnish
     relevant information in well devised format.
</p><p id="p_50">b)    The  present  system  of	the  Directorate  furnishing
     fortnightly reports  providing statistical	 information
     and  brief	  outline  of	the  cases   taken  up	 for
     investigation  should  be	further	 fine  tuned.  These
     reports should  be carefully  examined by	the  Revenue
     Department to ensure that the Directorate is performing
     its functions officiently. The Revenue Secretary should
     hold  regular   review  meetings	with  the   Director
     Enforcement,  also	  involving  the   Director  Revenue
     Intelligence and other concerned officers.
</p><p id="p_51">c)    Guidelines  relating  to	interrogation,	prosecution,
     adjudication,   time    frame   for    completion	  of
     investigation,  etc.,   have   been   issued   by	 the
     Directorate from  time to time. These guidelines should
     be	 comprehensively  reviewed  and,  based	 thereon,  a
     circular should  be released for the information of the
     public at	large, to  enable all  concerned to know the
     systems and  procedures followed  by  the	Directorate.
     This shall	 contribute to	greater	 transparency.	This
     effort should be concluded within 2-3 months.
5.2  It	  is importance	 that the  Directorate lays  down  a
clearly	 spelt	 out  time   frame  for	 the  completion  of
investigation, launching  of prosecution  and completion  of
adjudication proceedings and for the Director to ensure that
the prescribed	time limits  are strictly  adhered  to.	 The
Committee are of the view that the Directorate would be able
to more	 efficiently discharge	its functions  if  immediate
steps are  taken to upgrade the level and quality of its in-
house legal  advice mechanism.	At our request, the  Cabinet
Secretary convened  a meeting  with the	 Revenue Department,
Enforcement Directorate	 and  other  concerned	officers  to
consider   various    proposals	  for	 strengthening	 the
Directorate. The  Committee hope  that the various decisions
taken at  t  he	 Cabinet  Secretary's  level  shall  witness
implementation within 6-8 weeks.
</p><p id="p_52">5.3  The Committee  recommends that  the Directorate  should
take time  bound steps	to establish  a grievances redressal
mechanism to  promptly deal with complaints received from he
public	against	 actions  of  the  Enforcement	Directorate.
Insofar as complaints of arbitrary action by senior officers
of the	Directorate are	 concerned, the Committee recommends
that these  should b e looked into  by a Committee headed by
the Central  Vigilance Commissioner  and comprising  Revenue
Secretary,   Director	 General    Revenue    Intelligence,
Enforcement Director  and a  senior  representative  of	 the
Ministry of Law.
</p><p id="p_53">5.4  As regards	 the pursuit of cases which appear to have a
politico-beaurocrai-criminal  nexus,   the  Home   Secretary
agreed with  the Committees suggestion that the Nodal Agency
in the	Home Ministry (chaired by Home Secretary) shall also
include Member	(Investigation)	 of  the  Central  Board  Of
Direct Taxes,  Director General Revenue Intelligence and the
Director Enforcement as members.
</p><p id="p_54">5.5 The	 Committee recommends  that the Annual Report of the
Department  of	 Revenue  should   have	 a  section  devoted
exclusively  to	  the	functioning   of   the	 Enforcement
Directorate. This  report should  highlight  the  number  of
cases taken  up for  investigation by ED, raids and searches
conducted, amount  of Indian  and foreign  currency  seized,
etc. The  report should	 also indicate the number of persons
arrested, prosecutions	launched and  convictions ordered by
the  Courts.   The  Committee  feels  that  enhanced  public
knowledge about the work being done by the Directorate shall
demystify its  operations and  contribute to improved public
confidence."

be read along with the discussion in the corresponding paras
in Part I and Part II of the report.
</p><p id="p_117">Need for Court's intervention
     The IRC is a body constituted by the Central Government
itself as  a result  of its perception that the constitution
and  functioning   of  the   CBI,  CVC	and  Directorate  of
Enforcement require  a close  scrutiny in  the background of
the recent unsatisfactory functioning of these agencies with
a view	to improve t heir functioning. The view taken by the
IRC is	a reaffirmation	 of this belief shared b y everyone.
The preface  to the  report indicates  the  reason  for	 the
constitution of	 the IRC  and says that "In the past several
years, there  has been progressive increase in allegation of
corruption involving  public servants. Understandably, cases
of this	 nature have  attracted heightened  media and public
attention. A  general  impression  appears  to	have  gained
ground that the concerned Central investigating agencies are
subject to  extraneous pressures  and have been indulging in
dilatory tactics  in not  bringing the	guilty to  book. The
decisions   of	  higher   courts    to	  directly   monitor
investigations in  certain cases have added to the aforesaid
belief." There	can thus  be no doubt that there is need for
the exercise  we were  called upon  to perform and which has
occasioned consideration of this crucial issue by this Court
in exercise  of its  powers conferred by the Constitution of
India.	The   conclusions  reached  b  y  the  IRC  and	 the
recommendation it has made for improving the functioning and
thereby	 the   image  of   these  agencies   is	 a   further
reaffirmation of  this general	belief. There can also be no
doubt that  the conclusions  reached  by  the  IRC  and	 its
recommendations are  the  minimum  which  require  immediate
acceptance and implementation in a bid to arrest any further
decay of  the polity.  Ii follows  that the  exercise to  be
performed now  by this	Court is  really to consider whether
any modifications/additions  are required  to be  made to be
recommendations of  the IRC  for achieving  the	 object	 for
which the  Central Government itself constituted the Irc. We
are informed by the IRC could not be taken so far because of
certain	 practical   difficulties  faced   by  the   Central
Government but	there is  no negative reaction to the report
given by the Central Government.
</p><p id="p_118">     The only  caveat entered  by the Attorney General is on
the basis of a note by an individual Minister in the Central
Cabinet in  which emphasis  has been  laid that the ultimate
responsibility for  the functioning of these agencies to the
Parliament is that of the concerned Minister and this aspect
may be dept in mind. It has been specifically mentioned that
the Minister  would remain  the final disciplinary authority
and would  have the  power to  refer complaints	 against the
agency or  its officers	 to  an	 appropriate  authority	 for
necessary  action.   There  can	  be  no  quarrel  with	 the
Minister's ultimate responsibility to the Parliament for the
functioning  of	 these	agencies  and  he  being  the  final
disciplinary authority	in respect  of the  officers of	 the
agency with  power to  refer complaints	 against them to the
appropriate authority  Some other  specific  powers  of	 the
Minister were indicated as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">     1.	  The Minister	has the	 power to review the working
     of the agencies which are under his Department.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">     2.	   The	Minister has  the power to give broad policy
     directions regarding  investigation and  prosecution of
     classes or categories of cases.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">     3. The  Minister has that power to appraise the quality
     of the  work of the Head of the agency as well as other
     senior officers of the agency.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">     4. The  Minister has  the power to call for information
     regarding progress of cases.</blockquote>
<p id="p_119">     It is  sufficient to  say that  The Minister's  general
power to  review the working of the agency and to give broad
policy directions  regarding the functioning of the agencies
and to	appraise the  quality of the work of the Head of the
agency and other officers to the executive head is in no way
to be  diluted. Similarly,  the Minister's power to call for
information generally  regarding the  cases being handled by
the agencies  is not  to be  taken away.  However,  all	 the
powers of  the Minister	 are subject  to the  condition that
none  of  them	would  extend  to  permit  the	Minister  to
interfere with	the course  of investigation and prosecution
in any	individual case	 and in	 that respect  the concerned
officers are  to be  governed entirely by the mandate of law
and the statutory duty cast upon them.
</p><p id="p_120">     It is  useful to  remember in  this context  what	this
Court has  no several  occasions in  the past said about the
nature of  duty and  functions of  Policy  officers  in	 the
investigation of  an offence.  It is  sufficient to refer to
one of	them, namely,  <a href="/doc/1604039/" id="a_9">Union of	 India and Others vs. Sushil
Kumar Modi  and Others</a>, 1997 (4) SCC 770, (Bihar Fodder Scam
case), wherein it was said, as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">     "4.  At   the  outset,   we   would
     indicate	that   the   nature   of
     proceedings before	 the High  Court
     is	 somewhat   similar   to   those
     pending in	 this  Court  in  <a href="/doc/1754201/" id="a_10">Vineet
     Narain v.	Union of India</a>, 1996 (2)
     SCC 199 and <a href="/doc/1670642/" id="a_11">Anukul Chandara Pradhan
     v. Union of India</a>, 1996 (6) SCC 354
     and, therefore,  the High	Court is
     required to proceed with the matter
     in a  similar manner.  It has to be
     borne in  mind that  the purpose of
     these proceedings in essentially to
     ensure performance of the statutory
     duty  by  the  CBI	 and  the  other
     government agencies  in  accordance
     with    law    for	   the	  proper
     implementation of	the rule of law.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">     To	 achieve  this	object	a  fair,
     honest	  and	     expeditious
     investigation into every reasonable
     accusation against	 each and  every
     person  reasonably	  suspected   of
     involvement in the alleged offences
     has  to   be   made   strictly   in
     accordance with  law. The	duty  of
     the Court	in such	 proceedings is,
     therefore, to  ensure that	 the CBI
     and other	government  agencies  do
     their duty	 and do	 so strictly  in
     conformity	 with	law.  In   these
     proceedings,  the	 Court	is   not
     required to  go into  the merits of
     the accusation  or even  to express
     any opinion  thereon,  which  is  a
     matter  for  consideration	 by  the
     competent	court	in   which   the
     charge-sheet  is	filed  and   the
     accused have  to face trial. It is,
     therefore, necessary  that not even
     an	 observation   relating	 to  the
     merits of	t he  accusation is made
     by the  Court in  these proceedings
     lest it  prejudice the  accused  at
     the  trial.  The  nature  of  these
     proceeding may be described as that
     of	    "continuing	  mandamus"   to
     require performance  of its duty by
     the CBI  and the  other  government
     agencies  concerned.  The	agencies
     concerned must bear in mind and, if
     needed, be	 reminded of the caution
     administered  by  Lord  Denning  in
     this behalf  in R.V..  Metropolitan
     Police  Commr.,  1968  (1)	 All  ER
     763/1968 (@) QB 118. Indicating the
     duty of the Commissioner of Police,
     Lord Denning  stated thus : (All ER
     p.769)
	  "I   have    no    hesitation,
	  however, in holding that, like
	  every constable  in the  land,
	  he   should	 be,   and   is,
	  independent of  the executive.
	  He  is   not	subject	 to  the
	  orders  of  the  Secretary  of
	  State,.. I  hold it  to be the
	  duty of  the	Commissioner  of
	  Policy,  AS  it  is  of  every
	  chief	 constable,  to	 enforce
	  the law  of the  land. He must
	  take steps  so to post his men
	  that	 crimes may be detected;
	  and that  honest citizens  may
	  go  about  their  affaires  in
	  peace. He  must decide whether
	  or not  suspected persons  are
	  to be prosecuted; and, if need
	  be, being  the prosecution  or
	  see hat  it is brought; but in
	  all these things he is not the
	  servant of anyone, save of the
	  law itself. No Minister of the
	  Crown can  tell  him	that  he
	  must,	 or   must   not,   jeep
	  observation on  this place  or
	  that; or that he must, or must
	  not prosecute this man or that
	  one.	Nor   can   any	  policy

	  answerable to	 the law  and to
	  the law alone."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">     The nature	 of such a proceeding in
     a court  of law  was also indicated
     by Lord Denning, as under :
	  "A question  may be  raised as

	  could be  compelled to  do his
	  duty. On  principle, it  seems
	  to me that once a duty exists,
	  there should	be  a  means  of
	  enforcing it. This duty can be
	  enforced. I  think, either  by
	  action  at  the  suit	 of  the
	  Attorney General;  or	 by  the
	  prerogative order of mandamus.
	  (emphasis supplied)
     There can	hardly be any doubt that

<p id="p_121">     The Minister's  power in  these matters has, therefore,
to be understood as circumscribed by these limitations under
the law.
</p><p id="p_122">History of CBI
     It is  useful to  refer at this stage to the history of
the CBI.  The Special Police Establishment was formed during
the World  War II when large sums of public money were being
spent in  connection with  the War  and there arise enormous
potential for  corruption amongst  the officers dealing with
the supplies.  An executive order was made by the Government
of India in 1941 setting up the Special Police Establishment
(SPE) under  a DIG  in the  then Department of War. The need
for a  central government  agency to  investigate c  ases of
bribery and corruption by the Central	Government  servants
continued  and,	  therefore,  the   Delhi   Special   Policy
Establishment act was brought into force in 1946. Under this
Act, the superintendence of the Special Police Establishment
was transferred to the Home Department and its function were
enlarged to  cover all	departments  of	 the  Government  of
India. The jurisdiction of the SPE extended to all the Union
Territories and	 could also  be extended  to the States with
the consent of the concerned State Governments. Then the SPE
was put	 under the  charge of Director, Intelligence Bureau.
Later in 1948 a post of Inspector General of Police, SPE was
created and  the organisation  was placed  under his charge.
The Central  Bureau  of	 Investigation	was  established  on
1.4.1963 vide  Government of India's Resolution No, 4/31/61-
T/MHA. This  was done  to meet	the felt  need of  having  a
central	 police	 agency	 at  the  disposal  of	the  Central
Government to investigate into cases not only of bribery and
corruption but	also those relating to the breach of central
fiscal laws,  frauds in	 government departments and PSUs and
other serious  crimes. On  enlargement of the role of CBI an
Economic Offences  Wing was  added to the existing Divisions
of the	CBI. In	 1887 tow  Divisions were created in the CBI
known  as   Anti-Corruption  Division	and  Special  Crimes
Division, the  latter dealing  with  cases  of	conventional
crimes besides	economic offences.  In 1994 due to increased
workload relating  to bank  frauds and	economic offences  a
separate Economic  Offences Wing was established in CBI with
the result  that since	then the CBI has three Investigation
Divisions, namely,  Anti-Corruption Division, Special Crimes
Division and Economic Offences Division. Further particulars
thereof are not necessary in the present context.
</p><p id="p_123">     We are  informed that  almost all the State Governments
have given  concurrence for extension of the jurisdiction of
the Delhi  Special Police Establishment in their States with
the exception  of only	a few.	The result  is that  for all
practical purposes,  he jurisdiction  in respect of all such
offences is  exercised in  the consenting States only by the
CBI and not by the State Police. This is the significance of
the  role   of	the  CBI  in  such  matters  and,  therefor,
technically the	 additional jurisdiction  under the  general
law of the State Police in.
</p><p id="p_124">these matters  is of  no practical  relevance. The pragmatic
effect of  the single  Directive is,  therefore, to  inhibit
investigation against  the specified  category	of  officers
without sanction in accordance with the Single Directive.
Validity of directive No.4.7(3) of the Single Directive
     We may now refer to the two decisions on which specific
reliance has  been placed  by the  learned Attorney  General
before us as well as the IRC in its report.
</p><p id="p_125">     The decision in J.A.C. Saldanha (supra) is on <a href="/doc/900247/" id="a_14">Section 3</a>
of the	Police, Act  1861 and deals with the ambit and scope
of State  Governments power of `superintendence' thereunder.
It was	held in	 J.A.C. Saldanha  (supra) that	the power of
superintendence of  the State  Government includes its power
to  direct  further  investigation  under  <a href="/doc/1612841/" id="a_15">Section  173</a>	 (8)
<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_16">Cr.P.C</a>.. That  was a  case in  which there  was occasion  to
require further	 investigation because of the unsatisfactory
nature of  the investigation  done earlier  of a  cognizable
offence. Thus, in that case the power of superintendence was
exercised for directing further investigation to complete an
unsatisfactory investigation  of  a  cognizable	 offence  to
promote the  cause of  justice and  not	 to  subvert  it  by
preventing investigation.  In our  opinion, in	the  present
context, that  decision has  no application  to support	 the
issuance of  the Single	 directive in exercise foe of the of
superintendence, since	the effect  of the  Single Directive
might thwart  investigation of	a cognizable offence and not
to  promote  the  cause	 of  justice  by  directing  further
investigation leading to a prosecution.
</p><p id="p_126">     The other	decision of  this court	 is in K. Veeraswami
(supra). That was a decision in which the majority held that
the prevention	of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_17">Corruption Act</a> applies even to the Judges
of the	High court  and the Supreme Court, After taking that
view, it  was said  by the majority (per Shetty, J.) that in
order to  protect the  independence  of	 judiciary,  it	 was
essential that	no criminal  case shall	 be registered under
<a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_18">Section 154</a>  Cr.P.C. against a Judge of the High Court or of
the Supreme  court unless  the Chief  Justice  of  India  is
consulted and  he assents to such an action being taken. The
Learned Attorney  General contended that this decision is an
authority  for	 the  proposition   that  in  case  of	high
officials, the requirement of prior permission/sanction from
a higher  officer or  Hear of  the Department is permissible
and necessary  to save the concerned officer from harassment
cause by a malicious or vexatious prosecution. we are unable
to accept this submission.
</p><p id="p_127">     The position  of Judges  of  High	Courts	and  Supreme
Court, who  are constitutional	functionaries, is  distinct,
and the	 independence of judiciary, keeping it free from any
extraneous influence,  including that from executive, is the
rationale of  the decision  in	K.  Veeraswami	(supra).  In
strict terms  the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_19">Prevention  of Corruption  Act</a>, 1946 could
not be	applied to the superior Judges and, therefore, while
bringing those	Judges within	the  purview of	 the Act yet
maintaining the	 independence of  judiciary, this  guideline
was issued  as a  direction but	 the Court.  The feature  of
independence of judiciary has no application to the officers
covered by  the single	directive, The need for independence
of judiciary  from the directive influence does not arise in
the case  of officers belonging to the executive. we have no
doubt that  the decision  in K.	 Veeraswami (supra)  has  no
application to	the wide proposition advanced by the learned
Attorney General  to support  the single  Directive. For the
same reason,  reliance on that decision by the IRC to uphold
the Single Directive is misplaced.
</p><p id="p_128">     The question,  however, is	 whether, without the aid of
these decisions,  the Single  Directive can  be upheld.,  In
this context,  meaning	of  the	 word  "superintendence"  in
<a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_20">Section 4(1)</a>  of the Delhi Special Police establishment Act,
1946 requires consideration.
</p><p id="p_129">The Delhi  special police  <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_21">Establishment Act</a>, 1946 is an Act
to make	 provision for	the constitution of a special police
force in  Delhi for the investigation of certain offences in
the  Union   Territories   for	 the   superintendence	 and
administration of  the said  force and	for the extension to
other areas of the powers and jurisdiction of members of the
said force  in retard  to  the	investigation  of  the	said
offences, <a href="/doc/1868602/" id="a_22">Section 6</a> of the Act requires consent of the state
government to exercise powers and jurisdiction under the Act
by the Delhi special police establishment. This is because
Police' is a State subject, being in List Li, entry 2 of the
seventh Schedule;  For this  reason,  the  learned  Attorney
general contended  that the  power and	jurisdiction of	 the
state  police	in  respect   of  an   offence	within	 its
jurisdiction remains  intact and  is not  inhibited  by	 the
Single Directive;  and	that  the  CBI	alone  is  inhibited
thereby. <a href="/doc/330488/" id="a_23">Section  2</a> of	the act	 deals with constitution and
powers of  the Special	Police Establishment  (SPE). This is
how the	 CBI has  been constituted.  <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_24">Section 3</a>	provides for
offences to  be investigated  by the  SPE and  says that the
offences or  class of  offences to  be investigated  by	 the
agency may  be specified  by notification  in  the  Official

<p id="p_131">     The meaning  of the  word "superintendence"  in <a href="/doc/613060/" id="a_30">Section
4(1)</a> of	 the Delhi  special police  Act, 1946 determines the
scope of  the authority	 of the	 Central Government  in this
context.
</p><p id="p_132">     There can	be no  doubt that the overall administration
of the	said face, i.e. CBI vests in the Central Government,
which also  includes, by  the virtue of <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_31">Section 3</a>, the power
to specify the offences or class of offences which are to be
investigated by	 it. The  general superintendence  over	 the
functioning of	the  department	 and  specification  of	 the
offences which	are to	be investigated by the agency is not
the same  as and  would not include within it the control of
the intiation	and  the actual	 process  of  investigation,
i.e., direction. Once the CBI is empowered to investigate an
offence generally by its specification under  <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_32">Section 3</a>, the
process of investigation, including its initiation, is to be
governed by  the statutory  provision which  provide for the
initiation and	manner of investigation the offence. This is
not an	area which  can be  included within  the meaning  of
"superintendence" in <a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_33">section 4(1)</a>.
</p><p id="p_133">     It is,  therefore, the notification made by the Central
Government under  <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_34">Section 3</a> which confers and determines the
jurisdiction of	 the CBI to investigate an offence; and once
that jurisdiction is attracted by virtue of the notification
under <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_35">Section  3</a>, the actual investigation to be governed by
the statutory provisions under the general law applicable to
such  investigation.   This  appears   to  us	the   proper
construction of	 <a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_36">section 4(1)</a>  in the  context, and it is in
harmony with  the scheme  of the  Act, and  <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_37">section  3</a>	  in
particular.  the  word	"superintendence"  in  <a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_38">section	4(1)</a>
cannot	be   constructed  in   a  winder   sense  to  permit
supervision of the actual investigation of an offence by the
CBI  contrary	to  the	  manner  roved	  by  the  statutory
provisions., The  board proportion  urged on  behalf of	 the
Union of India that it can issue any directive to the CBI to
curtail	 or  inhibit  its  jurisdiction	 to  investigate  an
offence specified in the notification issued under <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_39">section 3</a>
by a  directive under  <a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_40">section 4(1)</a>  of three  Act cannot be
accepted, The  jurisdiction of	the 4  CBI to investigate an
offence	 is   to  be   determined  with	  reference  to	 the
notification issued  under Section  any not by	any separate
order not having that character
     This view does not conflict with the decision in J.A.C.
Saldanha (supra)  as earlier  indicated.  In  Saldanha,	 the
question was whether an unsatisfactory investigation already
made could  be undertaken  by another  officer	for  further
investigation  of  the	offence	 so  that  the	offence	 was
properly investigated  as required by law, and it was not to
prevent	 the   investigation  or   an  offence.	 The  single
Directive has the effect of restraining reforming of AIR and
initiation  of	investigation  and  not	 of  preceding	with
investigation,	as  in	Saldanha,  No  authority  to  permit
control of  salutary  powers  exercised	 by  the  police  to
investigation an  offence within  its jurisdiction  has been
cited before  us except.  K.Veeraswami which we have already
distinguished. The view we take accords not only with reason
but also  with the  gunnery purpose  of the  law and  is  in
consonance with the basic tenet of the rule of law.
</p><p id="p_134">     Once the  Jurisdiction is	conferred  on  the  CBI	 top
investigate an	offence	 by  virtue  of	 notification  under
<a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_41">Section 3</a>  of the  Act,	 the  powers  of  investigation	 are
governed by  the statuary  provisions  and  they  cannot  be
estopped or  curtailed by  any executive  instruction issued
under <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_42">Section  3(1)</a> thereof.  This result  follows from	 the
fact that  conferment of  jurisdiction is under <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_43">section 3</a> of
the Act and exercise of powers of investigation is by virtue
of the	statuary provisions covering investigation offences.
it is  settled that statutory jurisdiction cannot be subject
to execute control
     There is  no similarity  between a mere executive order
requiring prior	 permission sanctions  investigation of	 the
offence	 and   sanction	 needed	  under	 the   stature	 for
prosecution. The  requirement of  sanction  for	 prosecution
being  provided in the very statue which enacts the offence,
the sanction  for prosecution  is a  pre-requisite  for	 the
court to  take connivance  of the offence. In the absence of
any statutory  requirement of  prior permission	 or sanction
for investigation,  it cannot  be  imposed  as	a  condition
precedent  for	 institution  of   the	investigation	once
jurisdiction is	 conferred on  the CBI	to  investigate	 the
offence by virtue of the notification under <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_44">section 3</a> of the
Act. The  word "superintendence"  in <a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_45">section 4(1)</a> of the Act
in the context must be construct in a manner consistent with
the other  provisions of  the Act  and the general statutory
powers of  investigation which	given investigation  even by
the CBI.  The necessity of previous sanction for prosecution
is provided  in <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_46">Section	 6</a> of  the Prevention  of Corruption
Act, 1947  (<a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_47">Section 19</a>	of the	1988 Act)  without which  no
court can  take consistence  of an  offence punishable under
<a href="/doc/152213/" id="a_48">Section 5</a>  of that  Act. There	is no such previous sanction
for investigation  provided for	 either in the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_49">Prevention of
Corruption Act</a> or the Delhi Special Police establishment Act
or in  any other  statutory provision. The above is the only
manner ii  which <a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_50">Section  4(1)</a> of  the Act can in harmonised
with <a href="/doc/289116/" id="a_51">Section 3</a> and the other statutory provisions.
</p><p id="p_135">     The  Single  Directive  has  to  be  examined  in	this
background. The	 law does not classify offenders differently
for  treatment	 thereunder,  including	  investigation	  of
offences and  persecution for  offences. according  to their
status in  life. Every person accused of committing the same
offences  is  to  be  dealt  with  in  the  same  manner  in
accordance with	 law, which  is equal  in its application to
everyone. The Single Directive is applicable only to certain
p[person above	the specified  level who  are  described  as
"decision making  officers". The  question  is	whether	 any
distinction  can  be  made  for	 them  for  the	 purpose  of
investigation of an offence of which they are accused.
</p><p id="p_136">     Obviously, where  the accusation of corruption is based
on direct  evidence and it does not require any inference to
be drawn  depend on the decision making process, there is no
rational basic to classify them differently. In other words,
if the accusation be of bribery which is supported by direct
evidence of  acceptance of  illegal gratification  by  them,
including strap cases, it is obvious that no other factor is
relevant  and  the  level  or  status  of  the	offender  is
irrelevant. It	is for this reason that it was conceded that
such cases,  i.e., if  bribery, including  trap	 cases,	 are
outside the scope of the Single Directive. After some debate
at the	bar, no	 serious attempt  was made  by	the  learned
Attorney General  to support  inclusion	 within	 the  Single
Directive of cases in which the offender is alleged to be in
possession of  disproportionate assets. It is clear that the
accusation of  possession of  disproportionate assists	by a
person is  also based  on  direct  evidence  and  no  factor
pertaining to  the exercise  of decision  making is involved
therein. We  have,  therefore,	no  doubt  that	 the  Single
directive  cannot   include  within   its  ambit   cases  of
possession of  disproportionate assists by the offender. The
question new  is only  with regard to cases other than those
of bribery,  including trap  cases,  and  of  possession  of
disproportioned	 assists   being  covered   by	the   Single
Directive
     There may be other cases where the accusation cannot be
supported by direct evidence and is a matter of inference of
corrupt motive	for the	 decision,  with  nothing  to  prove
directly any  illegal gain  to the decision maker. Those are
cases in  which the inference drawn is that the decision mus
have been  made for  a corrupt	motive because	the decision
could not  have been reached otherwise by an officer at that
level in  the hierarchy.  This is,  therefore, an area where
the opinion  of persons with requisite expertise in decision
making of that kind is relevant, and may be even decisive in
reaching the  conclusion  whether  allegation  requires	 any
investigation to  be made.  In view of the fact that the CBI
of the	Police force does not have the expertise within fold
for the	 formation of the requisition opinion in such cases,
the need for the inclusion of such a mechanism comprising of
experts in  the field as a part of the infrastructure of the
CBI is	obvious,  to  decide  whether  the  accusation	made
discloses  grounds   for  a   reasonable  suspicion  of	 the
commission of  an offence  and it requires investigation. In
the absence  of any such mechanism within the infrastructure
of the	CBI, comprising	 of experts  in the  field  who	 can
evaluate  the	material  for	the  decision  to  be  made,
introduction therein  of a  body of experts having expertise
of the	kind of	 business which	 requires the division to be
made, can  be appreciated. But then, the final opinion is to
be of  the CBI	with the  aid of that advice and not that of
anyone else.  It would	be more	 appropriate to	 have such a
body within the infrastructure of the CBI itself.
The Single  Directive cannot,  therefore, be uphold as valid
on the	ground to  it being  permissible in  exercise of the
power of  superintendence of  the Central  Government  under
<a href="/doc/1709033/" id="a_52">Section 4(1)</a>  Act. The	matter now  to be considered de hors
hors the Single Directive.
</p><p id="p_137">Power of the Supreme court
     In view  of the  common perception	 shared by  everyone
including the  Government of  India    and  the	 Independent
review Committee  (IRC) of  the need  for insulation  of the
need for  insulation of the CBI from extrancous influence of
any kind,  it is  imperative that  some action	is  urgently
taken to  prevent the  continuance of  this situation with a
view in	 ensure proper	implementation of  the rule  of law.
This is the need of equality guaranteed in the	Constitution
The right  to equality	in a  situation like this is that of
the Indian  polity and	not merely of a few individuals. The
powers conferred on this Court by the Constitution are ample
to remedy  this defect	and to	ensure	enforcement  of	 the
concept of equality.
</p><p id="p_138">     There are	ample powers  conferred by  <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_53">Article 32</a>	read
with <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_54">Article 142</a> to make orders which have the effect of law
by virtue  of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_55">article  141</a>  and	 there	is  mandate  to	 all
authorities to	act in	aid of	the orders  of this Court as
provided in  <a href="/doc/1799967/" id="a_56">Article 144</a> of the Constitution. In a catena of
decisions of  this Court, this power has been recognised and
exercised, if  need be,	 by issuing  necessary directions to
fill the  vacuum till  such time the legislature steps in to
cover the gap or the executive discharges its role. it is in
the discharge  of this	duty that the IRC was constituted by
the  Government	  of  India   with  a  view  to	 obtain	 its
recommendations after  an indepth  study of  the problem  in
order to  implement them  by suitable  executive  directions
till proper  legislation is  enacted. The  report of the IRC
has been  given to  the Government  of India  but because of
certain difficulties  in the  present  context,	 no  further
action by  the executive has been possible. The study having
been made  by a	 Committee considered  by  the Government of
India itself  as an  expert body,  it is safe top act on the
recommendations of  the IRC  to formulate  the directions of
this Court,  to the  extent they  are of  assistance. In the
remaining area, on the basis of the study of the IRC and its
recommendations, suitable  directions can  be  formulate  to
fill the  entire vacuum.  This is the exercise we propose to
perform in  the present	 case since  this  exercise  can  no
longer	be   delayed.  it   is	essential   and	 indeed	 the
constitutional obligation  of this court under the aforesaid
provisions to issue the necessary directions in this behalf.
We now	consider formulation of the needed directions in the
performance of this obligation. The directions issued herein
for strict  compliance are  a to  operate till	such time as
they are replaced by suitable legislation in this behalf.
</p><p id="p_139">     There is  another aspect  of rule	of law	which is  of
equal significance.   Unless  a proper investigation is made
and it	is followed  by an  equally proper  prosecution, the
effort made  would not bear fruition.  The recent experience
in  the	  field	 of  prosecution  s  also  discouraging.  To
emphasise this	point, some  reference has  to be  made to a
large number  of  prosecution  launched	 as    a  result  of
monitoring by  the court  in this matter which have resulted
in discharge  of the  accused at  the threshold.    It	took
serval years  for the CBI to commence investigation and that
too as	a result  of the monitoring by this Court. It is not
as if  the CBI,	 on conclusion	of the investigation, formed
the opinion  that no  case was	made out  for prosecution so
that the  earlier inaction may have been justified.  The CBI
did file  numerous chargesheets	 which indicated that in its
view a	prima facie  case for prosecution had been made out.
This alone  is	sufficient  to	indicate  that	the  earlier
inaction was unjustified.  However, discharge of the accused
on filing  of the chargesheet indicates, irrespective of the
ultimate outcome  of  the  matters  pending  in	 the  higher
courts, that the trial court at least was not satisfied that
a prima facie case was made out by the investigation.  These
facts  are   sufficient	 to   indicate	 that	either	 the
investigation or  the prosecution  or both  were lacking.  A
similar result	of discharge  of the accused in such a large
number of cases where chargesheets has been filed by the CBI
is not	consistent with any other inference.  The need for a
strong and  competent prosecution machinery and not merely a
fair and  competent investigation  by the  CBI can hardly be
over emphasised.   This	 is the	 occasion for us to take the
view that  a suitable machinery for prosecution of the cases
filed in  court by the CBI is	    also essential to ensure
discharge of  its full	responsibility by the CBI.  Unless a
competent  prosecution	 follows  a   fair   and   competent
investigation, the  exercise in	 the ultimate analysis would
be futile.   Investigation without improving the prosecution
machinery  is	of  no	practical  significance.  We  would,
therefore, consider  the aspect	 of prosecution	 also in the
formulation of the guidelines.

</p><p id="p_152">     The Seven	Principles of  Public Life are stated in the
Report by Lord Nolan, thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_55">	    "The Seven Principles of Public Life
			Selflessness
     Holders of	 public office	should take decisions solely
in terms  of the  public interest.  They should not do so in
order to  gain financial  or  other  material  benefits	 for
themselves, their family, or their friends.</blockquote>
<p id="p_153">			 Integrity
     Holders of	 public office	should not  place themselves
under  any   financial	or   other  obligation	 to  outside
individuals or	organisations that  might influence  them in
the performance of their official duties.
</p><p id="p_154">			Objectivity
     In	 carrying  out	public	business,  including  making
public appointments,  awarding	contracts,  or	recommending
individuals for	 rewards and  benefits,	 holders  of  public
office should make choices on merit
		       Accountability
     Holders of	 public office	are  accountable  for  their
decisions  and	 actions  to  the  public  and	must  submit
themselves to  whatever scrutiny  is  appropriate  to  their
office
			  Openness
     Holders of	 public office should be as open as possible
about all  the decisions  and actions  that they take.	They
should	give   reasons	for  their  decisions  and  restrict
information only  when the  wider  public  interest  clearly
demands.
</p><p id="p_155">			  Honesty
     Holders of	 public office	have a	duty to	 declare any
private interests  relating to	their public  duties and  to
take steps  to resolve	any conflicts  arising in a way that
protects the public interest.
</p><p id="p_156">			 leadership
     Holders of	 public office	should promote	and  support
these principles by leadership and example."
</p><p id="p_157">     These  principles	 of  public   life  are	 of  general
application in	every democracy	 and one is expected to bear
them in	 mind while scrutinising the conduct of every holder
of a  public office.  It is trite that the holders of public
offices are entrusted with certain powers to be exercised in
public interest	 alone and, therefore, the office is held by
them in	 trust for  the people.	 Any deviation from the path
of rectitude by any of them amounts to a breach of trust and
must be	 severely dealt	 with instead  of being pushed under
the carpet.   If  the conduct amounts to an offence, it must
be promptly  investigated and  the offender  against whom  a
prima  facie   case  is	  made	out   should  be  prosecuted
expeditiously so  that the  majesty of law is upheld and the
rule of	 law vindicated.   It  is duty	of the	judiciary to
enforce the  rule of  law and,	therefore, to  guard against
erosion of the rule of law.
</p><p id="p_158">     The adverse  impact of  lack of  probity in public life
leading to a high degree of corruption is manifold.  It also
has adverse  effect on	foreign investment  and funding from
the International  Monetary Fund and the World Bank who have
warned that  future aid	 to under-developed countries may be
subject to  the requisite  steps being	taken  to  eradicate
corruption, which  prevents international  aid from reaching
those for  whom it  is meant.  Increasing corruption has led
to investigative  journalism which  is of  value to  a	free
society.   The need  to highlight  corruption in public life
through the  medium of	public interest	 litigation invoking
judicial review	 may be frequent in India but is not unknown
in other  countries:  R v Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, (1995) 1 WLR 386.
</p><p id="p_159">     Of	 course,   the	necessity  of  desirable  procedures
evolved by  court rules	 to ensure that such a litigation is
properly conducted  and confined  only to  mattes of  public
interest is  obvious.	This is	 the effort  made  in  these
proceedings  for   the	enforcement  of	 fundamental  rights
guaranteed  in	 the  Constitution  in	exercise  of  powers
conferred on  this Court  for doing  complete justice  in  a
cause.	 It cannot  be doubted that there is a serious human
rights aspect  involved in  such a  proceeding	because	 the
prevailing  corruption	in  public  life,  if  permitted  to
continue unchecked, has ultimately the deleterious effect of
eroding the Indian polity.

</p><p id="p_198">4.   Steps shall  be taken  immediately for the constitution
of an  able  and  impartial  agency  comprising	 persons  of
unimpeachable integrity	 to perform  functions akin to those
of the Director of Prosecutions in U.K.	 On the constitution
of  such  a  body,  the	 task  of  supervising	prosecutions
launched  by   the  CBI/Enforcement   Directorate  shall  be
entrusted to it.
</p><p id="p_199">5.   Till the  constitution of	the aforesaid  body, Special
Counsel shall  be appointed  for the  conduct  of  important
trials on  the recommendation of the Attorney General or any
other law officer designated by him.
</p><p id="p_200">     The  learned  amicus  curiae  had	urged  us  to  issue
directions for	the appointment	 of an authority akin to the
Special or  Independent Counsel	 in  the  United  States  of
America for  the investigation	of  charges  in	 politically
sensitive matters and for the prosecution of those cases and
to ensure  that appointments  to sensitive  posts in the CBI
and other  enforcement agencies and transfers therefrom were
not made  by the  political executive.	 We  are of the view
that the  time for  these drastic steps has not come.  It is
our hope  that it  never will,	for we	entertain the belief
that the  investigative agencies  shall function  far better
now, having regard to all that has happened since these writ
petition were  admitted and  to	 the  directions  which	 are
contained  in	  this	judgment.    The  personnel  of	 the
enforcement agencies  should not  now lack  the courage	 and
independence to	 go about  their task  as they	should, even
where those  to be  investigated are  prominent and powerful
persons.
</p><p id="p_201">     In view  of the  problem in  the States being even more
acute,	as  claborately	 discussed  in	the  Report  of	 the
National Police	 Commission (1979), there is urgent need for
the State  Government also  to set up credible mechanism for
selection of  the Police  Chief in  the States.	 The Central
Government  must   pursue  the	 matter	 within	  the  State
Governments  and   ensure  that	  a  similar  mechanism,  as
indicated  above,   is	set   up  in   each  State  for	 the
selection/appointment, tenure,	transfer and  posting of not
merely the  Chief of  the State	 Police but  also all police
officers of  the rank of Superintendent of Police and above.
It is  shocking to  hear, a matter of common knowledge, that
in some	 States the  tenure of a Superintendent of Police is
on an  average only  a fee months and transfers are made for
whimsical reasons.    Apart  from  demoralising	 the  police
force, it  has also  the adverse  effect of politicizing the
personnel.  It is, therefore, essential that prompt measures
are taken  by the  Central Government  within the  ambit  of
their constitutional  powers in	 the federation	 to  impress
upon the  State Governments that such a practice is alien to
the  envisaged	constitutional	machinery.    The  situation
described in  the National Police Commission's Report (1979)
was alarming  and it  has become  much worse  by now.	 The
desperation of the Union Home Minister in his letters to the
state Governments, placed before us at the hearing, reveal a
distressing situation  which must  be cured,  if the rule of
law is	to prevail.   No  action within	 the  constitutional
scheme found  necessary to  remedy  the	 situations  is	 too
stringent in these circumstances.
</p><p id="p_202">     In the  result, we	 strike down Directive No. 4.7(3) of
the Single  Directive  quoted  above  and  issue  the  above
directions, which  have to  be construed in the light of the
earlier discussion.   The  Report of  the Independent Review
Committee (IRC) and its recommendations which are similar to
this  extent  can  be  read,  if  necessary,  for  a  proper
appreciation of	 these directions.   To	 the extent we agree
with the  conclusions and  recommendations of  the IRC,	 and
that is	 a large  area, we  have adopted  the  same  in	 the
formulation of	the  above  directions.	   These  directions
require the  strict compliance/adherence  of  the  Union  of
India and all concerned.
</p><p id="p_203">     The writ petitions are disposed of in the above terms
     Criminal Misc. Petition Nos. 5879-5882 of 1997
     In view  of the  disposal of  the writ petitions in the
manner indicated above and in the facts and circumstances of
the cases,  we do  not consider	 it necessary now to examine
the appointment	 of  Shri  R.C.	 Sharma	 as  Director,	CBI.
Moreover, the  tenure of  Shri Sharma as Director, CBI is to
end soon.   We	make it	 clear that Shri Sharma is not to be
continued as  CBI Director  beyond the date of expiry of his
present tenure.	 Accordingly, these Crl. M. Ps. are disposed
of in this manner.
</p><p id="p_204">     In view  of the  withdrawal of C.W.P.No.2992 of 1997 in
the Delhi High Court as required by this Court's order dated
11.9.1997, no  further order  for the disposal of C.W.P. No.
2992 of 1997 is necessary.
