<p id="p_1">Ramachandran Nair, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      These writ petitions are filed seeking for the issuance of a writ of

habeas corpus for the production of detenus, viz. Sri. Jojo George,

Mujeeb Rahiman and Sheen Mondy Jose @ Saju; to release them and; to

quash Ext.P1 order of detention. Since these writ petitioners raise common

issues, they are heard together and are disposed of by a common judgment.

</p><p id="p_3">      2.     We have heard the learned Senior Counsel Sri. C.C. Thomas on

behalf of the petitioners and the learned Additional Director General of

Prosecutions, Sri. K.K.Ravindranath on behalf of the respondents.

</p><p id="p_4">      3.     The short facts leading to the disposal of the cases are the

following:-
</p>
<p id="p_5">      In W.P.(Crl) No.265/2008, the detenu is one Jojo George; in W.P.

(Crl) No.266/2008, the detenu is one Mujeeb Rahiman and in W.P.(Crl)

No.267/2008, the detenu is one Sheen Mondy Jose @ Sabu. The orders of

detention are dated 25/06/2008, passed by the District Magistrate and

District Collector, Palakkad.     They have been issued under the power

conferred on the said Officer by the Kerala Anti-Social Activities

(Prevention) Act, 2007, (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act'). It is stated in

the respective orders that the detenus are accused in Crime Nos.26/2008,

181/2006 and 663/2007 of various police stations. The sum and substance

of the allegation is that the detenus are arrayed as accused in different cases

registered as Crime Nos.26/2008, 181/2006, 263/2006 and 663/2007 for

smuggling illegal spirit.     They have been aiding, abetting, conspiring,

executing smuggling of spirit and distributing spirit in Kerala with scant

respect to the law of the land . It is alleged that thus they have been

indulging in activities of transporting and distribution of spirit in violation

of the Abkari Act and are active members of an organised mafia involved in

smuggling of spirit into Kerala from neighbouring States and are 'Known

Goondas under Section 2(c) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      4.     The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners while attacking

the orders of detention contended that the detenus will not come under the

definition of "known goonda" as per Section 2(o)(ii) of the Act, since there

is no seizure of alcohol/spirit from the detenu in the presence of the

witnesses. It is also contended that they cannot be termed as "known

rowdy" under Section 2(p) of the Act also. It is contended that going by

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">266 &amp; 267/2008                        -3-</span>

Section 34 of the Abkari Act, only a person found committing an offence

punishable under the said Act alone is liable to be arrested and if at all the

allegations are correct, even then it is to be conceded that the detenus were

not present at the time of seizure of spirit in the four cases relied upon by

the respondents and there is also no evidence to show that the contraband

seized were under the control/possession of the detenus.         It is on this

premise that the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the detaining authority

is attacked. It is also contended by relying upon Exts.P4 to P9 orders

passed by this Court and by the Sessions Court relating to the applications

for bail, etc. of the respective detenus that it has been found therein that

there are no materials to connect the accused with the crime. It is submitted

that regular bail has been granted under Section 41A of the Abkari Act after

hearing the prosecutor also. It is therefore contended that the detaining

authority has not applied its mind to the findings rendered by the Sessions

Court in those orders which have been passed after perusal of the case diary

also. It is therefore submitted that as these are materials which ought to

have been considered by the detaining authority, failure to consider the

orders and the findings rendered by the Sessions Court in those orders will

result in total non application of mind. It is therefore contended that there

is nothing to connect the detenus with the crimes concerned and in these

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">266 &amp; 267/2008                         -4-</span>

cases as no charge-sheet has been filed,         no report could have been

forwarded by the Police Officer concerned to the Superintendent of Police

to the detaining authority to issue the orders of detention. Our attention was

invited to the relevant provisions of the Act to contend for the position that

in the absence of the final report by the Investigating Officer under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_1">Section

173(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure there could not have been any

basis for the issuance of the order of detention. During the arguments, it is

also pointed out that there is a violation of Section 7(2) of the Act as all the

relevant materials on the basis of which the detention has been found

necessary have not been communicated to the detenus.

</p><p id="p_7">      5.     Per contra, the learned Additional Director General of

Prosecutions submitted that the detenus in their representations have

themselves produced the orders on the bail applications and hence the non

supply of the same is not at all material. It is contended that herein there

were cogent materials by way of confession statement of the driver and the

confession of the accused/detenus of their involvement in the respective

cases and these materials would justify the orders of detention. It is also

submitted that copies of relevant documents relied upon by the detaining

authority have been supplied to the detenus and there is no violation of

either Section 7(2) of the Act or compliance of natural justice as enjoined by

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">266 &amp; 267/2008                        -5-</span>

<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_2">Article 22(5)</a> of the Constitution of India and therefore, the action does not

suffer from any infirmity. It was also submitted that as far as the provisions

of the Act in question are concerned there need not be any final report by

the Investigating Officer for enabling the Superintendent of Police to submit

his report under Section 3(1) of the Act. It is pointed out that no less a

person that the Superintendent of Police has been conferred with power

under Section 3(1) of the Act to furnish information to the Government or

the authorised officer to exercise the power to order detention.          The

Superintendent of Police was satisfied himself about the materials

forwarded by his subordinate Police Officer who has investigated the case

which formed the basis of his report to the detaining authority. it is

submitted that the confession statements of the driver before the police and

of the detenus themselves were material in the sense that they will connect

them to the commission of the crimes and, therefore, the orders of detention

do not suffer from any infirmity. It is argued that a final report filed under

<a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_3">Section 173(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not required for

satisfying the conditions to invoke the relevant provisions of the Act.

herein Section 2(o) of the Act which defines 'known goonda' including the

proviso and the explanation.

</p><p id="p_14">      8.     First we will consider the question as to the requirements of

Section 2(o)(ii) of the Act. This is relevant to consider whether the detenus

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">266 &amp; 267/2008                        -8-</span>

satisfy the definition of "known goonda". The section has two limbs, the

proviso and its explanation. Sub Section (i) is not applicable here because

the detenus have not been found guilty by any competent Court. To satisfy

clause 2(o)(ii) "the detenu should be one who had been found in any

investigation or enquiry by a competent police officer................. to have

committed any act within the meaning of the term 'goonda' as defined in

clause (j) of <a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_21">Section 2</a>."    To attract the proviso there should be a report

filed by the Police Officer before a lawful authority in respect of an offence

consequent to the seizure, in the presence of witnesses, of alcohol, spirit,

etc.  If there is such a report, such an offence can also be included for

consideration though the report had resulted from an action initiated by a

Police Officer. Here, the argument raised by the learned Senior Counsel

for the petitioners is that the seizure of alcohol, spirit, etc. should be from

their possession, in the presence of witnesses and herein, as the seizure has

not been effected from their possession in the presence of witnesses, the

said proviso is not attracted. Further, reliance is placed on Section 34 of

the Abkari Act. We are not impressed by the above argument. The proviso

lays emphasis on the seizure of alcohol, spirit, etc. in the presence of

witnesses and it is not conditioned that the alleged offender should be

apprehended from the scene itself followed by seizure in the presence of

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">266 &amp; 267/2008                         -9-</span>

witnesses. In many cases either the driver or the person concerned may be

escaping from the scene even before any seizure is effected and to insist

that the seizure should be in the presence of such accused in all cases to

attract the proviso, cannot be countenanced. What is provided is the report

filed by a police officer before a lawful authority "consequent to the seizure

in the presence of witnesses, of alcohol, spirit, etc." That alone will satisfy

the legal requirement to attract the proviso. Therefore, we reject the said

argument raised on behalf of the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      9. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners relying upon Exts.P4 to

P9, vehemently argued that in the light of the findings rendered by this court

in Ext.P4 and by the Criminal courts concerned in Exts.P5 to P9, it is a case

where there is no material to connect the accused with any of the crime

alleged and thus there is total non- application of mind in passing the orders

of detention. It is pointed out that the finding rendered by the Sessions

Court in Ext.P6 and the other orders Exts.P7 to P9 will show that the court

was of the view that there are no materials to connect the accused with the

crime. It is pointed out that the said finding has been arrived at after

perusing the case diary also. In para 9 of Ext.P6, while dismissing the Crl.

Revision Petition filed by the State, it is observed by the Sessions Court that

no material has been produced to prove the involvement of the accused

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">266 &amp; 267/2008                        -10-</span>

persons before the Magistrate or before that court even during the hearing of

the revision petition. Our attention was also drawn to the observation by the

Sessions Court that even though the driver of the vehicle involved in Crime

NO.181/2006 was arrested on the spot itself, the police has no case that any

confession statement of the driver implicating the petitioners, was obtained.

In paragraph 7 of Ext.P7 judgment, it is observed by the Sessions Court that

the prosecution has not produced any material before the court to connect

the accused with the crime. Reference therein is in respect of Crime

No.26/2008 of Valayar Police Station. Ultimately, it was observed that the

case is of the year 2006 and till now the police has no case that the

petitioners are involved in the case and accordingly they were granted bail

on certain conditions. In para 8 also, there is a finding to the effect that

"there is no material produced by the prosecution to prove that their

continued detention in prison is essential for completing the investigation in

the case."    Thus, it is argued that there are no materials to connect the

detenus with the crimes and the findings rendered by the competent

criminal courts ought to have been considered by the detaining authority

before passing the orders of detention. It is therefore submitted that there is

no basis for the subjective satisfaction arrived at by the authority concerned.

It is stated that the attempt by the authority concerned is malafide in the

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">266 &amp; 267/2008                         -11-</span>

sense that the order of detention has been passed to nullify the orders

granting bail to them. It is also submitted that going by the legal effect of

Section 41-A of the Abkari Act, an application for bail will be disposed of

by the court only after giving an opportunity to the Public Prosecutor to

oppose the same and going by Sub-section (b)(ii) of Section 41-A of the

Abkari Act, bail can be granted only if the court is satisfied that there are

reasonable ground to believe that he is not guilty of such offence and he is

not likely to commit any offence while on bail. In the light of the above

provision, it is contended that this is a clear case where attempts have been

made to over-reach the orders passed by the competent criminal courts.

</p><p id="p_16">      10.    In reply, learned Addl. Director General of Prosecutions

submitted that the fact that the petitioners have obtained bail was within the

knowledge of the detaining authority as is evident from the clear mentioning

of the said fact in Ext.P1 itself and in the Ground of detention, Ext.P2. It is

pointed out that mere granting of bail by the criminal court will not prevent

the detaining authority in passing an order of detention and there is no legal

bar for the same. It is contended that the detaining authority was satisfied

from the materials produced before it, of the grounds for detaining the

detenus under Section 3 of the Act in order to prevent them from

committing any such acts alleged as their activities have become potential

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">266 &amp; 267/2008                        -12-</span>

threat to maintenance of peace and public order in the society. It is further

pointed out that even though the Sessions Court has found in various

orders that no materials have been made available to connect the accused, in

fact there were materials like confession statement of the driver who was

arrested earlier and also of the accused detenus. It is therefore submitted

that the findings rendered by the Sessions Court in Exts.P6 to P9 about the

absence of materials, is wrong and the State had taken steps to challenge

those orders before this court. In fact, before completion of the hearing it

was submitted by the learned counsel that already Crl.M.Cs. have been filed

before this court on which notice has been ordered to the accused. It is

stated that the reasons for not producing the case diary had also been

explained before the Sessions Court in the objection filed by the Public

Prosecutor and thus, it is not a case where there was absence of materials to

connect the    accused with the crime.     It is further submitted that the

detaining authority has considered the entire materials including the

confession statement as mentioned above, while passing the order of

detention and he has applied his mind to all the circumstances also.

</p><p id="p_17">      11. It is clear from Ext.P1 and P2 orders that the detaining authority

was aware that the detenus have been granted bail in Crime Nos.26/2008

and 181/2006. It is further stated that there is every likelihood of the

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">266 &amp; 267/2008                      -13-</span>

detenus getting bail in Crime No.663/2007 of Kayamkulam Police Station

also. Thus, it is not a case where the authority concerned was unaware

about the orders granting bail.       Learned Addl. Director General of

Prosecutions is well founded in relying upon the principles stated by the

Apex Court in <a href="/doc/358390/" id="a_22">Kartic Chandra Guha v. The State of West Bengal and

others</a> (AIR 1974 SC 2149) to contend for the position that even if there is

any likelihood of releasing the accused on bail, it is open to the detaining

authority to pass orders of detention. It was held in para 4 of the above

judgment that the District Magistrate was entitled to pass the order of

detention even in such a case to prevent the accused from acting in a manner

prejudicial to the maintenance of 'public order'. Similar is the circumstance

herein also. Even though the accused had been granted bail in two cases the

likelihood of the detenus getting bail and indulging in smuggling of spirit,

etc. had been considered by the detaining authority and there is no legal bar

in passing the orders of detention. This principle has been reiterated in

<a href="/doc/1101604/" id="a_23">Sanjeev Kumar Aggarwal v. Union of India and others</a> (AIR 1990 SC

1202) also. Therefore, we are of the view that the fact that the applications

for bail have been allowed in two cases and there was possibility of getting

bail in Crime No.663/2007 will not deter the detaining authority from

passing an order of detention, if circumstances existed. The subjective

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">266 &amp; 267/2008                        -14-</span>

satisfaction of the authority concerned is not a matter for judicial review by

this court in these proceedings and this court will not be justified in

substituting our opinion with that of the detaining authority. Therefore, the

argument raised by the petitioners that there is total non-application of

mind is not correct and we reject the said argument. It is true that under

Section 41-A of the Abkari Act, the court has to satisfy, while considering

the application for bail, that there are reasonable ground to believe that he

is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence

while on bail. In the light of the relevant provisions of the Act there is no

bar for the detaining authority in passing an order of detention, as what is

relevant is only whether the detention is justified on the facts placed before

the detaining authority. The principles reiterated by the Apex Court in

<a href="/doc/212274/" id="a_24">Kamarunnissa v. Union of India and another</a> (AIR 1991 SC 1640) is

apposite to the context. It was held in para 13 of the judgment that "from

the catena of decisions referred to above it seems clear to us that even in

the case of a person in custody a detention order can validly be passed

(1) if the authority passing the order is aware of the fact that he is

actually in custody; (2) if he has reason to believe on the basis of

reliable material placed before him (a) that there is a real possibility of

all probability indulge in prejudicial activity and (3) if it is felt essential

to detain him to prevent him from so doing. If the authority passes an

order after recording his satisfaction in this behalf, such an order

cannot be struck down on the ground that the proper course for the

authority was to oppose the bail and if bail is granted notwithstanding

such opposition to question it before a higher Court."

</p><p id="p_18">      12. The next point is whether the provisions of Section 2(o)(ii) of the

Act are satisfied in this case. The argument raised is that there should have

been finding in an investigation against the detenu and normally in a

criminal investigation under the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25"> of the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure, only after conclusion of the investigation and by filing a report

under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_26">Section 173(2)</a> alone an investigating officer could be said to have

found that the accused has committed an offence and in this case that stage

has not reached at all and therefore the pre-conditions to attract the

provisions are not satisfied. It is pointed out that in the absence of such a

report by the investigating officer, merely on the basis of the First

Information Report and the alleged confession statement the detaining

authority ought not have come to a conclusion that the detention of the

detenus is necessary. It is pointed out that as far as the Act is concerned,

there are no specific provisions as regards the investigation of various acts

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">266 &amp; 267/2008                         -16-</span>

to satisfy the definition of 'goonda' and 'known goonda' and therefore resort

has to be made to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_27">Cr.P.C</a>. to understand the real

purport of the words used in <a href="/doc/30042/" id="a_28">Section 2(o)(ii)</a> also unless there is a report

under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_29">Section 173(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. it cannot be said that the investigating

officer would have formed an opinion that the accused has committed an

offence .
</p>
<p id="p_19">       13. Learned Addl. Director General of Prosecutions contended that

such a a pre-condition cannot be imported to the above provision at all. It

was submitted that a senior officer of the department like the Superintendent

of Police is submitting a report before the detaining authority which is

evident from Section 3 of the Act and the detaining authority before passing

the order of detention will have to enter satisfaction on perusing such a

report along with the materials and hence it cannot be said that a report

under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_30">Section 173(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. is must for proceeding under the Act.

The Superintendent of Police being a higher functionary, no malice can be

attributed also and he will be submitting the report after perusing the case

diary and based on the materials supplied by the investigating officer and

therefore there is no lacuna in the procedure adopted.

</p><p id="p_20">       14. It is true that the crucial words used in <a href="/doc/30042/" id="a_31">Section 2(o)(ii)</a> is "found

in any investigation or enquiry by a competent police officer, authority or

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,

competent court...........". It is relevant to notice that the Police Officer has

to rely on the investigation or enquiry to find that the person "committed

any act within the meaning of the term "goonda" as defined in clause (j) of

<a href="/doc/760919/" id="a_32">Section 2</a>. The usage of the words "any act" is important.              It is not

synonymous with the words "any offence". Even otherwise, the provision

for an "enquiry by a competent police officer" is also significant. The

principles reiterated by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/170679023/" id="a_33">Union of India v. Paul

Manickam and another</a> (AIR 2003 SC 4622) are relevant herein. It has

been held in para 14 that "in case of preventive detention no offence is

proved, nor any charge is formulated and the justification of such

detention is suspicion or reasonability and there is no criminal

conviction which can only be warranted by legal evidence. Preventive

justice requires an action to be taken to prevent apprehended

objectionable activities. [See Rex v.Hallidey (1917 AC 260): <a href="/doc/417170/" id="a_34">Mr.Kubic

Dariusz v.Union of India and others</a> (AIR 1990 SC 605)]. But at the

same time, a person's greatest of human freedoms, i.e. personal liberty

is deprived, and, therefore, the laws of preventive detention are strictly

construed, and a meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguard,

however, technical is mandatory. The compulsions of the primordial

need to maintain order in society, without which enjoyment of all

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">266 &amp; 267/2008                       -18-</span>

rights, including the right of personal liberty would lose all their

meanings, are the true justifications for the laws of preventive

detention. This jurisdiction has been described as a "jurisdiction of

suspicion", and the compulsions to preserve the values of freedom of a

democratic society and social order sometimes merit the curtailment of

the individual liberty." We are of the view that a final report as provided

under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_35">Section 173(2)</a> is not a pre-condition to attract the said provision.

Preventive detention is anticipatory and preventive. Thus, it is a case where

the detaining authority will have to satisfy itself of the possibilities of the

person indulging in acts contemplated by the respective provisions.

Therefore, a final report as envisaged under <a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_36">Section 173(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C.

as such is not essential for an action under Section 3 of the Act. Even

though investigations are pending against the detenus who are accused in

various crimes and is yet to be completed for various reasons, it will not

prevent the detaining authority from examining the matter to arrive at the

subjective satisfaction, even in the absence of a final report. Herein, as

contended by the Addl. Director General of Prosecutions, there is a report

by the Superintendent of Police along with the materials supplied by him

which alone is the pre-requisite for action under Section 3 of the Act.

Therefore, we reject the said contention.

complied with by the respondents after the order of detention was passed

and executed. <a href="/doc/1737367/" id="a_37">Section 7</a> (2) obliges the authorities concerned to supply to

the detenu copies of relevant documents on the basis of which he is

considered as a "known goonda". In view of the contentions raised by the

(2) of the Act which are as follows:

This point was raised during the arguments, even though it is not

specifically taken as a ground in the writ petitions. Relying upon the

decisions of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/317979/" id="a_40">Smt. Icchu Devi Choraria v. Union of

India</a> and others {(1980) 4 SCC 531}, <a href="/doc/1712028/" id="a_41">M. Ahamedkutty v. Union of

India and another</a> {(1990) 2 SCC 1) and other decisions, learned Senior

Counsel for the petitioners contended that since it is a legal question, that

can be considered by this court. The argument developed is like this. Even

though the detaining authority has clearly mentioned about the existence of

orders granting bail, they have not been communicated to the detenus. This

amounts to gross violation of Section 7(2) of the Act, and merely because

the detenus could subsequently procure it, that cannot save the situation as

strict adherence to the provisions is required. Again, when confronted with

the findings rendered by the respective courts in Exts.P4 to P9 regarding

absence of any positive material to connect the accused for granting bail, it

was submitted by the learned Addl. Director General of Prosecutions that

materials like confession statement of the driver who was arrested and that

of the petitioners themselves were there which have been considered by the

authorities. These have not been made available to the detenus. It was

submitted by the learned Addl. Director General of Prosecutions that those

materials were in the files which were duly considered by the authorities

<p id="p_24">      16. A reference to the averments contained in the counter affidavit

filed by the second respondent, the detaining authority, in Writ Petition

No.265/2008 is profitable while considering the above arguments. In para

8 of the counter affidavit, it is stated as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">        "On examination and evaluation of said report along with the

        connected First Information Report and supporting materials and

        defined in Section 2(C) of the Kerala Anti-social Activities

        (Prevention) Act, 2007 and also a "Known Goonda" as defined in

        <a href="/doc/30042/" id="a_42">Section 2(o)</a> thereof and that his activities have become potential

        threat to maintenance of peace and public order in the society,

        Ext.P1 order of detention was issued by the 2nd respondent."

detention, the crucial averment in para 7 of the counter affidavit is the

following:

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">         "At the time of arrest the detenu was served with copies of order of

         detention, grounds of detention (English and Malayalam), copies of

two writ petitions.
</p>
<p id="p_27">       17. The connected files produced by the Additional Director General

of Prosecutions have been perused by us. In fact, it was pointed out by the

respondents with reference to the files that the acknowledgment of the

detenus have been obtained in the copies furnished and there is no lacuna

on this point.   In all the three writ petitions, the files start with the

letter/report number 32170/Camp/2007P dated          24.6.2008 from the

Superintendent of Police, Palakkad to the District Magistrate, Palakkad.

Therein, the brief history of the three cases, viz. Crime Nos.26.2008,

181/2006 and 263/2006 have been stated and it is recommended that the

detenu/accused be detained under Section 3 of the Act, so that he is not able

to commit any other smuggling, conspiracy and illegal transportation of

spirit cases. The enclosure shows five items of documents which includes

the grounds of detention, brief of cases, brief of FIRs, and the copies of

FIRs in three cases. On verifying with the documents, it is found that

acknowledgments have been obtained behind the order of detention, the

grounds of detention in English and Malayalam, memo for executing the

order of detention, copies of F.I.Rs. in the three cases, a letter dated

24.1.2008 issued by Malabar Cements Limited to the Sub Inspector of

Police, Valayar, copy of the statement submitted by the police officer

concerned before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Palakkad

seeking to include the names of the accused in the array of accused, copy of

crime and occurrence report of the Excise Department and seizure

mahazars. The files do not show that the copies of Exts.P4 to P9 have been

served on the detenus and the copies of confession statements of the driver

and the detenus themselves have been served on them. The situation is

identical in all the three cases. Thus, the question is whether the submission

made by the respondents that copies of all the material documents have

been supplied to the detenus is correct or not. Going by the endorsement

contained in the letter dated 24.6.2008 of the Superintendent of Police,

Palakkad, what was forwarded are only the copies of F.I.Rs., brief of

F.I.Rs., brief of cases and grounds of detention and nothing else. If that is

accepted on the face value, it would have to be concluded that the other

documents like copies of the bail orders and copies of the confession

statements of the driver and the accused were not forwarded along with

them. But in the light of the fact that reference is made to the release on

bail of the detenus under various orders, in the grounds of detention,

straight away it cannot be concluded that this was made without seeing

those orders. If the earlier position is accepted, then the orders will be

vitiated by non-application of mind to the relevant materials and non-supply

of relevant documents to the detaining authority. To meet the argument of

the learned counsel for the petitioners that respondents are bound by the

findings rendered in Exts.P6 to P9 to the effect that there are no reliable

materials to implicate the detenu, it was vehemently argued on behalf of the

respondents that the confession by the driver and the detenus will clearly

implicate them.    Thus, obviously the detaining authority would have

confronted the findings contained in these orders with the confession

statements relied upon by the respondents.         These were very material

documents and were essential for arriving at the subjective satisfaction by

the detaining authority. Therefore, the question is whether the non-supply

of those documents to the detenus is fatal.

<p id="p_28">       18.  Going by the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1738051/" id="a_43">Usha Agarwal v.

Union of India and others</a> {(2007) 1 SCC 295}                 "the   procedural

safeguards under the Constitution have been interpreted, to require every

material which is relevant, having a bearing on the question as to whether a

person should be detained under the Act, be placed before the detaining

authority, as the detention to detain a person is rendered by a detaining

authority on his subjective satisfaction as to the existence of the grounds for

such detention. The sponsoring authority should not undertake any exercise

WP.(Crl.)Nos.265,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">266 &amp; 267/2008                        -25-</span>

of examination and interpretation of the available material with a view to

place the documents selectively before the detaining authority. It is not for

the sponsoring authority to decide as to which of the relevant documents

should be placed before the detaining authority, or which of the documents

are likely to help or not help the prospective detenu. Consequently, the

sponsoring authority cannot exclude any particular document from the

material to be placed before the detaining authority. If the relevant facts or

documents which may influence the subjective satisfaction of the detaining

auhtority on the question whether or not to make the detention order, are not

placed before the detaining authority, or are not considered by the detaining

authority, it may vitiate the detention order itself. It is no answer to say that

the view of the other documents that were placed before the detaining

authority or that the detaining authority would have come to the same

conclusion even if it had considered the said document." In para 13 of the

said judgment, their Lordships further held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">        " A document is relevant for considering the case of a person for

        preventive detention if it relates to or has a bearing on either of the

        following two issues: (a) whether the detenu had indulged in

        smuggling or other activities prejudicial to the State, which the

        <a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_44">COFEPOSA Act</a> is designed to prevent; and (b) whether the nature

        of the illegal and prejudicial activity and the manner in which the

        that he would continue to indulge in such activity. In other words,

        whether he had the propensity and potentiality to continue the

        prejudicial activity necessitating an order of detention."

</blockquote><p id="p_29">Herein, the detention is ordered to prevent the detenu from indulging in

further smuggling of illicit spirit.     It will be therefore clear that the

documents like confession statement of the accused and the driver and the

orders on the bail applications were relevant documents to be produced

before the detaining authority.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      19. It is well settled by various decisions of the Apex Court that

communication of materials is essential for the detenu to make an effective

representation against his detention. In Smt. Icchu Devi Choraria's case

(supra) {(1980) 4 SCC 531), it was held in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 in the

following terms:

             necessary corollary from the right conferred on the

             detenu to be afforded the earliest opportunity of making

             a representation against the detention, because unless the

             for reasons to be recorded in writing, not later than

             fifteen days from the date of detention. There are no

             not satisfied, the continued detention of the detenu

             would be illegal and void. However, even if the above

on. If there is failure or even delay in furnishing those documents it would

amount to denial of the right to make an effective representation guaranteed

under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_52">Article 22(5)."</a> It was further held in para 20 as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">           "It is immaterial whether the detenu already knew about their

        contents or not. <a href="/doc/124525/" id="a_53">In Mehrunissa v. State of Maharashtra</a> it was

        held that the fact that the detenu was aware of the contents of the

        documents not furnished was immaterial and non-furnishing of the

        copy of the seizure list was held to be fatal. To appreciate this point

        one has to bear in mind that the detenu is in jail and has no access to

        his own documents. <a href="/doc/1370957/" id="a_54">In Mohd. Zakir v. Delhi Administration</a> it

        was reiterated that it being a constitutional imperative for the

        detaining authority to give the documents relied on and referred to in

        the order of detention pari passu the grounds of detention, those

        should be furnished at the earliest so that the detenu could make an

        effective representation immediately instead of waiting for the

        documents to be supplied with. The question of demanding the

        documents was wholly irrelevant and the infirmity in that regard was

        violative of constitutional safeguards enshrined in <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_55">Article 22(5)."</a>

</blockquote><p id="p_32">Therefore, the argument raised by the learned Additional Director General

of Prosecutions that since the copies of orders Exts.P4 to P9 have been

produced by the detenus along with their representation, the non-furnishing

of the said copies will not be fatal, is not correct. Their Lordships have held

that "it is immaterial whether the detenu already knew about their contents

or not." There was no obligation on the part of the detenu to demand the

documents and if they were not supplied, that will violate the constitutional

safeguards enshrined in <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_56">Article 22(5)</a> read with <a href="/doc/26271110/" id="a_57">Section 7(2)</a> of the Act.

The reliance placed by the learned Addl. Director General of Prosecutions

to the decision in Usha Agarwal's case (supra) to contend that the detenu

had forwarded the copies of documents and therefore there will not be any

violation of the provisions, is not correct. Therein, the detenu alleged that

legible copies of documents were not supplied to him. But it turned out that

these were documents which had been forwarded by the detenu himself

earlier to the department which were illegible.        The copies of those

documents have actually been furnished by the detaining authority to the

detenu which contained such illegible portions. It is on that ground the

Apex Court found that there is no merit in the contention that proper copies

were not furnished. Herein, the position is different. Copies of the orders

on the bail applications have not been furnished to the detenus. Copies of

the confession statements have also not been furnished. Only copy of a

statement submitted by the investigating officer to the criminal court for

adding their names as accused alone was furnished without annexing the

copies of the confession statements. We have referred to the averments of

the second respondent in the counter affidavit on this crucial aspect wherein

it is stated that "the order of detention was passed on examination and

evaluation of the report along with the connected FIR and supporting

materials." As we have pointed out earlier, if the supporting materials are

not furnished and only the copies of FIRs, brief of cases, brief of FIRs. and

grounds of detention as seen from the enclosures mentioned in the report of

the Superintendent of Police alone are furnished, that will vitiate the order

of detention, as he had failed to forward the relevant materials to the

detaining authority. That is not the case here as now pleaded. There is

nothing in the files to show that the copies of the bail orders or the copies of

confession statements have been communicated to the detenus.               The

position is reiterated by the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/764779/" id="a_58">Adishwar Jain v. Union of

India and another</a> {(2006) 11 SCC 339} wherein it was held in para 29

that "if the documents were material so as to enable the detenu to make an

effective representation which is his constitutional as also statutory right,

non-supply thereof would vitiate the order of detention. What is necessary

to be supplied is the relevant and the material documents, but, thus, all

relevant documents must be supplied so as to enable the detenu to make an

effective representation which is his fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_59">Article 22(5)</a>

of the Constitution. Right to make an effective representation is also a

statutory right." This dictum squarely applies to the facts of this case.

</p><p id="p_33">       20. It is therefore to be examined whether there is any violation of

<a href="/doc/26271110/" id="a_60">Section 7(2)</a> of the Act. Going by <a href="/doc/26271110/" id="a_61">Section 7(2)</a> of the Act, it is clear that

the authorities are bound to furnish the grounds of detention specifying the

instances of     offences with copies of relevant documents as far as

practicable, on the basis of which he is considered as a "known goonda"

and giving such materials relating to his activities on the basis of which his

detention has been found necessary. Even though it was argued by the

learned Addl. Director General of Prosecutions by relying upon <a href="/doc/146959060/" id="a_62">Section 3</a>

(1) of the Act that the report or information conveyed by the Superintendent

of Police is the sole basis for the action under <a href="/doc/69411723/" id="a_63">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act, we

are afraid that the said argument may not be correct in the light of <a href="/doc/17622504/" id="a_64">Section 7</a>

(2) of the Act. The detenu is entitled to know the basis on which he is

considered as a "known goonda" and he shall also be furnished such

materials relating to his activities on the basis of which his detention has

been found necessary. Therefore, the report of the Superintendent of Police

alone is not the basis of the action, but apart from the report, materials

forwarded to the detaining authority are crucial for arriving at the subjective

satisfaction by that authority. He cannot withhold any material from the

detaining authority also. The provisions under <a href="/doc/26271110/" id="a_65">Section 7(2)</a> are plain and

clear and no other interpretation is possible. It may also be of mentioned

here of the argument raised by the learned Senior counsel appearing for the

petitioners that there are clear findings rendered by the various courts in

Exts.P4 to P9 orders , on the absence of materials to connect the accused.

Therefore, the respondents were compelled to disclose the crucial materials

in this proceedings, by way of confession statement of the accused and the

driver. Copies of the same are kept in one of the files produced before us.

Since they have been the basis for their arrest, their importance cannot be

lost sight of. Non-supply of the said material and the copies of bail orders

to the detenu is therefore a clear violation of <a href="/doc/26271110/" id="a_66">Section 7(2)</a> of the Act read

with <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_67">Section 22(5)</a> of the Constitution of India. Since the principles of

natural justice are violated, the consequent action will have to fail. We are

fortified in our view by the recent decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/434861/" id="a_68">Union of

India v. Ranu Bhandari</a> (2008 (12) SCALE 452).

proceedings. We are not finally pronouncing upon the same.

are any procedural infirmities, the detaining authority can pass fresh orders

after clearing the procedural defects.        While considering a similar

argument, it was held by this court in the above said decision that in

appropriate cases where there are procedural       infirmities, the detaining

authority can pass fresh orders after clearing the procedural defects. Their

Lordships have relied upon the decision of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/148612/" id="a_70">Naranjan

Singh Nathawan v. State of Punjab</a> (AIR 1952 SC 106) while arriving at

the said conclusion. Herein, we notice that <a href="/doc/195265553/" id="a_71">Section 13(2)</a> of the Act allows

the authorities concerned to pass fresh orders of detention.        The said
