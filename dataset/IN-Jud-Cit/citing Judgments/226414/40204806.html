                          in I.A. No. 8999 of 2021 in CS (Comm) No. 340 of 2021, whereby the
                          appellant was restrained from publishing a print advertisement
                          (hereafter &#x27;the impugned advertisement&#x27;) and airing three YouTube
                          videos (hereafter collectively referred to as &#x27;the impugned videos&#x27; and
                          separately as &#x27;the first impugned video&#x27;; &#x27;the second impugned
                          video&#x27;; and &#x27;the third impugned video&#x27;). These advertisements for the
                          toilet cleaner sold under the tradename &#x27;Domex&#x27;, were found to be,
                          prima facie, disparaging the toilet cleaner sold by the respondent
                          (hereafter &#x27;Reckitt&#x27;) under its trademark &#x27;Harpic&#x27;.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                          2.    HUL claims that the impugned advertisement and the impugned
                          videos truthfully depict that the effect of its product lasts longer than
                          Reckitt&#x27;s product. Thus, the impugned advertisement and impugned
                          videos are permissible and ought not to have been interdicted. Reckitt
                          disputes the claims made by HUL and complains that the impugned
                          advertisement and the impugned videos are misleading and disparaging.

                          and food products.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                          5.     Reckitt states that it has been involved in the manufacturing of a
                          well-known toilet cleaner under the trademark &#x27;Harpic&#x27; in India, since
                          the year 2001. Reckitt claims that Harpic is a household name in India
                          in the category of toilet cleaners and is the most widely used toilet
                          cleaner brand in the country. Its use dates back to its original launch in
                          England in 1920; currently, it is sold in over forty-seven countries.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                          6.     On 15.03.1979, Reckitt became the registered proprietor of the
                          word mark &#x27;HARPIC&#x27; (Registration No. 347055) under Class 3. The
                          aforementioned trademark registration is valid and subsisting as of date.
                          Reckitt has also obtained a registration for the shape of the bottle used
                          for packaging &#x27;Harpic&#x27; branded products in India. Reckitt claims that
                          since the launch of Harpic, the shape of the bottle has become a source
                          identifier for its product.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                          7.     HUL also manufactures and markets a toilet cleaner sold under
                          the trademark &#x27;Domex&#x27;. It claims that its product Domex is superior to
                          Reckitt&#x27;s Harpic in fighting bad odour. It is the case of HUL that it has
                          been granted a patent for using a technology that involves the use of a
                          chemical compound called &#x27;Saline&#x27;, which enhances the malodour
                          fighting capabilities by extending the period of its effectiveness.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                          8.     HUL ran an advertisement campaign with the message that its
                          product fights malodour for a longer period of time. The advertisement
                          campaign included the impugned advertisement, the impugned videos

                          and a TV Commercial. The TV commercial was launched on
                          23.07.2021. These advertisements are the subject matter of the suit, CS
                          (Comm) No. 340 of 2021.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                          9.    On 26.07.2021, Reckitt instituted the aforementioned suit
                          claiming that the TV Commercial, impugned advertisement and the
                          impugned videos were disparaging its product (toilet cleaner) sold
                          under the brand name &#x27;Harpic&#x27;. Reckitt also filed an application seeking
                          an interim relief restraining HUL from publishing or telecasting the
                          impugned advertisement and the impugned videos.                  The said
                          application was disposed of by the impugned judgment dated
                          09.11.2021. The learned Single Judge held that, prima facie, the
                          impugned videos seek to denigrate and malign HUL&#x27;s product as they
                          depict Reckitt&#x27;s Harpic bottle as an ordinary toilet cleaner. The learned
                          Single Judge also noted that the shape of the bottle was a registered
                          trademark of Reckitt and, accordingly, restrained HUL from
                          broadcasting the impugned videos in any form till HUL removes all
                          reference to Reckitt&#x27;s product &#x27;Harpic&#x27; or the bottle in question. Insofar
                          as the impugned advertisement is concerned, the learned Single Judge
                          also restrained HUL from publishing the same. The learned Single
                          Judge noted that the impugned advertisement was premised on the basis
                          that HUL&#x27;s product was technically superior to that of Reckitt&#x27;s.
                          However, the onus to establish that the said message was truthful rested
                          on HUL. The said question was a matter of trial and at the interim stage,
                          without any evidence being led, it was not possible to accept that HUL&#x27;s
                          product was superior to that of Reckitt. However, as far as the TV

                          Commercial is concerned, the learned Single Judge did not find the
                          same to be offending. The learned Single Judge held that the advertiser
                          had enough room to play and that Reckitt ought not to be hypersensitive.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                          10.     Both the parties assailed the impugned judgment. Reckitt filed
                          an appeal to the limited extent that the learned Single Judge had not
                          interdicted broadcast of the TV Commercial. The said appeal 1 was
                          disposed of by a judgment dated 26.09.2022. This Court found that the
                          learned Single Judge had erred in drawing a prima facie conclusion that
                          the TV Commercial did not denigrate Reckitt&#x27;s product. Accordingly,
                          this Court restrained HUL from airing the TV Commercial.

<p id="p_13">                          11.     The present appeal is confined to the impugned advertisement
                          (published in a newspaper) and the impugned videos (three videos
                          broadcasted on the internet website, YouTube).

                          contended that the learned Single Judge had erred in assuming that the
                          impugned videos denigrated any product. He submitted that there was
                          no ground to draw any such assumption. He submitted that the storyline
                          of the impugned videos merely promoted HUL&#x27;s product sold under the
                          brand name &#x27;Domex&#x27; and did not disparage any other product. He

                          bottle of Harpic would show that they are not identical. He also
                          submitted that the impugned videos contained a disclaimer stating that
                          the ordinary toilet cleaner was one that did not use water repellent
                          technology. He also contested Reckitt&#x27;s claim that it had a registration
                          in respect of the shape of the bottle. He referred to the documents
                          furnished, which reflect the trademark status as filed by Reckitt and
                          submitted that the registration to obtain a trademark was in respect of
                          the device marks as depicted on the bottle and not the shape of the
                          bottle. He also submitted that there were various other similar products,
                          which were sold in bottles that were broadly corresponding to the shape
                          of the toilet cleaner bottle shown in the impugned videos as a
                          representation of an ordinary toilet cleaner. He submitted that therefore,
                          Reckitt&#x27;s claim that the bottle of an ordinary toilet cleaner, as shown in
                          the impugned videos, in fact, identified its product Harpic, is erroneous.

                          in the present case, HUL had produced test reports, which established
                          that HUL&#x27;s product had better odour fighting ability. He submitted that

                          FreshGuard technology used in Domex works to fight off bad smell for
                          a longer period of time. He submitted that the intent of the impugned
                          advertisement was to put forth the said claim, which was neither untrue

                          Harpic, was smelly and emanating bad odour. Thus, this is a clear case
                          of disparagement. He submitted that HUL&#x27;s claim that its product is
                          superior, is untrue. He submitted that HUL&#x27;s claim is based entirely on
                          the use of a chemical compound called &#x27;Saline&#x27;, which makes the hard

                          the effect that the toilet bowls are made of ceramic and have a smooth
                          surface, which in any case, makes it hydrophobic. He submitted that

                          well; and HUL&#x27;s product does not have any additional advantage in that
                          regard. He also submitted that HUL&#x27;s claim that it uses a patented
                          technology was also misleading as several of the claims regarding anti-
                          microbial effect were rejected by the Patent Office. Further, the claim
                          that HUL&#x27;s product is effective for a longer period of time was also
                          rejected. He submitted that the test methodology used did not take into
                          account that even if the odour causing liquids did not stick to the hard
                          surface on account of HUL&#x27;s toilet cleaner making it more hydrophobic,
                          the odour causing liquid would collect in the water body at the bottom
                          of the toilet bowl. He also contended that Reckitt used caused third party
                          laboratories to conduct tests and the results of the malodour intensity,
                          and the faecal stain repellent test conducted, showed that there was no

                          (Harpic). He submitted that both the products were effective in cleaning
                          germs at the time of usage but were ineffective after subsequent wash
                          cycles.

                          honesty of the message that they convey. He also submitted that in the
                          present case, the message conveyed by the impugned advertisement and
                          the impugned videos, is untruthful.

                          Reasons and Conclusion

</p><p id="p_21">                          17.     This Court had, in the connected appeal1, briefly noted the law of
                          disparaging advertisements. This Court had noted that in <a href="/doc/752455/" id="a_8">Tata Press
                          Ltd. v. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited &amp; Ors</a>.8, the Supreme
                          Court had authoritatively held that commercial speech was a facet of
                          freedom of speech and expression, which was guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_9">Article
                          19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. Thus, it was entitled to be
                          protected; but the protection cannot extend to misrepresentation or
                          where the advertisements are contrary to law.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                          18.     In the case of M/s Colortek Meghalaya4, this Court had referred
                          to various earlier decisions of the Supreme Court and had set out the
                          principles to be borne in mind while considering whether an
                          advertisement is required to be protected. The relevant extract of the
                          decision reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                  &quot;14.   On the basis of the law laid down by the Supreme Court,
                                         the guiding principles for us should be the following:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                         (i) An advertisement is commercial speech and is
                                             protected by <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_10">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                         (ii) An advertisement must not be false, misleading, unfair
                                              or deceptive.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                         (iii) Of course, there would be some grey areas but these
                                               need not necessarily be taken as serious representations
                                               of fact but only as glorifying one&#x27;s product.</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">                                               To this extent, in our opinion, the protection of <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_11">Article
                                               19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution is available. However, if an
                                               advertisement extends beyond the grey areas and
                                               becomes a false, misleading, unfair or deceptive

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                 &quot;11. From the law discussed above it appears to me that the law on
                                 subject is as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                                 I) A tradesman is entitled to declare his goods to be best in the
                                 world, even though the declaration is untrue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                 II) He can also say that his goods are better than his competitors&#x27;,
                                 even though such statement is untrue.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                 III) For the purpose of saying that his goods are the best in the
                                 world or his goods are better than his competitors&#x27; he can even
                                 compare the advantages of his goods over the goods of others.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                 IV) He however, cannot, while saying that his goods are better than
                                 his competitors&#x27;, say that his competitors&#x27; goods are bad. If he says
                                 so, he really slanders the goods of his competitors. In other words
                                 he defames his competitors and their goods, which is not
                                 permissible.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                                 V) If there is no defamation to the goods or to the manufacturer of
                                 such goods no action lies, but if there is such defermation an action
                                 lies and if an action lies for recovery of damages for defamation,
                                 then the Court is also competent to grant an order of injunction
                                 restraining repetition of such defamation.&quot;

                          hyperbole; they do not hold good in cases where statements are held out
                          as representations of fact. This Court had observed that puffery and
                          exaggerated opinions are for attracting the attention of the targeted
                          customers. Such statements are neither held out as binding
                          representations or warranties, nor perceived as representation of facts.
                          Insofar as puffery and hyperbole is concerned, they were not required
                          to be tested on the anvil of accuracy or the truth. The creativeness of the
                          advertiser. which finds expression in puffery and hyperbole, are not
                          restricted even though such exaggerated statements are not true.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                          21.   In the case of Colgate Palmolive Company2, this Court had
                          observed that in a comparative advertisement, a certain amount of
                          disparagement is implicit. Puffery and hyperbole in the context of a
                          comparative advertisement would, to some extent, reflect the
                          competitor&#x27;s goods in a bad light.          However, as long as the
                          advertisements are limited to puffery and hyperbole - as contrasted with
                          the statements of fact, which are accepted as such - they are not
                          actionable. It is now settled law that while it is open for a person to
                          exaggerate its claims relating to his goods, it is not open for him to
                          denigrate or disparage the goods of another person.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                          22.   It is also settled law that honest comparative advertisements are
                          permissible. This implies that not only the statements of fact made in
                          the advertisements are accurate and true but that the overall message
                          delivered by the said statements of facts is also not misleading.
                          Obviously, this would have to be determined from the standpoint of the
                          customer viewing the said advertisement.

                                &quot;Leaves and petals are known to keep fluids from settling on their
                                surface. And now, your toilet bowl will have that ability too. All you
                                need is Domex FreshGuard to coat it with a transparent hydrophobic
                                layer. So any fluids that could potentially cause bad smell are
                                instantly repelled. Leaving your toilet fresh for upto 100 flushes.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_35">                          26.      The footnote at the bottom right of the advertisement reads as
                          under:
</p>
<p id="p_36">                                &quot;based on independent lab test on simulated toilet use, 2021, Harpic
                                Power Plus 10x Max Clean does not have FreshGuard technology.&quot;
</p>


<p id="p_37">                          27.      HUL claims that its product Domex FreshGuard includes a
                          compound called &#x27;Saline&#x27;, which makes the hard surface, such as that
                          of the toilet bowl, hydrophobic. Resultantly, fluids that cause bad smell
                          do not stick to the surface of the toilet bowl. It is also claimed that its
                          product continues to be effective in this regard for upto 100 flushes.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                          28.      The image of the toilet bowl in the impugned advertisement
                          indicates that the side of the toilet bowl, which is treated with HUL&#x27;s
                          product Domex is clean (represented by the blue color) and flowers
                          emanating out from that side of the toilet bowl depict a pleasant smell.
                          However, the side of the toilet bowl which is not treated with Domex is
                          shown as unclean. Green fumes representing a foul smell are shown as
                          emanating from the side of the toilet bowl where the toilet cleaner
                          without FreshGuard technology is used.
</p>
<p id="p_39">                          29.      The overall message of the impugned advertisement is loud and
                          clear: if one uses Harpic to clean the toilet, the toilet bowl will emanate
                          a foul smell but if one uses Domex, then the toilet would smell pleasant.

                          HUL attributes this to the use of FreshGuard technology (which uses
                          &#x27;Saline&#x27; as one of the active ingredients in the product).
</p>
<p id="p_41">                          30.   There can be little doubt that the impugned advertisement is
                          disparaging to Reckitt&#x27;s product. It mentions Harpic in particular and
                          claims that Domex fights bad smell for a longer period of time. Apart
                          from that, it shows that the toilet bowl cleaned with Domex emanates
                          fragrance while that cleaned with the use of Harpic emanates a foul
                          smell. As stated above, an advertiser can indulge in puffery and
                          hyperbole to reflect its product in a good light. However, it is not open
                          for an advertiser to claim that the product of its competitor is bad,
                          substandard or its use would be detrimental to the interest or well-being
                          of the customers. In the present case, the advertisement denigrates
                          Reckitt&#x27;s product by reflecting that the toilet bowl cleaned by the use of
                          the said product would result in the same remaining unclean and
                          emanating a foul smell.
</p>
<p id="p_42">                          31.   The impugned advertisement is also untruthful, at least to the
                          extent that it reflects that the toilet cleaned by its product would emanate
                          fragrance, while the one cleaned by Harpic would emanate a foul smell.
                          As stated above, HUL&#x27;s claim rests on the use of &#x27;Saline&#x27;, which
                          according to HUL has hydrophobic qualities. It is not HUL&#x27;s case that
                          the use of &#x27;Saline&#x27; would keep the toilet fragrant; it merely states that
                          the liquid causing bad odour would be repelled as the use of &#x27;Saline&#x27; on
                          the sides of the toilet bowl would not allow liquids with foul odour
                          (referring to urine) to stick on the side of the bowl.

                          inference that would be drawn by a customer viewing the first impugned
                          video is that Harpic is ineffective and cannot fight odour causing fluids.
</blockquote><p id="p_48">                          The toilet bowl cleaned by Harpic would permit odour causing fluids to
                          stick to the sides of the toilet bowl.
</p>
<p id="p_49">                          35.    Reckitt&#x27;s objection to the second impugned video is also to a
                          similar effect. The same also shows the bottle of an ordinary cleaner
                          (which Reckitt claims as its trademark) and mentions that an ordinary
                          cleaner is effective only till one flush whereas HUL&#x27;s product continues
                          to be effective in combating bad odour till 100 flushes. The message of
                          the third impugned video is that ordinary toilet cleaners are unable to
                          combat bad odour and therefore, the customers should choose Domex
                          FreshGuard. The Ordinary toilet cleaner is represented by a bottle which
                          Reckitt claims as its trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_50">                          36.    If it is accepted that Reckitt&#x27;s product Harpic is depicted as an
                          ordinary toilet cleaner, it would follow that the first and the third
                          impugned videos are disparaging its product Harpic. Insofar as the
                          second impugned video is concerned, the message is that Domex
                          combats bad odour for use up to 100 flushes. But Reckitt&#x27;s product does
                          so only till the first flush.
</p>
<p id="p_51">                          37.    In view of the above, the principal question to be addressed is
                          whether Reckitt&#x27;s claim that the impugned videos reflect its product as
                          an ordinary toilet cleaner, is justified.

</p><p id="p_55">                          39.      HUL contends that the said conclusion is erroneous. As noted
                          above, Mr. Sibal contested the claim that the shape of the bottle is the
                          registered trademark of Reckitt. He also contended that there are several
                          other manufacturers who sell toilet cleaners in bottles which look
                          similar to the shape of the bottle used by Harpic. He also urged that an
                          angular nozzle is a common feature of the toilet cleaner bottles as they
                          are useful for application under the rim of the toilet bowls. He
                          contended that if this feature is ignored, there would be no similarity
                          between the shape of the bottle depicting an ordinary toilet cleaner as
                          used in the impugned videos and the bottle used by Reckitt.
</p>
<p id="p_56">                          40.      The contentions advanced by Mr. Sibal are not persuasive. We
                          are unable to accept that Reckitt&#x27;s claim that the shape of the bottle as
                          depicted in the impugned videos is deceptively similar to its trademark,
                          is required to be rejected. Mr. Lall had pointed out that at least in two
                          orders - an order dated 31.10.2017 in <a href="/doc/159698441/" id="a_14">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Private
                          Limited v. Jyothy Laboratories Limited10</a> and an order dated

                          registered proprietor of the trademark in respect of the shape of the
                          Harpic bottle. Mr. Sibal also did not dispute the same. However, he
                          contended that the orders relied upon by Reckitt are orders that were
                          passed at an interim stage, prior to the defendants filing any pleadings.

                          Laboratories Limited was settled and therefore, no final findings were
                          rendered by this Court.
</p>
<p id="p_57">                          41.   In the present case, the learned Single Judge has, prima facie,
                          found that the shape of the Harpic bottle was the registered trademark
                          of Reckitt. We do not find any reason to interfere with the view of the
                          learned Single Judge in this regard. The registration certificates
                          produced by Reckitt establish that it has a registered trademark in the
                          shape of the bottle. According to HUL, the said registered trademark is
                          only in respect of the labels on the bottle and not the shape of the bottle.
                          At this stage, we are unable to accept the said contention. The trademark
                          registration clearly depicts the bottle from various angles and therefore,
                          it may not be correct to suggest that the trademark is limited to the labels
                          used on the said bottle.
</p>
<p id="p_58">                          42.   We are also unable to accept that the shape of the bottle shown
                          as an ordinary toilet cleaner is not similar to the shape of the bottle used
                          by Reckitt for the competing product, Harpic. It is well settled that the
                          similarity between competing trademarks is not required to be resolved
                          by juxtaposing them and closely examining various features of the
                          trademarks. Similarity between the trademarks is required to be viewed
                          from the standpoint of a person of average intelligence and an imperfect
                          recollection. The question is whether such a person viewing the shape
                          of the bottle in the impugned videos, would consider the same to be
                          depicting the bottle of Harpic. Prima facie, the answer is required to be
                          in the affirmative

                          that the shape of the bottle, as depicted in the impugned videos, is
                          deceptively similar to Rekitt&#x27;s trademark. Trademarks are source
                          identifiers and therefore, we find no infirmity with the reasoning of the
                          learned Single Judge that the depiction of the bottle of an ordinary toilet
                          cleaner in the impugned videos is likely to be identified as Reckitt&#x27;s
                          product Harpic.

                          clearly mention the competitor&#x27;s product. It would be impermissible if
                          the disparaged product is likely to be identified as that of a rival. <a href="/doc/226414/" id="a_16">In
                          Hindustan Lever Ltd. v. Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>.12, the

                          that its toothpaste would be more effective in combatting germs. The
                          characters in the said TV Commercial did not specifically mention the
                          respondent&#x27;s product (Colgate Toothpaste). It merely showed a lip
                          movement by a child in the TV Commercial, which could be identified
                          as pronouncing &#x27;Colgate&#x27;. Further, in the background, a jingle was
                          played, which could be identified as that from the respondent&#x27;s
                          advertisement. This was sufficient to establish that the appellant was
                          alluding to its rival&#x27;s product, &#x27;Colgate Toothpaste&#x27;. Similarly, in the
                          case of M/s Colortek Meghalaya4 a depiction of a red toothpowder was
                          found to be referring to the appellant&#x27;s toothpowder.

                          the learned Single Judge interdicting the telecast of the first and the third
                          impugned videos.
</p>
<p id="p_63">                          46.   The second impugned video mentions that the ordinary toilet
                          cleaner (referring to Reckitt&#x27;s product Harpic) is only effective for one
                          flush but HUL&#x27;s product is effective for a longer period of 100 flushes.
                          It is common a ground between the parties that HUL&#x27;s message is not
                          in the nature of puffery or hyperbole but is held out as a statement of
                          fact. Thus, the question whether HUL is entitled to run an advertisement
                          representing that its product is effective for 100 flushes and Harpic is
                          effective for only one flush, is required to be answered by determining
                          whether the said statement is true and not misleading.
</p>
<p id="p_64">                          47.   There is no dispute that comparative advertisement is
                          permissible. However, the same cannot disparage the products of the
                          competitors. It is permissible to advertise that a particular feature or
                          quality of the product is better than that of the competitor. However,
                          this is clearly subject to the condition that the overall advertisement
                          must not be misleading. A statement of fact or a representation made
                          in an advertisement must not only be accurate but should not be
                          misleading, as well. This has to be viewed from the standpoint of the
                          customers that the advertisements seek to target. For instance, it is
                          possible that a particular feature of the product, which has no material
                          relevance, is compared with the feature of the competing product to
                          craft an advertisement reflecting the product of the advertiser to be
                          superior to the product of its competitor. Whilst the statement regarding

<p id="p_66">                          49.   In the present case, the second impugned video asserts that
                          Domex fights bad odour up to 100 flushes while ordinary toilet cleaners
                          (referring to Reckitt&#x27;s product Harpic) fight bad odour only till the first
                          flush. It is also relevant to refer to the first frame where the question

                          translated in English, &quot;whether your toilet cleaner fights bad odour&quot;).

                          long does their toilet cleaner fight bad odour?
</p>
<p id="p_67">                          50.   As stated above, HUL&#x27;s claim that its product fights bad odour
                          till 100 flushes rests solely on the basis that it uses a compound with
                          hydrophobic qualities that sticks to the side of the toilet bowls and
                          therefore, does not let the odour causing liquids (referring to urine) stick
                          on the side wall for up to 100 flushes.

                                                                               2023:DHC:2528-DB



                          poured on the ceramic surface uniformly and was allowed to fall
                          naturally and after five to six seconds the extent of ammonia smell was
                          evaluated.    This cycle was repeated.       Reckitt disputes that the
                          methodology used can lead to the broad inference as advertised. Mr.
                          Lall contends that the said test does not indicate as to how the ceramic
                          surface is rinsed so as to simulate a flush. He submitted that a toilet
                          bowl has hydrophobic qualities and coating the same with &#x27;Saline&#x27; does
                          not result in fighting bad odour as the foul-smelling liquid would collect
                          in the water at the bottom of the toilet bowl. He submitted that any test
                          to validate HUL&#x27;s claim would necessarily entail the ceramic surface
                          being rinsed immediately after the ammonia solution is poured. The
                          competing efficacy of the product is required to be determined by
                          ascertaining whether any foul-smelling liquid is retained on the walls of
                          the toilet bowl after flushing.

<p id="p_69">                          52.   The question whether the test report furnished by HUL
                          substantiates its claim is a contentious one. The learned Single Judge
                          has proceeded on the basis that determination of the said question
                          requires the parties to lead evidence. Given the nature of the
                          controversy, we find no infirmity with the decision of the learned Single
                          Judge to defer the decision in this regard till the parties have led
                          evidence.

<p id="p_70">                          53.   Undisputedly, the balance of convenience lies in favour of
                          Reckitt. A false advertisement campaign would cause irreparable loss
                          to Reckitt while postponing broadcast of an advertisement referring to
                          Reckitt&#x27;s product may not have any material effect on HUL,

                          Single Judge has not interdicted HUL from broadcasting the impugned
                          videos but merely directed that it remove all references to Rekitt&#x27;s
                          product and the bottle representing ordinary toilet cleaners as the same
                          is identifiable with Reckitt&#x27;s product - Harpic.
