<p id="p_1">     1.        This petition is under <a href="/doc/1120409/" id="a_1">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and
     <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a> 1996 (hereinafter referred as 'the Act') seeking
     interim relief. The brief facts of the case are:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">          O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                             Page 1 of 25</span>
<p id="p_2">  a) The petitioner - Connaught Plaza Restaurants Private
     Limited (for short 'CPRL') operates fast food restaurants
     across the whole of North and East India under the name of
     "McDonald's". The respondent was (till recently) acting as
     the sole Purchasing and Forwarding Agent of the petitioner
     in terms of the agreement between the parties. The duties of
     the respondent under the said agreement included interalia,
     warehousing, placement of orders, distribution and ensuring
     safe custody of the products/ goods being handed over to the
     petitioner. However, post the wrongful and illegal
     termination of the said agreements by the respondent, the
     respondent has refused to release the products/ goods,
     (which products/ goods also include perishable products) to
     the petitioner with the intention of causing unlawful harm
     and injury to the business of the petitioner. The illegal
     withholding of the products/goods has caused irreparable
     loss to the petitioner and crippled its business operations. It
     may be noted the products/goods withheld by the respondent
     include. i) Perishable products having short shelf life and
     which would be imminently if not already past their expiry;
</p><p id="p_3">     ii) various items designed as being seasonal, viz. keeping in
     mind the specific time and month of the year, like
     pamphlets, posters, marketing materials toys etc.; iii)
     various other items related to the critical business activities
     of the petitioner like materials relating to sales, marketing,
     merchandising, regular consumables etc.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                               Page 2 of 25</span>
</p><p id="p_4">           b) It is evident the respondent has no lawful claim to these
             products/goods whether by way of ownership/ lien/
             hypothecation etc., and the illegal withholding of the
             same is severely prejudicing the operations of the
             petitioner, and the interests of all its stakeholders,
             including its 6500 employees. The petitioner has a
             number of claims against the respondent for its illegal
             actions and as regards which it reserves all its rights to
             initiate appropriate proceedings. In the interim, however,
             if the custody of the products/goods is not released to the
             petitioner, it will cause further irreparable loss to the
             products/goods as well as to the business of the
             petitioner, hence, this petition.
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.        The petitioner has filed this petition under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_3">Section 9</a> of the
Act on the premise there exists a subsisting arbitration agreement
between the parties and since the Agent Agreement dated
22.06.2009 extended till date says the respondent has no lien in
respect of the food/non-food products lying in their storage and the
respondent is illegally withholding the same, the same be ordered
to be returned to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_6">3.        This petition is challenged by (i) respondent herein and (ii)
by McDonald's India Private Limited as an intervenor.
</p>
<p id="p_7">4.        Let me take the intervener's application first.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">     O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                              Page 3 of 25</span>
<p id="p_8"> 5.        The learned senior counsel for the intervener qua its locus
standi to intervene has relied upon Mohammad Ishaq Bhat vs
Tariq Ahmed Sofi AIR 2010 J &amp; K 56 wherein the court held a
person holding a material and substantial interest in the subject
matter of the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_4">Section 9</a> of the Act or is likely to
be affected by the order in such proceedings should be allowed to
be a party in such proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_9">6.        The intervener MIPL has two principal contentions in
relation to present petition filed by CPRL viz. - a) petition has
been filed by suppressing the material facts and is as an attempt to
overreach the proceedings initiated by the intervenor in CS
(COMM) No.24/2018 and IA No.409/2018 pending before another
Bench; and b) the petitioner has filed this petition without proper
authorization as MIPL though holds 92.95% of the total issued and
paid up share capital and has two directors on the - CRPL Board
but neither the CRPL Board nor MIPL has ever approved of the
filing of the present petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">7.        Regarding contention a) above, it was argued CS(COMM)
No.24/2018 has a material bearing on the present petition as the
products of which the petitioner herein is seeking custody are the
property of MIPL which CRPL is not authorised to use or deploy.
Secondly, the CPRL is a party to the Franchise Agreement and is
defendant No.1 in such Suit and is aware of the proceedings,
having entered an appearance therein on its first date of hearing i.e.
11.01.2018. The copies of Franchise Agreement; Suit and IA are
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">     O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                            Page 4 of 25</span>
 already in possession of the petitioner herein and it ought to have
been filed by the petitioner with this petition. Since the aforesaid
Franchise Agreement, Suit and IA have been suppressed in this
petition without any explanation offered and since this petition is
filed in order to overreach the proceedings in said Suit and IA,
without due authorization by MIPL or without impleading MIPL;
or without disclosing the term of the Franchise Agreement; etc., on
these grounds alone in accordance with the settled principle of
suppression veri exclusion falsi, the petitioner is not entitled to any
relief and the petition is liable to be dismissed. Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_11">8.        Admittedly the franchise agreement does not contain any
reference to the agency agreement entered into between the parties
herein, either directly or indirectly. The effect of the termination of
the Franchise agreement is given in its Clause No.20 and such
agreement was terminated vide a notice dated 21.08.2017 by the
intervenor. Now this termination raises a question as to how the
respondent had understood the franchise agreement and the effect
of its termination i.e., whether the relationship between the
petitioner and the respondent was effected with the execution or
termination of the franchise agreement.             Admittedly post
21.08.2017 (date of termination) not only the respondent had
provided services to the petitioner but had continued writing letters
describing its relationship with the petitioner and even wrote email
dated 17.11.2017 (supra) and another mail dated 29.11.2017
(supra). These mails were sent four months after the termination of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">     O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                              Page 5 of 25</span>
 the franchise agreement. Even in its letter dated 26.12.2017 to the
administrator appointed by NCLT the respondent wrote they are
not privy to the dispute between CPRL and MIPL. All these show
as per respondent's understanding its relationship was never co-
terminus with the franchise agreement, but was independent of
that. Moreso, it is an admitted fact MIPL never filed any
proceedings against the respondent. The MIPL has rather filed a
suit against the petitioner wherein it sought injunction against the
petitioner from pursuing the relief under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_5">Section 9</a> of the Act
before this Court, but did not get any stay. Now, if the intervenor
failed to get relief in the suit, cannot be allowed to plead its cause
here.
</p>
<p id="p_12">9.        Moreso Clause No.31 of the Agent agreement dated
25.03.2013 notes:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 "31 This Agreement shall supersede the earlier
                 agreements/arrangements if any with respect to the subject
                 matter of the Agreement. Any change in the terms herein shall
                 be effective only upon the written concurrence of both the
                 Parties herein."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">10.       Further the law as it stands considers the intervener being
actually an inter lopper and its application if, motivated to cause
unlawful harm and injury to the petitioner by illegally intervening
with the petitioner's business and abusing the present lis to arm-
twist the petitioner cannot be allowed. It is trite an intervener
cannot seek any relief for itself or agitate its own cause; and can
only make submissions in support of one or the other party to the
matter. <a href="/doc/1225119/" id="a_6">See Sarswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd vs Commissioner of
Income Tax Haryana, Rohtak</a> (1999) 3 SCC 141 and State of UP &amp;

</p><p id="p_14">11.    The Intervener, therefore, seeks to indirectly create a
situation what the intervener was unable to do directly. Therefore,
its application is plainly in gross abuse of the process of law.
</p><p id="p_15">12.    The second argument raised by the intervenor is qua its
share holdings in the petitioner company to the extent of 50%
having 92.53% paid up capital also does not lead it anywhere. The
share holder does not own the property of the company, as is held
in <a href="/doc/1873699/" id="a_7">Mrs.Bacha F Guzdar, Bombay vs Commissioner of Income Tax,
Bombay</a> AIR 1955 SC 74:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">              "xxxxx
              The true position of a shareholder is that on buying shares an
              investor becomes entitled to participate in the profits of the
              company in which he holds the shares if and when the
              company declares, subject to the Articles of Association, that
              the profits or any portion thereof should be distributed by
              way of dividends among the shareholders. He has undoubtedly
              a further right to participate in the assets of the company
              which would be left over after winding up, but not in the assets
              as a whole as Lord Anderson puts it."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_16">13.    Thus the application of the intervenor stands dismissed.
</p><p id="p_17">14.    The learned senior counsel for the respondent herein also
raises three pertinent issues - a) there exists no valid arbitration
agreement between the parties; b) the relief sought for cannot be
granted at interim stage; and c) the relief if granted would lead the
respondent to breach its duties to the supply chain team.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15.    It is argued by the learned senior counsel for the respondent
that existence of a valid arbitration agreement is a mandatory
condition to maintain a petition under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_8">Section 9</a> of the Act and if

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">  O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                                                 Page 7 of 25</span>
 existence of a valid arbitration agreement is in dispute, the Court is
obligated to resolve this issue before considering the interim relief
sought under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_9">Section 9</a> of the Act. Accordingly, the existence of a
valid and subsisting arbitration agreement at the time of cause of
action ought to be determined as a preliminary issue.
</p>
<p id="p_19">16.    Further, it is argued under <a href="/doc/1846895/" id="a_10">Section 7</a> of the Act, an
arbitration agreement is valid only if it is in writing since parties
specific intention to resolve their disputes by arbitration is to be
clear. Further under <a href="/doc/153260/" id="a_11">Section 7(5)</a> of the Act in case of
incorporation of arbitration agreement through reference there
should be a clear and conscious acceptance by the parties of the
arbitration agreement being incorporated by reference and a mutual
intention to so incorporate it.

              the referred document into the contract between the parties.
              The arbitration clause from another contract can be
              incorporated into the contract (where such reference is made),
              only by a specific reference to arbitration clause.

                        was intended to cover all the disputes

                        phraseology was of the widest amplitude, it
                        is inconceivable that the parties intended its

<p id="p_25">22.   It was further argued by the learned senior counsel for the
respondent when the dispute arose in September 2017 there was no
valid and subsisting arbitration agreement governing the disputes
and the last subsisting written agreement between the parties was
of dated 25.03.2013 which expired on 31.03.2016 and was never
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                                                Page 10 of 25</span>
 renewed and clause No.31 of the agreement of 2013 stipulated any
amendment to the 2013 agreement shall be only upon the written
agreement. No further amendments were made to extend the term
of 2013 agreement which expired on 31.03.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_26">23.   It was argued after 31.03.2016 the relationship between the
parties was governed by the business arrangements between the
petitioner, the respondent and the supply chain team and not by
any written contract which contained the arbitration agreement.
Additionally, the parties did not execute any independent written
arbitration agreement reflecting their unequivocal intention to
resolve, through arbitration, any disputes arising after expiry of
2013 agreement i.e. after 31.03.2016. Hence when the dispute
arose between the parties in September 2017, there was no
subsisting written arbitration agreement between them.
</p>
<p id="p_27">24.   It was also argued the business relations may though have
continued to be governed by the terms of 2013 agreement, but the
same could not be construed as an extension of the agreement
dated 2013 as it could be extended only by conscious, intentional
and unequivocal reference or renewal in writing - which never
took place. Hence a stray reference to 2013 agreement in the
correspondence dated 29.11.2017 cannot be construed as an
extension of the arbitration agreement under 2013 agreement by
reference as there was no mutual intention of extension of any
arbitration agreement specifically expressed in writing which
would meet the requirements of <a href="/doc/1846895/" id="a_19">Section 7</a> of the Act.

<p id="p_28"> 25.    Secondly, it is argued in a petition under <a href="/doc/171085462/" id="a_20">Section 9</a> of the
Act the Court is not bound by the principle governing the grant of
interim reliefs in Civil Suits. <a href="/doc/1847057/" id="a_21">In Adhunik Steels Limited vs Orissa
Manganese and Minerals Private Limited</a> (2007) 7 SCC 125 it
was held:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">              "11. ....The grant of an interim prohibitory injunction or an
              interim mandatory injunction are governed by well known
              rules and it is difficult to imagine that the legislature while
              enacting Section 9 of the Act intended to make a provision
              which was de hors the accepted principles that governed the
              grant of an interim injunction. .... The concluding words of the
              Section, "and the court shall have the same power for making
              orders as it has for the purpose and in relation to any
              proceedings before it" also suggest that the normal rules that
              govern the court in the grant of interim orders is not sought to
              be jettisoned by the provision. ...... On that basis also, it is not
              possible to keep out the concept of balance of convenience,
              prima facie case, irreparable injury and the concept of just
              and convenient while passing interim measures under Section
              9 of the Act.

              principles in that behalf. ..... Therefore, on the whole, we feel
              that it would not be correct to say that the power under
              Section 9 of the Act is totally independent of the well known
              principles governing the grant of an interim injunction that
              generally govern the courts in this connection......"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">26.    It was also argued that Court cannot grant final relief at an
interim stage unless the final relief would become infructuous by
the time of adjudication of the disputes. <a href="/doc/160789/" id="a_22">In Deoraj vs State of
Maharashtra</a> (2004) 4 SCC 697 it was held:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">              "7. Situations emerge where the granting of an interim relief
              would tantamount to granting the final relief itself. .... In such
              cases the availability of a very strong prima facie case -- of a
              standard much higher than just prima facie case, the
              considerations of balance of convenience and irreparable
              injury forcefully tilting the balance of case totally in favour of
              the applicant may persuade the Court to grant an interim
              relief though it amounts to granting the final relief itself. Of
              course, such would be rare and exceptional cases."

<p id="p_30"> 27.       Thus, it was argued this Court cannot grant a mandatory

case is made out by the petitioner and any order of delivery of
products from respondent's possession shall be in the nature of

<p id="p_31">28.    Heard.
</p>
<p id="p_32">29.    Before coming to the contentions raised by the respondent,
let me examione the case of the petitioner. Admittedly, the parties
have entered into an Agent Agreement dated 22.06.2009 wherein
the petitioner had appointed the respondent as its sole purchasing
and forwarding agent with effect from 11.08.2008 in respect of
food and non-food products for its McDonald restaurants which
were in existence as on the date of the such agreement and those
which were to be opened in the future. The services to be provided
by the respondent were - warehousing facilities, receipt of the
goods, its safe custody/transportation to the designated restaurants,
insurance etc. Clause No.8 of this agreement is relevant and it
notes:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                "8. This agreement shall take effect w.e.f. 11th August, 2008

the respondent being carrying on its duty till September 2017 when
suddenly the respondent started asking to revisit its commercial
terms viz. to increase the storage charges and on the basis of

lying in storage. An email dated 17.11.2017 written by the

</blockquote>
<p id="p_37">33.   It is pertinent to note in its correspondence the respondent
allege suspension of its obligations under the agreement dated
25.03.2013 and never alleged the agreement was not in existence.
These assertions of outstanding dues were made on the basis of the
invoices raised from time to time and such outstanding dues, of
course, are disputed by the petitioner since settlement of accounts
could only be done at the end of financial year, as per the terms of
the agreement between them.
</p>
<p id="p_38">34.   The learned counsel for the petitioner referred to stock
report showing goods worth              10 crores of the petitioner lying in
the warehouse of the respondent upon which the respondent has no
lien and most of the perishable goods has since expired. It is
alleged though the respondent demanded its dues of                        4.19 crores
but there are various attachments/adjustments need to be made as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16"> O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                                                Page 16 of 25</span>
 their business was running upon the concept of under recovery and
over recovery so as to say there was an annual and monthly plan
between the parties as to the quantity of goods be taken in and out
every month and it was only at the end of the financial year the
parties would calculate its figures to determine actual dues.
However, in its letter dated 29.11.2017 the respondent created a
mid-way demand requiring the petitioner to pay or else it would
retain goods, which per terms of the agreement, is illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_39">35.   The petitioner also sent a letter dated 28.09.2017 to the
respondent qua re-conciliation of accounts, para 3 of it notes:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">              "3. As a business practice, CPRL would give annual
              projections for the volume of materials, which RKFL would
              have to handle for the duration of the forthcoming year. These
              projections were a tentative assessment of the requirements of
              CPRL for the upcoming year, based on the past history of
              consumption and future plans for expansion, These were
              provided to R.KFL only to facilitate R.KFL in securing
              appropriate warehousing and transport facilities and was
              done purely for the ease of business and not by way of any
              contractual obligation. The projections and assessments in no
              manner indicated a minimum guarantee for the-volumes which
              RKFL would be handling for the duration of the year, and
              there is nothing in the Agreement to suggest anything to the
              contrary. However again as a courtesy of business and in light
              of the healthy business relations between the parties, in the
              event that the volumes exceeded the projections, it was treated
              as a case of "over recovery" whereas if the volumes were
              lower than the projections, it was treated as case of "under
              recovery". In the former situation CPRL would credit the
              additional amounts received by RKFL and in the latter
              situation, CPRL would compensate RKFL to the extent of
              under recovery, pursuant to re-conciliation of accounts
              between the parties at the end of the financial year."

              failure to perform its obligations under the commercial
              arrangement between the parties and is not in any way
              connected with the ongoing shareholder disputes. RFPL being
              an independent company will have to assess -the commercial
              risk it is exposed to, given the ongoing shareholder disputes.
              We have been accommodating CRPL in good faith in hope of
              seeing an early resolution of the current business situation
              with us. Given that we have not got any kind of assurance in
              relation to the various concerns we have raised from time to
              time, we believe that we are exposed to an inordinately high
              commercial risk and we are within our right to protect our
              interest."

29.12.2017 to the administrator:-

<p id="p_43">39.    The correspondences above reveal the conduct of
respondent in extending the agreement retrospectively despite it
came to an end twice by efflux of time. Thus the intention of the
parties was to continue with their business arrangement under the
agreement(s) till the disputes arose in September 2017 and their
relations became sour.
</p><p id="p_44">40.   Would the conduct of parties herein determine the extension
of terms of the agreement dated 2013. The answer is <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_25">M/s.Bharat
Petroleum Corporation Ltd. vs. Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>.
(2008) 1 SCC 503 wherein the time charter party was entered into
between the appellant and the respondent on 06.05.1997 letting
hire vessels for a period of two years which was subsequently
extended for one month with an option for two further extensions
for a period of 15 days each without altering the conditions,
exceptions and exemptions contained in the charter party dated
06.05.1997. Later there were various offers and counter offers
exchanged between the parties as to the terms on which the charter
party was to continue pending the finalization of charter party from
01.09.1998, but the disputes arose and the Court in these
circumstances held:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">              "23.We are, therefore, of the opinion that though performance
              of the Charter Party agreement dated 6th May, 1997 may have
              come to an end on 31st August, 1998 but it was still in
              existence for some purposes, viz. the effect of vessels non re-
              delivery as per the prescribed mechanism and its continued
              use beyond the stipulated time and, thus, the arbitration clause
              in the said Charter Party operated in respect of these and
              other allied purposes. Therefore, the factual scenario in the
              instant case leads to an inescapable conclusion that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19"> O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                                                 Page 19 of 25</span>
                notwithstanding the expiry of the period fixed in the time
               charter party dated 6th May, 1997, the said charter party did
               not get extinguished, inter alia, for the purpose of
               determination of the disputes arising thereunder and the
               arbitration clause contained therein could be invoked by the
               respondent."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">41.      Thus, in the circumstances of this case, a) considering the
correspondence(s) on record; b) the conduct of the parties in
extending the agreement(s) retrospectively; c) continuing with the
business on similar terms and conditions; d) the assertions made by
the respondent to continue its support / business relations with the
petitioner, per communication addressed to the administrator, it
can safely be said though the term of the agreement dated 2013
came to an end on 31.03.2016, but it continued even thereafter till
disputes surfaced and hence the arbitration clause contained in the
said agreement dated 2013 would continue to operate qua the
disputes arisen thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_46">42.      The decisions in Duro Felguera SA (supra); M R Engineers
&amp; Contractors Private Limited (supra); Indowind Energy Limited
(supra) and others as relied by the respondent would not come in
the way of the petitioner since the facts in those cases were slightly
different. Those cases were under <a href="/doc/1846895/" id="a_26">Section 7</a> (5) of the Act where
the parties tried to take benefit of an arbitration agreement
incorporated in some other document by implication which was
never allowed. The facts of this case do not match with the cited
cases.
</p>
<p id="p_47">43.      Further the decisions relied upon by the learned senior
counsel for respondent namely Viom Networks Limited (supra) and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20"> O.M.P.(I)(COMM.) 103/2018                                               Page 20 of 25</span>
 Jagdish Kaur (supra) are also not applicable as in these cases the
lease agreements and license agreements expired and were never
renewed and there was no plea of either of the parties that such
agreement continued to be effective and binding by the parties
subsequent to that date. It is not so in the present case. The glaring
distinction is the parties in the present case continue to pursue each
other on the basis of the agency agreement dated 25.03.2016 and
as noted in various correspondences of the respondent, the
agreement continued to operate between them and the respondent
is now estopped by its conduct to claim there exist no arbitration
agreement. The respondent does not deny that it expressly and
impliedly accepted the continuation of the agency agreement dated
25.03.2016 and continued to deal with each other on such basis.
Having taken this position in its correspondences clearly and
expressly the respondent is estopped from claiming to the contrary.
</p>
<p id="p_48">44.   This case relates to retrospective extensions of arbitration
agreement dated 25.03.2013, per past practices till 31.03.2016.
Thereafter the agreement continued by implication as the
correspondences reveal the parties were acting under the
agreement, do show it had consciously accepted the terms of the
agreement dated 25.03.2013 including the arbitration clause even
after its formal expiry and there was mutual intention to abide by
such terms.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">              "8. It is thus an admitted case that the contractual
              relationship between the parties continued even after
              31.08.2014, that is, even after the term of the Agreement had
              expired. It is also not disputed that the services were availed
              at the same rates as specified in the Agreement.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">              11. There can be no dispute that an arbitration agreement is
              required to be in writing; the same is an essential condition
              under <a href="/doc/1846895/" id="a_28">Section 7</a> of the Act. In the present case, there is no
              dispute that the Arbitration Agreement is in writing. The only
              question is whether the Arbitration Agreement has perished
              even though the parties continued to implement the
              Agreement, albeit, without any written extension.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">              13. The Agreement further provided for the price payable to
              the Petitioner for its services. The Agreement further provided
              that the petitioner would raise invoices and charges relating
              to the services and the same would be paid by the respondent.
              Admittedly, the aforesaid contractual relationship did not end
              on 31.08.2014 even though the duration of the Agreement was
              till 31.08.2014. It is an admitted case that the parties
              continued the relationship thereafter; the petitioner continued
              to provide the services and the respondent continued to avail
              the same at the rates as agreed to in terms of the Agreement.
              According to Mr Bawa, although the Agreement could
              continue for all other purposes as there was no bar for the
              parties to contract orally but the same would not apply to the
              arbitration clause which necessarily has to be in writing."

<p id="p_50">46.   Hence I hold arbitration agreement was in existence till
disputes arose and hence a petition under <a href="/doc/1079220/" id="a_29">Section 9</a> of the Act,
shall be maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_51">47.     Another question which arose for determination is if
directions sought for can be given. The learned senior counsel for
the respondent argued the final relief at the interim stage cannot be
given as it would make the lis infructuous. The answer to this
query need to be founded within the parameters of the agency
agreement dated 25.03.2013 entered into between the parties.

<p id="p_52"> 48.    The terms of the agreement do show the respondent shall
have no right of lien over the products of the petitioner lying in its

petitioner as it shall harm the business, customer relations/goodwill

                until the price is paid, because during the period of the lien
                the seller is detaining the goods for his own benefit. The
                seller‟s remedy against the buyer for these expenses will be a
                claim for damages if he can establish a ground for such a

immensely affect the business of the petitioner in terms of loss of
