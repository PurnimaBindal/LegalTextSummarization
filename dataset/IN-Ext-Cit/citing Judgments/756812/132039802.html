Hon&#x27;ble Ravindra Maithani, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             Applicant Smt. Sumati Devi Thapliyal is in

judicial custody in Case Crime/FIR No. 20 of 2022, under

Sections 304-B, 498-A, 302, 201, 315, 120B read with 34

<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>, Police Station Dharasu, District Uttarkashi. She has

sought her release on bail.
</p>
<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.           Heard    learned    counsel    for   the   parties   and

perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_4">
</p><p id="p_5">3.           According to the FIR, the deceased and the

applicant were married in the month of April, 2021. After the

marriage, the applicant and the co-accused mentally and

physically harassed the deceased for the demand of dowry. On

05.05.2022, the deceased died. The FIR records that her

jewellery had broken and there were marks of injury on her

neck. She was pregnant by 6 months.

</p><p id="p_7">4.         Learned counsel for the applicant would submit

that there has been no specific demand of dowry against the

applicant. There is no evidence to suggest that soon before her

death, the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment

for or in connection with demand of dowry. Learned counsel

would refer to the statement of the informant given to the

Investigating Officer, where he has stated that they have

assured the husband and in-laws of the deceased that they

would financially assist them for opening a pharmacy shop of

the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">5.         Learned counsel has referred to the judgment

passed in the case of Appasaheb and another Vs. State of

Maharashtra, (2007) 9 SCC 721 to argue that financial

assistance never amounts to dowry.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.         On the other hand, learned State Counsel would

submit that the witnesses have supported the prosecution

case during investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7.         The judgment in the case of Appasaheb (supra) has

further been clarified in various judgments, including the

judgment in the case of Rajindra Singh Vs. State of Punjab

(2015) 6 SCC 477. In fact, in the case of Jatinder Kumar Vs.

State of Haryana, (2020) 16 SCC 721, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

Court has analysed the law and held in para 9 as hereunder:-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                           3</span>



</p><p id="p_14">     &quot;9. But the view of the Court reflected in that
judgment that seeking financial assistance would
not per se constitute demand for dowry has been
rejected by a later judgment of a three-Judge Bench
of   this     Court       in <a href="/doc/940643/" id="a_2">Rajinder        Singh v. State       of
Punjab [Rajinder Singh</a> v. State of Punjab, (2015) 6
SCC 477 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 225] . Upon
considering <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_3">Appasaheb [Appasaheb v. State                         of
Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9 SCC 721 : (2007) 3 SCC
(Cri) 468] and certain other authorities, it was held
in <a href="/doc/141748525/" id="a_4">Rajinder        Singh [Rajinder        Singh v. State          of
Punjab</a>, (2015) 6 SCC 477 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 225]
: (Rajinder Singh case [<a href="/doc/141748525/" id="a_5">Rajinder Singh v. State of
Punjab</a>, (2015) 6 SCC 477 : (2015) 3 SCC (Cri) 225]
, SCC p. 491, para 20)
             &quot;20. Given that the statute with which
     we      are     dealing     must     be    given    a      fair,
     pragmatic, and common sense interpretation
     so as to fulfil the object sought to be achieved
     by Parliament, we feel that the judgment
     in Appasaheb             case    [<a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_6">Appasaheb v. State         of
     Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9 SCC 721 : (2007) 3
     SCC (Cri) 468] followed by the judgment
     of <a href="/doc/167568223/" id="a_7">Vipin Jaiswal [Vipin Jaiswal v. State of A.P</a>.,
     (2013) 3 SCC 684 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 15] do
     not state the law correctly. We, therefore,
     declare       that    any       money     or    property     or
     valuable security demanded by any of the
     persons mentioned in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_8">Section 2</a> of the Dowry
     Prohibition Act, at or before or at any time
     after     the    marriage        which     is    reasonably
     connected to the death of a married woman,
     would necessarily be in connection with or in
     relation to the marriage unless, the facts of a

                 given case clearly and unequivocally point
                 otherwise.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_15">8.          The applicant is mother-in-law of the deceased. The

witnesses have stated about the dowry. In fact, it has been

told to the Investigating Office that after the marriage, the

applicant and her family members were not happy with the

simple T.V. and they wanted a smart TV. Therefore, TV was

substituted. The informant in answer to the last question has

revealed that when after marriage the deceased was harassed

for the demand of dowry, they assured to give some money to

assist them in opening the pharmacy shop for the deceased. Is

it directly related to the death of the deceased? The post

mortem report reveals that it is the case of strangulation. Who

killed the deceased in her house? As stated, the witnesses

have stated about the demand of dowry.


</p><p id="p_16">9.          Having considered the entirety of facts, this

Court is of the view that the bail application deserves to be

rejected.

<p id="p_17">
