HEADNOTE:
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_8">Article	 131</a> of the Constitution of India provides that	 the
Supreme	 Court	shall  have  original  jurisdiction  in	 any
dispute	 :  (a) between the Government of India and  one  or
more  States;  or (b) between Government of  India  and	 any
State or States on one side and one or more other States  on
the  other; or (c) between two or more States if and  in  so
far as the dispute involves any question (whether of law  or
fact)  on  which the existence or extent of  a	legal  right
depends.
A  memorandum alleging corruption, favouritism and  nepotism
against	 the  Chief Minister of the State of  Karnataka	 was
submitted  to the Union Homo Minister by certain  opposition
members of the State Assembly.	The Chief Minister  repelled
the allegations as frivolous and politically motivated.	  By
a  notification	 dated	May 18, 1977  the  State  Government
appointed under s.. 3(1) of the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_9">Commissions of Inquiry	Act</a>,
1952, a one man commission presided over by a retired  judge
of   the  Karnataka  High  Court  for  inquiring  into	 the
allegations specified in the notification.  By	notification
dated May 23, 1977, the Government of India appointed  under
s.  3(1) of the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_10">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952, a one	 man
commission  presided over by a retired judge of the  Supreme
Court  to  enquire into the charges made against  the  Chief
Minister  excluding "any matter covered by the	notification
of  the	 Government  of Karnataka".   Thereupon,  the  State
Government filed in this Court a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_11">Art. 131</a> of	 the
Constitution.  On the pleadings of the parties, three issues
were  framed  by this Court.  These were : (1) Is  the	suit
maintainable ? (2) Is the impugned notification ultra  vires
the  powers  of	 the Central Government under<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_12"> s.  3</a>  of	 the
Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 ? (3)	Even	 if	 the
notification  falls  within  sec. 3 of	the  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_13">Commissions  of
Inquiry Act</a>    is the section itself unconstitutional ?
It  was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that : (1)	 the
Central	 Government  has  no jurisdiction  or  authority  to
constitute  the	 Commission  of	 Inquiry  in  the  purported
exercise of its powers under the Act; (2) the action of	 the
Central Government in appointing the Commission against	 the
Ministers  of  the State Government is	destructive  of	 the
federal	 structure  of the Constitution and  the  scheme  of
distribution  of powers between the Centre and	the  States;
(3)  under the Cabinet system of government the	 Council  of
Ministers  is  responsible to the Legislature  for  all	 its
actions	 and the inquiry ordered by the	 Central  Government
against the State Ministers, while they are in office  would
subvert	 the  principle	 of  collective	 responsibility	  of
Ministers to the Legislature; (4)  by  virtue of Art  194(3)
it is the privilege of the Assembly (and not of
2
any  other body) to appoint a Committee for  inquiring	into
the conduct of any of its members; (5) interpretation of  a.
3  of the 1952 Act in such a way as to empower	the  Central
Government  to	appoint	 a  Commission	for  inquiring	into
matters	 relating  to any of the entries in List II  of	 the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution-would make a. 3 itself
ultra  vires the provisions of Part XI of the  Constitution;
and  (6)  since	 on  the basis of  the	report	the  Central
Government  cannot take any action against the Ministers  of
the  State  Government such a Commission  cannot  serve	 any
useful purpose.
On the other hand, the defendant (Central Government) raised
preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the suit
on  the	 ground that the appointment of	 such  a  Commission
does- not affect any legal right of the State; and.(2)	also
that  the  Central Government is competent to  constitute  a
Commission  to	inquire	 into a definite  matter  of  public
importance, (3) that, furthermore, its notification does not
cover any of the matters mentioned in the State Government's
notification, namely, the conduct of Ministers of the  State
Government.
(Per majority Beg, C.J. Chandrachud, Bhagwati and  Kailasam,
JJ)
(Untwalia, Shinghal and Jaswant Singh, JJ dissenting)
The suit is maintainable.
G. C. J.
1(a)  The State concerned, which challenges the validity  of
the action of the Central Government against one or more  of
its  Ministers in respect of acts involving exercise of	 its
governmental  powers,  would  have  sufficient	interest  to
maintain a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_14">Art. 131</a> because it involves claims to
what appertains to the State is a "State." [94 C-D]
(b)  The  case	involves consideration of  the	exercise  of
governmental  powers  which vest in the	 Government  of	 the
State  and  its	 Ministers as such vis-a-vis  those  of	 the
Central	 Government  and  its  Ministers.   It	also  raises
questions  relating  to the meaning and the  ambit  and	 the
applicability	of   the  particular   provisions   of	 the
Constitution whose operations are of vital interest to every
State.	 Interpretations  given	 to  those  provisions	must
necessarily be of great concern to the Union as well. (91 C-
D]
(c)  The   Union  of  India,  acting  through  the   Central
Government,  could  be said to represent the  whole  of	 the
people	of  India.  The individual  States,  acting  through
their Governments and Ministers, could be said to  represent
the  people  of each individual State and  their  interests.
When  differences arise between the representatives  of	 the
State  and those of the whole people of India, on  questions
of interpretation of the Constitution, which must affect the
welfare	 of the whole people, and, particularly that of	 the
people	of  the	 State concerned, it  is  too  technical  an
argument  to  be  accepted that a suit does  not  lie  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_15">Article 131</a> of the Constitution. [91 E-P]
(d)  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_16">Article  131</a> can be invoked whenever a State and  other
States	or the Union differ on a question of  interpretation
of the Constitution so that a decision of it will affect the
scope	or  exercise  of  governmental	powers	 which	 are
attributes  of	a  State.  It makes  no	 difference  to	 the
maintainability	 of  the action if the powers of  the  State
which	are  executive,	 legislative,  and-   judicial	 are
exercised through particular individuals. [92 F-G]
(e) The distinction between the State and its Government is,
at the most,one between the whole and an inseparable part of
the whole.It  would be immaterial as regards claims  on
behalf of either the State or itsGovernment  whether   the
two are distinct juristic entities.  Assuming that these are
distinctly  separate entities, the claim of  the  Government
would be that of the State. [91 H]
(f)The	fact that the State acts through its Ministers	or
officials cannot affect% the maintainability of a quit under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_17">Art. 131</a> of. the Constitution.	<a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_18">Article 166(3)</a> provides	 for
allocation of the business of the Government		,be
Ministers  for	"the  more  convenient	transaction  of	 the
business".  that  the State cannot act	merely	through	 its
Government as a whole but also
3
through	 its individual Ministers as provided by the  rules.
Articles  166(3)  and  154(1),	far  from  establishing	 any
antithesis  between the official capacity of a Minister	 and
the State for which he acts, only show that, as a  Minister,
he is an agent or a limb of the Government of the State and,
therefore,  he can be treated as an officer for purposes  of
<a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_19">Art.  154(1).</a>  The result is that a Ministers official	acts
cannot	be  distinguished from those of the State  on  whose
behalf	he  acts.   There  is nothing in  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_20">Art.	131</a>  of	 the
Constitution  itself to debar the State, which	must  always
necessarily act through its officers or agents or Ministers,
from suing the Central Government not only to protect one of
its  officers,	agents	or Ministers  from  being  proceeded
against,  by the Central Government, but to prefer  its	 own
claim to exclusive power to deal with him and	  this	  is
what the plaintiff has done by means of the suit. [92 H;  93

The Central Government's notification is valid. [94 G]
2(a) A perusal of the two notifications shows that while the
State  notification is meant to set up the commission  which
has to enquire whether the veil worn by certain transactions
is  correct  in	 form  and  covers  it	fully,	the  Central
Government  notification  is  clearly meant  to	 enable	 the
Commission appointed by it to tear down the veil of apparent
legality   and	regularity  which  may	be  worn   by	some
transactions.  It cannot be said that the two  notifications
would  be  covering  "the same matter"	as  contemplated  by
proviso	  (b)  to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_22"> s.  3(1)</a>  of	 the  Act.   If	 the   State
notification  is  meant only to	 superficially	scratch	 the
,surface  of  the  allegations	made  whereas  the   Central
Government  notification is meant to probe into the crux  or
the  heart of what may or may not have gone wrong  with	 the
body  politic  in  the State, this Court could	not  be	 too
technical  or  astute in finding reasons to  hold  that	 the
subject-matter	of  the two inquiries is  substantially	 the
same. [36 G-H]
(b)Since  the two notifications authorise  inquiries  into
matters	 which	are substantially different  in	 nature	 and
object, the inquiry of the Central Commission cannot be said
to be barred by reason of the State Government	notification
under proviso (b) to<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_23"> s. 3</a> (1 ) of the Act even if, in  order
to  deal  with	a  substantially  different  subject-matter,
central	 areas of fact or rules governing  the	transactions
may  be	 common.   If  the  objectives	are  different	 the
examination  of common areas of fact and law  for  different
purposes will be permissible. [39 B]
3(a) The obvious intention behind the 1952 Act is to  enable
the  machinery	of democratic Government  to  function	more
efficiently  and effectively.  It could hardly be  construed
is an Act meant to thwart democratic methods of	 Government.
[44 E]
(b)In  all  democratic	countries  when	 allegations   and
rumours circulate causing crisisof   confidence	 in   the
integrity  of public life or about other matters  of  public
importance, it is essential that public confidence should be
restored   and	 this  can  be	done  only   by	  thoroughly
investigating and probing the rumours and allegations.	Such
an inquiry might reveal either that the evil exists or	that
there is no force in the rumours.  In either case confidence
is restored. [40 H]
(c)In England, the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921
was   passed   "to   displace  the   procedure	 of   Select
Parliamentary  Committees  which  till then  were  used	 "to
investigate  alleged  wrong doing in high places".   Such  a
method of investigation by a political Tribunal was found to
be wholly unsatisfactory 'because such bodies could never be
free from party political influences.  When
4
reports of these committees came to be debated in the  House
of  Commons, the House was divided on party-lines and  by  a
majority   exonerated	the  ministers	 from	all   blame.
Therefore, investigation by a political tribunal on  matters
causing	 grave public disquiet had been discredited and	 the
1921   Act  was	 passed	 for  setting  up   some   permanent
investigating  machinery.  Even in the United States,  where
the system of Congressional Committees is still in vogue, ad
hoc tribunals (such as the Warren Commission) are  appointed
to   avoid   a	matter	being  referred	  to   Congressional
Committees.	    This clearly, shows that, in  democratic
countries,  not	 only does modem practice  but	statute	 can
provide for inquiries of the kind which are to be  conducted
under  the 1952 Act.  The proceedings of the Commission	 can
only  result  in  a report which is to be  laid	 before	 the
Legislature  concerned under<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_24"> s. 31(4)</a> of the Act.   <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_25">The	 Act</a>
contains  no provision for giving effect to the findings  of
the Commission or for enforcing any order which can be	made
by the Commission. [41 C-H; 44 E]
4.  The	 question whether a State Government  or  its  Chief
Minister  is  or  is not carrying out the  trust  which	 the
constitutional	power  places  in  the	hands  of  a   State
Government  and	 its head for the  purposes  of	 determining
whether any exercise of extraordinary powers under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_26">Art.	 356</a>
is  called  for	 or not. is a matter which  lay	 within	 the
powers	of the Central Government.  What is contemplated  by
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_27">Art.  356</a>  when	 it  speaks of	the  "satisfaction"  of	 the
President  from	 a  report of the  Governor  "or  otherwise"
whether	 a  particular	situation has arisen  in  which	 the
Government of the State can be carried on in accordance with
the  provisions of the Constitution is a matter which  would
be  of	public	importance.   If  the  President  deems	  it
necessary to give the State Government or its Chief Minister
an opportunity of being heard before an impartial Commission
of  Inquiry constituted under the Act, it could not be	said
that such I mode of exercise of power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_28">Art. 356</a> is	 not
fully  covered	by  what  is  necessarily  implied  in	 the
provisions of the Constitution, that is, the Power to  order
an inquiry for the purposes of the satisfaction required  by
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_29">Art. 356.</a>
[48 F-H]
5(a)  Provisions of either <a href="/doc/584478/" id="a_30">Art. 75(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/331399/" id="a_31">Art. 164(2)</a>  cannot
operate	 as  bars against the institution  of  inquiries  by
Commissions set up under the Act.  To infer such bars  would
be  to	misunderstand  the object as well as  the  mode	 and
sphere of operation of these articles as also the  purposes,
scope,	and function of Commissions to be set up  under	 the
Act. [53 H]
(b)'The	  Council  of  Ministers,   though   theoretically
appointed  by the Governor, is collectively  responsible  to
the  Legislative Assembly of the State.	 But his  collective
responsibility does rot abridge or truncate the power of the
Central Government to appoint a Commission under<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_32"> s. 3</a> of the
Act.   Collective  responsibility has a scope  and  mode  of
operation which are very different from those of an  inquiry
under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_33"> s.  3</a>  of the Act even though  the  same	 or  similar
matters	  may  some  times  give  rise	to  both.    Matters
investigated  under<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_34"> s. 3</a> of the Act may have no	 bearing  on
any collective responsibility.	The sphere of inquiry  under
s.  3  is  very	 different from	 that  in  which  collective
responsibility	functions.  While the object  of  collective
responsibility	is  to	make the  whole	 body  of  Ministers
collectively  or vicariously responsible for acts of  others
even  if  an  individual  minister  may	 not  personally  be
responsible, the inquiry under<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_35"> s. 3</a> has been ordered by	 the
Central Government to determine who is actually	 responsible
for certain actions and what will be the motive behind them.
[50 F]
(c)Inasmuch as the Council of Ministers is able to stay in
office	only  so,  long	 as it	continues  the	support	 and
confidence of a majority of the Members of the	Legislature,
the  whole Council of Ministers is  politically	 responsible
for the decisions and policies of each of the Ministers	 and
of  his department.  So far is the Ministry's  answerability
to the Legislative Assembly is concerned. the whole Ministry
has to be treated as one entity.  The purpose of <a href="/doc/331399/" id="a_36">Art. 164(2)</a>
which  embodies this Principle, is not to find out facts  or
to  establish the actual responsibility of a Chief  Minister
or any other Minister or Ministers for particular  decisions
or  governmental acts.	The principle of individual as	well
as  collective	ministerial  responsibility  can  work	most
efficiently  only  when cases requiring proper	sifting	 and
evaluation of evidence and discussion of questions: involved
have   taken  place  in	 proceedings  before  a	  Commission
appointed under<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_37"> s.  3</a> of the, <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_38">Art. [51</a> F-G)
5
6(a)  The  only sanction for the enforcement  of  collective
responsibility	is  the	 pressure  of  public  opinion.,  In
England,  the principle operators as a of convention  backed
by  political  judgment, but for us this  principle  in	 our
Constitution itself [Arts. 75(2) and 164(2)].	Nevertheless
here  also  it depends upon convention and  public  opinion,
particularly   as  reflected  in  Parliament  or  in   State
Legislatures,  for  its effectiveness.	 The  principle,  of
collective   responsibility  also  exists   separately	 and
independently from the legal liability of a Minister holding
an office in the Union or a State Government. [52 H]
(b)An  investigation  by a Commission  of  inquiry  should
facilitate or help the formation of sound public opinion.  A
Minister's  individual actions, however, do not	 bring	into
operation  the principle of collective responsibility  where
his  colleagues in the Government cannot reasonably be	held
guilty of dereliction or breach of any duty. [53 C-D]
Constitutional Law-Wade &amp; Phillips 8th Edn. p. 87.
Constitutional and Administrative Law Prof.  S. A. de Smith,
pp. 170-179 referred to.
7.A  Commission of Inquiry has an orbit of action of  its
own  within which it can move so as not to conflict with  or
impede	other  forms  of  action or  modes  of	redress.   A
Commission of Inquiry is meant to explore and discover	real
facts. It  is neither a substitute for action in a  court
of law nor can its report orfindings  relieve  courts	of
their duty.  The appointment of a Commission isgenerally
a  confession  of want of sufficient evidence to  take	the,
matter toa  court combined with an attempt to  satisfy	the
public	need  and desire to discover what  had	really	gone
wrong and how and where, if possible. [53 G-H]
8.There	 is  no force in the  contention  that	Ministers
answerable to the Legislature are governed by a separate law
which exempted them from liabilities under the ordinary law.
Articles 194 and 105 which deal with powers, privileges	 and
immunities  of	each House as well as its  Members,  do	 not
apply  to legislative powers of Parliament or of  the  State
Legislatures.	The powers" meant to be indicated  in  these
Articles  are powers which depend upon or are necessary	 for
the conduct of business of each House. [57 B-C]
9(a)  The Constitution could not mention and  exhaust  every
conceivable topic of legislation and it is precisely to meet
such  a	 situation  that <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_39">Art. 248</a>, read with  Entry  97	 was
inserted.  Therefore, <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_40">Art. 248</a> read with Entry 97 of List  I
will fully cover<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_41"> s. 3</a> of the Act even if Entry 94 of List  I
does  not.   The  term 'constitutional law  can	 be  neither
clearly	 nor exhaustively defined.  A Constitution could  be
expected to contain only the basic frame-work., It is not  a
part  of its nature to exhaustively deal with  all  matters.
It is well accepted that nit all constitutional law need  be
written.  There can be no clear-cut distinction between what
could  or  should  and	what could  not	 or  should  not  be
comprehended within the body of rules called  constitutional
law.   In  practice,,  what is embodied even  in  a  written
constitution depends sometimes on the peculiar notions of  a
people.	  It reflects their views about what should be	con-
sidered	 so basic or fundamental as to find a place  in	 the
constitutional	document.   To	expect the  content  of	 the
Constitution  to be so all-embracing as to deal	 with  every
conceivable topic of legislation exhaustively so as to leave
no room for doubt is to expect the humanly impracticable, if
not  the impossible.  The most that could be  expected	from
the  human  foresight of Constitution-makers  is  that	they
should	Provide for the residual power of legislation  which
could	cover	topics	 on  which   Parliament	  or   State
legislatures could legislate even though the legislation may
not  be	 easily assignable to any specific  entry.   Such  a
provision  our Constitution-makers did make. [61 H; 59	G-H;
61 B-C; D-E]
(b)The	term 'inquires' as used in Entry 94 of List I  and
Entry  45  of  List III, without any  limitations,  is	wide
enough to embrace every kind of inquiry, whether a  criminal
offence	 by  any one is disclosed or not by  facts  alleged.
Entry  45  in  List  III  must	include	 inquires  to  cover
allegations against all persons which bring them within	 the
sphere of Entry I of List III relating to criminal law.	 All
that "inquires" covered by Entry 45 require is that they
6
must be "for the purpose of any of the matters specified  in
List  II or List III". The language used........ any of	 the
matters	 specified. .  " is broad enough to  cover  anything
reasonably  related to any of the enumerated items  even  if
done by holders of ministerial offices in the States.  Other
subjects  will	be  found in List II.	Even  assuming	that
neither Entry 94 List I nor Entry 45 of List III would cover
inquires  against Ministers in the States, relating to	acts
connected  with	 the exercise of ministerial  powers.	<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_42">Art.
248</a>, read with Entry 97 of List I, must necessarily cover an
inquiry	 against Ministers on matters of public	 importance,
whether	 the allegations include violations of criminal	 law
or not.	 A contrary view would have the wholly	unacceptable
consequence  of	 placing  Ministers  in	 State	 Governments
practically above the law. [63 C-E]
(c)Since the powers conferred by<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_43"> s. 3</a> upon the Central and
State	Governments,  including	 the  power   to   institute
inquiries  of  the  kind  set  up  under  each	of  the	 two
Notifications,	are  covered by the  express  constitutional
provisions,   no  question  of	any  exclusion,	 either	  by
necessary implication or by any principle, supposed to	form
a  part	 of  or	 to flow from the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution, can rise here.  Nor is it possible to so	read
down  and interpret<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_44"> s. 3</a> of the Act as to exclude  from	 its
purview	 inquiries  of	the kind instituted  under  the	 two
notifications.	 To do so would be to give an  incentive  to
possible misuse and perversion of governmental machinery and
powers for objects not warranted by law.  Such powers  carry
constitutional	obligations  with  them.   They	 are  to  be
exercised  like the powers and obligations of  trustees	 who
must not deviate from the purposes of their trusts.  Whether
a  Minister has or his not abused his powers and  privileges
could be best determined by fair and honest people  anywhere
only after a just and impartial inquiry has taken place into
complaints  made against him so that its results  as  before
them. [64 A-C]
(d)  There  is	no  room for applying  the  rule  Expression
Union.v Est Exclusion Alterius to exclude what falls  within
in   expressly	provided  legislative  entry.	Before	 the
principle  can	be applied at all, the Court  must  find  an
express	 mode  of  doing something that	 is  provided  in  a
statute	 which, by its necessary implication, could  exclude
doing  of  that very thing and not something  else  in	some
other  way.   Far  from	 this  being  the  case	 here,	 the
constitution-makers   intended	to  cover  the	 making	  of
provisions  by Parliament for inquiries for various  objects
which,	may  be	 matters of public  importance	without	 any
indications of any other limits except that they must relate
to subjects found in the List. [64 H]
Colquhoun v. Brooks, [1888] Q.B.D 52 @ 65 referred to.
(e)The proposition that what is not specifically mentioned
in the Constitutionmust	  be  deemed  to  be   deliberately
excluded from its purview so that nothingshort	 of    a
constitutional amendment could authorise legislation upon it
is  really  to invent a "Casus Omissus" so as to  apply	 the
rule  that, where there is such a gap in the law, the  Court
cannot	fill it.  The rule, however, is equally	 clear	that
the  Court  cannot so interpret a statute as  to  produce  a
casus	omissus	 where	there  is  really  none.    If	 the
Constitution itself provides for legislation to fill what is
sought	to be construed as a lacuna, legislation seeking  to
do  this cannot be held to be void because it  performs	 its
intended  function by an exercise of an expressly  conferred
legislative   power.   In  declaring  the  purpose  of	 the
provisions  so made and the authority for making it,  Courts
do  not supply an omission or fill up a gap at all.   It  is
Parliament which can do so and his done it. [65 A-B]
The Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v. V. Henderson Brothers,
[1888] 13 A.C. 595 @ 602 referred to.
10(a)  The  written Constitution by its very nature  as	 the
embodiment  of	the 'fundamental law of the  land  makes  it
imperative for Courts to determine the meaning of its  parts
in keeping with its broad and basic purposes and objectives.
It  must be read as a whole, and construed in  keeping	with
its  declared  objects	and  its  functions.   Although	 the
Courts, acting in exercise of judicial power. may supplement
those  parts where the letter of the Constitution is  silent
or  may	 leave room for its development by  either  ordinary
legislation
7
 or judicial interpretation, they cannot nullify, defeat, or
distort	 the  reasonably clear Meaning of any  part  of	 the
Constitution in Order to give expression to some theories of
their	own  about  the	 broad	'or  basic  scheme  of	 the
Constitution.	This  must  be done with  reference  to	 the
express provisions of the Constitution.	 The dubiousness  of
expressions  used  may be cured by Courts  by  making  their
meanings  clear and definite, if necessary, in the light  of
the  broad and basic purposes set before themselves  by	 the
Constitution-makers.   The power of judicial  interpretation
cannot extend to laying down what is in direct conflict with
express	 provisions  of the Constitution.- Nor	can  express
provisions be curtailed by importing limits based on a	mere
theory of limitations on legislative powers. [66 C-G]
(b)  In	 the matter of interpretation of. the  Constitution,
in a long line of decisions, this Court has held that  where
two constructions are possible, the Court should adopt	that
which  will implement and discard that which will  ,stultify
the apparent intentions of the Constitution-makers, that the
Court  should adopt a construction which  harmonizes  rather
than  one which produces a conflict between its	 provisions,
the  construction  which will ensure smooth  and  harmonious
working of the Constitution and eschew the other which	will
lead to absurdity or give rise to practical inconvenience or
make well-established	 provisions of existing law nugatory
that the plenitude of power to legislate,    indicated by  a
legislative  entry has to be  given as wide and	 liberal  an
interpretation as is reasonably possible. If  a subject does
not fall within a   specifically  demarcated field found  in
List II or List III, it would fall in List I,	  apparently
because of the amplitude of the residuary field indicated by
Entry 97, List I. Legislative entries only denote fields  of
operation  of legislative power which is actually  conferred
by one of the articles of the Constitution.  This Court	 has
also rejected argument that the wide range given to Entry 97
of  List  I, read with <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_45">Art. 248</a> of the	Constitution,  would
destroy	 the  federal  structure of  our  Republic.   On  an
application  of	 a  similar test, the powers  given  to	 the
Central Government by<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_46"> s. 3</a> of the Act, could not be held  to
be  invalid on the ground that the federal structure of	 the
State is jeopardized. [68 C; E; 69 C; 70 <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_47">B &amp; D]

(c)  Whenever  the  doctrine  of basic	structure  has	been
expounded   or	applied	 it  is	 only  as  a   doctrine	  of
interpretation of the Constitution as it actually exists and
not of a Constitution which could exist only subjectively in
the  minds of different individuals as mere  theories  about
what  the Constitution is.  The doctrine did not add to	 the
contents of the Constitution.  It did not, in theory, deduct
anything  from what was there.	It only	 purported_to  bring
out  and explain the meaning of what was already there.	  It
was,  in fact, used by ill the Judges for this purpose	with
differing  results  simply  because  their  assessments	  or
inferences as to what was part of the basic structure in the
Constitution  differed.	 This is the correct  interpretation
of the doctrine of the basic structure of the  Constitution.
It should only be applied if it is clear, beyond the  region
of  doubt,  that what is put forward as a  restriction	upon
otherwise clear and plenary legislative power is there as  a
Constitutional imperative. [ 86 G-H]
(d)  If this is the correct view about the basic  structure,
as  a  mode of interpreting the Constitution  only,  the  so
called federalism as a fetter on legislative power must find
expression  in	some express provision to be  recognised  by
Courts.	  A  majority of Judges who decided  the  Keshvanand
Bharati's case have not treated "federalism" as part of	 the
basic  structure  of the Constitution and none of  them	 has
discussed  the extent of the "federal" part of	this  struc-
ture.	It  is	not  enough  to point  out  <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_58">Art.  1</a>  of	 the
Constitution-to emphasise that
8
our  Republic is a "Union" of States.  The word "Union"	 was
used in the context of the peculiar character of our federal
Republic  revealed  by its express provisions.	One  has  to
find  from other express provisions what this 'Union'  means
or  what is the extent or nature of "federalism" implied  by
it.    The  Constitution  itself  does	not  use  the	word
"federation"  at  all.	It is not possible to  discover	 any
such  fetter  which  could.,  by  a  necessary	implication,
prevent Parliament from enacting<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_59"> s. 3</a> of the Act. [87 B-D]
Per Chandrachud, J.
The preliminary objection to the maintainability of the suit
ought  to be rejected.	The proceeding brought by the  State
of   Karnataka	is  maintainable  under	 <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_60">Art.  131</a>  of	 the
Constitution. [100 C]
(a)  The jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_61">Art.
131</a> of the Constitution should not be tested on the anvil of
rules  which are applied under the Code of  Civil  Procedure
for   determining  whether  a  suit  is	  maintainable.	   A
constitutional	  provision    which	confers	   exclusive
jurisdiction  on  this	Court to  entertain  disputes  of  a
certain nature in the exercise of its original jurisdiction,
cannot be equated  with a provision conferring a right on  a
civil court to entertain a    common suit so as to apply  to
an original proceeding under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_62">Art. 131</a> the canons  of a	suit
which  is ordinarily triable under s. 15 of the C.P.C. by  a
court of  the  lowest  grade  competent	 to  try  it.	 The
Constitution does not describe a   proceeding under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_63">Art. 131</a>
as  a suit but uses words and phrases commonly employed	 for
determining the jurisdiction of a court of first instance to
entertain  and try a suit.  It does not speak of a cause  of
action;	 instead it employs the word "dispute".	 Above	all,
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_64">Art. 131</a> is a self-contained code on matters falling  within
its  purview.	By the very terms of the Article,  the	sole
condition required to be satisfied for invoking the original
jurisdiction  of this Court is that the dispute between	 the
parties	 referred  to in clauses (a) to (c) must  involve  a
question  on which the existence or extent of a legal  right
depends. [97 E-H]
(b)  The quintessence of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_65">Art. 131</a> is that there has to be  a
dispute	 between the parties regarding a question  on  which
the  existence	or  extent  of a  legal	 right	depends.   A
challenge  by the State Government to the authority  of	 the
Central	 Government  to	 appoint  a  Commission	 of  Inquiry
clearly involves a question on which the existence or extent
of the legal right of the Central Government to appoint	 the
Commission of Inquiry depends and that is enough to  sustain
the  proceeding brought by the State under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_66">Art. 131</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	The Constitution has purposefully  conferred
on  this  Court	 a jurisdiction	 which	is  untrammelled  by
considerations	which fetter the jurisdiction of a court  of
first  instance which entertains and tries suits of a  civil
nature.	  The very nature of the dispute arising under	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_67">Art.
131</a> is different both in form and substance from the  nature
of claims which require adjudication in ordinary suits.	 [98
B-D]
(c)  Part XI of the Constitution is devoted specially to the
delineation  of relations between the Union and the  States.
The  object  of	 <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_68">Art.  131</a> is  to  provide  a  high  powered
machinery  for ensuring that the Central Government and	 the
State Governments act within the respective spheres of their
authority   and	  do   not  trespass   upon   each   other's
constitutional functions or powers, Therefore, a,  challenge
to the constitutional capacity of the defendant to act in an
intended manner is enough to attract the application of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_69">Art.
131</a>  particularly  when	 the  plaintiff	 claims	 that  right
"exclusively for itself. [98 F-G]
(d)  A	proceeding under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_70">Art. 131</a> stands in  sharp  contrast
with  an  ordinary civil suit.	While in an  ordinary  civil
suit  rejection of a right asserted by the defendant  cannot
correspondingly	 and  of its own force establish  the  right
claimed	 by  the plaintiff, proceedings under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_71">Art.  131</a>	 are
adjudicatory of the limits of constitutional power vested in
the  Central or the State Governments.	In a civil suit	 the
plaintiff  has to succeed on the strength of his own  title;
the  competition in a proceeding under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_72">Art. 131</a>	 is  between
two  or more Governments.  There is no third alternative  as
in  a civil suit wherein the right claimed by the  plaintiff
may  reside  neither in him nor in the defendant  but  In  a
stranger.   A demarcation and definition  of  constitutional
power between the
9
rival  claimants  and restricted to them and them  alone  is
what a proceeding under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_73">Art. 131</a> necessarily involves. [98 H
JUDGMENT:
</pre><p id="p_1">(e)  There is no force in the defendant's contention that if
a  State Government challenges the constitutional rights  of
the  Central  Government  to take  a  particular  course  of
action, <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_74">Art. 131</a> will not be attracted.	 The contention	 ,of
the State Government is not only that the Central Government
has no power to appoint	 the	Inquiry	   Commission	 for
enquiring into the conduct of State Ministers	  but	that
such  right is exclusively vested in the  State	 Government.
There is, therefore, not only a denial of the right  claimed
by  the Central Government but an assertion that  the  right
exclusively resides in the State Government. [99 <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_75">D-E]

</p><p id="p_2">(f)  A	writ  under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_76">Art. 226</a> is hardly a  substitute  for  a

More,over,  disputes  of the nature described  in  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_79">Art.	 131</a>

within the scope of<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_80"> s.	 3(1)</a> of the Act.  The objection  of
the State Government that it offends against cl. (b) of	 the
proviso	 to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_81"> s. 3(1)</a> of the Act is factually  unfounded	 and
theoretically unsound. [114 F; 101 H]
</p><p id="p_4">(a)  It is wrong to contend that the Central Government	 has
appointed  the	Commission  of Inquiry for  the	 purpose  of
inquiring into the same matter into which the Commission  of
Inquiry	 appointed  by the State Government is	directed  to
inquire. [101 E]
</p><p id="p_5">(b)  Considering  the terms of the notifications  issued  by
the  State  Government and the Central	Government  and	 the
matters	 into which the respective Commissions are  directed
to inquire, it is obvious that the object and purpose of the
two inquiries is basically different.  The primary object of
the  State  Government in appointing the  commission  is  to
ascertain whether improper or excessive payments were  made,
undue  favours	were  shown,  irregularities  or  fraud	 had
occurred  in  the  conduct of  official	 business  etc;	 and
secondly to find out as to who are 'the persons	 responsible
for the lapses, if any, regarding the aforesaid and to	what
extent".  On the other hand, the Commission appointed by the
Central	 Government  is	 specifically  directed	 to  inquire
"whether  the  Chief  Minister	practiced  favouritism	 and
nepotism"  in  regard to various matters  mentioned  in	 the
notification. (100 G; 101 D-E]
</p><p id="p_6">(c)  Moreover,	it  is hardly ever possible that  the  State
Government will appoint a Commission to inquire into acts of
corruption,  favouritism  and nepotism on the  part  of	 its
Chief Minister. [101 G]
3(a)  On  a  plain  reading of<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_82"> s. 3(1)</a> of  the	Act,  it  is
impossible  to bold that the section cannot be construed  as
authorising  the Central Government to appoint a  Commission
of Inquiry for the purpose of inquiring into the conduct  of
a sitting Minister of a State Government. [102 B]
</p><p id="p_7">(b)  <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_83">Section  3(1)</a>  cannot be given  a	restricted  meaning.
There is no justification for reading down the provisions of
the section to limit the power of the 'Central Government to
appointing  a Commission of Inquiry for inquiring  into	 the
conduct	 of  persons in relation to matters  concerning	 the
affairs of the Union Government only.  The section  empowers
the Central Government to appoint a Commission for making an
inquiry	 into any definite matter of public importance.	  It
is inarguable that the conduct of Ministers of State Govern-
ments in the purported discharge of their official functions
is not a definite matter of public importance.	Further,  it
cannot	be  said that the Central Government does  not	even
possess the power to collect facts in regard to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">10</span>
allegations  of	 corruption made by a section of  the  State
Legislature   against	sitting	 Ministers  of	 the   State
Government. [102 E-F]
</p><p id="p_8">(c)  The  argument  that <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_84"> s. 3(1)</a> will	offend	against	 the
principle   of	collective  responsibility  unless   it	  is
construed  narrowly is without substance.  Whatever may	 the
findings  of  the  Commission of  Inquiry,  the	 Council  of
Ministers whether at the Centre or in the States,  continues
to be collectively answerable or accountable to the House of
the  People  or	 the  'Legislative  Assembly.	Neither	 the
appointment of the Commission nor even the rejection by	 the
Commission  of all or any of the allegations referred to  it
for its inquiry would make the Council of Ministers any	 the
less  answerable  to those bodies.  The object	of  Articles
75(3) and 164(2) of the Constitution is to provide that	 for
every  decision	 taken	by  the	 Cabinet  each	one  of	 the
Minister-  is responsible to the Legislature concerned.	  It
is difficult to accept that for acts of corruption, nepotism
or  favouritism	 which	are alleged by	members	 against  an
individual Minister, the entire Council of Ministers can  be
held  collectively  responsible to the Legislature.   If  an
individual  Minister  uses  his office	as  an	occasion  or
pretense  for  committing acts of corruption,  he  would  be
personally answerable for his unlawful acts and no  question
of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers can
arise in such a case. [105 C; 103 F-H]
</p><p id="p_9">(d)  The essence of collective responsibility of the Council
of  Ministers  is  that the Cabinet is	responsible  to	 the
Legislature for every action taken in any of the ministries.
In  other words the principle of  collective  responsibility
governs	 only  those acts which a Minister performs  or	 can
reasonably be said to have performed in the lawful discharge
of his official functions. [104, B]

</p><p id="p_10">(e)  In	  the  absence	of  a  specific	 provision  in	 the
Constitution  the  conduct of a member	of  the	 Legislature
shall  be  inquired  into by the  Legislature  only,  it  is
impossible  to hold that the appointment of a Commission  of
Inquiry	 under	the Act constitutes  interference  with	 the
privileges of the Legislature.	English precedents  relating
to the privileges of the House of Commons which are relevant
under <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_85">Art. 194(3)</a> do not support the States contention. [105

Act  for  the purpose of facts in regard to  allegations  of
corruption, favouritism and nepotism against a sitting Chief
Minister  or Ministers cannot be held to  constitute  inter-
ference with the executive functions of the State Government
or  that it confers on the Central Government the  power  to
control the functions of the State executive. [109 F-G]
</p><p id="p_12">(g)  An examination of the provisions and scheme of the	 Act
shows that a Commission appointed under the Act is purely  a
fact finding body with no power to pronounce a binding or  a
definitive  judgment.  The larger interest of the  community
requires that sensitive matters of public importance  should
be enquired into by a high-powered Commission whose findings
can  command the  confidence of the people.  If, on  receipt
of  the report, the Central Government decides to  take	 any
action	the validity thereof may have to be decided  in	 the
light  of  the constitutional provisions.  But,	 until	that
stage  arrives,	 it is difficult to hold  that	the  Central
Government   is	 exercising  any  control   or	 supervisory
jurisdiction over the executive functions of the State.	 108

individual  as	a  moral and  intellectual  person  and	 his
material  physical body.  By the term 'State' is  understood
the  political	person or entity which	possesses  the	law-
making right and by the term 'Government' is understood	 the
agency	through which the will of the State  is	 formulated,
"pressed  and  executed.  The Government thus  acts  as	 the
machinery of the State and those who operate this  machinery
act  as the agents of the State. Again, the State itself  is
an ideal person, intangible, invisible and immutable and the
Government  is	its agent.  If the State Government  is	 the
agent through which the State expresses its will, the  State
cannot be said to be unconcerned when any right or  capacity

would be wholly unrealistic to suggest that since the  State
Government  is	distinct  from	the  State,  any  action  or

in  both the fields.  Apart from the  exclusive	 legislative
power  of  the Centre and the States, both  have  concurrent
powers of legislation in regard to the entries of List	III.
The  residuary	power lies with the  Parliament	 (<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_122">Art.	248</a>,

legislative  power  of	the State  nor	with  its  executive

Ministers,   while  remaining  in  office,  would   set	  up
Commissions  of	 Inquiry for enquiring	into  their  alleged
misdeeds  even	if it is assumed that this is  possible,  it
does  not  lead	 to  the  conclusion  that  their  power  is
exclusive  and excludes the power of the Central  Government
under  the  Act.  There is nothing in  the  Constitution  to
indicate  that	the power of the State	Legislature  or	 the

appointed by the Central Government to inquire into the same
matter for which a commission had already been set up by the
State  Government  is violative of<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_134"> s. 3(1)</a> (b) of  the	Act.
The notification of the State Government has not, in  terms,
appointed any commission for inquiring into the matter-,  of
alleged	  corruption,	nepotism,   favouritism	  and	mal-
administration	of the Chief Minister or any other  Minister
of the Government.  The items referred to for inquiry by the
State  Commission were "irregularities committed  or  excess
payments  made	in certain matters  relating  to  contracts,
grant of loan, allotment of sites, purchase IT of furniture,
disposal  of foodgrains, etc." In none of those clauses,  is
it  mentioned as to the person responsible for	the  alleged
irregularities or maladministration.  There is no  reference
to  any alleged misconduct, corruption or  maladministration
of  the Chief Minister or any other Minister.  In  contrast,
the  terms  of reference in the notification issued  by	 the
Centre is to enquire into the specific matters enumerated in
Annexure  I, one of which is covered by the notification  of
the  State  Government.	 In regard to  specific	 matters  in
Annexture II, there may be some common matters which are the
subject-matter	of enquiry by the State Government.  but  in
regard to matters in Annexure II, the notification in  clear
terms excludes any matter covered by the notification of the
State  Government.  The Commission appointed by the  Central
Government,  therefore, would he competent to  exclude	such
matters from the purview, of its enquiry. [137 E-F]

1(a)  The  suit is maintainable.  When the exercise  of	 the

interfered with by the Central Government, it cannot be said
that  the legal right of the State is not affected. [168  G;

According  to  the impugned notification the  Commission  of
Inquiry	 was appointed for the purpose of making an  inquiry
into a definite matter of public importance, namely, charges
of  corruption, nepotism, favouritism and misuse of  govern-
mental power levelled against the Chief Minister and certain
other Ministers ,of the State.	Therefore, the scope of	 the
inquiry-  would	 inevitably involve the functioning  of	 the

relates	 to the functioning of the State in exercise of	 the
powers	conferred under the Constitution and so. the  States
legal rights are affected. [166 D-F]

</p><p id="p_44">(c)  The  Government  of  India	 Act,  1858,  provided	only
absolute imperial control without any popular  participation
in the administration. The Government of India Act 1919, for
the  first time introduced dyarchy in the Provinces.   Under
this Act the Provinces were delegates of the Centre and	 the
Central	 legislature retained the power to legislate on	 any
subject	 for  the whole of India.  The Government  of  India
Act, 1935 changed the unitary nature of the Government under
the 1919 Act into a federal structure and made the Provinces
as  units.  The 1935 Act divided legislative powers  between
the centre and the provinces; the Federal list comprising of
subjects  over which the federal legislature  had  exclusive
powers	of  legislation, the Provincial List  comprising  of
subjects   over	 which	the  Provincial	  legislatures	 had
exclusive jurisdiction and the Concurrent List comprising of
subjects   over	 which	both  the  Federal  and	  Provincial
legislatures had power to make laws.  Under the Constitution
the  States,  in several respects, are	subordinate  to	 the
Central	 Government in that the formation of the  federation
was not as a result of any treaty between the States and the
Federation.  There are various features of the	Constitution
which  make it strictly not federal.  It has variously	been
described as quasifederal or federal in structure or federal
system	with  a	 strong	 central bias.	 In  the  scheme  of
distribution  of  powers between the Union and	the  States,
there  is  a strong tilt in favour of the  Union.   For	 the
purpose	 of  settling disputes between the  Centre  and	 the
States a machinery is also provided for in the ,Constitution
itself. [140 C; 141 C; 142]
</p><p id="p_45">(d)  In determining what the respective powers of the Centre
and  the States are, one has to look into the  Constitution.
Since  the  States  are not the	 delegates  of	the  Central
Government  and	 the source of power both for the  Union  as
well  as  the  States being  the  Constitution	itself,	 the
Central Government cannot exercise any power over the States
which is not provided for in the Constitution.	There is  no
overriding power with the Union Government. [143 <a href="/doc/128161/" id="a_135">B]

</p><p id="p_49">(b)  The well accepted basic principles of  construction  of
the Constitution as laid down by decided cases are that when
a  question arises whether the prescribed limit	 shave	been
exceeded, the only way in which it can be done is by looking
into the terms of the instrument by which affirmatively	 the
legislative powers were	 created  and  by  which  negatively
they  are restricted.  If what has been done is	 legislation
within the general scope of the affirmative words which give
the  power,  and  if  it  violates  no	express	 conditioner
restriction by which	 that  power is limited, it  is	 not
for  any Court of justice to inquire further or	 to  enlarge
constructively those conditions and restrictions.If the text
is  explicit  the  text is conclusive.	 When  the  text  is
ambiguous, recourse must be had to the context and scheme of
the  Act.  Yet another well-accepted aid to construction  is
that   the  history  which  lies  behind  an  enactment	  is
admissible  because  to	 find out the meaning  of  the	law,
recourse  may legitimately be had to the prior state of	 the
law, the evil sought to be remedied and the process by which
the law was evolved. [150 H; 151 A]
</p><p id="p_50">(i)The	golden rule of interpretation that  in	construing
words  in a Constitution conferring legislative	 power,	 the
most  liberal  construction should be put  upon	 the  words,
admits	of certain exceptions.	If it is found necessary  to
prevent	 conflict  between  two	 exclusive  jurisdictions  a
restricted  meaning may be given to the words.	Further,  in
interpreting  the words of a statute the main object  is  to
ascertain  the intention expressed by the words	 used,	that
is, to ascertain "the intention of them that made it."	[154

ORIGINAL JURISDICTION : Original Suit No. 8 of 1977.
L.   N. Sinha, R. N. Byra Reddy, Adv.  Genl., S. C. Agarwal,

S.   N.	 Kacker, Solicitor General, Soli J. Sorabjee,  Add1.

Chandra, for Defendant No. 1.
</p><p id="p_63">The following Judgments were delivered by
BEG, C.J.-"India, that is Bharat, shall be union of States'.
The  very  first  mandate  of  the  first  article  of	 our
Constitution  to which we owe allegiance thus prohibits,  by
necessary  implication,	 according to the plaintiff  in	 the
original  suit	now  before  us under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_157">Article	131</a>  of	 the
Constitution  of India, any  constitutionally  unjustifiable
trespass  by  the Union Government upon the  domain  of	 the
powers	of  the	 States.   The	State  of  Karnataka,	has,
therefore, sued for a declaration that it notification dated
23-5-1977   (hereinafter   referred  to	 as   ,rho   Central
Notification)  constituting  a	Commission  of	Inquiry	  in
purported  exercise  of its powers under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_158">Section  3</a>  of	 the
Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as
'the Act'), is illegal and ultravirus.	This declaration  is
sought on one of two alternative grounds : firstly, that the
<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_159">Commissions  of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952, does not  "authorise	 the
Central Government to constitute a Commission of Inquiry  in
regard	to matters falling exclusively within the sphere  of
the State's legislative and executive power", and, secondly,
that  if  the  provisions of the Act do	 cover	the  Central
Government   Notification,   they   are	  ultra-vires	 for
contravention  of "the terms of the Constitution as well  as
the federal structure implicit and accepted as an inviolable
basic  feature of the Constitution".   Consequentially,	 the
plaintiff  seeks  a  perpetual injunction  to  restrain	 the
respondents,  the Union of India and Shri A. N. Grover,	 the
one-man Commission of Inquiry into "  charges of corruption,
nepotism,  favouritism	and misuse  of	Governmental  power,
against the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the  State
of  Karnataka", from acting under the  Central	Government's
notification.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">21</span>
<p id="p_64">The plaintiff State's case is : that, the Congress Party was
returned  by the electors by a majority at an election	held
in  the	 State	in  1972; that the  majority  party  in	 the
legislature  elected Shri Devraj Urs as its leader who	then
formed	his  Government as required by <a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_160">Article	163</a>  of	 the
Constitution;  that, the Government thus installed, by	what
must  be  deemed to be the will and decision  of  the  State
Legislature,  continues	 to  enjoy  the	 confidence  of	 the
legislature and is in office; that, in the recent Lok  Sabha
elections,  the	 Congress party headed by  Shri	 Devrai	 Urs
achieved  a  resounding success by having won 26 out  of  28
seats  so  that the Janata party, which is in power  at	 the
Centre,	 must  be  deemed  to  have  been  rejected  by	 the
electorate, but it is indirectly, through the appointment of
a  Central  Commission of Inquiry trying  to  discredit	 the
Congress  Party and its leaders in the State  of  Karnataka,
and,  thereby, interfering with the democratic machinery  of
control	 and  supervision  of the Government  of  the  State
provided by the Constitution itself.
</p><p id="p_65">On  26th April, 1977, the Union Home Minister sent a  letter
to  the	 Chief	Minister  of  the  State  communicating	 the
allegations  contained in a Memorandum submitted by  certain
members	 of  the  opposition party in  the  Karnataka  State
Legislatures and asked him to make his comments.  The  Chief
Minister  gave a reply dated 13th May, 1977 a copy of  which
was attached to the plaint.
</p><p id="p_66">The Chief Minister, in his reply, complains that "slanderous
propaganda  has been unleashed without any  verification  of
the truth or otherwise of the allegations or past history of
most  of  the charges".	 He points out that  broadcasts	 and
press reports had given him an intimation of the allegations
sent  to him even before they were received by him with	 the
Home  Minister's letter.  The Chief Minister said :  "It  is
reasonable  to presume that the object of this	campaign  of
slander	 is  mainly  to tarnish the image  of  the  Congress
party,	my  colleagues and myself in an effort to  gain,  if
possible,  power  for your party in  the  State	 immediately
after  your party was totally rejected by the electorate  of
the   State  in	 the  recent  Lok  Sabha  elections".	 The
insinuation was that the whole object of manipulated charges
against	 the  Chief  Minister  was to  vilify  him  and	 his
Government  and to bring him down in the estimation  of	 the
public so as to destroy the support which the Congress party
had  from the people of the State. it was thus a  charge  of
malice in fact.
</p><p id="p_67">The Chief Minister also admitted, in his letter to the Union
Home  said to be embodied in our Constitution and  described
them  as  "the comer-stone of national	unity  and  national
integrity". He asserted : "the constitution is the source of
all power for the various organs of the Centre and the State
and  all actions and exercise of all power under any of	 the
statutes  either by the Centre or by the State must  conform
to  and	 be subordinated to the scheme	of  distribution  of
powers, legislative and executive, under the Federal  Scheme
of the Constitution".
</p><p id="p_68">The Chief Minister also admitted in his letter to the  Union
Home Minister, that the Constitution "in certain exceptional
circumstances pro-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">22</span>
<p id="p_69">vides  for  the	 Centre making inroads	into  the  exclusive
domain	of  the State Legislature or the  State	 executive".
But,   lie  denied  that  the	exceptional   circumstances,
expressly provided for in the Constitution, for interference
by the Centre, existed in the instant case.
Evidently,  the Chief Minister meant that there was no	room
for  invoking the emergency provisions under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_161">Article 356</a>  of
the  Constitution which provides for the assumption  by	 the
President of India of any of the functions of the Government
and  by the Union Parliament of the functions of  the  State
Legislature, provided "the President is satisfied on receipt
of a report from the Governor of a State or Otherwise that a
situation  has arisen in which the Government of  the  State
cannot be carried on in terms of the Constitution".
The Chief Minister also invokes the aid of the principles of
democracy which, according to him, permeate the whole scheme
of the Constitution, so that Chief Ministers and other State
Ministers  can	be  called  to account	only  by  the  State
Legislature to which they are responsible.  He asserted that
"the Cabinet system of Government is a basic feature of	 the
Indian Constitution".  This implies, according to him,	that
all  control  over ministerial actions vests  in  the  State
Legislatures only and not in the Union Government,  subject,
of course, to exceptions expressly provided.  With regard to
the actions of the State Government, he complained that	 the
assumption of inquisitorial or supervisory functions by	 the
Union Government at the instance of "an extra constitutional
agency,	 however high, would destroy the basic character  of
the   Cabinet  system  of  Government  and  would  rob	 the
legislature   of   the	State  and  its	  people,   of	 the
constitutionally guaranteed right of having a Government  of
their choice subject to their control".	 He claimed that the
State had exclusive right to investigate charges relating to
matters falling "within exclusive domain of the State  under
the  Constitution".   He  warned  against  the	dangers	  to
national  interest  by undue interference with	the  federal
scheme contemplated by the Constitution.
The Chief Minister, after having emphatically asserted	what
he conceived to be the object of the proceedings against him
and  his  constitutional rights, very  properly	 offered  to
place all the material having a bearing upon the 36  charges
out of which he admitted that 23 related to him.  He offered
to clear himself of these charges. lie pointed out that 4 of
the charges related to his colleagues and had been discussed
in the legislature.  He also said that 3 charges had already
been  enquired into by the former Prime Minister.   He	said
that  be  did not want these to be reopened.  He  cited	 the
speech of Shri Om Mehta, a former Minister of State, in	 the
Lok  Sabha, on 5th May 1976, where it was stated  that	some
memoranda   bad	  been	sent,  containing   allegations	  of
corruption  and	 misuse	 of power  made	 against  the  Chief
Minister and other ministers of Karnataka by some members of
the Legislative Assembly, as long ago as 1973.	According to
that  statement, there were 99 allegations out of  which  16
concerned  the	Chief Minister personally.  Shri  Mehta	 was
said to have declared that the allegations against the Chief
Minister  were	found to lack substance	 after	the  settled
procedure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">23</span>
of  inviting  comments from the Chief  Minister	 Iliad	been
observed.   The	 Chief Minister then dealt  at	considerable
length with the individual charges.
</p><p id="p_70">In the plaint before us, it was pointed out that charges  of
the  nature  now referred to the one man Commission  by	 the
Central	 Government had been made over since 1972  elections
both on the floor of the Legislature and elsewhere.  It also
said that they had been explained and answered on the  floor
of   the   Legislature	repeatedly.   The   Chief   Minister
complained that the same allegations had been repeated after
a new Government had assumed office at the Centre.
It  was also asserted in the plaint that, in order to  allay
any suspicion in the 'minds of the public in-the State, and,
in  view  of the continued agitation for a  judicial  probe,
and,  in accordance with the highest and best traditions  of
Government, the State Government, by a notification, dated 1
8th  May,  1977,  appointed a Commission  of  Inquiry  under
<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_162">Section	 3(1)</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry Act,  1952.	  'A
copy  of  the  notification  of	 the  State  Government	 was
attached to the complaint.  It was alleged that a copy of it
had also been sent to the Home Minister ,on 18th May, 1977.
One  of the submissions by the plaintiff is that  the  State
Government notification dated 18th May, 1977, appointing its
own   Commission  to  inquire  into  all  the  matters	 and
irregularities,	 to  which additions could be  made  and  of
which further particulars could be provided, covers all that
could  be enquired into by the Grover Commission  under	 the
notification  dated  23rd  May,	 1977,	which	specifically
excludes  matters  covered  by	the  Karnataka	Government's
notification  dated 18th May, 1977.  Reliance is  placed  on
proviso	 (b) to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_163">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act which prohibits	 the
Central	 Government from appointing another Commission "  to
inquire	 into  the  same matter for so	long  as  Commission
appointed by the State Government is functioning, unless the
Central	 Government,  is of opinion that the  scope  of	 the
inquiry should be extended to two or more States".
The written statement filed on behalf of the Union of  India
raises	2 preliminary objections as follows  before_replying
seriatim  to the paragraphs in the plaint.  The	 preliminary
objections are :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	      "1. The suit by the State of Karnataka is	 not
	      maintainable   inasmuch	as   the    impugned
	      notification  S.O. No. 365(E) dated  23rd	 May
	      1977  constituting the Commission	 of  inquiry
	      does  not	 affect	 the  plaintiff-State.	  By
	      impugned notification a Commission of  Inquiry
	      under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_164">section 3</a> of the Commissions of  Inquiry
	      Act,  1952,  has	been  constituted  for	 the
	      purpose of making an inquiry into the  charges
	      of   corruption,	nepotism,  favouritism	 and
	      misuse of Governmental power against the Chief
	      Minister and certain other Minister',; of	 the
	      State Karnataka specified in the notification.
	      The inquiry is against the Chief Minister	 and
	      certain other Ministers as individuals and not
	      against  the State of Karnataka.	The  inquiry
	      is rather
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">	      24</span>
	      in the interest of State that such corruption,
	      nepotism, favouritism should not exist in	 the
	      State.  The State of Karnataka is not directly
	      interested in the inquiry proposed to be	held
	      against  the Chief Minister and certain  other
	      Ministers	 of  the  State.   The	 individuals
	      occupying	 the  office of Chief  Minister	 and
	      Ministers are distinct from the State it".
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      2.<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_165">Article 131</a> of the Constitution of India
	      gives  original jurisdiction to  the  Hon'ble,
	      Supreme  Court  in  any  dispute	between	 the
	      Government  of  India and one or	more  States
	      etc., if the dispute involves any question  of
	      law  or fact or which the existence or  extent
	      of  a  legal right depends.   There  being  no
	      dispute  between the Government of  India	 and
	      the  State,  the	suit  is  not  maintainable.
	      There is no legal right of the plaintiff-State
	      to Me the present suit."
</blockquote><p id="p_71">The  Union  of	India  denied that the	matters	 now  to  be
enquired  into	by  the	 Grover	 Commission  constituted   a
resuscitation of previous charges and allegations which	 had
been  disposed	of.  Mala fides in the	institution  of	 the
Commission  of	Inquiry	 is denied.   The  validity  of	 all
provisions  of the Act is staunchly defended.	The  Inquiry
ordered	 by the Central Government is, its  asserted,  quite
competent   and	  not  covered	by  the	  State	  Government
notification.	It  is	denied that the	 federal  scheme  or
democratic  principles	embodied in the Constitution  are  '
affected  by the institution of a Commission of	 Inquiry  of
the  kirict  set  up.	It is  submitted  that	the  Central
Government  Commission of Inquiry was ordered to  enable  an
appropriate and completely impartial fact finding process to
take  place  so that either the Central	 Government  or	 any
other  authority  or  even members of  the  public  may,  in
accordance with democratic principles, act in a manner which
is  constitutionally  proper and fully	justified.   In	 any
case,  the  conduct of the Chief Minister of  a	 State	with
regard	to affairs of State and the manner in which he	used
his  official position were, according to Union	 Government,
matters	  of  public  importance  into	which  the   Central
Government  was	 quite	competent to  order  impartial	fact
finding inquiries in public interest.
</p><p id="p_72">On  the	 above set of pleadings, the following	issues	were
framed this Court :
</p><p id="p_73">"1.  Is the suit maintainable ?
</p><p id="p_74">2.   Is the impugned notification ultra vires the powers  of
the Central Government under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_166">section 3</a> of the Commissions of
Inquiry Act ?
</p><p id="p_75">3.   If	 <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_167">Section 3</a> of the Commission of Inquiry	 Act  autho-
rises	the  Central  Government  to  issue   the   impugned
notification, is the Section itself unconstitutional
An  important  preliminary question to be decided,  for	 the
reasons	 already indicated, concerns the nature of  the	 two
inquiries,  one the State Government and another  instituted
by  the Central Government.  If the two notifications  cover
substantially "the same matter", it may
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">25</span>
not  be necessary to deal with other questions at all.	 The
parties have very fully argued their cases on this  question
even  through no separate or specific issue has been  framed
on it.	Both the parties have raised this issue specifically
in their pleadings.  They have argued on the assumption that
a decision on it is implied in the trial of other issues  in
the  case.  We will, therefore, take it up first  separately
as  a  preliminary question which we  should  decide  before
taking	up other matters in issue.  A determination of	this
question  has  an important bearing on	matters	 argued	 for
purposes of deciding each of the three issues framed  above.
Even if the question was not directly or indirectly involved
in the decision of each of the three issues framed above,  a
decision on it seems necessary for clearing the ground for a
correct	 approach to the whole case.  It is certainly not  a
question  we could abstain from deciding simply	 because  no
specific  issue was framed separately on it at	the  outset.
Although, in view of the fact that the question has been put
in  issue  and so understood and very fully  argued  by	 the
parties,  a separate and specific issue need not  be  framed
upon  it, yet, because of the crucial importance of  it,  we
formulate it now separately and specifically as follows : Do
both  the State and the Central Government inquiries  relate
to  the	 'same matter within the meaning of proviso  (b)  to
<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_168">Section	 3(1)</a>  of  the Act so as to bar an  inquiry  by	 the
Central or Union Government so long as the State  Commission
is  functioning?  The State Government's notification  dated

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_30">The  first thing that strikes one, on a bare reading of	 the
two  notifications is that, whereas the	 State	Notification
seems  scrupulously to avoid any mention of  any  particular
act  or part of any individual whatsoever, the whole  object
of  the	 Central  Government notification  seems  to  be  to
inquire into the correctness of the allegations made against
the  Chief  Minister  of  the  State  principally  and	into
allegations    against	  other	   specified	 individuals
incidentally.  The objects and subject matter of the Central
Government   notification  become  clearer  by	looking	  at
Annexures  1 and 2 of it giving particulars of	transactions
:to be investigated.  The first five items of Annexure 1 and
separate transactions in each of which the Chief Minister of
the  State is himself alleged to have played  the  principal
role   in   such  a  way  as  to  indicate   his   exclusive
responsibility.	  In  other transactions, such as  in  items
,10,  1	 1  and 13, the Chief Minister is  shown  as  having
participated   with   ,Others.	 And,	in   the   remaining
transactions  mentioned,  the allegations do not  place	 the
responsibility	on any particular individual, but they	seem
designed to elicit the truth of allegations of	favouritism,
nepotism,  and	misuse	of  power  against  whoever  may  be
responsible.	Annexure   2  of  the	Central	  Government
notification  begins  by a statement which  shows  that	 its
object	is to determine whether the Chief Minister  or	,any
other Minister of the Government of the State of Karnataka,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">36</span>
indulged in nepotism, favouritism, or misuse of Governmental
powers in a number of transactions which are listed as items
1  to  25 there.  On the other hand,  the  State  Government
notification,  without mentioning the persons who  might  be
responsible  for  any  excessive or  improper  payments,  or
favouritism, or misappropriation, or irregularity,  mentions
certain contracts in favour of various companies, or parties
under  32  heads.   It then states, as a  separate  item  of
inquiry, the question as to who were the persons responsible
in  the lapses, if any, mentioned earlier.  In other  words,
apart from their parts in certain lapses the  responsibility
of  the	 Chief	Minister  or  any  other  Minister  of	 the
Government  of Karnataka could not be inquired into  by	 the
Commission appointed under the State notification.  And, all
that the State notification seems to empower its  Commission
to enquire into, with regard to transactions mentioned there
is  whether there was any excessive payment or	irregularity
involved.   Hence, it speaks of responsibility for  "lapses"
</blockquote><p id="p_137">as  though  one	 could assume that there  was  no  dishonest
motive.	 The emphasis, in the State notification, is on	 the
question  of observance or non-observance of  rules  coupled
with  the  question whether certain  payments  were  proper.
And,  the  question  of	 affixation  of	 responsibility	  is
confined  to  "lapses" in the course of	 these	transactions
only.
</p><p id="p_138">Even if a transaction has been made completely in accordance
with  the  rules,  it  may,  nevertheless,  be	an  act	  of
favouritism  tainted  with corruption or  dishonesty.	Less
deserving parties could be deliberately preferred over	more
deserving parties in much transactions.	 It is not difficult
to  make out compliance with the rules or to show  on  paper
that the most deserving party has received the benefit of  a
contract.  Indeed, even the post deserving party may receive
a  contract  or	 a  benefit under  a  decision	taken  by  a
Government or its Ministers who may have received an illegal
gratification  for  it	without	 anything  what	 so   ',ever
appearing  on the records of the Government about the  bribe
received by the Minister, concerned.  Hence, in addition  to
the  fact that the items mentioned in the two  notifications
mostly	do not tally with each other, it appears to us	that
the  objects  of  the State notification do  not  go  beyond
investigation  into  the illegality or irregularity  of	 any
transaction  and "responsibility" only of persons  concerned
to  point  out what they were.	If one may so  put  it,	 the
State notification is meant to set up a Commission which has
to inquire whether the veil worn by certain transactions  is
correct	 in  form  and	covers it  fully,  but	the  Central
Government  notification  is  clearly meant  to	 enable	 the
Commission appointed to tear down even the veil of  apparent
legality   and	regularity  which  may	be  worn   by	some
transactions.	It  authorises	the  Grover  Commission	  to
inquire into and discover the reality or substance, if	any,
behind	certain (mostly other) transactions.  The object  of
the  Central Government notification seems clearly not	only
to affix responsibility for transactions mentioned there  on
individuals  who may be really guilty even if a few of	them
could be said to have been mentioned in both  notifications.
We  do	not think that such notifications  would  justly  or
fairly	be  spoken  of as covering  "the  same	matter",  as
contemplated  by  proviso (b) to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_174">Section 3(1)</a>  of  the	Act,
because the
3 7
State  Commission is there to examine the appearance or	 the
surface whereas the Central Commission is expected to  delve
deeper into what could only lie behind or below it.
It  is	certainly a matter for concern to a  State  if	some
irregularity   or  illegality  has  been  committed   in   a
particular  transaction	 by its Government  or	a  Minister.
But, it would obviously be more helpful to determine why  it
has been committed.  And, it should be still more  important
for  it	 to find out who, however highly placed,  is  really
responsible  for  the commission of  that  irregularity	 and
whether	 any  dishonesty or corruption has operated  at	 the
highest	 levels in the State even if the form is proper	 and
regular.   If  the State notification shows no	concern	 for
what seem to us to be the much more important objects of the
Central	 Government  notification, one could  perhaps  guess
that the indifference of the State towards the more  serious
matters	  is  not  without  some  object  or   significance.
Nevertheless, we do not propose to pass any judgment on	 the
motives	 of the State Government or the fact that  the	most
important  or significant features of what has been  alleged
against	 the  Chief Minister and members of  his  Government
have been left out by the State Government notification even
if  the object of that notification was quite  bonafide	 and
proper so far as it went. We  think, however,  that  the
State notification does not go far enough. But,	       the
Central Government notification does proceed further. It
squarely  levels charges against persons who,  according  to
the allegations made, may have acted in a manner which makes
them not only theoretically responsible but actually  guilty
of corruption.
</p><p id="p_139">For  the success of the policies of any State or  Government
in  it, in any part of the country over which its  authority
runs,  it should be shown to be capable of carrying out	 the
constitutional	 mandates  contained  in  Part	IV  of	 the
Directive Principles of State Policy so as to make the basic
human  rights guaranteed by our Constitution a	reality	 and
Dot  a mirage.	That, for the masses of our people,  is	 the
basic  purpose	of the whole Constitution  which  cannot  be
allowed to be frustrated.  If the basic rights of the people
are not to be stultified and to appear chimerical, those  in
charge	of the affairs of the State, at the highest  levels,
must be above suspicion.  This is only possible if their own
bona fides and utterly unquestionable integrity are  assured
and  apparent  in the context of the high  purposes  of	 our
Constitution  and  the	dire needs  of	our  poverty  strike
masses.	  We cannot view allegations of corruption  lightly.
We  think that the interests of the States and of the  Union
are  not antithetical when there are charges  of  corruption
and misuse of power against those in authority anywhere.  To
serve  the  common interests of the whole people,  on  whose
behalf	our  Constitution speaks, the States and  the  Union
cannot	stand  apart.  They must stand	together  united  in
purpose and action.  It is as important that unjustified and
malicious  attacks and charges	against individuals in	high
places	should	be  unmasked and  the  reality	behind	them
exposed	 for  what  it is worth, as  it	 is  that  justified
complaints  must find adequate means of redress so that	 the
interests  of the dumb millions of our country men are	duly
safeguarded against unscrupulousness wherever found.  If, as
we  find in this case, the State notification is meant	only
to  superficially  scratch the surface	of  the	 allegations
made,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">38</span>
whereas	 the  Central Government notification  is  meant  to
probe into the crux or the heart of what may or may not have
gone wrong with the body politic in the State of  Karnataka,
we  could not be too technical or astute in finding  reasons
to  hold  that the subject matter of the  two  enquiries  is
substantially the same.	 Obviously, this could not really be
so.   A	 bare reading of the two notifications, set  out  in
full above, shows that.
</p><p id="p_140">In  the circumstances of this case, it may be more  graceful
for  the Chief Minister of the State of Karnataka  to  waive
his  technical objections, as he seems to do in	 undertaking
to place all the material before whichever commission may be
found  to have jurisdiction to inquire into the	 allegations
made  against  him.   He  could	 take  the  opportunity	  to
honourably  face and repel the charges which,  according  to
him, have been repeatedly but Unjustifiably and	 maliciously
made against him over a sufficiently long period.  He  could
thus  be able to establish that he is serving the  interests
of  his State, its inhabitants, and, indeed, of the  country
as a whole, if his assertions are correct.
</p><p id="p_141">The  plaintiff	has not suggested anywhere that	 the  Grover
Commission  is	not  presided  ever  by	 an  individual	  of
unquestionable	integrity  and independence who has  been  a
Judge  of this Court., Mr. Lal Narain Sinha,  appearing	 for
the plaintiff, has, very frankly and properly, conceded that
he cannot successfully press want of bona fides on the	part
of the Central Government in issuing its notification.	This
means  that  the question whether the Commission  is  either
unnecessary,  except  as a weapon of political	warfare,  as
well  as any doubts about whether it could be or was  to  be
misused	 in this case, must be dismissed  as  unsustainable.
The  State  Government must itself be deemed to	 admit	that
circumstances necessitated the appointment of a	 Commission,
by  appointing	its own, to inquire into  analogous  matters
which deserved investigation due to their public importance.
We  find  that the Central  Government	notification  itself
excludes from its purview those charges which may be  fairly
said  to fall within the scope of the Commission set  up  by
the  State  Government.	 We are not concerned  with  matters
which may be subsequently added so as to expand the scope of
inquiry	 by  the  State	 Commission.   We  think  that	 the
provisions  of proviso (b) to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_175">Section 3(1)</a> of the  Act	will
prevent the State Government from adding such matters as are
already covered by the Central Government notification.	 We,
however,  leave	 it  to	 the  Grover  Commission  itself  to
determine,  whenever  it is faced with	such  an  objection,
whether	 a  particular	matter	is  already  being  properly
enquired into by the State Commission.
</p><p id="p_142">In view of what we have observed above, it would perhaps  be
proper for the Government of Karnataka itself to withdraw it
sown  notification if it thinks that certain members of	 the
State  Government  will be unduly embarrassed by  having  to
face inquiries by two Commissions on matters which may	have
some connections or even some common areas.  Indeed, to	 get
to   the  heart	 of  a	transaction,  its   surrounding	  or
superficial shell, which is all that the State Commission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">39</span>
can inquire into with regard to some transactions, may	have
to,  be	 pierced, or, to some degree, traversed	 before	 the
core of these transactions can be reached.  As we hold	that
the two notifications authorise inquiries into matters which
are  substantially  different  in  nature  and	object,	 the
enquiry by the Grover Commission cannot be said to be barred
by reason of the State Government notification under proviso
</p><p id="p_143">(b)  to <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_176">Section 3</a> (1) of the Act, even if, in order to	deal
with the substantially different subject matter, in view  of
the  divergence	 in objects certain areas of fact  or  rules
governing transaction may be common.  If the objectives	 are
different  the examination of common areas of fact  and	 law
for different purposes will still be permissible.
Without	 doubting  the motives of the  State  Government  in
appointing  its own Commission perhaps we may observe  that,
in  a  case involving charges of the kind made	against	 the
Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State, it would be
better	if the State's own Commission did not even  remotely
appear	to  have  been set up merely in	 anticipation  of  a
thorough investigation by an outside Central authority which
would, presumably, appear more impartial and objective,	 or,
to  impede  or	embarrass the  proceedings  of	the  Central
Government Commission.	Such doubts as could arise on  these
grounds	 will be dispelled by the, withdrawal of  the  State
notification.	Although  the prompt action  toy  the  State
Government  may	 seem  quite commendable  and  bonafide,  in
appointing   its   own	Commission  in	 the   context	 and
circumstances  disclosed above, its continued existence	 may
not  give  exactly that impression after what we  have	held
above  on  an analysis of the apparent objects	of  the	 two
Commissions judged by the contents of the two notifications.
In  any	 case, the subject matter, not	being  substantially
same,  the Central Government Commission could proceed	with
its investigations if other objections, which we now proceed
to  examine,  are not really fatal to the  validity  of	 the
Central Government's notification.
</p><p id="p_144">Those  other  objections  to the  validity  of	the  Central
Government's notification may be summarised as follows :
Firstly,  it  is submitted that express	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution relating to the federal structure, distribution
of  executive and legislative powers between the  State	 and
the  Union,  joint responsibility of a	State's	 Council  of
Ministers,  conditions under which they can bold  office  or
may  be dismissed, the State Legislatures exclusive  control
over  their  actions  and conduct of affairs  of  the  State
Government, are infringed by it, so that, if all this  could
be done, under the clock of the powers conferred by  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_177">Section
3</a>  of the Act, by the Central Government, this provision  of
the  Act  is, pro tanto, invalid.  Secondly,  and  following
logically  and	naturally from the set of  propositions,  as
their  necessary consequence, the  notification	 constitutes
violations by the Central Government of what must be held to
be parts of the basic features or the basic structure of the
Constitution  which do not permit the destruction of  either
federalism or democracy by issuing executive fiats.   Third-
ly,  carrying  the  logic  of  the  last  mentioned  set  of
submissions  a step further, it is urged that, as the  basic
features  of the Constitution have been 'held by this  Court
to be outside the procedure for amendment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">40</span>
contained  in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_178">Article 368</a> of the Constitution, it  must,  a
fortiori,  be held to be outside the legislative  competence
of Parliament as contemplated by Articles 245-255 in Part XI
of the Constitution read with provisions of the	 Legislative
Lists  in  Schedule  7. Fourthly, it is	 suggested,  in	 the
alternative,  that, in any case, a necessary implication  of
the express provisions of the Constitution is that a control
by the Union Government. over the day-to-day working of	 the
Governments in the States by the adoption of the legislative
procedure  found in Part Xi of the Constitution must have  a
result	which  can  only be  achieved  by  a  Constitutional
amendment under <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_179">Article 368</a> of the Constitution' Fifthly, it
is  submitted that even if interference with the day to	 day
working	 of the Governmental machinery in the States is	 not
barred by the basic structure of the Constitution, yet,	 the
situations  in which such interference is  warranted  having
been specifically laid down in the emergency	  provisions
contained  in  Articles 352-360 found in Part XVIII  of	 the
Constitution,  any  other  mode of  interference,  with	 the
operations  of State Governments, not expressly provided  by
the  Constitution itself, must be deemed to be	outside	 the
ordinary legislative competence of Parliament.	Sixthly, the
plaintiff's  counsel  submitted	 that,	in  any	 event,	 the
provisions  of the Act must be so construed or	interpreted,
by   reading  them  down  if  necessary,  as   to   preclude
interference by the Union Government with the operations  of
the State Government or the conduct of its Ministers keeping
in view all the submissions mentioned above.
It  is	true  that learned counsel for	the  plaintiff	kept
reverting  to  what he really meant to put  forward  as	 the
basic  or inviolable features of the Constitution,  yet,  he
felt  reluctant to unequivocally commit himself to the	view
that  the  Act	contained  provisions  which  constituted  a
violation  of the basic structure of the Constitution  which
has  been  held to include both	 Democracy  and	 Federalism.
Apparently,  this  somewhat shifting position arose  from  a
realisation that the Act may, have very little, if  anything
at  all,  to do with provisions meant to  ensure  Democratic
Government, and that our Constitution has, despite  whatever
federalism  may	 be  found in  its  structure,	so  strongly
unitary features also in it that, when the totality of these
provisions  is	examined,  it becomes  difficult  to  assert
confidently   how  much	 federalism  such   a	Constitution
contains,  whether those parts of it which seem to  override
the federal elements of our Constitution are not more  basic
or significant than what is described as its federalism, and
whether	  possible  actions  under  the	 Act,  intended	  to
authorise  investigation, presumably with a view to  finding
remedies,  into	 whatever dishonesty or	 corruption  may  be
discovered  in	the  conduct  of  governmental	affairs	  by
Ministers, are not really meant to safeguard or help  rather
than to destroy	 or hinder democratic government.
It  is	interesting  to note what  Sir	Gyril  Salmon,	Lord
Justice	 of  Appeal.  said  in a  lecture  on  Tribunals  of
Inquiry".
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_31">	      "In  all countries, certainly in	those  which
	      enjoy  freedom  of speech and  a	free  Press,
	      moments  occur  when allegations	and  rumours
	      circulate	 causing  a  nation-wide  crisis  of
	      confidence in the integrity of public life  or
	      about other matters
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">	      41</span>
	      of  vital	 public importance.  No	 doubt	this
	      rarely  happens,	but  when  it  does  it	  is
	      essential	 that  public confidence  should  be
	      restored, for without it no democracy can long
	      survive.	 This confidence can be	 effectively
	      restored only by thoroughly investigating	 and
	      probing  the rumours and allegations so as  to
	      search out and establish the truth.  The truth
	      may  show that the evil exists, thus  enabling
	      it  to  be  rooted out, or that  there  is  no
	      foundation  in the rumours and allegations  by
	      which  the  public  has  been  disturbed.	  In
	      either case, confidence is restored".
</blockquote><p id="p_145">In the lecture mentioned above, it was pointed out that	 the
Tribunal  of  Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921,  was  passed  in
England	  to   displace	 the  procedure	 by   which   Select
Parliamentary  Committees were used "to investigate  alleged
wrongdoing  in	high places".  About  the  Select  Committee
procedure  he  said : "Such a method of investigation  by  a
political  tribunal  was  wholly  unsatisfactory.   Being  a
progressive  people it took us only little more	 than  about
300 years to do anything about it.  In the United States  of
America,  however, which is still more progressive  than  we
are,   they   still   use   virtually	the   same   method.
Congressional	Committees   of	 investigation,	  like	 our
Parliamentary  committees, consist of  members	representing
the relative strength of the majority and minority  parties.
Clearly	 such bodies can never be free from party  political
influences.   This  is a very real defect  in  any  tribunal
investigating allegations of public  misconduct-particularly
as  the	 subject  matter of the	 inquiry  often	 has  highly
charged political overtones." He observed : "The history  of
such  investigations in England by Parliamentary  committees
is, to say the least, unfortunate.  Let me give you but	 one
example.   Early in the present century there occurred	what
became	known  as  the Marconi Scandal.	 In  1912  the	Post
Master General in a Liberal Government accepted a tender  by
the  English Marconi Company for the construction of  State-
owned  wireless	 telegraph stations throughout	the  Empire.
There  followed widespread rumours that the  Government	 had
corruptly  favoured  the Marconi Company  and  that  certain
prominent members of the Government had improperly  profited
by  the	 transaction.  The  Select  Parliamentary  Committee
appointed  to  investigate  these  rumours  represented	 the
respective   strengths	of  the	 Liberal  and	Conservative
Parties.  The majority report of the Liberal members of	 the
Committee exonerated the members of the Government concerned
whereas a minority report by the Conservative members of the
Committee  found  that these members of the  Government	 had
been guilty of gross impropriety.  When the reports came  to
be  debated  in the House of Commons, the House	 divided  on
strictly  party	 lines	and by	a  majority  exonerated	 the
Ministers  from all blame.  This is the last instance  of  a
matter of this kind being investigated by a Select Committee
of Parliament".	 In other words, "it was because in  England
investigation  by  a political tribunal of  matters  causing
grave public disquiet had been discredited that the Tribunal
of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, was passed, with a view  to
setting	 up  some permanent investigating  machinery  to  be
available  for use when required"  Furthermore,	 he  pointed
out that even in America ad hoc
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">42</span>
tribunals  are not infrequently appointed to avoid a  matter
being  referred	 to  a	Congressional  Committee,  as,	 for
example, the Warren Commission to investigate the murder  of
President Kennedy.

After  the two sections, set out above, which  disclose	 the
apparently very wide and undefined scope of inquiries to  be
conducted under the Act, the only limit being that they must
relate	to matters of "definite public	importance",  follow
sections conferring upon Commissions under the Act powers of
a  civil court for the purpose of eliciting  evidence,	both
oral  and documentary, and power to punish those  guilty  of
its contempt.  <a href="/doc/1399613/" id="a_184">Section 6</a> of the Act, however, makes it clear
that  statements  made	by a person in	the  course  of	 his
evidence  before the Commission "will not subject him to  or
be  used  against him in any civil  or	criminal  proceeding
except in a prosecution for giving false evidence by  making
such  statements".  But; this protection is not extended  to
statements  made in reply to questions not required  by	 the
Commission  to be answered, or, those made on matters  which
are not relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiry.	 <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_185">The
Act</a>,  however, contains no provisions for giving any  effect
to the findings of the Commission or for enforcing any order
which could be made by the Commission against any person  as
a  result  of  an  inquiry.  In	 fact,	the  only  orders  a
Commission  under  the	Act is	empowered  to  make  against
anybody are those relating to abduction of evidence, whether
oral  or  documentary, and those which may  be	required  to
protect the Commission against "acts calculated to bring the
Commission  or	any  member thereof  into  disrepute".	 The
proceedings  of a Commission could only result in  a  Report
which  is to be laid before the Legislature concerned  under
the  provisions of<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_186"> s. 3</a> (4) of the Act.	 Hence, the  obvious
intention  behind  the	Act is to enable  the  machinery  of
democratic  government	to  function  more  efficiently	 and
effectively. it could hardly be construed as an Act meant to
thwart democratic methods of government.
Even  in countries with undiluted unitary systems  of  Govt.
there  is devolution of powers of local self-Government	 for
restricted purposes.  In 'our country, there is, at the top,
a Central or the Union Government responsible to Parliament,
and  there are, below, it State Governments, responsible  to
the  State Legislatures, each functioning within the  sphere
of its own powers which are divided into two categories; the
exclusive  and the concurrent.	Within the exclusive  sphere
of the powers of the State legislature is local	 Government.
And, in all States there is a system of local Government  in
both   Urban  and  Rural  areas,  functioning  under   State
enactments.   Thus, we can speak of a three tier  system  of
Government in our country in which the Central or the  Union
Govt.  comes  at the apex with certain	subjects  which	 are
exclusively  left to the States concerned ordinarily  or  in
normal	times.	 But, even problems which arise	 within	 the
territories  of	 States	 may  fall  within  the	 sphere	  of
overriding Central power in emergencies.  And, if a  subject
is considered important enough to be regarded as the concern
of the whole nation, the Constitution makers have themselves
placed it either in the exclusively Central Legislative List
I  or  in  the	concurrent Legislative	List  III  of  items
mentioned in Schedule VII.
</p><p id="p_165">Our Parliament consists of the President and the two  Houses
of  Parliament.	  The House of, the People is not  meant  to
represent  the States as independent units of  a  federation

chosen	by  direct  election  by  the  people  from  various
territorial  constituencies in the States and not more	than
twenty	representatives	 of  people  living  in	 the   Union
territories  (<a href="/doc/1501881/" id="a_188">Article 81</a>).  There, the people of In"  living
in  the	 States and of the Union  territories  are  directly
represented  so	 that their interests and  rights  could  be
presumed  to  be well looked after and	protected  by  their
direct	representatives.   The	Council	 of  States  has  12
members	 in it nominated by the President for their  special
knowledge  or  experience  in matters of  art,	science,  or
social service, and not more than 238 representatives of the
States and elected by members of the legislative assembly of
each  State  in accordance with the system  of	proportional
representation by means of single transferable vote and from
the  Union territories in the manner prescribed by law	made
by  the Parliament (<a href="/doc/1864214/" id="a_189">Article 80</a>).  The representation of	 the
Legislative   bodies  of  the  States  and  of	 the   Union
territories  is	 certainly  a recognition  of  the,  federal
principle.   But,  this	 does  not  mean  that	the  Central
Government  is	precluded from all interference	 in  matters
concerning individual States.  For determining the extent of
that  interference  and	 the circumstances in  which  it  is
,possible  we  have  to	 turn to  other	 provisions  of	 our
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_166"><a href="/doc/369702/" id="a_190">Article	 245(1)</a>	 of our Constitution gives  the	 territorial
operations  of	the laws made by Parliament  and  the  State
legislatures.  <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_191">Article 246(1)</a> enacts that items in List I of
the  Seventh Schedule fall exclusively within the domain  of
Parliament and those  in List II come exclusively within the
legislative  power of the State legislatures, but  those  in
List III are to be concurrent.	<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_192">Article 248</a>, however,  vests
Parliament with exclusive power to legislate with respect to
matters	 not  enumerated in either the concurrent  or  State
list.  This is what is spoken of generally as the "residuary
power".	  In addition, Parliament has over-riding powers  of
legislating  even for matters in the State list for  limited
durations  if the Council of States by resolution  supported
by not less than two thirds of its members declared that  it
is  necessary  to do so in national interest or	 during	 the
continuance of a proclamation of emergency (Articles 249 and
</p><p id="p_167">250).  Inconsistency between laws made by the Parliament and
a  State legislature on an item found in a concurrent  list,
is  to be resolved in favour of the law made  by  Parliament
(<a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_193">Article  254</a>).	  And,	far-reaching  powers,  contained  in
Articles  352-360 in Part XVIII of the Constitution,  enable
the  President	to  suspend  not  only	the  enforcement  of
fundamental  rights  of	 citizens, and	their  operation  as
fetters on legislative powers but also the functions of	 the
State legislature which can be assumed by Parliament and  of
State Governments which can be taken over by the  President.
It  is	true that the emergency powers are so  drastic	that
they  can be abused.  We have not, however, got before us  a
case  of  the exercise of emergency powers or  of  abuse  of
powers.	  We are only considering here the extents  of	what
are put forward as federal and democratic features of  Govt.
which  may  or	may not be capable of  suspension.   As	 the
Constitution   stands  at  present,  the  exercise  of	 the
emergency powers, whose validity is not questioned before us
by  any party in this case, can completely remove  even	 the
semblance of a federal structure in our Constitution for the
duration of an emergency.

</blockquote><p id="p_175">In the first quotation given above, what was spoken of as  a
,'residuary  executive	power" of  the	Central	 Government,
analogous   to	 the  "residuary"  legislative	 powers	  of
Parliament,  was  relied  upon in  support  of	the  alleged
"direction" from the Centre' In the case before us it  could
certainly  be  urged that a consideration  of  the  question
whether	 a  State Govt. or its Chief Minister is or  is	 not
carrying out the trust which Constitutional power places  in
the  hands  of	a State Government and its head,  so  as  to
determine whether any exercise of extraordinary powers under
<a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_206">Article	 356</a>  of the Constitution is called for or  not,  is
certainly  a  matter  which lay within	the  powers  of	 the
Central Government.  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_207">Article 356</a> speaks of the satisfaction"
of  the	 President  from  a  report  of	 the  Governor	 "or
otherwise"  whether  a particular situation  has  arisen  in
which  the  Govt.  of  the State cannot	 be  carried  on  in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  Such  a
matter would certainly be a matter of public importance.  If
the President deems it necessary to give the State Govt.  or
its  Chief Minister an opportunity of being heard before  an
impartial  Commission of Inquiry constituted under the	Act,
it could certainly not be said that such a mode of  exercise
of  power under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_208">Article 356</a> is not fully covered by what  is
necessarily  implied  by this article of  the  Constitution.
Indeed, such a procedure would be a very fair and reasonable
one.   And,  in	 judging  the-validity	of  provisions	even
hypothetical  situations to which they could apply could  be
taken into account and not merely those present in the Pi
case before the Court.	We do not think that an	 examination
of  the express provisions of the Constitution advances	 the
case of the plaintiff-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">49</span>
<p id="p_176">On the other hand, the Central Government can place reliance
on, interalia, provisions of <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_209">Article 356</a> of the Constitution
for powers which could be held to be necessarily implied  in
the  provisions of the Constitution-that is to say, a  power
to  order  an inquiry for the purposes of  the	satisfaction
required by <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_210">article 356.</a>  And the machinery provided by	 the
Act  could,  it seems to us, be utilised to  decide  whether
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_211">article 356</a> is really called for.
Reliance was, however, placed strongly on provisions of	 the
Constitution setting up what, in the words of Dr.  Ambedkar,
one of the prime architects of our Constitution, is "a	Dual
Polity"	 by which, as was explained in the case of State  of
Rajasthan (supra), he meant a Republic "both unitary as well
as  federal"  according	 to  the  needs	 of  the  time	 and
circumstances.	 This "Dual Polity" of ours is a product  of
historical  accidents,	or, at any  rate,  of  circumstances
other  than  those which result in  genuine  federations  in
which  the desire for a separate identity  and	governmental
independence  of  the  federating units is  so	strong	that
nothing	 more than a union with a strictly demarcated  field
of  Central Government's powers is possible.   A  nonfederal
polity	carries the attenuation of Central authority to	 the
extent of confining combined or concerted action to the more
strictly limited field of collaboration only to matters such
as  foreign  affairs  and  defence so  that  it	 sets  up  a
mechanism  of cooperative action in limited areas which	 can
hardly	be spoken of as a Government.  A genuine  federation
is  a  combination of political units  which  adhere  rather
tenaciously  to the exclusion of the Central authority	from
strictly demarcated spheres of State action, but there is  a
Central	 or Federal "Government".  The extent of  Federalism
set  up	 depends  upon	the extent  of	demarcation  in	 the
executive,  legislative	 and judicial spheres.	In  a  truly
Federal	 Constitution this demarcation is carried out  in  a
very  carefully	 comprehensive	and  detailed  manner.	 The
limits are clearly specified.  We will thus have to  examine
our Constitution to determine how much of it is found here.
No  doubt,  throughout the long course of our  history,	 our
successive  rulers  bad been trying to build up a  unity  of
India  by establishing their imperial sway  Politically	 and
administratively over the whole country, but, it was  really
the  British  who  succeeded in giving reality	to  such  an
objective.  And, even they preserved a duality of systems of
Government.   There was a British India under  the  Governor
General	  presiding  over  the	destinies  of  the   various
provinces  under Governors as Imperial sub-agents,  but	 all
acting on behalf of an Emperor whose governments ruled	from
Westminster  and Whitehall.  And, there were other parts  of
the country, ruled by Indian Prince.,; owing allegiance to a
foreign	 Emperor  to  whose authority they  paid  homage  by
acknowledging  his sovereignty or the paramountly  exercised
through	 his  Viceroy.	These two parts were  sought  to  be
knitted together into a federal polity by the Government  of
India Act of 1935.  Federal principles, including a  Federal
Court,	were embodied in it so as to bring together and	 co-
ordinate  two different types of political systems and	sets
of authorities.	 But, after the Constitution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">50</span>
of our Republic, came the gradual disappearance of  Princely
States	and a unification of India in a single	polity	with
duality	 of agencies of Government only for the purposes  of
their  more  effective	and  efficient	operations  under  a
Central direction.  It was, more or less, an application  of
the  principle of division of labour under at least  Central
supervision.   In other words the duality or duplication  of
organs of government on the Central and State levels did not
reflect	 a truly federal demarcation of powers based on	 any
separatist  sentiments which could threaten the	 sovereignty
and integrity of the Indian Republic to which members of our
Constituent  Assembly seemed ardently devoted,	particularly
after  an unfortunate division of the country  with  certain
obviously disastrous results.
</p><p id="p_177">However,  we  may  examine the	express	 provisions  of	 our
Constitution  relating	to the organs of Government  in	 the
States which, no doubt, give the appearance of	full-fledged
separate  States for certain purposes.	Each State  has	 its
own  Governor exercising the executive power of that  State.
But,   all   Governors,	 although  undertaking	 to   devote
themselves  to the service and well-being of the  people  of
their respective States, owe an undivided allegiance to "the
Constitution and the law".  Each of them is appointed by the
President  and	holds  office during  the  pleasure  of	 the
President  to whom he sends his reports with a view  to	 any
proposed action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_212">Article 356</a> of the Constitution.	 The
Governor's authority, under the Warrant of his	appointment,
is  traceable to the President to whom he is to	 submit	 his
resignation if he resigns.
</p><p id="p_178"><a href="/doc/674146/" id="a_213">Article	 163</a> speaks of the, Council of Ministers  "with	 the
Chief  Minister at the head to. aid and advise the  Governor
in the exercise of his functions, except in so far as he  is
by  or	under  this Constitution required  to  exercise	 his
functions  or  any  of them in	his  discretion."  Now,	 the
Council of Ministers, theoretically appointed by the  Gover-
nor,   is   certainly  "collectively  responsible   to	 the
Legislative  Assembly of the State" (see :  <a href="/doc/331399/" id="a_214">Article  164(2).</a>
But, this "collective responsibility" does not, as has	been
erroneously  attempted	to be argued before us,	 abridge  or
truncate  the power of the Central Government to  appoint  a
Commission under<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_215"> s. 3</a> of the Act.  In fact, this "collective
responsibility" has a scope and mode of operation which	 are
very  different from those of an inquiry under<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_216"> s. 3</a>  of	 the
Act even though the same or similar matters may,  sometimes,
give rise to both.  "Collective Responsibility" is basically
political  in  origin and mode of operation.  It  may  arise
even  in  cases	 which may not call for	 any  inquiry  under
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_217">Section	 3</a>  of	the Act.  And,	matters	 investigated  under
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_218">Section 3</a> of the Act may have no bearing on any	 "collective
responsibility".
</p><p id="p_179">The object of collective responsibility is to make the whole
body of persons holding Ministerial office collectively, or,
if  one	 may so put it, "vicariously" responsible  for	such
acts  of  the others as are referable  to  their  collective
volition  so  that,  even  if  an  individual  may  not	  be
personally  responsible	 for it, yet, he will be  deemed  to
share
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">51</span>
the   responsibility  with  those  who	may  have   actually
committed some wrong.  On the other hand, in the case before
us,  the  enquiry under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_219">Section 3</a> of the Act by	 the  Grover
Commission has been ordered by the Central Government so  as
to determine who is actually responsible for certain actions
and  what  could be the motive behind them.  The  sphere  of
this   enquiry	is  very  different  from  that	  in   which
"collective    responsibility"	  functions.	  Explaining
"collective  responsibility", as understood in England,	 two
writers	 on Constitutional matters (see : "Some Problems  of
the Constitution' by Geoffrey Marshall and Graeme C. Moodie)
say: (at p. 71)
	      "If  responsibility  is taken  in	 the  formal
	      constitutional   sense,  there   would   seem,
	      granted  collective  governmental res-
</p><p id="p_180">	      ponsibility, to be no clear distinction to
	      be  drawn between Ministers inside  and  those
	      outside  the  Cabinet.  To be  responsible  in
	      this sense simply is to share the consequences
	      of- responsibility-namely to be subject to the
	      rule  that  no member of	the  Government	 may
	      properly	 remain	 a  member  and	  dissociate
	      himself from its policies (except on occasions
	      when the Government permits a free vote in the
	      House)".
</p><p id="p_181">	      'They add :
</p><p id="p_182">	      "The substance of the Government's  collective
	      responsibility could be defined as its duty to
	      submit  its  policy to and defend	 its  policy
	      before the House of Commons, and to resign  if
	      defeated on an issue of confidence".
</p><p id="p_183">Each  Minister can be and is separately responsible for	 his
own  ,decisions and acts and omissions also.  But,  inasmuch
as  the Council of Ministers is able to stay in office	only
so  long  as  it commands the support and  confidence  of  a
majority  of  Members of the Legislature of the	 State,	 the
whole  Council of Ministers must be held to  be	 politically
responsible, for the decisions' and policies of each of	 the
Ministers  and of his department which could be presumed  to
have  the support of the whole Ministry.  Hence,  the  whole
Ministry  will,	 at  least on issues  involving	 matters  of
policy,	 have  to  be treated as one entity so	far  as	 its
answerability  to the Legislative Assembly representing	 the
electors is concerned.	This is the meaning of the principle
underlying <a href="/doc/331399/" id="a_220">article, 164(2)</a> of the Constitution.	 The purpose
of  this provision is not to find out facts or to  establish
the  actual responsibility of a Chief Minister or any  other
Minister   or	Ministers  for	 particular   decisions	  or
Governmental  acts.   That can be more suitably	 done,	when
wrongful  acts or decisions are complained of, by  means  of
inquiries  under the Act.  As already indicated above,	,the
procedure of Parliamentary Committees to inquire into  every
legally	  or   ethically   wrong  act  was   found   to	  be
unsatisfactory and unsound.  The principle of individual  as
well as collective ministerial responsibility can work	most
efficiently  only  when cases requiring proper	sifting	 and
evaluation of evidence and discussion of questions  involved
have taken place, where this is required, in proceedings be-
fore a Commission appointed under,<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_221"> s. 3</a> of the Act.-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">52</span>
<p id="p_184">Text-books writers on Constitutional Law have indicated	 how
collective  ministerial responsibility to Parliament,  which
has  essentially a political purpose and effects,  developed
later	than  individual  responsibility  of  Ministers	  to
Parliament which was also political in origin and operation.
It  is true that an. individual Minister could, in  England,
where  the  principle of individual and	 collective  respon-
sibility of Ministers was evolved, be responsible either for
wrongful acts done by him without the authority of the whole
cabinet	 or of the monarch to support them, or under  orders
of the King who could, in the eye of law, do no wrong.	But,
apart  from  an impeachment, which has become  obsolete,  or
punishment for contempt of a House, which constitute only  a
limited kind of offences, the Parliament does not punish the
offender.  For establishing his legal liability recourse  to
ordinary courts of law is indispensable.
</p><p id="p_185">Responsibility	to Parliament only means that  the  Minister
may  be	 compelled  by convention to resign.   Out  of	this
liability arose the principle of collective  responsibility.
Thus,  in  Wade and Phillips on	 "Constitutional  Law",	 8th
Edn.,  p. 87, we find; "Just as it became recognised that  a
single Minister could not retain office against the will  of
Parliament, so later it became clear that all Ministers must
stand or fall together in Parliament, if the Government	 was
to  be	carried	 on as a unity rather than by  a  number  of
advisers   of  the  Sovereign  acting	separately".	This
development of collective responsibility was thus  described
in 1878 by Lord Salisbury:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_43">	      "For  all that passes in Cabinet every  member
	      of  it who does not resign is  absolutely	 and
	      irretrievably  responsible  and has  no  right
	      afterwards  to say that he agreed in one	case
	      to  a  compromise,  while in  another  he	 was
	      persuaded by his colleagues.... It is only  on
	      the principle that absolute responsibility  is
	      undertaken  by  every member of  the  Cabinet,
	      who,  after a decision is arrived at,  remains
	      member of it, that the joint responsibility of
	      Ministers to Parliament can be upheld and	 one
	      of   the	 most	essential   principles	  of
	      parliamentary responsibility established."
</blockquote><p id="p_186">The  whole  question  of responsibility is  related  to	 the
continuance  of	 a Minister or a Government  in	 office.   A
Minister's  own acts or omissions or those of others in	 the
Department  in	his charge, for which he  may  feel  morally
responsible,  or,  for	which others may  hold	him  morally
responsible,  may compel him to resign.	 By an extension  of
this logic, applied to individual Ministers at first, emerg-
ed  the	 principle of "collective responsibility"  which  we
find   enacted	 in  Articles  75(2)  and  164(2)   of	 our
Constitution.  The only sanction for its enforcement is	 the
pressure  of public opinion expressed particularly in  terms
of withdrawal of political support by members of  Parliament
or the State Legislature as the case may be.
As  Prof.  S. A. de Smith points out in	 his  Constitutional
and  Administrative  Law,  1971,  at  p.  170  to  179,	 the
principle   operates  in,  a  nebulous	 moral-cum-political
sphere, sometimes forcing an individual Minister to  resign,
as in the, case of Mr. Profumo, and, on
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">53</span>
other  occasions, involving the fate of the whole  Ministry,
depending  upon the extent to which the Cabinet as  a  whole
could be, in the circumstances of a particular case,  deemed
to  be	responsible for a particular decision or  action  or
inaction.  In England, the principle operates as a matter of
convention  backed  by political judgment, as  reflected  in
Parliament  whereas, for us, the principle is stated in	 our
Constitution  itself,  but it,	nevertheless,  depends	upon
convention   and  upon	public	opinion,   particularly	  as
reflected in Parliament or in the State Legislature, as	 the
case  may  be, for its effectiveness.	The  principle	thus
exists separately and independently from the legal liability
of  a  Minister, holding an office in the Union or  a  State
Government.
</p><p id="p_187">An   investigation  by	a  Commission  of   Inquiry   should
facilitate  or help the formation of sound  public  opinion.
That  was the object of the Commission of  Inquiry  presided
over by Lord Denninig on the Profumo affair.  The fact	that
the   Minister	 concerned   was   considered	individually
responsible  to the House for a wrong statement made  to  it
did  not prevent an inquiry by a Commission into matters  on
which  he had made the statement.  His	individual  actions,
however,  did  not  bring into operation  the  principle  of
collective   responsible  because  his	colleagues  in	 the
Government   could   not  reasonably  be  held	 guilty	  of
dereliction or breach of any duty.
</p><p id="p_188">A  Commission of Inquiry could not properly be meant, as  is
sometimes  suspected,  to merely white-wash  ministerial  or
departmental action rather than to explore and discover,  if
possible,  real facts.	It is also not meant to serve  as  a
mode   of   prosecution	 and  much  less   of	persecution.
Proceedings  before  it	 cannot	 serve	as  substitutes	 for
proceedings  which should take place before a Court  of	 law
invested with powers of adjudication as well as of  awarding
punishments  or affording reliefs.  Its report	or  findings
cannot	relieve	 Courts	 which may  have  to  determine	 for
themselves matters dealt with by a Commission.	Indeed,	 the
legal  relevance  or  evidentiary value	 of  a	Commission's
report	or  findings  on issues which a Court  may  have  to
decide for itself, is very questionable.  The appointment of
a  Commission  of  Inquiry to  investigate  a  matter  which
should, in the ordinary course, have gone to a Court of	 law
is generally a confession of want, of sufficient evidence-as
in  the case of the appointment of the Warren Commission  in
the  U.S.A. to inquire into facts concerning the  murder  of
the late President Kennedy-to take it to Court combined with
an attempt to satisfy the public need and desire to discover
what had really gone wrong and how and where if possible.  A
Commission of Inquiry has, therefore, a function of its	 own
to  fulfill.   It has an orbit of action of its	 own  within
which it can move so as not to conflict with or impede other
forms of action or modes of redress.  Its report or findings
are  not immune from criticism if they are either  not	fair
and impartial or are unsatisfactory for other reasons as was
said to be the case with the Warren Commission's report.

</blockquote><p id="p_190"><a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_229">Article	 194.</a> reproduces the terms of <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_230">article 105</a> with	this
evident difference that, whereas <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_231">article 194</a>, is  applicable
to  Houses of a State Legislature,, <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_232">article 105</a>	 applies  to
the  two Houses of Parliament.	Each of these  two  articles
subjects  "the	powers, privileges and immunities"  of	each
House as well as all its Members and its Committees not only
to the laws made by the appropriate legislature but also  to
all the other provisions of the Constitution.  It is  clear,
from  these articles, that they do not apply to	 legislative
powers of Parliament or of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">55</span>
State  Legislatures  which are specifically  dealt  with  by
articles  245 to 255 of the Constitution.  Articles 105	 and
194, far from dealing with the legislative powers of  Houses
of  Parliament	or of State Legislatures  respectively,	 are
confined  in  scope to such powers of each House as  it	 may
exercise separately functioning as a House.  It also  covers
immunities  and privileges of each House as a House as	well
as of its members The correct principle of interpretation to
apply is "no scitur a sociis", or, in other words, the	word
"powers"  gets	its  meaning and colour not  only  from	 its
context	 but also from the other words used  in	 association
with it.
</p><p id="p_191">It is evident, from the Chapter in which <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_233">article 194</a>  occurs
as  well  as  the heading and its  marginal  note  that	 the
"powers"  meant	 to be indicated here are  not	independent.
They are powers which depend upon and are necessary for	 the
conduct-of the- business of each House.	 They cannot also be
expanded  into those of the House of Commons in England	 for
all  purposes.	For example, it could not be contended	that
each  House  of a State Legislature has the  same  share  of
legislative power as the House of Commons has, as a  consti-
tuent part of a completely sovereign legislature.  Under our
law  it is the Constitution which is sovereign	or  supreme.
The  Parliament	 as well as each Legislature of a  State  in
India	enjoys	 only  such  legislative   powers   as	 the
Constitution  confers  upon it.	 Similarly,  each  House  of
Parliament   or	  State	 Legislature  has  such	  share	  in
Legislative  power as is assigned to it by the	Constitution
itself.	  The  powers  conferred  on  a	 House	of  a  State
Legislature  are  distinct from the  legislative  powers  of
either	Parliament or of a State legislature for  which,  as
already	 observed,  there  are separate	 provisions  in	 our
Constitution.	We  need  not travel  beyond  the  words  of
<a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_234">article	 194</a>  itself,  read with  other	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution, to clearly reach such a conclusion.
There is, if we may say so, considerable confusion still  in
the  minds of some people as to the scope of  the  undefined
"powers,  privileges and immunities" of a House of  a  State
Legislature  so much so that it has sometimes been  imagined
that  a	 House of a State legislature has some	judicial  or
quasi-judicial powers also. quite apart from its  recognised
powers	of  punishment	for its contempt  or  the  power  of
investigations	it may carry out by the appointment  of	 its
own  committees.   Arguments  of the kind  which  have	been
sometimes  advanced  in	 this country could  not  have	been
advanced if it was clearly understood that, even in England,
where the Constitution is largely conventional, the exercise
of  judicial powers directly by Houses of  the	legislature,
including   powers  such  as  those  of	  impeachment,	 are
practically  obsolete.	Whatever remained of the  power	 en-
joyed  once by the High Court of Parliament, when  the	King
could himself sit, as a part of Parliament, with the  Houses
of Parliament, to administer justice is now concentrated  in
the  House  of Lords, exercised through a Committee  of	 Law
Lords.
</p><p id="p_192">Every power of the House of Parliament in England is subject
to  an	act  of	 Parliament.  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_235">The  Act</a>	with  which  we	 are
concerned is an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">56</span>
Act  of	 our Parliament.  We have to, satisfy  ourselves  by
reference   to	 our  Constitution  and	 not   the   British
Constitution  that the provisions of the Act before  us	 are
within the legislative competence of Parliament.  But, if we
could ignore the provisions of our Constitution relating  to
distribution  of  legislative  powers,	which  is  what	 the
arguments based on <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_236">Article 194(3)</a> seem to imply, we would be
left  with  no yard-stick for  determining  the	 legislative
competence  of our Parliament.	It would be absurd  to	take
that  view simply because that is the position	in  England.
Nobody could, in England, question the validity of an Act of
Parliament  on the ground that it is in excess of the  power
vested in a sovereign Parliament to legislate.	If we  could
apply  that  principle	here the Act before us	would  be  a
sufficient answer to all argument against its validity.
If  that principle does not apply in our country because  of
the provisions of our Constitution, which constitute  courts
judges	of constitutionality of even Acts of Parliament,  we
have  to  test	the provisions of the Act on  the  anvil  of
express	 provisions of our own Constitution and not  on	 the
erroneously supposed powers of a House of Commons in England
which could never ignore or invalidate the provisions of any
Act  made by the Parliament there although it could  play  a
decisive role in its repeal if it so desired.
A source of confusion about the "powers" and "privileges" of
the  House  of	Commons even in England	 was  sought  to  be
removed	 long ago by Sir Erskine May when he pointed out  in
his  "Parliamentary Procedure and Practice', in	 1844,	that
Coke's dictum and Blackstones views, according to which	 the
ordinary law courts could not judge matters relating to "Lex
Parliament",   on  the	ground	that  "the  High  Court	  of
Parliament  hath no higher", were out of date even  in	17th
Century England.  He said about such views :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	      "The  views  belonged  to	 a  time  when	 the
	      distinction    between   the   judicial	 and
	      legislative   functions  of   Parliament	 was
	      undrawn or only beginning to be drawn and when
	      the  separation of the Lords from the  Commons
	      was  much	 less complete than it	was  in	 the
	      seventeenth  century.   Views about  the	High
	      Court of Parliament and its powers which	were
	      becoming	antiquated  in	the  time  of  Coke,
	      continued	  to  be  repeated  far	  into	 the
	      eighteenth   century,   although	 after	 the
	      Restoration  Principles began to be laid	down
	      which  were more in accord with the  facts  of
	      the  modern Constitution.	 But much  confusion
	      remained which was not dismissed by the use of
	      the phrase "privileges of Parliament".
</blockquote><p id="p_193">Sir  Erskine  May  went on to  indicate	 the  three  notions
resulting from this "confusion of thought" in the course  of
English Constitutional history.	 He wrote :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_47">	      "Three  notions arise from this  confusion  of
	      thought
	      (1)   That  the courts, being inferior to	 the
	      High  Court  of  Parliament,  cannot  call  in
	      question,	 the decision of either House  on  a
	      matter of privilege.
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">	      57</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">	      (2)   That the lex et conseutudo parliament is
	      a separate law, and, therefore, unknown to the
	      Courts.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_49">	      (3)   That   a  Resolution  of  either   House
	      declaratory   of	privilege  is	a   judicial
	      precedent binding on the courts."
</blockquote><p id="p_194">Now,  what  learned  counsel for  the  plaintiff  seemed  to
suggest was that Ministers, answerable to a Legislature were
governed  by  a	 separate  law	which  exempted	 them	from
liabilities under the ordinary law.  This was never the	 law
in  England.   And,  it is not so  here.   Our	Constitution
leaves	no  scope for such arguments, based on	a  confusion
concerning  the	 "powers" and "privileges" of the  House  of
Commons	 mentioned  in	articles  105(3)  and  194(3).	 Our
Constitution  vests only legislative power in Parliament  as
well as in the State Legislatures.  A House of Parliament or
State Legislature cannot try anyone or any case directly, as
a Court of Justice can, but it can proceed  quasi-judicially
in  cases of contempt of its authority and take	 up  motions
concerning  its	 "privileges" and "immunities"	because,  in
doing  so, it only seeks removal of obstructions to the	 due
performance  of	 its  legislative functions.   But,  if	 any
question of jurisdiction arises as to whether a matter falls
here or not, it has to be decided by the ordinary courts  in
appropriate  proceedings.  For example, the jurisdiction  to
try a criminal offence, such as murder committed even within
a House vests in ordinary criminal courts and not in a House
of  Parliament or in a State legislature.  <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_237">In  Smt.   Indira
Nehru  Gandhi v. Shri Rai Narain</a>(1), this Court held that  a
House  of  Parliament cannot, in exercise  of  any  supposed
"powers"  under	 <a href="/doc/1251904/" id="a_238">article 105</a>, decide election  disputes	 for
which  special authorities have been constituted  under	 the
<a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_239">Representation	of People Act</a>, 1961, enacted  in  compliance
with  <a href="/doc/1797219/" id="a_240">article 329.</a>  Similarly, appropriate  provisions	for.
appointments  of  suitable persons, invested with  power  to
determine, in accordance with a procedure which is fair	 and
just  and regular and efficient, for ascertainment of  facts
on matters of public importance, is provided by the Act.  If
such provisions are covered by specific provisions  relating
to  legislative	 competence of Parliament and on(--  of	 the
items  in Central List I or the concurrent List III  of	 the
Seventh	 Schedule  of the Constitution, we-need	 not  go  to
other  provisions  which would, strictly  speaking,  not  be
relevant  unless they could be relied upon to clearly  carve
out  some  exception  ,operating  against  such	 legislative
competence.
</p><p id="p_195">Learned	 Counsel for the plaintiff has relied also upon	 the
provisions  of Chapter 11, Part XI, containing Articles	 256
to 263 of the Constitution.  Here, we find Articles 256	 and
257(1)	of the Constitution which we have  already  examined
above to bring out the extent of Government of India's power
to  give  necessary  directions to every  State.   The	term
"State"	 used  there  could not possibly be  held  to  apply
merely	to a geographical entity or  territory.	  <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_241">Article-1</a>,
sub-<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_242">article  (2)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_243">Article-3</a> of our Constitution  make  a
distinction between "the State" and its territory.   <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_244">Article
300</a>,  in  the  context	of  legal  proceedings,	 makes	 the
Government of a State the legal representative of the
(1) [1976] 2 S.C.R. 347.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">58</span>
<p id="p_196">State.	A direction can only be given to a legal entity	 and
not  to	 a  geographical or a  territorial  entity.   Hence,
"directions"  to  the "State", as these terms  are  used  in
Articles  256 and 257, must necessarily mean  directions  to
States	as legal entities which must have legal	 representa-
tives.	 There	need  be no  difficulty	 in  treating  State
Governments   as   representatives   of	  their	  respective
individual  States.   Can we, with such	 a  constitution  as
ours, say that the Union Government must take no   interest,
and,  consequently,  no action whatsoever which	 savours  of
interference   with  governmental  functions  of   a   State
Government ? in, the dissolution of State Assemblies case we
have  already  stated  the views of this  Court	 on  such  a
subject	 at  some  length  indicating  there  the  ]dud	  of
federation  we	have  in this country  with  what  has	been
characterised  as "a strong unitary bias", or, at any  rate,
with powers given to the Union Government of.supervision and
even  supersession,  in	 certain  circumstances,  of   State
Governments  temporarily  to restore normalcy or  to  inject
honesty,   integrity,  and  efficiency	into   State   admi-
nistrations where these essentials of good government may be
wanting.
</p><p id="p_197">Neither	 Chapter 11, part XI of the-  Constitution,  dealing
with the administrative relations between the Union and	 the
States, nor any other part of the Constitution could be held
to   imply  a  prohibition  against  the  exercise  of	 any
legislative  power of Parliament.  Indeed, a glance  through
Chapter	 11 in part XI shows that, apart from articles 25  6
and 25 7 (1 ), it deals only with some special matters, such
as  maintenance	 of  national  highways,  water	 ways,	 and
railways,  constructions  to be undertaken  for	 objects  of
national  or  military	importance,  delegation	 of  certain
powers,	  some	arbitrations,  recognition  throughout	 the
territory  of  India  of certain public	 acts  and  judicial
proceedings  of the Union and of every State,  determination
of  disputes relating to waters, and certain  other  matters
involving co-ordination between the States.  It could not be
said to exhaust all matters which may involve the  interests
of  particular	States as well as of the  Union.   There  is
nothing	 in any of the provisions here or elsewhere  in	 our
Constitution  which  could, by a necessary  implication,  be
said  to  impose conditions on the exercise  of	 legislative
powers	 distributed  by  Chapter  I  of  Part	XI  of	 the
Constitution  read  with  the three  lists  in	the  Seventh
Schedule.   Such a question must, therefore,  be  determined
exclusively by the provisions of Chapter I of Part XI  which
refer  us to the legislative lists in the Seventh  Schedule.
We  cannot  forget that we are really  concerned  here	with
legislative powers and not with administrative relations  or
directions.   It  is  true that those powers  cannot  be  so
exercised  as to displace or amend the	Constitution.	But,
unless they have that effect, provisions meant to supplement
and facilitate due discharge of Constitutional powers cannot
be deemed to be in excess of ordinary legislative power.
Entry  94  in  List I of  exclusively  Central	subjects  of
legislation reads as follows :
</p><p id="p_198">"94.   Inquiries, surveys and statistics for the purpose  of
any of the matters in this list".
</p><p id="p_199">It  is	true that matters affecting  relations	between	 the
Union  Government  and the State Government  are  not  found
mentioned specifically
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">59</span>
anywhere  in the Union List.  It was, therefore, urged	that
"inquiries""  mentioned	 here, even if	they  extend  beyond
surveys	 and statistics, must, nevertheless, be confined  to
"matters  in  this  list".   It	 was  submitted	 that	such
"inquiries" could not embrace the conduct of Ministers exer-
cising	governmental  powers as such conduct does  not	fall
under  any item in the list but should,	 properly  speaking,
have  found  a	place  in  the	Chapter	 on  "administrative
relations".  It was suggested that the Union Government war,
really trying to exercise a kind of unwarranted disciplinary
authority  and control over the conduct of Ministers in	 the
States	in  the	 performance of	 governmental  functions  by
setting	 up  a	Commission  of	Inquiry	 a  subject,  it  is
submitted, that could properly be dealt with only as a	part
of  "Constitutional  law" and should have  found  a  mention
explicitly  in	some part of our Constitution so as  to	 'be
unmistakably identifiable there as such control	 exercisable
through the means adopted for it.
</p><p id="p_200">We  do not think that the term "Constitutional law"  can  be
either ,clearly or exhaustively defined although its  nature
can  be	 roughly  indicated in the way	in  which  text-book
writers	 have attempted to do it.  For	example,  Professors
E.C.S.	Wade and Godfrey Phillips (See	Constitutional	Law,
8th Ed. page 4) say :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">	      "There  is  no  hard and	fast  definition  of
	      constitutional law.  In the generally accepted
	      use  of  the  term it means  the	rules  which
	      regulate the structure of the principal organs
	      of  government and their relationship to	each
	      other,	and   determine	  their	   principal
	      functions."
</blockquote><p id="p_201">In  other  words, it could be expected to contain  only	 the
basic	framework.   It	 is  not  part	of  its	 nature	  to
exhaustively deal with all governmental matters.
As there is no written Constitution in Britain, the  authors
quoted	 above	said  "the  Constitution  has  no   separate
existence  since it is the ordinary law of the land".	They
added  :  "There  is a common body of law  which  forms	 the
constitution,  partly  statutory,  partly  common  law,	 and
partly	conventions".	It  is not possible  in	 England  to
equate	all that passes as "constitutional law"	 With  rules
enforceable through Courts of law because conventions, which
cannot	be  so enforced, are also,  apparently,	 treated  as
parts of it since they also contain rules of conduct.  Thus,
not  all  "constitutional law" need be written	or  be	even
"law"  in the commonly accepted sense of this term.  In	 any
case,  there  can be no clear-cut distinction  between	what
could  or  should  and	what could  not	 or  should  not  be
comprehended within the body of rules called "constitutional
law".	In practice, it will be found that what is  embodied
even  in  a written constitution depends  sometimes  on	 the
peculiar  notions for the time being of people who make	 it.
It  reflects their views about what should be considered  so
basic	or   fundamental  as  to  find	a   place   in	 the
Constitutional document.  For example, one of the provisions
of  the	 Swiss Constitution of 1893 prohibits  "sticking  of
animals for butchers" meat unless they have previously	been
stunned".   According to normal notions	 of  "Constitutional
law",  such a subject should not have found a place  in	 it.
Others think that a 5-1042SCI/77
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">60</span>
constitution  should  contain nothing more than	 the  barest
possible  outlines of the structure of the Government  of  a
country.   The	rest, whether "constitutional law"  or	not,
could  be  done	 by the	 exercise  of  ordinary	 legislative
powers.
</p><p id="p_202">Prof.	K. C. Where, in his "modern Constitutions", wrote  a
Chapter	 on "What a constitution should contain",  where  he
observes :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_51">	      "A  glance at the Constitutions  of  different
	      countries	 shows at one,,- that people  differ
	      very much in what they think it necessary	 for
	      a	 Constitution  to contain.   The  Norwegians
	      were  able to say all that they wanted to	 say
	      in about twenty five pages; the Indians occupy
	      about  two  hundred and fifty pages  in  their
	      Constitution  of	1950.  A principal  line  of
	      division	is found between those who regard  a
	      Constitution    as   primarily   and    almost
	      exclusively   a  legal  document	 in   which,
	      therefore,  there is a place for rules of	 law
	      but  for practically nothing else,  and  those
	      who  think  of  a Constitution as	 a  sort  of
	      manifesto, a confession of faith, a  statement
	      of  ideals,  a 'charter of the land',  as	 Mr.
	      Podsnap called it".
</blockquote><p id="p_203">He  opined  that "the one essential  characteristic  of	 the
ideal or the best form of constitution is that it should  be
the shortest possible".	 And, Chief Justice John Marshall of
the United States said in 1819 in McCulloch v. Maryland(1) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">	      "A Constitution to contain an accurate  detail
	      of  all  the subdivisions of which  its  great
	      powers  will  admit, and of all the  means  by
	      which  they  may be  carried  into  execution,
	      would  partake  of the prolixity	of  a  legal
	      code,  and could scarcely be embraced  by	 the
	      human  mind.   It	 would	probably  never	  be
	      understood by the public.	 Its nature,  there-
	      fore,  requires that only its  great  outlines
	      should  be  marked,  its	important'   objects
	      designated,  and the minor ingredients  ,which
	      compose  those  objects be  deduced  from	 the
	      nature of the objects themselves."
</blockquote><p id="p_204">It  is	true  that our Constitution-makers did	not  try  to
conform	 to  the standards indicated above.   This  was	 due
largely	 to the historical background and the manner of	 our
Constitution  making.  We did not start with a clean  slate.
We accepted as our starting point the scheme embodied in the
Government  of	India  Act, 1935,  enacted  by	the  British
Parliament, evidently in an attempt to provide quite a	com-
prehensive  and	 foolproof  set	 of  legal  rules  for	 the
governance of. our country.  On it, were engrafted a set  of
provisions  containing	principles,  sometimes	conflicting,
culled	 from  the  Constitutions  of	various	  countries,
including  Japan,  and results of judicial  wisdom  and	 ex-
perience  gathered from all comers of the earth, so that  we
have a Constitution which, as Mr. Granville Austin  suggests
in his book on "The Indian Constitution : The cornerstone of
a Nation", resembles a coat of various colours.

<p id="p_205">Our  Constitution  may	be  lengthy  and  considerably	more
comprehensive  and  elaborate than  Constitutions  of  other
countries. Nevertheless, to expect its contents to be so all
embracing  as  to necessarily specify and  deal	 with  every
conceivable  topic  of	legislation  on	 all  constitutional
matters exhaustively, with sufficient particulars, so as  to
leave  no  room	 for  doubt as to what	could  be  meant  by
it...... as though a topic of legislation had to be  stated,
with  necessary	 particulars, like a charge  to	 an  accused
person	.... is to expect the humanly impracticable  if	 not
the  impossible.  And, to build an argument founded  on	 the
supposed  reasonableness  of such an  expectation  and	some
loosely	  drafted   comprehensive   definition	 of   either
"Constitutional	 law"  or a "Constitution", to	convince  us
that what is not so specified and identifiable as a  subject
of   legislation,   given  in  the  Constitution   must	  be
necessarily  prohibited	 at  least as a	 topic	of  ordinary
legislation,  although	it  may	 become	 permissible  by  an
amendment of the Constitution, by an addition to it, appears
very unrealistic to us.	 At any rate, our Constitution	does
not  inhibit  the  growth or  development  of  supplementary
constitutional law through channels other than <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_245">Article 368.</a>
Excessive  particularity  is  not  consistent,	as   already
indicated  above, with the generally accepted notions  of  a
basic  or what may be characterised as the "structural"	 law
of the State delineating its broad basic features only.	 The
most  that  could be expected from the	human  foresight  of
Constitution  makers  is that they should provide  for	that
residual  power of legislation which could cover  topics  on
which,	consistently  with  the	 constitutional	  framework,
Parliament  or	State legislatures could  depending  on	 the
constitutional	 pattern,   legislate	even   though	 the
legislation  may  not be easily assignable to  any  specific
entry.	Such a provision our Constitution makers did make.
Item  97 corresponds to the residuary legislative powers  of
Parliament under <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_246">Article 248.</a>  It reads as follows :
"97.  Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III
including any tax not mentioned in either of those lists."
It gives effect to <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_247">Article 248.</a>	 No doubt, resort to <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_248">Article
248</a>,  read  with item 97 of List I, could not  overcome	 any
specific   constitutional   bar	  against   legislation	  on
investigation	of  conduct  of	 Ministers  of	 any   State
Government  in the discharge of their duties had there	been
one.  There is certainly no such express and specific bar in
our  Constitution.  And, it is difficult to see how one	 can
arise  by some necessary implication of	 provisions  dealing
with  entirely	different topics.  There  is  no  indication
anywhere  in  our  Constitution	 that,	while  enacting	 the
provisions from which we are asked to infer a bar against or
limitation  upon legislation on such a topic  as  inquiries,
that our Constitution-makers had any such bar or  limitation
even  remotely	in  their minds.  There seems  no  legal  or
rational nexus between such a supposed bar or limitation and
the  subjects  dealt with in the articles relied  upon.	  As
already	 indicated  above, the	Constitution  makers  cannot
always	mention	 and exhaust every  conceivable	 topic.	  We
think that it is in order to meet precisely such a situation
that <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_249">article 248</a> read with Entry 97 was inserted.  Hence, we
think that <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_250">article 248</a> read
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">62</span>
with  Entry 97 of list I will fully cover <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_251">Section 3</a>  of	 the
Act even if item 94 of List I does not.
</p><p id="p_206">Alternatively,	Entry 45 of the Concurrent List III  of	 the
Seventh	 Schedule  was relied upon on behalf of	 the  Union.
This item reads as follows
</p><p id="p_207">45.Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the
matters 'specified in List II or List III".
To fall under item 45 of List III the topic of inquiry	must
relate to one of the specified items in List II or List III.
If  neither  items 94 and 97 of List I nor item 45  of	List
III which refers to inquiries relating to topics in List  II
as  well  could	 cover	<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_252">Section	 3</a>  of	the  Act,  it  would
necessarily  follow  that such an enactment,  assuming	that
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_253">Section	 3</a>  was meant to cover an inquiry  against  a  State
Minister's conduct in the exercise of powers enjoyed by	 him
by  virtue of his office was not contemplated at all by	 our
Constitution  makers.	If  such an  argument  was  correct,
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_254">Section	 3</a>  would,  on the assumption  made,  fall  entirely
outside	 the legislative competence of both  Parliament	 and
State  Legislatures  because there would be  no	 legislative
power  conferred  upon	any Legislature to  deal  with	such
subject as it could not be covered by any entry in any list.
Indeed,	 if  we have correctly understood  the	argument  of
learned	 Counsel  for the plaintiff in the form	 it  finally
took,  this  is	 precisely  what  is  submitted	 to  us	 for
acceptance.   It was contended that this was so because	 the
conduct	 of  governmental affairs by State  Governments	 and
their  Ministers  is subject exclusively to the	 control  by
State  Legislature  and	 those of the  Union  Government  by
Parliament alone by reason of the Constitutional  provisions
we have already examined and explained.
</p><p id="p_208">To  accept such contentions of the learned Counsel  for	 the
plaintiff  is to place Ministers, both in the States and  in
the Union Governments, completely outside the scope of legal
answerability on the ground that they were only	 politically
responsible to and controllable by appropriate	legislatures
even  when  they,  in the course of  purported	exercise  of
official  powers,  act dishonestly and	corruptly  and	even
commit	criminal offences.  This would mean that even  if  a
Minister receives bribes, as we genuinely hope that none  in
the  whole country does, he could not be made answerable  in
ordinary courts or be subjected to criminal proceedings.  If
no  inquiry  under  any law into his  conduct  was  possible
simply because the act complained of was done by a  Minister
in purported exercise of a power vested in him by virtue  of
his  ministerial office, he would be placed in a  privileged
position  above the ordinary processes of law applicable  to
other  citizens.  Mere holding of Ministerial  office  would
confer	immunity from any inquiry.  He would thus  become  a
legally irresponsible despot above the ordinary law.
The  determine	whether there is a prima facie, case  for  a
criminal  offence facts have to be necessarily	investigated
or  inquired  into.   But,  of every  type  of	inquiry	 and
investigation except one by the House of the Legislature  of
which he is a member is burred, the very first stop
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">63</span>
towards aprosecution  for any serious crime would  be  shut
out in limine. No question of any further legal	 proceedings
would arise under any enactment.  Such a consequence of	 the
constitutional provisions relied upon by learned counsel for
the plaintiff could not, in our opinion, be possible  within
the contemplation of our Constitution makers.  Indeed,	such
a  view would clearly violate the express and very  salutary
provisions of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_255">Article 14.</a>
</p><p id="p_209">We  prefer to infer and hold that the term  'inquiries',  as
used  in item 94 of List I and Item 45 of List III,  without
any limitations upon their nature or specification of  their
character  or objects, is wide enough to embrace every	kind
of  inquiry,  whether  a  criminal  offence  by	 anyone	  is
disclosed  or  not by facts alleged.  Entry 45 in  List	 III
must  include  inquiries to cover  allegations	against	 all
persons	 which	bring them within the sphere of Entry  I  of
List  II  relating  to criminal law.  All  that	 "Inquiries"
covered by Item 45 require is that they must be	  "for	 the
purpose	 of any of the matters specified in List II or	List
III."	  The language used-"any of the matters	 specified"-
is broad enough	    to cover anything reasonably related  to
any  of	 the  enumerated items even if done  by	 holders  of
ministerial  offices  in the States.Other subjects  will  be
found  in  State List II.  And, even assuming  that  neither
Entry  94  of List I nor Entry 45 of List III,	would  cover
inquiries against ministers in the States, relating to	acts
connected with the exercise of ministerial powers, we  think
that  <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_256">Article  248</a>,  read  with Entry 97  of  List  I,	must
necessarily cover an inquiry against Ministers on matters of
public importance whether the allegations include violations
of  criminal  law  or not.  A contrary	view  would,  in  my
opinion have the wholly unacceptable consequence of  placing
Ministers  in State Governments practically above  the	law.
We   must   lean  against  an	interpretation	 which	 has
consequences   which,  had  they  flowed  from	an   express
enactment  of  Parliament or of a State	 Legislature,  would
have  invalidated the provision for conflict  with  Article,
</p><p id="p_210">14.
It  would not be out of place to mention that even  for	 the
purposes  of  an inquiry into the conduct of Judges  of	 the
Supreme	 Court	or of High Courts an Act of  Parliament	 was
passed for the specific purposes of <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_257">Article 124</a> to  provide,
through appropriate investigation and inquiry, "proof of the
misbehaviour  or incapacity of a Judge"	 before	 proceedings
under  <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_258">Article 124(4)</a> could be initiated for their  removal.
(See  : The Judges' <a href="/doc/1719017/" id="a_259">(Inquiry) Act</a> 51 of 1968).	Hence,	even
Judges,	 who  have  to be  protected  against  unfounded  or
malicious charges, as they have to give decisions which must
necessarily  displease	at  least one out  of  two  or	more
parties	 to a case, are not in a more  privileged  position.
It is true that, as somebody has observed, reckless  charges
are  perhaps hurled against those holding public offices  in
our  country  with the abundance of confetti at	 a  wedding,
yet, we cannot do away with inquiries under the Act for this
reason.	 The liability to face such inquiries before a	duly
appointed impartial Commission is one of those hazards which
individuals  holding ministerial office have to face.	They
can perhaps find solace in the thought that inquiries  which
are  thorough and impartial, conducted by competent  persons
who  have held high judicial office, are the best  means  of
clearing  them	of charges which are  really  unfounded	 and
malicious.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">64</span>
<p id="p_211">As we think that the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_260">Section 3</a> upon	 the
Central	 and  State  Governments,  including  the  power  to
institute inquiries of the kind set up under each of the two
Notifications,	are  covered by the  express  constitutional
provisions  mentioned above, no question of  any  exclusion,
either by necessary implication or by any principle supposed
to form a part of or to flow from the basic structure of the
Constitution, can arise here.  Nor can we, upon the view  we
take, read down and so interpret <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_261">Section 3</a> of the Act as  to
exclude	 from its purview inquiries of the  kind  instituted
under  the two Notifications.  To do so would be to give  an
incentive to possible misuse and perversion of	governmental
machinery and powers for objects not warranted by law.	Such
powers carry constitutional obligations with them.  They are
to be exercised like the powers and obligations of  trustees
who  must  not deviate from the purposes  of  their  trusts.
Whether	 a  Minister has or has not abused  his	 powers	 and
privileges  could  be  best determined by  fair	 and  honest
people anywhere only after a just and impartial inquiry	 has
taken  place  into complaints made against him so  that	 its
results are before them.
</p><p id="p_212">It  is	evident	 from  the  foregoing  discussion  that	 the
principle  relied  upon by the plaintiff's  learned  Counsel
repeatedly,  in support of which a passage  from  Crawford's
"Statutory Construction" (1940 Edn. paragraph 195 at p. 334-
</p><p id="p_213">335) was also cited, as the basis of the submissions of	 the
learned Counsel, was that what is expressly provided for  by
the  Constitution  must necessarily exclude what is  not  so
provided for.  This reasoning is an attempted misapplication
of  the	 principle  of construction  "Expression  Unius	 Est
Exclusio Alterius." Before, the principle can be applied  at
all  the Court must find an express mode of doing  something
that  is  provided  in a statute, which,  by  its  necessary
implication, could exclude the doing of that very thing	 and
not  something else in some other way.	Far from this  being
the  case  here,  as the discussion  above  has	 shewn,	 the
Constitution   makers  intended	 to  cover  the	 making	  of
provisions  by Parliament for inquiries for various  objects
which  may  be	matters of  public  importance	without	 any
indications of any other limits except that they must relate
to subjects found in the Lists.	 I have also indicated why a
provision  like section of the Act would, in any case,	fall
under entry 97 of List I of Schedule VII read with  Articles
248  and  356 of the Constitution even if  all	subjects  to
which  it may relate are not found specified in	 the  lists.
Thus,  there  is express provision in  our  Constitution  to
cover  an  enactment such as <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_262">Section 3</a> of the  Act.   Hence,
there  is  no room whatsoever for  applying  the  "Expressio
Unius"	rule  to  exclude what	falls  within  an  expressly
provided legislative entry.  That maxim has been aptly	des-
cribed	as  a "useful servant but a  dangerous	master	(per
Lopes  L.J. in Colquhoun v. Brooks(1).	The  limitations  or
conditions  under  which  this	principle  of	construction
operates  are frequently overlooked by those who attempt  to
apply it.
</p><p id="p_214">(1)  [1888] 21 Q.B.D. p. 52 @ 65.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">65</span>
<p id="p_215">To  advance the balder and broader proposition that what  is
not  specifically  mentioned  in the  Constitution  must  be
deemed to be deliberately excluded from its purview, so that
nothing short of a Constitutional amendment could  authorise
legislation  upon it, is really to invent a "Casus  Omissus"
so as to apply the rule that, where ',.here is such a gap in
the  law, the Court cannot fill it.  The rule,	however,  is
equally	 clear that the Court cannot so interpret a  statute
as  "to produce a casus omissus" where there is really	none
(see  :	 The  Mersey Docks and Harbour	Board  v.  Penderson
Brothers(1).   If  our	Constitution  'itself  provides	 for
legislation  to	 fill what is sought to be  construed  as  a
'lacuna how can legislation seeking to do this be held to be
void  because  it  performs  its  intended  function  by  an
exercise  of an expressly conferred legislative power ?	  In
declaring  the	purpose of the provisions so  made  and	 the
authority for making it, Courts do not supply an omission or
fill  up  a gap at all.	 It is Parliament which	 can  do  so
and has done it.  To hold that parliament is incompetent  to
do this is to substitute an indefensible theory or a figment
of one's imagination that the Constitution stands in the way
somehow-for that which only a clear Constitutional bar could
achieve.
</p><p id="p_216">This  brings me to the next question to be considered :	 Are
there  any  special rules relating to  the  construction  of
Constitutions	in  general  or	 of  our   Constitution	  in
particular  ? And, if there be any such rules,	would  their
application support the restrictive construction, ,submitted
on  behalf  of	the plaintiff for  our	acceptance,  on	 the
Parliament's  power  to enact <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_263">section 3</a> of the	Act?   These
seem to be important questions which need answers with	some
clarity if possible.
</p><p id="p_217">A writtenConstitution,	 like  any  other   enactment,	 is
embodied in a document. There are certain general rules	 of
interpretation	and constructionof  all documents  which,
no doubt, apply to the Constitution as well.Nevertheless,
the nature of a Constitution of a Sovereign Republic,  which
is  meant to endure and stand the test of time, the  strains
and  stresses  of  changing  circumstances,  to	 govern	 the
exercise  of all Governmental powers, continuously,  and  to
determine the destiny of a nation could be said to require a
special	 approach  so that judicial  intervention  does	 not
unduly	thwart the march of the nation towards the goals  it
has set before itself.
</p><p id="p_218">Napoleon Bonaparte once said that the best Constitution	 for
any   country  is  one	which  is  both	 short	and   vague.
Obviously,  be	meant  that a  Constitution  must  have	 the
capacity to develop and to be easily adapted to the changing
needs of the nation, to the vicissitudes of its fortunes, to
the  growth  and expansion of various spheres of  its  life-
social	  economic,   political,   legal,   cultural,	 and
psychological.	 If  the Constitution is unable	 to  perform
this  function	it  fails.  Prof.   Willis,  whose  work  on
"Constitutional	 Law  of the United States" has	 been  cited
before this Court, has said (at p. 19):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">	      "Our  original Constitution was not an  anchor
	      but a rudder.  The Constitution of one  period
	      has not been the
	      (1) [1888] 13A.C.595@ 602
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">	      66</span>
	      Constitution of another period.  As one period
	      has  succeeded another, the  Constitution	 has
	      become larger and larger."
</blockquote><p id="p_219">This elasticity or adaptability of the American Constitution
may account for its durability.
</p><p id="p_220">Although,  a written Constitution, which is always  embodied
in  a  document, must necessarily be subject  to  the  basic
cannons	 of construction of documents, yet, its very  nature
as the embodiment of the fundamental law of the land,  which
has  to be adapted to the changing needs of a nation,  makes
it  imperative for Courts to determine the meanings  of	 its
parts  in  keeping  with its broad and	basic  purposes	 and
objectives  This  approach seems to flow from  what  may  be
called	a  basic principle of construction of  documents  of
this  type : that the paramount or predominant	objects	 and
purposes,  evident  from  the contents,	 must  prevail	over
lesser	terms ones obscurely embedded here and there.	 The
Constitutional	document, in other words, must be read as  a
whole and construed in keeping with its declared objects and
its  functions.	  The dynamic needs of the nation,  which  a
Constitution must fulfill, leave no room for merely pedantic
hairsplitting play with words or semantic quibblings.  This,
however,  does	not mean that the Courts, acting  under	 the
guise  of a judicial power, which certainly extends to	even
making	the  Constitution,  in	the  sense  that  they	 may
supplement  it in those parts of it where the letter of	 the
Constitution is silent or may leave room for its development
by  either ordinary legislation or judicial  interpretation,
can  actually  nullify, defeat, or  distort  the  reasonably
clear  meaning of any part of the Constitution in  order  to
give  expression  to some theories of their  own  about	 the
broad or basic scheme of the Constitution.
The  theory behind the Constitution which can be taken	into
account for purposes of interpretation, by going even so far
as to fill what have been called the "interstices" or spaces
left  unfilled, due perhaps to some deliberate vagueness  or
indefiniteness in the letter of	   the	Constitution,	must
itself	 be   gathered	from  express  provisions   of	 the
Constitution.	   The dubiousness of expressions  used	 may
be  scured  by	Court by making	 their	meanings  clear	 and
definite  if necessary in the light of the broad  and  basic
purposes  set before themselves by the Constitution  makers.
And,  these meanings may, in keeping with the objectives  or
ends  which  the Constitution of every	nation	must  serve,
change	with changing requirements of the times.  The  power
of judicial interpretation, even if it includes what may  be
termed as "interstitial" law making, cannot extend to direct
conflict  with express provisions of the Constitution or  to
ruling	them out of existence.	What the express  provisions
authorise cannot be curtailed by importing limits based on a
mere theory of limitations on legislative powers.
The statement of general principles of construction set	 out
above, is home out by earlier pronouncements of this  Court-
some  emphasizing  the clearly expressed meanings  of  words
used  in the Constitution., which cannot be  deviated  from,
others	 laying	 stress	 on  the  paramount   purposes	 and
objectives of the Constitution makers, some asserting the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">67</span>
undoubted  power  of Courts to declare void  legislation  in
conflict with the Constitutional provisions, others pointing
out  the  plenitude of legislative powers conferred  by	 the
Constitution  upon  Parliament and the	State  Legislatures,
presumed  to  know  best the needs of the  people,  so	that
Courts	could  not  lightly  invalidate	 statutes.   I	will
briefly	 refer	to some of the past pronouncements  of	this
Court  where, emphasis would naturally differ from  case  to
case according to the particular context in which some	rule
of construction arose for consideration.
Kania,	C.  J., quite clearly laid down	 a  basically  sound
approach, if I may so characterise it with great respect, to
the  interpretation of the Constitution in <a href="/doc/1857950/" id="a_264">A. K. Gopalan  v.

it would fall in List I apparently because, of the amplitude
of  the	 residuary  field indicated by	entry  97,  List  I,
Legislative  entries  only  denote fields  of  operation  of
legislative power which is actually conferred by one of	 the
articles  of  the Constitution.	 It was,  pointed  out	that
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_277">Article 248</a> of the Constitution conferring legislative power

that  a	 wide range given to entry 97 of List I,  read	with
<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_279">Article 248</a> of the Constitution, would destroy the  "federal
structure" of our Republic was rejected there. On      an
application of a similar test here, the powers given to	 the
Central	 Government by <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_280">Section 3</a> of the Act, now before	 us,
could  not  be	held to be invalid on the  ground  that	 the
federal structure of the State is jeopardized by the view we
are  adopting in conformity with the previous  decisions  of
this Court.
</p><p id="p_229">I may next refer to what may be regarded as certain  special
features  of  our Constitution so as to indicate  its  broad
purposes and objectives.
</p><p id="p_230">Our Constitution has, in it, not only an elevating  preamble
setting	 forth	the  presumed will of the  whole  people  of
India, conceived of as one entity, but a set of	 Fundamental
Rights in Part III.  Directive Principles of State Policy in
Part  IV of the Constitution, a rough separation  of  powers
between	 the  Executive, the Legislative, and  the  Judicial
branches of Government, a pragmatic federalism which,  while
distributing  legislative powers between the Parliament	 and
State  Legislatures,  with  a  concurrent  field  also,	 and
indicating  the spheres of Governmental powers of State	 and
Central	 Governments,  is  overlaid,  as  already  indicated
above,	 'by  strongly	'unitary'   features,	particularly
exhibited by lodging in Parliament the residuary legislative
powers,	 and  in the Central Govt, the	executive  power  of
appointing State Governors, and Chief Justices and Judges of
High Courts, powers of giving appropriate directions to	 the
State  Governments, and of even displacing the State  Legis-
latures	 and  Governments in  exceptional  circumstances  or
emergencies   of   not	very  clearly  defined	 ambits	  or
characters.  No other "federation" in the world has  exactly
similar unitary features.  One wonders whether such a system
is  entitled  to  be dubbed "federal" in  a  sense  denoting
anything more than a merely convenient division of functions
operative in ordinary times.  The function of  "supervision"
is certainly that of the Central Government with all that it
implies.
</p><p id="p_231">It may be noticed that the basic allegiance contemplated  by
the  Constitution is, legally speaking, to the	Constitution
itself about whose advent this Court once said (in  <a href="/doc/635617/" id="a_281">Virendra

</blockquote><p id="p_232">The  Constitution, as its Preamble makes it clear, is  of  a
sovereign   republic.	The  legal  sovereignty	  which	  it
represents includes legal legislative sovereignty which must
embrace	 the power of making any law on any  subject.	Such
legislative  power  to enact any law must,  therefore,	vest
somewhere in a legislative organ of the Republic.  It cannot
be placed anywhere outside these organs.  To apply the	test
formulated in Dhillon's case, (supra) the Parliament  alone,
would  have  the  power to enact by a  simple  majority,  by
reason	of <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_282">Article 248</a> read with entry 97 of List I,  if  it
falls  neither	in List II nor in List	III.   As  indicated
above, the contention on behalf of the plaintiff, if  accep-
ted,  would  expel the power of legislation  itself  on	 any
matter involving an inquiry into the conduct of Governmental
affairs	 by  a	minister  in a	State  Government  from	 the
legislative  Lists  and place it under	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_283">Article	 368.</a>	This
means	that,  although	 the  express  provisions   of	 the
Constitution, broadly interpreted, as they should be,  would
prima facie authorse a provision.. such as <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_284">Section 3</a> of	 the
Act,  yet,  we	should imply  a	 Constitutional	 prohibition
against	 such  an enactment by Parliament even if  its	wide
terms  could  as  they prima  facie  do,  include  inquiries
against State Ministers exercising Governmental powers.
As indicated above, the first step of the argument mentioned
above is a theory of what the Constitution must	 necessarily
contain	 as contrasted with ordinary law.  To  support	this
submission, a passage was cited from the judgment of Wanchoo
J, in <a href="/doc/21266288/" id="a_285">I. C. Golak Nath &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab and Anr</a>.(1)
which contains the following question front Ivor Jennings on
"The Law and the Constitution" (1933 Edn. at p. 51  onwards)
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_74">	      "A   written   constitution   is	 thus	 the

	      The learned Judge then went on to observe
	      "It is because of this difference between	 the

</p><p id="p_235">The passages cited above cannot provide a foundation for the
theory	that  "constitutional Law" and the rest of  the	 law
can,  in  respect  of their contents or	 subject  matter  be
placed	in two sharply divided or distinct  and	 water-tight
compartments with no overlapping or uncertain fields between
them.  It must not be forgotten that Wanchoo, J.  repeatedly
explained,   by	  putting   in	 the   words   namely,	 the
"Constitution"	 within	 brackets,  that  he   'was   really
concerned  with	 indicating the special features of  a	very
detailed or comprehensive Constitution such as ours.  Indeed
as  regards the subject matter of the laws contained in	 the
Constitution  and  these  which may  be	 introduced  by	 the
ordinary law making procedure, the above mentioned  judgment
of Wanchoo J. itself indicates how even certain parts of the
law found in our written Constitution may be amended by	 the
ordinary law making procedure.	This passage was used by the
learned Counsel for the plaintiff to urge that additions  or
changes in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">73</span>
"Constitutional	 Law" cannot be made by ordinary law  making
procedure  but must take place only in accordance  with	 the
provisions  found  in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_291">Article 368</a>  unless  the	Constitution
expressly  provides  otherwise.	 This  contention,  however,
overlooks the fact that <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_292">Article 368</a> of the Constitution only
provides   the	 procedure   for  an   amendment   of	"the
Constitution", and says nothing about any amendment of other
laws  by  the introduction of or changes in laws  which	 may
conceivably be classed or construed as "constitutional laws"
because of their subject matter.  This passage should not be
torn  out  of  its  context,  in  which	 the  difference  in
procedure,  between  the  one  for  an	amendment  of	"the
,Constitution",	 provided  by  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_293">article	368</a>,  and  that	 for
ordinary  legislation, contemplated by Articles 245 to	248,
was under consideration.  It was in that connection that the
observation was rightly made that, unless there is  specific
authority  given by constitutional provisions  for  changing
the law laid down by "the Constitution" itself, by  adopting
only the ordinary law making procedure, a change in the	 law
contained in express provisions of the constitution"  itself
could  not be brought about without complying  with  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_294">Article
368</a>  of	 the Constitution. follows obviously from  the	very
notion of a Constitution as an embodiment of a	"fundamental
law" which serves as a touchstone for all other "laws".	 The
"fundamental  distinction" between "the Constitutional	law"
or "the fundamental law" and the ordinary laws, referred  to
there,	was meant to bring out only this difference- in	 the
uses  made of laws which, being "fundamental", can test	 the
validity  of all other laws on a lower normative  level	 and
these other laws which are so tested.  In that very  special
or restricted sense, the law not found in "the Constitution"
could  not be "constitutional" or "fundamental" law.   Other
parts  of  the	law,  even  though  they  may  appertain  to
important  constitutional  matters, are not  parts  of	"the
Constitution",	and, therefore, could not test the  validity
of laws made by Parliament.  What was said with reference to
the  actual  provisions	 of  the  Constitution	could	not,
however,  be  used to infer some bar  on  legislative  power
which  is not there in the Constitution at all	for  reasons
repeatedly indicated above.
</p><p id="p_236">In  an	earlier	 part  of this judgment,  it  is  held	that
legislative power to enact a provision such as <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_295">Section 3</a>  of
the  Act could be found, in any event, in <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_296">Article  248</a>	read
with entry 97 of List I, even if it could possibly be  urged
that  it is not covered by entries 94 of List I and  45	  of
List III, which seem to exhaust the three Lists in so  farms
the  subject  matters of enquiries are	concerned.   Learned
Counsel for the plaintiff tried to introduce some doubts  on
the  ground  that there is no specific entry in any  of	 the
lists	to  cover  the	conduct	 of  Ministers	 in   St-ate
Governments in relation to governmental functions.  And,  it
was submitted, reference to subjects specified in the  Lists
would  exclude	those which are unspecified.   It  could  be
urged in reply that, as indicated in Dhillon's case (supra),
a legislative entry only indicates the field of operation of
the power, but the sources of ordinary legislative power are
to be found in one of the Articles 245, 246, 247, 248,	249,
250,  252,  or 253 of the Constitution, and, so far  as	 the
field  of operation of the legislative power  is  concerned,
both  entry  94 of List I and entry 45 of List	III  are  so
widely worded as to embrace inquiries
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">74</span>
touching  any of the fields indicated by any of the  entries
in   the  lists.   A  Minister	must  necessarily   exercise
governmental powers in relation to one of these fields.	  It
is  not necessary to specify which that field is. The  field
of  power to legislate about inquiries is indicated in	wide
enough terms to make it unnecessary to specify the field, in
the law made itself, to which the inquiry must relate,.	  It
is  enough  if	the enquiry set up relates to  a  matter  of
"public importance." Again, it is not a necessary part of an
entry ill a legislative list, which only roughly indicates a
field of legislation, that it must also specify the  classes
of persons who may be affected by the legislation.  That  is
neither a constitutional nor a reasonable requirement.
This  Court has already held that overlapping of  fields  of
operation  of  legislative  power does	not  take  away	 the
legislative  power.  Indeed, ,as we have said, both  entries
94 of List I and 45 of List III must necessarily be  related
to  a variety of fields of operation of	 legislative  power.
And, in any case, even if an inquiry on a matter of  "public
importance"  relates to an unspecified field, it  should  be
covered	 by  entry 97 of List I itself.	  Therefore,  it  is
immaterial whether we hold that entry 97 of List I by itself
singly or that entry, read with entry 94 of List I, could be
deemed to cover the field of operation of such	legislation,
what  is material and important is that the  three  entries-
Nos.  94  and 97 of List I and 45 of List III are  bound  to
cover, between them, legislation authorising inquiries	such
as  the	 one  entrusted to the Grover  Commission.   If	 the
subject of inquiries against Ministers in State	 Governments
is not mentioned specifically either in any of the  articles
of the Constitution or in the legislative lists it does	 not
follow	from it that legislation covering such inquiries  is
incompetent  except by means of a constitutional  amendment.
'On  the  contrary,  such a subject  would  be	prima  facie
covered by the wide terms of <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_297">article 248</a> for the very reason
that  the  Constitution contains no express or	implied	 bar
which  could  curtail  the  presumably	plenary	 powers	  of
legislation of our Parliament.
</p><p id="p_237">Once  we  have located the legislative power in one  of	 the
articles   of	the   Constitution,   authorising   ordinary
legislation by Parliament for inquiries covered by <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_298">section 3</a>
of  the	 Act, and we find also the  appropriate	 entries  in
legislative Lists I and III indicating the fields of  opera-
tion  of  that	legislative power of  Parliament,  the	well
recognised  principle  which  would  apply  and	 exclude  an
implied	 bar against the exercise of that plenary power	 has
been  stated  by  this Court and also  by  other  Courts  in
Commonwealth countries on several occasions.  That principle
follows	 logically  from R. v. Burah (1878) (3	A.  C.	889)
which  is  the locus classics on the subject.	The  general
principle  laid down in Burah's case was that once  what  is
conferred   upon  a  Parliament	 or  other  Legislature	  is
legislative power, its plenary character must be presumed so
that,	unless	the  instrument	 conferring  the  power	  to
legislate  itself  contains some express limitation  on	 the
exercise  of  legislative  power, the ambit  of	 that  power
cannot be indirectly cut down by supposed implications.	 The
cases  on  this subject were comprehensively  considered  by
this  Court in Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra) where	 the
majority  view	was  that there can  be	 no  merely  implied
limitations on expressly conferred legislative powers.	This
Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">75</span>
there  referred to and adopted the principles laid  down  in
Burah's	 case'	(supra).  Palekar J.  quoted  the  following
passage from it (in Kesavananda Bharati's case' at p. 607) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_76">	      "The  established	 Courts of Justice,  when  a
	      question arises whether the prescribed  limits
	      have   been   exceeded,  must   of   necessity
	      determine	 that question; and the only way  in
	      which  they can properly do so, is by  looking
	      to the terms of the
	      instrument   by  which,	affirmatively,	 the
	      legislative powers were created, and by  which
	      ,	 negatively , they are restricted.  if	what
	      has  been	 done  id  legislation,	 within	 the
	      general  scope of the affirmative words  which
	      give the power, and if it violates no  express
	      condition	  or  restriction on by	 which	that
	      power	 is limited if is not for any  Court
	      Justice to inquire further,    or	 to  enlarge
	      constructively	 those	  conditions	 and
	      restrictions."
</blockquote><p id="p_238">in that case, Judges of this Court also relied upon Attorney
General	 for the Province of Ontario' v. Attorney.   General
for  the Dominion of Canada(1) where Earl Loreburn had	said
(at p. 583)
	      "In  the interpretation of a completely  self-
	      governing Constitution founded upon a  written
	      organic  instrument such as the British  North
	      America Act, if the text is explicit the	text
	      is  conclusive, alike in what it	directs	 and
	      what it forbids.	When the text is  ambiguous,
	      as  for example, when the	 words	establishing
	      two mutually exclusive jurisdictions are	wide
	      enough  to  bring a  particular  power  within
	      either,  recourse must be had to	the  context
	      and scheme of the Act."
</p><p id="p_239">The learned Additional Solicitor General has strongly relied
upon  the  State of Victoria v. The Commonwealth  (2)  where
earlier	 cases applying the reasoning contained	 in  Burah's
case  (supra) were surveyed and Barwick C. J. cited the	 two
passages  set  out  above by us,  one  from  Lord  Selbome's
judgment  in  Burah's case (supra) and the  other  from	 the
judgment of Earl Loreburn in the Province of Ontario's	case

<p id="p_242">In  Victoria's case (supra), Barwick C.J., although  not  in
entire agreement with the way in which Sir Owen Dixon, C.J.,
had  expressed himself in West v. Commissioner	of  Taxation
(N.S.W.(1)  opined that it was only- another way of  putting
what  had been consistently. laid down as the  principle  of
interpretation	of Constitutions of British  self  governing
Dominions  since  Burah's case (supra).	  The  passage	thus
explained was :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">	      "........	 the principle is that whenever	 the

	      the  Parliament  to make	laws  affecting	 the
	      operations  of the States and their  agencies.

	      which it is conferred on some other  provision
	      in the Constitution."
</blockquote><p id="p_243">Learned	 Counsel for the plaintiff, conscious of  the  basic
principles  of	construction of the  plenary  constitutional
power  to  legislate,  fried to	 sustain  his  very  gallant
attacks	 upon  the  validity  of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_299">section 3</a>  of	the  Act  by
referring to express provisions of the Constitution  where,,
as we have explained above, we could discover no such bar by
a  necessary implication.  However, the theory of the  basic
structure of the Constitution kept "popping up", if Nyc	 may
so  put	 it,  like the "jack in the box",  from	 behind	 the
constitutional	provisions, from time to time.	It was	said
to "underlie" constitutional provisions.
Thus, the plaintiff's learned Counsel did not entirely	give
up  reliance  on  what	has been  described  as	 "the  basic
structure  of the Constitution" although he, very  ;astutely
and  rightly,  tried to put the express	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution in the fore-front.	 Whatever may be said  about
the strategic value for the plaintiff of this mode of  using
the  doctrine of "the basic structure of the  Constitution",
it  does  not relieve us from the necessity  of	 considering
whether an application of such a doctrine could be  involved
in the case before us.	We cannot overlook that	 Kesavananda
Bharati's case (supra) where although a majority of  learned
Judges	of this Court which rejected the theory of  "implied
limitations"  upon  express plenary  legislative  powers  of
constitutional	amendment, yet, we accepted, I say  so	with
the  utmost respect, again by a majority, limitations  which
appeared  to  be  not easily  distinguishable  from  implied
limitations upon plenary legislative powers even though they
were  classed  as  parts  of "the  basic  structure  of	 the
Constitution."	We  are	 bound	by  the	 majority  view	  in
Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra) which we have followed in
other  cases.	We  have,  however, to	make  it  clear	 and
explicit   enough   to	be  able   to	determine,   without
inconsistency and with some confidence, the type of cases to
which  it  could and others to which it could not  apply  as
specific cases come up before us for consideration.

<p id="p_244">What, therefore, is this doctrine of "the basic structure of
our  ,Constitution"  of	 which, according  to  some  learned
Judges of this Court, expressing the majority views on	this
doctrine, "federalism" is a part ?  We can only answer	this
question by quoting from certain passages from the  opinions
of  the learned Judges who were parties to the	decision  of
this Court in Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra).
Sikri	C.  J.,	 who  accepted	the  doctrine	of   implied
limitations,  and, consistently with its logic,	 found	that
the  basic structure of the Constitution forms an  orbit  of
exercise  of power which is outside the purview	 of  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_300">Article
368</a>, relied on the observations and dicta found in Melbourne
Corporation v. The Conzmonwealth(1) and Australian  National
Airways Pvt.  Ltd. v. The Commonwealth (2).
The learned Chief Justice cited Starke J.'s views  expressed
in Melbourne Corporation's case (supra) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">	      "The  federal  character	of  the	  Australian

	      government  of the Commonwealth are not to  be
	      narrowed	or limited by  implications.   Their
	      scope and amplitude depend simply on the words

</blockquote><p id="p_245">Similarly, Shelat and Grover JJ, after surveying  principles
of  interpretation  and construction  of  the  Constitution,
accepted  the theory of implied limitations on the power  of
Parliament as well as the doctrine of basic structure.	They
recorded their conclusion as follows (at ;pp. 280-281)
	      "The  basic structure of the  constitution  is

	      under  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_304">Article  368</a> is a very wide  power,  it

</blockquote><p id="p_254">Khanna, J., while definitely rejecting the theory of implied
limitations on plenary powers of legislation,  nevertheless,
thought that the need. to reconcile the urge for change with
the need for continuity imposed even upon the wide power  of
amendment  of the Constitution the limitation that  it	must
move  within the orbit defined by its basic  structure.	  He
did not, and I say so with great respect, explicitly attempt
a  reconciliation between his views on	implied	 limitations
with those on the basic structure, which at least  resembled
implied limits on the plenary power of legislation.  He also
relied	heavily	 on the preamble to  the  Constitution.	  He
explained  later,  in <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_306">Shrimati Indira Nehru  Gandhi  v.	 Raj
Narain</a>(1),  that he did not exclude such amendments  in	 the
chapter	 on  Fundamental  Rights as may form  parts  of	 the
"basic	structure"  from the purview of what  could  not  be
touched	 by the power of amendment contained in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_307">Article	 368</a>
of  the Constitution.  The judgment of Khanna J. tilted	 the
balance, by a narrow majority of one, in favour of the	"the
basic structure" of the Constitution as a limitation on	 the
expressly conferred legislative power of amendment.
I  need	 not  set out similarly the views  of  Ray,  Palekar
Mathew,	 Beg, Dwivedi, and Chandrachud, JJ, as	they,  while
accepting  the undeniable proposition that the	Constitution
contained what was basic, held the, view, supported also  by
reference, to the history of our Constitution-making and  to
its  express provisions, that the power to amend  or  change
the Constitution in any manner and in any respect desired by
the  representatives of the people was also a part  of	that
basic  structure or the urges of the people which had to  it
round  expression  ill <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_308">Article 368</a> of the  Constitution	 and
which  had  to be fully recognised by giving it	 the  widest
possible  amplitude.  They too, therefore,  recognised	that
there  was  "a basic structure" of the Constitution  in	 the
light  of its history and contents and by an application  of
well  established  rules of  construction.   The  difference
between	 the  majority and minority views was  only  on	 the
question  whether a wide scope of powers of amendment  given
to  the representatives of the people was or was not a	part
of  this basic structure or its functioning as evidenced  by
the express declarations and provisions of the Constitution.
I  do  not  think that what those  learned  Judges  who,  in
Kesavananda  Bharti's case (supra), found a  narrower  orbit
for  the legislative power of amendment of the	Constitution
itself to move in cant to
(1)  [1976] 2 S.C.R. 347.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">82</span>
<p id="p_255">lay  down some theory of a vague basic	structure  floating,
like  a	 cloud	in  the skies,	above  the  surface  of	 the
Constitution and outside it or one that lies buried  beneath
the  surface for which we have to dig in order	to  discover
it.   I	 prefer	 to  think That the  doctrine  of  "a  basic
structure" was nothing more than a set of obvious inferences
relating  to the intents of the Constitution makers  arrived
at by applying the established canons of construction rather
broadly,   as	they  should  be  so  far  as	an   organic
Constitutional	document,  meant  to govern the	 fate  of  a
nation, is concerned.  But, in every case where reliance  is
placed upon it, in the course of an attack upon legislation,
whether ordinary or constituent (in the sense that it is  an
amendment of the Constitution), what is put forward as	part
of  "a basic structure" must be justified by  references  to
the express provisions of the Constitution.  That  structure
does  not exist in vacuo.  Inferences from it must be  shown
to  be embedded in and to flow logically and naturally	from
the,  bases of that structure.	In other words, it  must  be
related	 to  the provisions of the Constitution and  to	 the
manner	in  which  they could  indubitably  be	presumed  to
naturally and reasonably function.. So viewed, the  doctrine
is  nothing more than a way of advancing a  well  recognised
mode of construing the Constitution.  It should be used with
due care and caution.  No exposition of it which could	make
it appear as a figment of judicial imagination or as capable
of  'such subjective interpretations that it may become	 im-
possible  to  decipher or fix its  meaning  with  reasonable
certainty could be accepted by us because that would  amount
to  declaring  its futility. In	 Kesavananda  Bharti's	case
(supra),  this Court had not worked out the implications  of
the basic structure doctrine in all its applications.  It
could, therefore, be said, with utmost respect, that it was
perhaps	  left there in an amorphous state which could	give
rise to possible    misunderstandings  as to whether  it  is
not  too  vaguely  stated  or  too  loosely  and   variously
formulated  without  attempting a basic	 uniformity  of	 its
meanings or implications.  The one principle, however, which
is  deducible  I  in  all  the	applications  of  the  basic
structure  doctrine,  which has been used by this  Court  to
limit  even the power of Constitutional amendment,  is	that
whatever   is  put  forward  as	 a  basic  limitation	upon
legislative  power must be correlated to one or more of	 the
express	 provisions  of	 the  Constitution  from  which	 the
limitation  should naturally and necessarily  spring  forth.
The  doctrine  of  basic  structure,  as  explained   above,
requires that any limitation on legislative power must be so
definitely   discernible   from	 the  provisions    of	 the
Constitution itself that there could be no doubt or  mistake
that  the  prohibition	is a part  of  the  basic  structure
imposing  a  limit  on	even  the  power  of  Constitutional
amendment.   And,  whenever  we construe  any  document,  by
reading	 its provisions as a whole, trying to  eliminate  or
resolve its disharmonies, do we not attempt to interpret  it
in accordance with what we find in its "basic structure"  or
purposes ? The doctrine is neither unique nor new.
I  may here point out that in <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_309">Smt.  Indira Nehru  Gandhi  v.
Rai Narain</a> (supra), when the doctrine of the basic structure
of the Constitution was invoked to assail the provisions  of

theory of basic structure
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">83</span>
altogether in its application either to the construction  of
the  Constitution or of ordinary legislation.  He  said	 (at
pp. 436-437) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_100">	      "To   accept  the	 basic	features  or   basic
	      structures  theory  with	regard	to  ordinary

	      kinds of limitations for legislative measures.
	      One  will pertain to legislative	power  under
	      Articles	245  and  246  and  the	 legislative
	      entries  and the provision in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_311">Article 13.</a>	 The
	      other would be that no legislation can be made

	      the  Constitution and robbing the	 legislature
	      of   acting  within  the	framework   of	 the
	      Constitution.  No legislation can be free from
	      challenge	 on  this  ground  even	 though	 the
	      legislative  measure  is	within	the  plenary

	      The   Preamble,	though	 a   part   of	 the

provided  general guidance in judging the  Constitutionality
of   all  laws	whether	 constitutional	 or   ordinary.	   I
specifically  said  there  that the doctrine  of  the  basic
structure  of  the Constitution could be used  to  test	 the
validity   of  laws  made  by  Parliament  either   in	 its
constituent or ordinary law making capacities
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">85</span>
because	 "ordinary law making cannot go beyond the range  of

</p><p id="p_259">No  doubt, as a set of inferences from a document (i.e.	 the
Constitution),	the doctrine of "the basic structure"  arose
out  of and relates to the Constitution only' and does	not,
in that sense, appertain to the sphere of ordinary  statutes
or arise for application to them in the same way.      But,
if,  as	 a result of the doctrine, certain  imperatives	 are
inherent  in  or  logically and necessarily  flow  from	 the
Constitution's 'basic	 structure", just as though they are
its express mandates, they can be  and	have to be  used  to
test  the, validity of ordinary laws just as other parts  of
the Constitution are so used.
</p><p id="p_260">In  Smt.  Indira Gandhi's case (supra), the  differences  of
approach between the learned Judges, were not so much on the
question  whether "the basic structure" was to be deemed  to
be  really an additional part of the Constitution  (on	this
there is agreement that it could not) or only a principle of
its construction, but on the question whether, once it,	 was
found  to  be  a  permissible  mode  of	 construction,	what
followed from it was applicable to test the validity of both
constitutional as well as ordinary law-making.	The majority
view  of learned Judges of this Court seemed to be that,  it
was  not  available  to test the validity  of  the  impugned
provisions  of the <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_315">Representation of People Act</a> because	 the
expressly laid down ordinary law making powers of Parliament
are  clear  enough.  In other words, it was held to  be	 in-
applicable  here on the view that there was no ambiguity  to
be  resolved  about  the  ordinary  law	 making	 powers	  of
Parliament.   It was applied to interpret the ambit of,	 the
Constituent  power as there was some uncertainty  about	 its
scope.	It, however, seems to me that the test of "free	 and
fair  elections" and of "equality before the law" were	used
by  this  Court	 in judging the	 validity  of  the  impugned
provisions  of	the  <a href="/doc/320017/" id="a_316">Representation of People  Act</a>  in	Smt.
Indira Nehru Gandhi's case (supra) although the majority  of
learned	 judges	 of  the bench preferred to  do	 so  without
characterising these features as parts of a basic  structure
of  the,  Constitution.	  But, when  deciding  the  question
whether	 the purported constitutional amendment	 could	take
away  the powers of this Court to hear and decide on  merits
the  election  appeals pending before it,  all	the  learned
Judges who participated in the decision of that case  seemed
to rely, in varying degrees, either expressly or  impliedly,
upon  the "basic structure" of the Constitution	 itself,  as
revealed by its express provisions, to hold that, under	 the
guise  of  exercising a legislative  power,  the  Parliament
could  not,  in	 effect,  adjudicate on	 the  merits  of  in

constitutional amendments, makeout  limitations	 founded
on the basic structure of the Constitution by very     detailed
references to the express provisions of the Constitution.In
Smt.   Indira  Nehru  Gandhi's case (supra),  parts  of	 the
Constitution
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">86</span>
(Thirty-Ninth  Amendment)  Act	of  1975  were	struck	down
primarily because specific provisions of <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_317">Article 368</a> of	 the
Constitution left no room for doubt that what was  conferred
by  the	 Constitution upon a majority of not less  than	 two
thirds	of  the	 members of the	 two  Houses  of  Parliament
present and voting, supported by resolutions of legislatures
of  not less than one half of the States, was a	 legislative
power  and not a judicial power judged both by its  contents
and  procedure.	 Hence, it was held that, on the very  terms
of  the	 specific power conferred, an exercise	of  judicial
power, in purported exercise of legislative powers contained
in  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_318">Article 368</a> of the Constitution, was prima	facie  ultra
vires.	 Such  exercise	 of  power  contravenes	 the   basic
structure of the Constitution of which the legislative orbit
of  power  indicated by <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_319">Article 368</a> of the  Constitution  is
also  a	 necessary part.  The principle asserted  there	 was
stated by me as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_104">	      "Neither	 of   the   three   constitutionally
	      separate organs of State can, according to the
	      basic  scheme of our Constitution today,	leap
	      outside	 the   boundaries   of	  its	 own
	      constitutionally	assigned sphere or orbit  of
	      authority into that of the other".
</blockquote><p id="p_261">These orbits were expressly chalked out by the law found  in
the Constitution.  There could be no doubt, whatsoever	upon
reading the provisions of the Constitution as a whole,	that
the  orbits  of legislative and judicial power are  not	 the
same.	But, so far as the orbits of legislative  power	 are
concerned, it is clear that those of Parliament and ofthe
State  legislatures  are  not mutually	exclusive  in  every
respect. There	is also a concurrent field of  legislation.
And, there is nothingthere  which could come in the  way
of   the  plenary  legislative	power  conferred  upon	 our
Parliament in fields assigned to it.  These can be  limited,
at the most, by a necessary or unavoidable implication, such
as  the one which must flow from the conferment of  judicial
and  legislative  and  executive  powers  separately,	with
unmistakably   different  characteristics,  upon   different
authorities.   The  basic scheme of the	 Constitution  could
certainly   be	 invoked  to   invalidate   legislation	  by
Parliament, acting in its ordinary law making capacity, on a
subject	 which falls either exclusively within the orbit  of
an  amendment  of "the Constitution" or in List	 II  of	 the
Seventh	 Schedule of exclusively State subjects.  But, as  I
have indicated above, this is not so here.
</p><p id="p_262">Thus,  it is clear that whenever the doctrine of  the  basic
structure  has	been expounded or applied it is	 only  as  a
doctrine  of  interpretation  of  the  Constitution  as	  it
actually exists and not of a Constitution which could  exist
only  subjectively in the minds of different individuals  as
mere theories about what the Constitution is.  The  doctrine
did  not  add to the contents of the Constitution.   It	 did
not,  in  theory, deduct anything from what was	 there.	  It
only purported to bring out and explain the meaning of	what
was already there.  It was, in fact, used by all the  judges
for only this purpose with differing results simply  because
their  assessments or inferences as to what was part of	 the
basic  structure  in  our Constitution	differed.   This,  I
think, is the 'Correct interpretation of the doctrine of the
basic structure of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">87</span>
Constitution.	It  should only be applied if it  is  clear,
beyond	the region of doubt, that What is put forward  as  a
restriction  upon  otherwise clear and	plenary	 legislative
power is there as a Constitutional imperative.
If this be the correct view about the basic structure, as  a
mode  of interpreting the Constitution only,  the  so-called
federalism  as	a  fetter on  legislative  power  must	find
expression  in	some express provision to be  recognised  by
Courts.	 It may be mentioned here that a majority of  Judges
who decided the Kesavananda Bharati's case (supra) have	 not
treated	 "Federalism" as part of the basic structure of	 the
Constitution.  And, none of them has discussed the extent of
the  "federal" part of this structure.	It is not enough  to
point to Article I of the Constitution to emphasize that our
Republic  is a "Union" of States.  That, no doubt  is  true.
But,  the  word	 "union"  was used in  the  context  of	 the
peculiar  character of our federal Republic revealed by	 its
express	 provisions.   We  have still to  find,	 from  other
express	 provisions, what this "Union" means or what is	 the
extent	or  nature  of	"federalism"  implied  by  it.	 The
Constitution  itself does not use the word  "federation"  at
all.	In  any	 case,	after  examining  all  the   express
provisions  of the Constitution, relied upon by the  learned
Counsel for the plaintiff, I am unable to discover there any
such fetter which could, by a necessary implication, prevent
Parliament from enacting <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_320">Section 3</a> of the Act.
Indeed,	 if  the theory of necessary implications is  to  be
applied	  here,	  the,	 entrenched   provisions   of	 our
Constitution, for which a special procedure for amendment is
prescribed  within  <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_321">Article 368</a> itself,	 together  with	 the
other provisions discussed above, give the express limits to
which  the operations of the federal principles is  confined
in  our	 Constitution.	 None  of  the	expressly  mentioned
features  could, by any necessary implication, impinge	upon
the expressly given and distributed legislative powers.	 The
doctrine that express mention excludes that which is not  so
mentioned  applies  also  to express  limitations.   If	 the
scheme	of distribution of legislative powers is  basic	 and
express,  with	its own express	 limitations,  "implied"  or
unspecified alleged limitations going beyond that scheme are
eliminated by the very force of the express provisions.
<a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_322">In Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar &amp;

to  report  on	"the  action which in  the  opinion  of	 the

Seventh Schdule so that the inquiries could be ordered	"for

inquiries themselves.  Furthermore, relying on <a href="/doc/1949862/" id="a_324">Kathi  Raning

this  Court pointed out that even if Bakshi Ghulam  Mohammad
had ceased to be the Chief Minister of the State of Jammu  &amp;
Kashmir	 his past actions would not cease to be	 matters  of
public	importance.  It definitely disapproved the  view  of
the High Court when it said (at p. 407) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_107">	      "These  learned  Judges  of  the	High   Court

	      public,  importance  if he was in	 office	 but
	      they  ceased to be so as he was out of  office
	      when  the Notification was issued.  In  taking
	      this   view,   they  appear  to	have   based

	      Court in <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_328">Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Sri Justice  S.
	      R.   Tendolkar</a>   that  "the  conduct   of	  an

	      make such conduct a definite matter of  public
	      importance,   urgently  calling  for  a	full
	      enquiry".	 The learned Judges felt that  since
	      Bakshi  Ghulam Mohammad was out of office,  he
	      had become innocuous; apparently, it was	felt
	      that  he	could not long threaten	 the  public

before	us  does  not lie at all under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_335">Article	131</a>  of	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_284">I  have	 dealt at length with all the arguments	 which	were
advanced  on  behalf  of the State of  Karnataka  because  I
accept as correct the submission of the learned Counsel	 for
the  plaintiff that the case involves consideration  of	 the
exercise of governmental powers which vest in the Government
of  the State and its Ministers as such vis a vis  those  of
the Central Government. and its Ministers.  They also  raise
questions  relating  to the meaning and the  ambit  and	 the
applicability	of   the  particular   provisions   of	 the
Constitution whose operations are of vital interest to every
State.	  Indeed,   the	 interpretations  given	  to   these
provisions must necessarily be of great concern to the Union
as  well.  They are matters which involve the  interests  of
the  whole of the people of India who gave  unto  themselves
the Constitution whose provisions we have interpreted.
The  Union of India, acting through the Central	 Government,
could be said to represent the whole of the people of India.
The individual States, acting through their Governments	 and
Ministers,  could  be said to represent the people  of	each
individual  State  and their  interests.   When	 differences
arise between the representatives of the State and those  of
the whole people of India on questions of interpretation  of
the Constitution, which must affect the welfare of the whole
people,	 and  particularly that of the people of  the  State
concerned,  it appears to me, with great respect, to be	 too
technical an argument to be accepted by us that a suit	does
not   lie  in  such  a	case  under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_336">Article  131</a>   of	 the

differ	only on the question whether the Government  of	 the

conflict.  There is a lies.  The parties to the dispute	 are
before	us.   We had to decide it and we have done  so.	  It
seems  to  me that a distinction between the State  and	 its
Government  is,	 at the most, one between the whole  and  an
inseparable  part  of the whole. It would be  immaterial  as
regards	 claims	 on  behalf  of	 either	 the  State  or	 its

Even  if  they	could  be  distinctly  separate,  which	  is

	      or fancied which the State Government  chooses
	      to take up on behalf of the State concerned in
	      a suit under Art. 131."
</blockquote><p id="p_287">It  may	 be, explained here that this  observation  was	 not
meant to lay down more than that there would be presumed  to
be  a  nexus between the interests of the State and  of	 the
people it represents when the Government of the State, takes
up   an	 issue	relating  to  the  interpretation   of	 the
Constitution  against an action taken, or, even, as was	 the
case  there, one contemplated by the Central Government.   I
would  like to remove the impression that no such  nexus  is
needed	if the use of the words "actual or fancied", in	 the
observations  quoted  above, create it.	  I  however,  think
that, in the case before us, the nexus between the rival
claims advancedand  the interests of the public of  the
State is reasonably made out. It is a different	 matter
that I do not accept the view put forward onbehalf  of	the
State  of  Karnataka  that  it	alone  and  not	 the   Union
Government  also has the power to set up a Commission  under
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_340">section	 3</a>  of	the, Act on a matter  of  public  importance
primarily concerning the State.
</p><p id="p_288">It  has	 to be remembered that <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_341">Article 131</a> is  traceable  to
section	  204	of  the	 Government  of	 India	 Act.	 The
jurisdiction  conferred	 by it thus originated in  what	 was
part  of the federal structure set up by the  Government  of
India Act, 1935.  It is a remnant of the Federalism found in
that Act. It   should,	 therefore,   be   widely   and
generously interpreted for thatreason	too  so	 as   to
advance the intended remedy. It can be invoked,in      my
opinion,  whenever  a State and other States  or  the  Union
differ	on a question of interpretation of the	Constitution
so  that a decision of it will affect the scope or  exercise
of governmental powers which are attributes of a State.	  It
makes no difference to the maintainability of the action  if
the  powers of the State, which are Executive,	Legislative,
and  Judicial, are exercised through particular	 individuals
as they necessarily must be.  It is true that a criminal act
committed by a Minister,, is no part of his official duties.
But, if any of the organs of the State claim exclusive power
to  take  cognizance  of it, the  State,  as  such,  becomes
interested  in	the dispute about the  legal  competence  or
extent of powers of one of its organs which may emerge.
I do not think that the fact that the State acts through its
Ministers or officials can affectthe maintainability of	 a
suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_342">Article 131</a> of the Constitution. Both    <a href="/doc/1431979/" id="a_343">Article
166(3)</a> of our Constitution  as well as Section 59(3)of
the Government of India Act of 1935 provided for  allocation
of  the business of the Government among the  Ministers	 for
"the  more  convenient transaction of  the  business."	This
implies	 that  the  State can act  not	merely	through	 its
Government as a whole
(1)  A.I.R. 1977 S.C. 1361.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">93</span>
<p id="p_289">but also through its individual Ministers as provided by the
rules.	 Section 49(1) of the Government of India  Act	made
this position absolutely clear by enacting :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_110">	      "The  executive authority of a Province  shall
	      be  exercised on behalf of His Majesty by	 the
	      Governor, either directly or through  officers

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_111">	      The  equivalent to that is <a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_344">Article  154(1)</a>  of
	      our Constitution which reads as follows :
	       "154.  Executive	 power	of  State-.(1)	 The

</blockquote><p id="p_290">In  King-Emperor  v.  Sibnath Banerji &amp;	 Ors.(1)  the  Privy
Council had held that "a Minister is an officer	 subordinate
to  the	 Governor"  for the purposes of Section	 49  of	 the
Government of India Act only.  This observation was no doubt
relied upon by this Court in A. Sanjeevi Naidu ,etc. etc. v.
State of Madras &amp; Anr.(2) with regard to the position of our
Ministers  for	the  purposes  of  <a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_345">Article  154(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution.These  provisions,	 far from  establishing	 any
antithesis  between the official capacity of a Minister	 and
the State for which he acts, only show that, as a  Minister,
he  is	an agent or a limb of the Government of	 the  State,
and,  therefore, he can be treated as an "officer" for	pur-
poses  of <a href="/doc/598144/" id="a_346">Article 154(1)</a> which corresponds to Section 49  of
the  Government	 of  India  Act.   The	result	is  that   a
Minister's official acts cannot be distinguished from  those
of  the State on whose behalf he ;acts.	 With great  respect
for  the  view	of  my learned brethren	 who  seem  to	hold
otherwise,  this  feature cannot make a suit  by  the  State
tinder	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_347">Article 131</a> of the Constitution	 incompetent  merely
because	 it relates to the exercise of a  Minister's  powers
enjoyed	 by  Virtue  of his office.   There  is	 nothing  in

which  must always necessarily act through its	officers  or
agents	or Ministers, from suing the Central Government	 not
only  to protect one of its agents, officers,  or  Ministers
from  being  proceeded against, in any way, by	the  Central
Government,  but to prefer its own claim to exclusive  power
to  deal with him; and, this is what the plaintiff has	done
by means of the suit before us.
</p><p id="p_291">It  is evident that a Minister has been treated, in the	 two

They do not equate or assimilate his status or position with
that  of a Government servant.	In my opinion, the  Minister
of  a State, as the holder of an office provided for by	 the
Constitution is, like a Judge of a High Court, a  "dignitary
of  State"  to use the expression employed  by	Sir  William

<p id="p_294">It  may	 be  possible  sometimes  to  distinguish  a  purely
individual   wrongful  or  criminal  act,  committed  by   a
Minister,  falling entirely outside the scope of  his  legal
authority, as disconnected with his office.  But, even	this
cannot,	 in my opinion, disable the State itself from  suing
for theprotection  of its own authority to deal with  the
Minister concerned. It is, as I have already indicated,
a different matter if  we, hold, aswe  have held  here,
that the claim of the State to have exclusive power to	deal
with its Minister is not sustainable for some reason.  The
right  to  advance a claim, which is all  that	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_349">Article	 131</a>
providesfor,  is to be distinguished from the strength	of
that claim in law.So long   as the claim is of the  State,
the fact that a Minister, in exercisinggovernmental powers,
represents  the State, can make no difference whatsoever  to
the maintainability of the suit by the State.
I  think  that	the State concerned,  which  challenges	 the
validity of the action of the Central Government against one
or  more  of  its Ministers in	respect	 of  acts  involving
exercise  of its governmental powers, would have  sufficient
interest  to  maintain a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_350">Article 131</a>	 because  it
involves  claims  to  what  appertains to  the	State  as  a
"State."  It may be that, if the effect upon the  rights  or
interests of a State, as the legal entity which	 constitutes
the legally set up and recognised governmental	Organisation
of the people residing within certain territorial limits  is
tooremote, indirect, or infinitesimal, upon the facts of a
particular case, wemay	hold  that it is  not  entitled	 to
maintain a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_351">Article 131.</a> But, I do not  think
that we can say that here.

</p><p id="p_305">CHANDRACHUD, J.-Consequent upon the result of the  elections
held  to  the Karnataka Legislative Assembly  in  1972,	 the
Congress  formed the government with Shri D. Devaraj Urs  as
the  Chief  Minister of the State.  That party was  then  in
power at the centre too, but it lost its long held  majority
in the 1977 Lok Sabha elections after which the Janata Party
formed	the  Government	 at the centre.	  However  in  those
elections  to the Lok Sabha, 26 out of 28 seats allotted  to
the State of Karnataka were won by the Congress.
Certain	 opposition  members of the  Karnataka	Legislative,
Assembly  submitted to the Union Home Minister a  memorandum
containing   allegations  of  corruption,  favouritism	 and
nepotism  against the Chief Minister, Shri Devaraj Urs.	  In
response to a request of the Union Home Minister, the  Chief
Minister offered his comments on the allegations but,  while
repelling  the	accusations  as	 frivolous  and	 politically
motivated, the Chief Minister raised a point which forms the
nucleus of the arguments advanced in the suit before us.  He
contended  that	 the,  federal structure  enshrined  in	 the
Constitution is the corner-stone of national integrity; that
the  Constitution is the source of the power of	 the  Centre
and the States; that the exercise of all powers, whether  by
the  Central  Government or by the State  Governments,	must
conform	 to  the scheme of distribution	 of  powers  devised
under the federal scheme of our Constitution that the erring
ministers of State Governments are accountable to the  State
legislature  only; and that, the Central Government  has  no
authority  or  control	over the government of	a  State  in
respect	 of matters which are within the  State's  exclusive
domain,	 save in exceptional times when an emergency  is  in
operation.  The Chief Minister asserted that an enquiry into
the charges levelled against him could only be held by or at
the instance of the State Government.

powers under the Commissionsof Inquiry Act, 1952; that the

inoffice    and	  enjoy	 the  confidence  of  the   State
legislature is destructiveof  the federal  structure  of
the  Constitution and the scheme of distribution  of  powers
provided for under it, that the cabinet system of government
under  which the Council of Ministers is responsible to	 the
legislature  of the State would fail of its purpose  if	 the
Union  executive  were	to assume to itself_  the  power  to
direct	an  inquiry  into  allegations	made  against  State
ministers while they are in office; that the provisions con-
tained in <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_358">section 3</a> of the Act of 1952 cannot be interpreted
so  as	to clothe the Central Government with the  power  to
appoint a Commission for inquiring into matters relatable to
any of the entries in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution, in respect of which Parliament has no power to
make  a	 law  and  the Union  executive	 no  power  to	take
executive  action; that such an interpretation would  render
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_359">section	 3</a> of the Act ultra vires the provisions of Part  XI
of  the	 Constitution  which  deals  exhaustively  with	 the
relations  between the Union and the States; and  that,	 the
report	of  the Inquiry Commission appointed  by  the  Union
Government  cannot serve any useful purpose as	the  Central
Government is incompetent to take any remedial executive  or
legislative  action  against  the  ministers  of  the  State
Government or the State Government itself.
These  contentions  are traversed by the Union of  India  by
its written statement. It  has,	 in  the  first	 instance,
raised a preliminary objection ,,hat thesuit itself  is
not  maintainable  as the appointment of the  Commission  to
inquire into the personal conduct of the Chief Minister	 and
other ministers does not affect any legal right of the State
of  Karnataka.	 It further contends that  the	notification
issued by the State Government neither covers the  questions
comprised in the notification of the Central Government	 nor
does  it  cover ail of the matters mentioned in	 the  latter
notification;  that the Central Government is  competent  to
constitute a Commission to inquire into a definite matter of
public	importance,  namely, the conduct of  a	minister  of
State	Government;  and  that,	 the  appointment   of	 the
Commission  is neither destructive of the federal  structure
of the Constitution nor of any other basic feature thereof.
Three  issues were framed by this Court on these  pleadings.
The  first relates to the maintainability of the  suit,	 the
second	to the question whether the notification  issued  by
the Central Government is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">97</span>
ultra  vires the powers possessed by it under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_360">section  3</a>  of
the Act of 1952 and the third to the contention whether,  if
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_361">section	 3</a>  authorises the Central Government to  issue	 the
impugned   notification,  the  section	itself	is  at	 all
constitutional.
</p><p id="p_309">On  the preliminary objection as to the	 maintainability  of
the  suit,  I prefer to adhere to the view which I  took  in
<a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_362">State  of  Rejasthan  v. Union of  India</a>,  where  a  similar
objection  was raised by the Union Government to  the  suits
filed  by  the State of Rajasthan and certain  other  States
under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_363">article	131</a>  of	 the  Constitution,  challenging   a
directive   of	 the  Union  Home  Minister   advising	 the
dissolution of State Assemblies. I have had the benefit of
perusing the Judgment prepared by brother Untwalia on behalf
of himself and Brethren Shinghal and JaswantSingh in  which
they have taken the view that the Commission of Inquiry set-
up by the Central Government is not against the State or the
State  Government but is against an individual	minister  or
ministers  and since the setting up of the  Commission	does
not involve any invasion of the legal rights of the State or
the  State  Government, the suit is not	 maintainable  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_364">article 131</a> at the instance of the State of Karnataka.	I am
free  to  confess that I have considerably profited  by	 the
judgment of my learned Brethren because their point of view,
with, respect, is not to be overlooked simply because I have
already expressed a contrary opinion in an earlier decision.
But  having given a fresh and closer thought to the  problem
in  the	 light of the view expressed by them  and  a  fuller
argument  advanced  in this case by the	 learned  Additional
Solicitor-General,  I am inclined to the opinion  that	even
taking	a  strictly  legalistic	 view  of  the	matter,	 the
preliminary  objection	to the maintainability of  the	suit
ought to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_310">The  jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_365">article
131</a> of the Constitution should not be tested on the anvil of
banal  rules  which  are applied under	the  Code  of  Civil
Procedure  for determining whether a suit  is  maintainable.
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_366">Article	 131</a> undoubtedly confers 'original jurisdiction'  on
the  Supreme  Court  and  the  commonest  form	of  a  legal
proceeding which is tried by a court in the exercise of	 its
original  jurisdiction	is  a suit.   But  a  constitutional
provision,  which  confers exclusive  jurisdiction  on	this
Court  to  entertain  disputes of a certain  nature  in	 the
exercise  of  its original jurisdiction, cannot	 be  equated
with  a	 provision conferring a right on a  civil  court  to
entertain  a  common  suit so as to  apply  to	an  original
proceeding  under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_367">article 131</a> the canons of a suit which  is
ordinarily triable under section 15 of the Code ofCivil
Procedure  by a court of the lowest grade competent  to	 try
it. Advisedly,	the  Constitution  does	 not  describe	the
proceeding whichmay  be brought under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_368">article 131</a>  as  a
'suit' and significantly, <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_369">article 131</a> uses words and phrases
not commonly employee, for determining the jurisdiction of a
court  of  first instance to entertain and try a  suit.	  It
does not speak of a 'cause of action, an expression of known
and  definite legal import in the world of witness  actions.
Instead,, it employs the word 'dispute,' which is no part of
the  elliptical jargon of law.	But above all,	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_370">article	 131</a>
which  in a manner of speaking is a self-contained  code  on
matters	 falling within its purview, provides expressly	 for
the condition subject to which an action can lie
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">98</span>
under  it.  That condition is expressed by the clause :	 "if
and in so far as the dispute involves any question  (whether
of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of a  legal
right	depends".   By	the  very  terms  of  the   article,
therefore,  the	 sole  condition which	is  required  to  be
satisfied  for	invoking the original jurisdiction  of	this
Court-is  that the dispute between the par-ties referred  to
in  clauses (a) to (c) must involve a question on which	 the
existence or extent of a legal right depends.
The  quintessence of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_371">article 131</a> is that there has to  be  a
dispute	 between the parties regarding a question  on  which
the  existence	or  extent  of a  legal	 right	depends.   A
challenge  by the State Government to the authority  of	 the
Central	 Government  to	 appoint  a  Commission	 of  Inquiry
clearly involves a question on which the existence or extent
of the legal right of the Central Government to appoint	 the
Commission of Inquiry depends and that is enough to  sustain
the proceeding brought by the State under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_372">article 131</a> of the
Constitution.  Far from its being a case of the "omission of
the  obvious", justifying the reading of words into  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_373">article
131</a>  which are not there, I consider that  the	Constitution
has  purposefully  conferred on this  Court  a	jurisdiction
which  is  untrammeled by considerations  which	 fetter	 the
jurisdiction of a court of first instance, which  entertains
and  tries suits of a civil nature.  The very nature of	 the
disputes  arising  under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_374">article 131</a> is different,  both  in
form and substance, from the nature of claims which  require
adjudication in ordinary suits.
</p><p id="p_311">The Constitution aims at maintaining a fine balance not only
between	 the  three organs of power,  the  legislature,	 the
executive and the judiciary, but it is designed to secure  a
similar balance between the powers of the Central Government
and those of the State, Governments.  The legislative  lists
in the Seventh Schedule contain a demarcation of legislative
powers	between	 the  Central and  State  Governments.	 The
executive power of the Central Government extends to matters
with respect to which Parliament has the power to make	Laws
while  that of the State extends to matters with respect  to
which  the  State legislature has the power  to	 make  laws.
Part  XI  of the Constitution is devoted  specially  to	 the
delineation  of relations between the Union and the  States.
That  is a delicate relationship, particularly if  different
political  parties  are in power at the Centre	and  in	 the
States.	  The  object of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_375">article 131</a> is to  provide  a	high
powered	 machinery for ensuring that the Central  Government
and the State Governments act within the respective  spheres
of  their  authority and do not trespass upon  each  other's
constitutional functions or powers.  Therefore, a  challenge
to the constitutional capacity of the 'defendant' to act  in
an  intended manner is enough to attract the application  of
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_376">article	 131</a>, particularly when the 'plaintiff' claims	that
right exclusively for itself.  If it fails to establish that
right,	its challenge may fail on merits but the  proceeding
cannot	be thrown out on the ground that the impugned  order
is  not calculated to affect or impair a legal right of	 the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_312">In an ordinary civil suit, the rejection of a right asserted
by the defendant cannot correspondingly and of its own force
establish   the	 right	claimed	 by  the   plaintiff.	 But
proceedings under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_377">article 131</a> are adjudicatory of the limits
of constitutional power vested in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">99</span>
Central and State Governments.	The claim that the defendant
(the Central Government here) does not possess the requisite
power  involves the assertion that the power to appoint	 the
Commission of Inquiry is vested exclusively in the plaintiff
(the State Government here).  In a civil suit the  plaintiff
has to succeed on the strength of his own title, not on	 the
weakness  of his adversary's because the defendant may be  a
rank  trespasser  and  yet he can lawfully hold	 on  to	 his
possession  against the whole world except the	true  owner.
If,,  the  plaintiff is not the true owner,  his  suit	must
fail.	A  proceeding  under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_378">article  131</a>  stands  in  sharp
contrast  with an ordinary civil suit.	The  competition  in
such a proceeding is between two or more governments--either
the  one or the other possesses the constitutional power  to
act.   There  is  no third alternative as in  a	 civil	suit
wherein	 the  right  claimed by	 the  plaintiff	 may  reside
neither	 in him nor in the defendant but in a  stranger.   A
demarcation  and definition of constitutional power  between
the rival claimants and restricted to them and them alone is
what  a proceeding under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_379">article 131</a>  necessarily  involves.
That  is  how  in  such	 a  proceeding,	 a  denial  of	 the
defendant's  right  carries  with it  an  assertion  of	 the
plaintiff's.
</p><p id="p_313">Firstly,  therefore,  1. am unable to appreciate that  if  a
State Government chaLlenges the constitutional rights of the
Central	 Government to take a particular course	 of  action,
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_380">article	 131</a>  will still not be	 attracted.   Secondly,	 the
contention of the State Government in the present proceeding
is  not	 only that the Central Government has  no  power  to
appoint	 the  Inquiry  Commission  for	inquiring  into	 the
conduct of State Ministers but that such a right is exclusi-
vely  vested in the State Government.  There is,  therefore,
not  only  a  denial of the right  claimed  by	the  Central
Government  but	 an  assertion that  the  right	 exclusively
resides	 in the State Government.  In a sense,	the  instant
case  stands on a stronger footing than the  Rajasthan	Case
because	 there the challenge made by the  State	 Governments
could perhaps be characterised as purely negative in  nature
since  the basic contention was that the Central  Government
had  no power to dissolve the State Assemblies.	  There	 is,
therefore,  an	the greater reason here	 for  rejecting	 the
preliminary objection.
</p><p id="p_314">The  State  of Karnataka has claimed an	 alternative  relief
that  if  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_381">section  3</a> of the Commissions of  Inquiry  Act  is
construed as authorising the Central Government to issue the
impugned  notification,	 it  is	 ultra	vires  as  being  in
violation  of  <a href="/doc/331399/" id="a_382">article	164(2)</a>	and  the  'federal   scheme'
embodied  in the Constitution.	Whether this  contention  is
well  founded  or not is another matter but it seems  to  me
difficult to hold that the State of Karnataka does not	even
have  the  legal right to contend that the  provision  of  a
parliamentary statute authorising the Central Government  to
act in a particular manner is unconstitutional.
The palliative of a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_383">article 226</a> which is
suggested  on behalf of the Union Government as a  sovereign
remedy	in  such  matters is hardly  any  substitute  for  a
proceeding  under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_384">article 131.</a>	 It is notorious  that	writ
petition has its own limitations and indeed many a  petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_385">article 226</a> is rejected with the familiar quip :	"Why
don't  you  file a suit ?" Apart from disputes	between	 the
Government  of	India and a State  Government,	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_386">article	 131</a>
contemplates other per-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">100</span>
<p id="p_315">mutations  and	combinations  in  the  matter  of  array  of
parties.   A dispute between one or more States	 or  between
the Government of India and a State on one hand and  another
State or other States on the other hand cannot appropriately
be decided by a High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_387">article 226</a> and that  could
not have been the intendment of the constitution.   Disputes
of  the	 nature described in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_388">article 131</a> are usually  of  an
urgent nature and their decision can brook no delay.  It  is
therefore  expedient  in the interest of justice  that	they
should,	 as far as possible,, be brought before and  decided
by  this  Court	 so  as to obviate  the	 dilatoriness  of  a
possible  appeal.  An original proceeding decided  by  this.
Court is decided once and for all.
</p><p id="p_316"> For these reasons I reject the preliminary objection raised
by the Union Government and hold that the proceeding brought
by the State of Karnataka is maintainable under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_389">article	 131</a>
of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_317">Another	 point,	 also of a preliminary nature,	may  now  be
disposed  of <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_390">Section 3(1)</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry	 Act
authorises   the  'appropriate	Government'  to	 appoint   a
Commission  of Inquiry for the purpose of making an  inquiry
into  any definite matter of public importance	and  perform
such  functions and within such time as may be specified  in
the  notification.  Clauses (a) and (b) of the	proviso	 to,
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_391">section	 3</a> (1) cut down the width of that power with a	view
to  ensuring  that  the Central	 Government  and  the  State
Governments  do not appoint parallel Commissions which	will
simultaneously	inquire into the ' same matter'.  Since,  in
the instant case, the State of Karnataka had' appointeda
Commission of Inquiry before the Union Government issued the
impugned  notification,	 clause (b) of the proviso  will  be
attracted. That	 clause	 says that if a	 Commission  has
been appointed to inquire into any matter :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_112">	      "(b)  by	a  State  Government,  the   Central
	      Government    shall   not	  appoint    another
	      Commission to inquire into the same matter for
	      so  long	as the Commission appointed  by	 the
	      State  Government is functioning,	 unless
	      the Central Government is of opinion that	 the
	      scope of the inquiry should be extended to two
	      or more states."
</blockquote><p id="p_318">The question for consideration is whether the appointment of
the commission of inquiry by the Central Government violates
the injunction contained in this clause.
</p><p id="p_319">Considering  the  terms of the notifications issued  by	 the
State Government and the Central Government and the  matters
into  which  the  respective  Commissions  are	directed  to
inquire, it seems obvious that the object and purpose of the
two inquiries is basically of different character.  The very
preambles to the two notifications highlight this difference
and show that they are directed to different ends.
The preamble of the Karnataka notification recites :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_113">	      "WHEREAS	allegations  have been made  on	 the
	      floor  of the Houses of the State	 Legislature

	      NOW  THEREFORE  The  Government  of  Karnataka
	      hereby  appoint the Commission of inquiry	 for
	      the purpose of making an inquiry into the said
	      allegations, particularly specified below
	      The   preamble  of  the	Central	  Government
	      notification on the other hand recites :
	      "Whereas the Central Government is of  opinion
	      that  it is necessary to appoint a  Commission
	      of  Inquiry  for	the  purpose  of  making  an
	      inquiry  into  a	definite  matter  of  public
	      importance,  namely,  charges  of	 corruption,
	      nepotism,	   favouritism	  or	misuse	  of
	      Governmental power against the Chief  Minister
	      and  certain other Ministers of the  State  of
	      Karnataka, hereinafter specified.........."
</blockquote><p id="p_320">The  terms of reference of the two commissions disclose	 the
same  fundamental  difference.	The primary  object  of	 the
State	Government  in	appointing  the	 Commission  is	  to
ascertain whether improper or excessive payments were  made,
undue favours were shown, irregularity or fraud had occurred
in the conduct of official business etc; and secondarily  to
find  out  as to "who are the persons  responsible  for	 the
lapses, if any, regarding the aforesaid and to what extent."
On  the other hand, the commission appointed by the  Central
Government is specifically directed to inquire "whether	 the
Chief Minister practised favouritism and nepotism" in regard
to  various  matters mentioned in the notification.  It	 is,
there-fore, wrong for the State Government   to contend that
the  Central  Government  has appointed	 the  Commission  of
Inquiry forthe	purpose	 of  inquiring	into  the  'same
matter'	 into which the Commission of Inquiry  appointed  by
the  State  Govt.  is directed to  inquire.   In  fact,	 the
Central Government notification provides expressly by clause
2  (a)	(ii)  that  the Commission  will  inquire  into	 the
allegation  contained in the memoranda submitted by  certain
members	 of the Karnataka State legislature, "excluding	 any
matter	covered	 by the notification of	 the  Government  of
Karnataka."
</p><p id="p_321">The  argument  that  the two notifications  cover  the	same
matter	suffers	 from  a lack  of  recognition	of  ordinary
political realities.  It is hardly ever possible, except  in
utopian conditions, that the State Government will appoint a
Commission  to inquire into acts of corruption,	 favouritism
and  nepotism  on  the part of its Chief  Minister.   It  is
interesting  that Sir Thomas More coined the  name  'Utopia'
from the Greek	(not) and topos (place) which together	mean
"No place." It is inconceivable that a Commission of Inquiry
will  be  appointed  by	 a  State  Government  without	 the
concurrence  of	 the  Chief Minister and  if  the  political
climate	 is  so hostile that he is obliged to submit  to  an
inquiry	 into  his  own conduct, he will  quit	rather	than
concur.	  Indeed,  a Council of Ministers  which,  considers
that  the  conduct  of its Chief Minister and  some  of	 the
Ministers  requires examination in a public  inquiry,  shall
have  forfeited the confidence of the legislature and  would
ordinarily  have  to  tender  its  resignation.	  Thus,	 the
objection  of the State Government that the notification  of
the  Central  Government offends against clause (b)  of	 the
proviso	 to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_392">section 3(1)</a> of the Act is	factually  unfounded
and theoretically unsound.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">102</span>
<p id="p_322">Having	 disposed  of  the  objections	which  were   of   a
preliminary  nature,  it is necessary now  to  consider	 the
merits of the rival contentions on issues 2 and 3.
Shri Lal Narayan Sinha who appears on behalf of the State of
Karnataka, contends that <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_393">section 3(1)</a> of the Commissions  of
Inquiry	 Act  should  not be construed	as  authorising	 the
Central	 Government to appoint a Commission of	Inquiry	 for
the  purpose  of  inquiring into the conduct  of  a  sitting
minister  of  a State Government.  It is  impossible,  on  a
plain  reading	of the section, to accept  this	 contention.
<a href="/doc/1980457/" id="a_394">Section 2(a)</a> (i)    and (ii) of the Act define	'appropriate
Government' to mean :
</p><p id="p_323">(i)the	Central	 Government, in relation to  a	Commission
appointed  by  it  to  make  an	 inquiry  into,	 any  matter
relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List I or List
II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the  Constitution;
and
</p><p id="p_324">(ii)the	 State	Government,  in relation  to  a	 commission
appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable
to  any of the entries enumerated in List II or List III  in
the  Seventh  Schedule to the  Constitution.   <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_395">Section	3(1)</a>
empowers  the 'appropriate Government' if it is	 of  opinion
that  it  is  necessary	 so  to do,  and  obliges  it  if  a
resolution  in	that behalf is passed by the  House  of	 the
People or the Legislative Assembly of the State as the	case
may  be, to appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the  purpose
of  making  an inquiry into any definite  matter  of  public
importance.   The constitutional considerations	 for  which,
the  learned  counsel contends that <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_396">section 3(1)</a>  should  be
given  a restricted meaning and the minute niceties  of	 his
submission  will  be considered later.	But,  keeping  those
considerations apart for the moment, I see no  justification
for  reading  down the provisions of <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_397">section 3(1)</a> so  as  to
limit  the  power of the Central  Government  to  appointing
Commissions  of	 Inquiry for inquiring into the	 conduct  of
persons in relation to matters concerning the affairs of the
Union  Government only.	 <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_398">Section 3(1)</a> empowers	the  Central
Government  to	appoint a commission for making	 an  inquiry
into  any  definite  matter of	public	importance.   It  is
inarguable   that-the	conduct	 of   ministers	  of   State
Governments  in	 the purported discharge of  their  official
functions  is  not a definite matter  of  public  importance
within	the  meaning of <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_399">section 3(1)</a>.  To  what	 extent	 the
principle   of	federalism  will  be  impaired	by  such   a
construction  will of course have to be examined  with	care
but  I see no substance in the contention that	the  Central
Government does not even possess the power to collect  facts
in regard to allegations of corruption made by a section  of
the State legislature against sitting ministers of the State
Government.   That  power  must	 undoubtedly  be   exercised
sparingly  and	with restraint because under  the  guise  of
directing  an  inquiry	under  <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_400">section	3(1)</a>,  tile  Central
Government  cannot interfere with the day-to-day working  of
the, State Government.	One cannot also contradict that what
appears to be a proper use of power may sometimes contain  a
veiled	abuse  of  power.  howsoever  infinitesimally.	 But
statutory,  construction  cannot  proceed  on  distrust	 and
suspicion  of  those  who  are	charged	 with  the  duty  of
administering  laws.  <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_401">Section 3(1)</a> must, therefore,  receive
its proper construction with the reservation that mala fides
vitiate all acts.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">103</span>
<p id="p_325">Lack  of bona fides was alleged but was not pressed in	this
case.	In  my opinion, therefore, <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_402">section  3(1)</a>  cannot  be
given  a  restricted  meaning, as  canvassed  by  the  State
Government.
</p><p id="p_326">On  this  view, the contention that <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_403">section 3(1)</a>  should  be
read down and the impugned notification should be set  aside
as  falling  outside  the scope of that section	 has  to  be
rejected.   But	 then it is urged by the State that  if	 the
section	 cannot be given a restricted meaning and has to  be
construed  widely so as to authorise the Central  Government
to  direct  the	 holding of inquiries into  the	 conduct  of
sitting	 State	ministers, the provision would	be  rendered
unconstitutional  for a variety of reasons.   Those  reasons
must now be considered.
</p><p id="p_327">It  is	said  in the first place that  if  the	language  of
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_404">section	 3</a> (1) is construed widely, it will not only  enable
the Central Government to appoint a Commission of Inquiry to
inquire	 into  the  conduct of sitting	Ministers  of  State
Governments   but  it  will,  applying	the  same  rule	  of
construction,  also enable the State Government	 to  appoint
similar	 Commissions of Inquiry to inquire into the  conduct
of  the Central Ministers.  This, according to	the  State's
counsel,  would	 offend against the provisions	of  articles
75(3)  and  164(2)  of	the  Constitution.   These  articles
provide	 respectively that the Central Council of  Ministers
shall be collectively responsible to the House of the People
and  the  State Council of Ministers shall  be	collectively
responsible  to the Legislative Assembly of the State.	 The
argument  is  that  the power to  appoint  a  Commission  of
Inquiry	 for  the purpose of inquiring into the	 conduct  of
sitting	 ministers of another Government is  destructive  of
the  principle	of collective responsibility  enunciated  in
these  articles.  This argument is said to  receive  support
from the circumstance that by virtue of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_405">article 194 (3</a>),  it
is the privilege of the Legislative Assembly of the State to
appoint a committee for inquiring into the conduct of any of
its   members,	including  a  minister.	   That	  privilege,
according  to the learned counsel, is as inviolable  as	 the
principle of collective responsibility.
I  find it impossible to accept this  contention.   Articles
75(3) and 164 (2) speak of the collective responsibility  of
the  Council  of Ministers as a body, to the  House  of	 the
People	or the Legislative Assembly of the State.   Whatever
may be the findings of a Commission of Inquiry, the  Council
of  Ministers,	whether	 at the Centre	or  in	the  States,
continues  to be collectively answerable or  accountable  to
the  House  of	the  People  or	 the  Legislative  Assembly.
Indeed,	 neither the appointment of the Commission nor	even
the  rejection	by  the	 Commission of all  or	any  of	 the
allegations  referred to it for its inquiry would  make	 the
Council	 of  Ministers	any the	 less  answerable  to  those
bodies.	 The object of the two articles of the	constitution
on  which the State of Karnataka relies is to  provide	that
for  every  decision taken by the cabinet, each one  of	 the
ministers  is responsible to the legislature concerned.	  It
is difficult to accept that for acts of corruption, nepotism
or  favouritism	 which	are alleged  or	 proved	 against  an
individual minister, the entire Council of Ministers can  be
hold  collectively  responsible to the legislature.   If  an
individual  minister  uses  his office' as  an	occasion  of
pretense for committing acts of corruption, he would be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">104</span>
personally answerable for his unlawful acts and no, question
of  Collective, responsibility of the Council  of  Ministers
can  arise  in such a case.  As observed by Hegde  J.  while
speaking  for  a  constitution Bench of	 this  Court  in  A.
Sanjeevi  Naidu	 etc.  v. State of  Madras  &amp;  Anr.,(1)	 the
essence	 of  collective	 responsibility of  the	 Council  of
Ministers  is  that  the  cabinet  is  responsible  to	 the
legislature for every action taken in any of the ministries.
In  other words, the principle of collective  responsibility
governs	 only  those acts which a minister performs  or	 can
reasonably be said to have performed in the lawful discharge
of his official functions.
</p><p id="p_328">The  history of the principle, of collective  responsibility
in England shows that it was originally developed as against
the  King.  The ministers maintained a common front  against
the  king,  accepted joint and	several	 responsibility	 for
their  decisions whether they agreed with them or  not,	 and
resigned  in  a	 body if the king refused  to  accept  their
advice.	 In relation to, the British Parliament,  collective
responsibility	means  that the cabinet	 presents  a  common
front.	In Melbourne's famous phrase, 'the cabinet ministers
must all say the same thing'.  The principle of	 collective,
responsibility perhaps compels ministers to compromise	with
their  conscience.  but in matters of policy  they  have  to
speak with one voice, each one of them being responsible for
the decision taken by the cabinet.(2)
In his book on "Constitutional and Administrative Law"	(Ed.
1971,  page  175), S.A. de Smith says  that  the  collective
responsibility	of  the cabinet to the House of	 Commons  is
sometimes  spoken of as a democratic bulwark of the  British
Constitution.	According to the learned author,  collective
responsibility	implies	 that all cabinet  ministers  assume
responsibility	for  cabinet decisions and action  taken  to
implement  those decisions.  A minister may disagree with  a
decision or with the manner of its implementation, but if he
wishes to express a dissent in public he should first tender
his resignation.
</p><p id="p_329">While explaining the principle of collective responsibility,
Sir  Ivor Jennings in his book "Cabinet	 Government"  (Third
Ed., 1959 p. 277) says
	      "For  all	 that passes in Cabinet	 (said	Lord
	      Salisbury in 1878) each member of it who	does
	      not  resign  is absolutely  and  irretrievably
	      responsible,  and has no right  afterwards  to
	      say   that  he  agreed  in  one  case   to   a
	      compromise, while in another he was  persuaded
	      by  his  colleagues.  . . It is  only  on	 the
	      principle	 that  absolute	 responsibility	  is
	      undertaken by every member of the Cabinet who,
	      after  a	decision is arrived  at,  remains  a
	      member of it, that the joint responsibility of
	      Ministers to Parliament can be upheld, and one
	      of   the	 most	essential   principles	  of
	      parliamentary responsibility established."

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">105</span>
<p id="p_330">The   learned	author	 says  that   perhaps	Mr.   Joseph
Chamberlain's  definition of collective	 responsibility	 was
better	since  he had occasion to study the matter  both  as
enfant	terrible under Mr. Gladstone and in his	 middle	 age
under Lord Salisbury.  According to Mr. Chamberlain.
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_114">	      "Absolute	 frankness in our private  relations
	      and  full discussion of all matters of  common
	      interest...  the decisions freely	 arrived  at
	      should be loyally supported and considered  as
	      the decisions of the whole of the	 Government.
	      of course there may be occasions in which	 the
	      difference is of so vital a character that  it
	      is   impossible  for  the	 minority  ....	  to
	      continue	their support, and in this case	 the
	      Ministry	breaks up or the minority member  or
	      members resign."
</blockquote><p id="p_331">Thus  the argument that <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_406">section 3(1)</a> of the Act will  offend
against the principle of collective responsibility unless it
is construed narrowly is without any substance.	 As  regards
the suggested involvement of <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_407">article 194(3</a>), in the  absence
of a specific provision in the Constitution that the conduct
of a member of the legislature shall be inquired into by the
legislature  only,  it	is  impossible	to  hold  that	 the
appointment  of	 a  Commission	of  Inquiry  under  the	 Act
constitutes  an	 interference  with  the  privilege  of	 the
legislature.  English precedents relating to the  privileges
of  the House of Commons, which are relevant  under  <a href="/doc/1130308/" id="a_408">article
194(3</a>), do not support the State's contention.
That   disposes	 of  an	 important  limb  of   the   State's
submission.   The other contentions of the State  Government
directed  towards showing that the impugned notification  is
unconstitutional are these :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_115">	      (a)   the	 charges contained in  the  impugned
	      notification  relate to corruption,  nepotism,

	      relation	to the executive powers	 exercisable
	      directly or through subordinate officers	find

</blockquote><p id="p_332">The dominant note of these submissions is one and one only :
that the Central executive cannot, save by a  constitutional
amendment,  be given power to control the functions  of	 the
State  executive  through  the medium  of  a  Commission  of
Inquiry.  Whether Parliament has the competence to pass	 the
impugned legislation in the exercise of its legislative,  as
distinguished  from constituent power is a separate  matter,
but   before  considering  the	validity  of   the   State's
contention  in	that  behalf, it  is  necessary	 to  examine
whether the assumption underlying that contention is at	 all
justified,   namely  that  by  the   impugned	legislation,
Parliament has conferred on the Central Government the power
to control the executive functions of the State	 Government.
For   that  purpose  it	 is  necessary	to  have  a   proper
understanding  of the scheme and purpose of the	 <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_414">Commissions
of  Inquiry  Act</a> and the true effect of its  more  important
provisions.
</p><p id="p_333"><a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_415">The Commissions of Inquiry Act</a> was passed by the  Parliament
in  1952  in  order  to	 provide  for  the  appointment	  of
Commissions  of	 Inquiry and for vesting them  with  certain
powers.	  <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_416">Section 3(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/633902/" id="a_417">section 2</a> (a) of  that	 Act
empowers,  in so far as is relevant, the Central  Government
to  appoint by notification a Commission of Inquiry for	 the
purpose	 of  making an inquiry into any definite  matter  of
public	importance  and	 perform such functions	 as  may  be
specified in the notification.	The Commission has thereupon
to make the inquiry and perform its functions, one of  which
of  course  is	to  submit its	report	to  the	 Government.
<a href="/doc/1661514/" id="a_418">Section	 3(4)</a>  requires that the  Central  Government  shall
cause  to be laid before the House of the People the  report
of  the Commission of Inquiry together with a memorandum  of
the  action taken thereon, within a period of six months  of
the  submission of the report by the commission.  <a href="/doc/631792/" id="a_419">Section  4</a>
confers on the Commission some of the powers possessed by  a
civil  court  while  trying  a	suit,  like  enforcing	 the
attendance  of witnesses, examining them on oath,  discovery
and   production   of  documents,  receiving   evidence	  on
affidavits  requisitioning any public record,  etc.   Having
regard	 to  the  nature  of  the  inquiry  and	 the   other
circumstances of the case, the Government can under  <a href="/doc/1012112/" id="a_420">section
5(1)</a>  direct that all or any of the provisions contained  in
sub-sections (2), (3) (4) and (5) of <a href="/doc/1113701/" id="a_421">section 5</a>
<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_422"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">108</span></a>
shall  apply to the Commission.	 Some of these	sub-sections
empower	 the  Commission to require any	 person	 to  furnish
information to the Commission and to enter into any building
or  place where any document relating to the subject  matter
of the inquiry may be found.  For the purpose of  conducting
any   investigation   pertaining  to   the   inquiry,	the.
Commission  by	<a href="/doc/1401198/" id="a_423">section 5A</a> can utilise the services  in	 the
case of a Commission appointed by the Central Government, of
any   officer  or  investigation  agency  of   the   Central
Government.
</p><p id="p_334">It is clear from these provisions and the general scheme  of
the Act that a Commission of Inquiry appointed under the Act
is  a  purely  fact-finding  body  which  has  no  power  to
pronounce,  a  binding or definitive judgment.	 It  has  to
collect	 facts through the evidence led before it and  on  a
consideration  thereof it is required to submit	 its  report
which the appointing authority may or may not accept.  There
are sensitive matters of public importance which, if left to
the  normal  investigational agencies, can  create  needless
controversies and generate an atmosphere of suspicion.	 The
larger interests of the community require that such  matters
should	 be  inquired  into  by	  high-powered	 commissions
consisting  of	persons	 whose	findings  can  command	 the
confidence  of	the people.  In his address  in	 the  Lionel
Cohen  Lectures, Sir Cyril Salmon speaking on "Tribunals  of
Inquiry" said :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_123">	      "In  all countries, certainly in	those  which
	      enjoy  freedom  of speech and  a	free  Press,
	      moments  occur  when allegations	and  rumours
	      circulate	 causing  a  nation-wide  crisis  of
	      confidence in the integrity of public life  or
	      about   other   matters	of   vital    public
	      importance.  No doubt this rarely happens, but
	      when  it	does  it is  essential	that  public
	      confidence should be restored, for without  it
	      no   democracy   can   long   survive.	This
	      confidence can be effectively restored only by
	      thoroughly   investigating  and  probing	 the
	      rumours  and allegations so as to	 search	 out
	      and  establish the truth.	 The truth may	show
	      that  the evil exists, thus enabling it to  be
	      noted  out, or that there is no foundation  in
	      the rumours and allegations by which the pubic
	      has  been disturbed.  In either  case,  confi-
	      dence is restored."
</blockquote><p id="p_335">A  police investigation is, at its very best,  a  unilateral
inquiry into an accusation since the person whose conduct is
the subject-matter of inquiry has no right or opportunity to
cross-examine	the  witness  whose  statements	 are   being
recorded by the police.	 <a href="/doc/606986/" id="a_424">Section 8C</a> of the Act, on the other
band, confers the right of cross-.examination, the right  of
audience  and  the right of representation through  a  legal
practitioner on the appropriate Government, on every  person
referred  to  in <a href="/doc/1236777/" id="a_425">Section 8B</a> and with the permission  of	 the
Commission,  on any other person whose evidence is  recorded
by the Commission.  Clauses (a) and (b) of <a href="/doc/1236777/" id="a_426">Section 8B</a>  refer
respectively   to  persons  whose  conduct  the	  Commission
considers  it  necessary to inquire into and  persons  whose
reputation,  in the opinion of the Commission, is likely  to
be prejudicially affected by the Inquiry.  It is  undeniable
that the person whose conduct is being inquired into and  if
the  be	 a Chief Minister or a Minister, the doings  of	 the
government  itself,  are  exposed to  the  fierce  light  of
publicity.   But that is a risk which is inherent  in  every
inquiry directed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">109</span>
at finding out the truth.  It does not, however, justify the
specious   submission  that  the  inquiry   constitutes	  an
interference  with  the	 executive functions  of  the  State
Government or that it confers on the ,Central Government the
power  to  control  the functions of  the  State  executive.
After all, it is in the interest of those against whom	open
allegations  of corruption and nepotism are made  that	they
should	have an opportunity of repelling  those	 allegations
before a trained and independent Commission of Inquiry which
is  not hide-bound by the technical rules of evidence.	 "It
is  only  by  establishing the truth  that  the	 purity	 and
integrity  of public life can be preserved" and that is	 the
object	which  the  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_427">Commissions	 of  Inquiry  Act</a>  seeks  to
achieve.
</p><p id="p_336"><a href="/doc/819726/" id="a_428">In M. V. Rajwade v. Dr. S. M. Hassan &amp; Ors</a>.,(1) it was	held
by  the Nagpur High Court that <a href="/doc/631792/" id="a_429">section 4</a> of the	 Act  merely
clothes the Commission with certain powers of a civil  court
but does not confer on it the status of a court and that the
Commission is only fictionally a civil court for the limited
purposes  enumerated  in <a href="/doc/1548817/" id="a_430">section 5(4)</a>.	The  Court  observed
that there is no accuser, no accused and no specific charges
for  trial  before the Commission, nor	is  the	 Government,
under the law, required to pronounce one way or the other on
the findings of the Commission.. In other words,
	      "The Commission governed by the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_431">Commissions of
	      Inquiry  Act</a>, 1952 is appointed by  the  State
	      Government  'for	the information of  its	 own
	      mind......... it is, therefore, a fact finding
	      body  meant only to instruct the mind  of	 the
	      Government without producing any document of a
	      judicial nature."
</p><p id="p_337">These  observations were extracted and quoted with  approval
by this Court in <a href="/doc/1776469/" id="a_432">Brajnandan Sinha v. Jyoti Narain</a>.(2)
It  is,	 therefore,  clear  that  the  power  conferred	  by
Parliament on the Central Government to appoint a Commission
of Inquiry under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_433">section 3</a> (1) of the Act for the purpose of
finding	 facts in regard to the allegations  of	 corruption,
favouritism and nepotism against a sitting Chief Minister or
ministers cannot be held to constitute interference with the
executive functions of the State Government.  On receipt  of
the  Commission's report, the Central Government may or	 may
not  take  any	action, depending upon	the  nature  of	 the
findings recorded by the Commission.  If it decides to	take
any  action. the validity thereof may have to be  tested  in
the light of the-constitutional provisions.  But until	that
stage  arrives,	 it is difficult to hold  that	the  Central
Government  is exercising any control or supervisory  juris-
diction	  over	 the  executive	 functions  of	 the   State
Government.   As observed by this Court in <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_434">Shri Ram  Krishna
Dalmia	v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar &amp; Others</a>,  (a)	"the
Commission  has	 no power of adjudication in  the  sense  of
passing an order which can be enforced proprio vigore".

<p id="p_340">Thus, the very assumption on which the State's counsel,	 has
built  up  the	edifice of his argument seems to  me  to  be
fallacious.  The, rejection of that assumption furnishes  at
once  an answer to most of his other submissions but,  since
the  matter  has  been	argued	on  both  sides	 fully	 and
earnestly,  it is desirable to consider all the	 rival	con-
tentions and set the dispute at rest.
</p><p id="p_341">The  next limb of Shri Sinha's argument is that India  is  a
Union  of States and that one must, while  interpreting	 the
Constitution, have regard to the essential features and	 the
general scheme of our federal or quasi-federal	Constitution
by  which, the powers of the Union' of India and the  States
are  clearly  defined  and demarcated.	 Quoting  a  learned
author	on "Constitutional Law of India" Vol. 1, page  1074,
counsel contends that to hold otherwise would mean that	 the
Union	executive  would  effectively  control	 the   State
executive,  which  is  opposed to the basic  scheme  of	 our
federal Constitution.
</p><p id="p_342">The  statement	from the "Constitutional Law  of  India"  on
which counsel relies is out of context because it occurs  in
relation to the question whether in dismissing the  ministry
or  in dissolving the legislature, the Governor acts  as  an
agent  of  the	President or under  his	 directions.   While
expressing  the	 opinion that a responsible  Union  ministry
would not be justified in advising the removal of a Governor
merely	because he takes action which does not fall in	line
with  the policy of the Union ministry, the  learned  author
says  that any other view would vest in the Union  executive
effective control over the State executive, which is opposed
to the basic scheme of our federal Constitution.  Apart from
the  consideration that the statement relied upon is out  of
context,  I  have already rejected the submission  that	 the
appointment  by	 the Central Government	 of  a	fact-finding
Commission  of	Inquiry for inquiring into  the	 conduct  of
sitting	 State	Ministers can be deemed	 to  vest  effective
control	 over the State executive in the Central  executive.
Counsel's  submission shall, therefore have to	be  examined
keeping aside this aspect of the matter.
</p><p id="p_343">India,	undoubtedly, is a Union of States and that  is	what
<a href="/doc/1200881/" id="a_435">article	  1(1)</a>	of  our	 Constitution  expressly   provides.
Whether	 we describe our Constitution as federal  or  quasi-
federal,  one  cannot ever blind ones vision  to  the  stark
reality	 that India is a Union of States.  The	Constitution
contains  a  carefully	conceived  demarcation	of   powers,
legislative and executive, between the Central Government on
the  ons hand and the State Governments on the	other.	 The
balance of that power ought never to be disturbed, but	that
is  a different thing from saying that inherent	 or  implied
limitations  should be read into legislative powers or	that
because	 India is a Union of States, one must read into	 the
Constitution powers and provisions which are not to be found
therein but which may seem to follow logically from what the
Constitution provides for expressly.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">111</span>
<p id="p_344">The  first  question  which  one  must	tackle	is   whether
Parliament  has	 the  legislative competence  to  enact	 the
<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_436">Commissions  of	 Inquiry Act</a>, 1952.  This  question,  in  my
opinion, is concluded by a judgment of a Constitution ]Bench
of  this Court in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia (supra)  in  which
the  validity of the very Act was challenged in a matter  in
which  a notification was issued by the	 Central  Government
under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_437">section 3</a> of the Act for inquiring into the affairs of
certain	  companies.   It  was	held  by  this	Court	that
Parliament  had the legislative competence to pass  the	 law
under  entry  94 of List I and entry 45 of List III  of	 the
Seventh	 Schedule of the Constitution.	Entry 94 of  List  I
relates	 to  "Inquiries,  surveys  and	statistics  for	 the
purpose of any of the matters" in List I, while entry 45  of
List  III  relates  to "Inquiries  and	statistics  for	 the
purposes of any of the matters specified in List II or	List
III". It   is  well-established	 that  entries	in   the
legislative lists must receivenot a narrow or  pedantic
but a wide and liberal construction and,considered from
that point of view, the word 'inquiries' which occurs in the
two  entries must be held to cover the power to pass an	 Act
providing for appointment of Commissions of Inquiry.  It  is
in the exercise of this power that the Parliament has passed
the  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_438">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952.	Since the  power  to
appoint a Commission to Inquire into the conduct of  sitting
ministers of State Governments which is comprehended  within
<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_439">section	 3(1)</a>  of  the	Act  does  not	offend	against	 the
principle  of  collective  responsibility  ,of	the  State's
Council of Ministers or against the privileges of the Legis-
lative	Assembly  and since it does not also confer  on	 the
Central	 Government  the  power of control  over  the  State
executive, the provision must be held to be a valid exercise
of the legislative competence of the Parliament.
Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia (supra) in so far as it decides that
the  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_440">Commissions  of  Inquiry Act</a>,  1952  falls	 within	 the
legislative competence of the Parliament in view of entry 94
of  List I and entry 45 of List Ill must, with respect,	 be`
affirmed and accepted as good law.  I may, however, add that
if for any reason it were to appear, which it does not, that
these  entries	do not justify the passing of the  Act,	 the
residuary entry 97 of List I will in any- event support	 the
legislative  validity  of the Act.  That  entry	 confers  on
Parliament  the power to legislate on 'Any other matter	 not
enumerated in List II or List Ill........ Entry 97 is in the
nature of a residuary entry and the words 'Any other matter'
which  appear  therein	mean 'Any matter  other	 than  those
enumerated  in	List  I'.  If entry 94 does  not  cover	 the
impugned Act, 'Inquiries' of the nature contemplated by	 the
Act will fall within the description 'Any other matter'; and
if  entry 45 of List III and, admittedly, the whole  of	 the
State List are to be kept out of consideration, the Act will
relate to 'a matter not enumerated in List II or List  III'.
Shri  Sinha  objected to recourse being had to entry  97  of
List  I	 on the ground that it cannot, any more	 than  other
entries	 in Lists I and II, confer on Parliament the  power
to  make a law vesting in the Central executive	 supervisory
control	 over the State executive.  That  contention  having
been  rejected,	 entry	97 will in  any	 event	sustain	 the
legislative validity of the Act.
</p><p id="p_345">It  is unnecessary to consider the implications	 of  <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_441">article
248</a> because that may require an examination of the question,
which is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">112</span>
needless  here in view of the decision in Shri	Ram  Krishna
Dalmia, (supra) whether that article confers power which  is
not to be found in <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_442">article 246(1)</a> read with entry 97 of List
I  and whether an affirmative answer to this  question	will
render entries 1 to 96 of List I otiose.  One may sum up the
discussion  on	the  question  of  Parliament's	 legislative
competence  by saying that adopting "the  construction	most
beneficial  to	the  widest possible  amplitude"  of  powers
conferred   by	 the  Constitution  and	  interpreting	 the
legislative  entries  in "a broad and liberal  spirit",	 the
impugned  Act  cannot  be  held	 to  suffer  from  want	  of
legislative  competence,  in  the Parliament  to  enact	 it.
Entry 94 of List I, entry 45 of List III and failing  these,
entry 97 of List I must sustain the Act.
</p><p id="p_346">That  disposes of points (a) to (e) set out  above,  leaving
for consideration points (f), (g) and (h).  For the sake  of
easy  reference,  these points may be  summarised  thus	 (i)
Administrative	relations between the Union and	 the  States
are dealt with in Chapter 11 of Part XI of the Constitution;
</p><p id="p_347">(ii)  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_443">The Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, as interpreted  above,
purports  to supplement the provisions contained in  Chapter
II,   Part  XI;	 (iii)	Parliament  cannot  supplement	 any
provision of the Constitution except by an amendment of	 the
Constitution; (iv) <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_444">The Commissions of Inquiry Act</a> creates  a
new  Centre,-State  relationship by vesting in	the  Central
executive  an  added control over the  State  executive	 not
provided  for in the Constitution, and (v) Since the  provi-
sions  contained in Chapter 11 of Part XI are exhaustive  of
matters, governing the administrative relations between	 the
Union  and the States, any legislative addition	 thereto  or
supplementing	thereof	 must  be  held	 to   be   impliedly
prohibited.
</p><p id="p_348">The  short  answer  to the first four points,  (i)  to	(iv)
above,	is  that  though  it  is  true	that  administrative
relations between the Union and the States are dealt with by
Chapter	 II  Part  XI of the  Constitution  and	 though	 the
provisions  contained  therein cannot be altered save  by  a
constitutional	amendment,  the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_445">Commissions of	Inquiry	 Act</a>
does  not  bring  about	 any  change  in  the	Centre-State
relationship  as  envisaged  by Part  XI.   The	 Act  merely
empowers  the Central Government to appoint a Commission  of
Inquiry	 for the purpose of collecting facts with a view  to
informing  its own mind; and the report of  the	 Commission,
not  being  binding  on any one, has no force  of  its	own.
Revelations before the Commission may conceivably produce an
impact	on the credibility of the State Government, but	 the
inquiry	 is  directed not to the manner in which  the  State
Government  or	the State executive conducts itself  in	 the
discharge of its constitutional functions but to the  manner
in which, if at all, its ministers have used their office as
a  cloak for committing acts of corruption and	favouritism.
It is possible that a Commission may accept the	 accusations
against	 the  minister and in fairness	emphasise  that	 the
private	 doings of the minister have nothing to do with	 the
public	administration	of the	States'	 executive  affairs.
Indeed, the Commission may reject the allegations as totally
baseless and frivolous.	 These are all imponderable and they
cannot	influence the decision of the basic question  as  to
the  nature of the Commission's functions.   Therefore,	 the
contention that by empowering the Central
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">113</span>
Government  to appoint a Commission for inquiring  into	 the
conduct	 of  the  sitting  ministers  of  State	 Government,
Parliament  has legislated on the Centre-State	relationship
which is a constitutional subject, is without any force.
However,  it is necessary to say a word about  the  somewhat
novel  argument	 of the State Government that,	by  ordinary
legislation,   the  Parliament	cannot	even  supplement   a
constitutional provision, unless the Constitution  expressly
authorises it to do so.	 Ordinary legislation, as  contended
by  the learned Additional Solicitor-General, has to  answer
only two tests : Firstly, the law must be within the  legis-
lative competence of the legislature, and secondly, the	 law
must  not  offend  against the provisions  of  Part  III  or
infringe  any other specific provision of the  Constitution.
Once  the  legislative	competence  is	established  and  no
violation  of any specific constitutional provision is	made
out,  the  validity  of the Act cannot be  assailed  on	 the
ground	that  it 'supplements' a  constitutional  provision.
The  fallacy  of  the  State's	argument  consists  in	the,
assumption  that every law "in respect of" a  subject-matter
dealt  with  by the Constitution amounts necessarily  to  an
amendment  of the Constitution.	 An illustration or two	 may
help clarify the true position.	 <a href="/doc/462904/" id="a_446">Article 297</a> of the  Consti-
tution	provides that all lands , minerals and other  things
of value underlying the ocean within the territorial  waters
or  the continental shelf of India shall vest in  the  Union
and be held for the purposes of the Union.  It is inarguable
that  since  "lands,  minerals and  other  things  of  value
underlying  the ocean within the territorial waters  or	 the
continental shelf of India" is the subject matter of <a href="/doc/462904/" id="a_447">article
297</a>,  no  legislature,	even  if  it  possesses	 legislative
competence  to do so, can legislate on that  subject-matter.
It   is	 elementary  that  the	legislature  cannot,   while
legislating  on	 a topic enumerated in	the  relevant  list,
violate or infringe any provision of the Constitution.	 But
so long as there is no such infringement, legislation on the
subject	 dealt	with  by  <a href="/doc/462904/" id="a_448">article  297</a>	cannot	be  declared
unconstitutional  on  the  ground that	it  supplements	 the
provisions of that article.  <a href="/doc/1084525/" id="a_449">Article 299</a> of the Constitution
deals  with  contracts.	 It seems to me	 equally  inarguable
that  a	 legislation  dealing  with  the  subject-matter  of
contracts,   even   though  not	  lacking   in	 legislative
competence, becomes unconstitutional for the reason that  it
deals with the subject-matter of contracts.  The argument of
the  State  in	this behalf is therefore  wholly  devoid  of
substance,  apart from the consideration that  the  impugned
legislation does not bear on the Centre-State relationship.
The  fifth and the last contention is also capable of  being
disposed of with the answer that the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_450">Commissions of  Inquiry
Act</a>   does  not	 deal  with  the  subject  of	Centre-State
relationship, directly or indirectly.  There is,  therefore,
no  question of its creating a new relationship between	 the
Union  and  the	 States not known  to  the  Constitution  or
inconsistent  with that provided for in Chapter II, Part  XI
of  the Constitution.  Not only that the pith and  substance
of the Act is "Inquiries", but it does not even incidentally
encroach or trespass upon a constitutional field occupied by
Part XI.  If it does not touch the subject-matter of Centre-
State  relationship, there is no question of  its  impinging
upon a subject dealt with by the Consti-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">114</span>
<p id="p_349">tution.	  Therefore, even assuming that legislation  on	 the
question  of Centre-State relationship is impliedly  barred,
the impugned Act does not fall within the vice of that	rule
and cannot, therefore, be pronounced as unconstitutional.
All  the  same,	 it  is necessary  to  examine	briefly	 the
validity of the State's contention that since the provisions
in Chapter II, Part Xi are exhaustive, of matters  governing
the  administrative  relations	between the  Union  and	 the
States,	 any legislative addition thereto, or  supplementing
thereof, if impliedly prohibited.  As already observed,	 _if
a   law	  is  within  the  legislative-competence   of	 the
legislature,  it  cannot  be invalidated  on  'the  supposed
ground that it. has added something to, or has supplemented,
a  constitutional  provision  so long  as  the	addition  or
supplementation	 is not inconsistent with any  provision  of
the Constitution.  I am, therefore, unable to appreciate the
relevance  of  the  State's reliance  on  the  passage	from
Crawford's  Statutory Construction (Ed. 1940 pages  334-335)
to  the effect that if a statute enumerates the things	upon
which it has to operate, everything else is necessarily	 and
by  implication excluded from its operation and its  effect.
As I have said more than once in my judgment, the one common
thread which runs through the argument of the State is	that
the Constitution must be deemed to have impliedly prohibited
the imposition of the control of the Central executive	over
the  State  executive except in emergencies, and  since	 the
<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_451">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a> transgresses that  constitutional
prohibition,   it  is  void.   The  very  assumption   being
unfounded,  the	 supposed consequence has  to  be  rejected.
Besides,  the  doctrine	 of  implied  prohibition  which  is
necessarily  based on the principle of inherent	 limitations
has  been rejected by this Court in the	 Fundamental  rights
case(1)	 and  in <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_452">Shrimati Indira Nehru Gandhi  v.  Shri	 Rai

</p><p id="p_350">I  am, therefore, of the opinion that though the suit  filed

that the Act is not unconstitutional for any of the  reasons

</p><p id="p_351">BHAGWATI,  J.-I	 entirely  agree  with	the  judgment	just
delivered  by my learned brother Chandrachud so, far as	 the

question of maintainability of the suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_455">Article 131</a> of

separate judgment, not only because the constitutional issue
it raises is one of some importance, but also because I find
that though there was some discussion in regard to the scope
and ambit of this article in the judgment delivered by me on

<p id="p_352">v.   Union of India(1) it did not take into account  certain
aspects of the, question and a fuller consideration appeared
to be clearly necessary.  The facts giving rise to the	suit
are set out in detail in the judgment pronounced by my	Lord
the  Chief  Justice  and  hence	 it  is	 not  necessary	  to
reiterate-them.	 Suffice it to state that the Suit has	been
filed  by the State of Karnataka against the Union of  India
to  quash  a notification issued by the	 Central  Government
setting	 up a Commission to inquire into certain charges  of
corruption and nepotism against the Chief Minister and	some
other ministers of the State of Karnataka.  The question  is
whether	 the  suit  is maintainable under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_456">Art.	131</a>,  for  a
preliminary  objection	against the maintainability  of	 the
suit  has been raised by the _ learned Additional  Solicitor
General on behalf of the Union of India.
</p><p id="p_353">The  answer  to the question depends primarily on  the	true
interpretation	of  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_457">Art. 131.</a>  This article confers  on	 the
Supreme	 Court,	 subject  to the  other	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution,	exclusive  original   jurisdiction  in	 any
dispute-(a) between the Government of India and one or	more
States, or (b) between the Government of India and     any
State or States on one side and one or more other States on
the  other, or (c) between two or more States, if and in  so
far as the     dispute involves any question (whether of law
or fact) on which the	 existence  or	extent	of  a  legal
right  depends.	  It  is clear on a plain  reading  of	this
article	 that  it does not lay down any particular  mode  of
proceeding   for  exercise  of	the  original	jurisdiction
conferred  by it.  No doubt, Part III of the  Supreme  Court
Rules  contemplates  that the Original jurisdiction  of	 the
Supreme	 Court under this article shall be invoked by  means
of  a suit, but that is not the requirement of	the  article
and  in interpreting it, we should be careful not  to  allow
,our  approach to be influenced by considerations of  'cause
of action' which are germane in a suit.	 The scope and ambit
of the original jurisdiction must be determined on the plain
terms of the article without being inhibited by any a priori
considerations.
</p><p id="p_354">Now,  plainly  there are two limitations in  regard  to	 the
dispute which can be brought before the Supreme Court  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_458">Article	 131.</a>  One is in regard to parties and the other  is
in regard to the subject-matter.  The article provides in so
many  terms that the dispute must be between the  Government
of  India  and	one or more States or between  two  or	more
States.	 The object of the article seems to be that since in
a   federal   or   quaasi-federal   structure,	 which	 the
Constitution seeks to set up, disputes may arise between the
Government of India; and one or more States, or between	 two
or  more  States,  a  forum  should  be	 provided  for	 the
resolution  of	such disputes and that forum should  be	 the
highest	 Court	in the land, so that final  adjudication  of
such  disputes could be achieved speedily and  expeditiously
without	 either party having to embark on a  long,  tortuous
and  time consuming journey through a hierarchy	 of  Courts.
The  article  is a necessary concomitant of a federal  or  a
quasi-federal  form of Government and it is  attracted	only
when the parties to the dispute are the Government of  India
or  one or more States arrayed on either side.	This is	 the
limitation  as	to  parties.  The  other  limitation  as  to
subject-matter flows from the
(1)A.T.R. 1977 S.C. 1361.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">116</span>
<p id="p_355">words "if and in so far as the dispute involves any question
(whether of law or fact) on which the existence or extent of
a  legal right depends".  These words clearly indicate	that
the dispute on affecting the existence or extent of a  legal
right and not a dispute on the political plane not involving
a  legal aspect.  It was put by Chandrachud, J., very  aptly
in his judgment in the <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_459">State of Rajasthan v. Union of  India</a>
(supra)	 when he said : "Mere wrangles	between	 governments
have  no place under the scheme of that article. It is	only
when a legal, as distinguished from a mere political,  issue
arises	touching  upon the existence or extent	of  a  legal
right that the article is attracted.  Hence the suit in	 the
present	 case would obviously not be maintainable unless  it
complies with both these limitations.
</p><p id="p_356">The  contention of the learned Additional Solicitor  General
on  behalf  of	the Union of India was	that  the  test	 for
determining the maintainability of the suit was not  whether
the  right of the Central Government to set up a  Commission
of  Inquiry against the, Chief Minister and other  ministers
of  the State of Karnataka was questioned in the  suit,	 but
whether	 the  impugned	action	of  the	 Central  Government
infringed  any	legal  right  of the  State.   Even  if	 the
impugned action of the Central Government were invalid and I
must  assume  it  to  be  so  in  order	 to  determine	 the
maintainability	 of  the suit the question is  as  to  whose
legal  right would be infringed : who would have a cause  of
action ? Can the State say that its legal right is infringed
and  is	 therefore,  entitled to maintain  the	suit  ?	 The
learned	 Additional Solicitor General submitted	 that  since
the  impugned action of the Central Government was  directed
against the Chief Minister and other ministers of the State,
the  legal  right  infringed  would be	that  of  the  Chief
Minister  and the concerned ministers and they would have  a
cause of action against the Union of India since they  would
be  prejudicially  affected by the executive action  of	 the
Central	 Government which is alleged to be in  contravention
of the Constitution and the law.  They have a legal right to
immunity from subjection to the unconstitutional exercise of
power by the Central Government and this right can certainly
be enforced by them.  But that would be by way of a petition
under  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_460">Article 226</a> or <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_461">Article 32</a>, if a fundamental right  is
involved, and not under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_462">Art. 131.</a>  Even the State Government
may be said to have a cause of action on the ground that the
impugned  action  of  the  Central  Government	affects	 its
personnel,  namely, the Chief Minister and  other  ministers
and  the  State Government may legitimately  claim  to	have
sufficient interest to maintain a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_463">Art. 226</a> to
challenge  the impugned action.	 But it cannot file  a	suit
under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_464">Article	131</a> because it is only the State  which	 can
maintain  such	a suit and not the  State  Government.	 The
learned	 Additional  Solicitor General	contended  that	 the
expression  used  in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_465">Article 131</a> is 'State' and	 not  "State
Government"  and there is a fundamental distinction  between
'State'	 and  'State Government' and it is,  therefore,	 not
enough to attract the applicability of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_466">Article 131</a> that	 the
State  Government should have a cause of action.  It is	 the
State whose legal right must be infringed and who must	have
a cause of action in order to invoke the jurisdiction  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_467">Article 131.</a>  The impugned action of the Central  Government
in the present case, argued the learned Additional Solicitor
General, affects the legal right of the Chief Minister
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">117</span>
and  the concerned Ministers and also possibly of the  State
Government, but it does not infringe the legal right-of	 the
State as a legal entity as distinct from the legal right  of
its  executive agent, namely, the State Government  and	 the
State is, therefore, not entitled to maintain the suit under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_468">Article	 131.</a>	This contention of  the	 learned  Additional
Solicitor  General is, in my opinion, not well	founded	 and
cannot be sustained.
</p><p id="p_357">There  are  two fallacies underlying the contention  of	 the
learned	 Additional Solicitor General.	One is in drawing  a
rather	rigid,	watertight distinction between	'State'	 and
'State	Government'  in the context of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_469">Article 131</a>  and	 the
other,	in assuming that it is only where a legal  right  of
the  plaintiff is infringed that the suit can be  maintained
by  the plaintiff under that article.  Turning first to	 the
distinction  between  'State' and 'State Government,  it  is
true  that theoretically this distinction does exist and  it
finds recognition in sub-.sections (58) and (60) of  <a href="/doc/174566148/" id="a_470">section
3</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897.  The majority judges  in
the  <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_471">State  of	Rajasthan v. Union  of	India</a>  (supra)	also
accepted  that	there is a distinction between	'State'	 and
'State	 Government'.	 Willoughby  points  out   in	"The
Fundamental  Concepts  of  Public  Law"	 at  page  49:	"The
distinction   between  the  State  and	its  Government	  is
analogous  to  that between a given human individual,  as  a
moral  and  intellectual person, and his  material  physical
body.	By  the	 term 'State' is  understood  the  political
person	or entity which possesses the law making right.	  By
the term 'Government' is understood the agency through which
the will of the State is formulated, expressed and executed.
The Government thus acts as the machinery of the State,	 and
those  who operate this machinery-act as the agents  of	 the
State'.	 And to the same effect are the observations, of the
United States Supreme Court in Poindexter v. Greenhow :	 (1)
"The State itself is an ideal person, intangible,  invisible
and  immutable.	  The Government is an agent. . .  .  ".  It
would  thus be seen that the State Government is  the  agent
through which the State exercises its executive power.	Now,
if  the	 State Government is the agent	through	 which	the-
State  expresses  its will, it is difficult to see  how	 the
State  can  be	said to be unconcerned	when  any  right  or
capacity   or  lack  of	 it  is	 attributed  to	 the   State
Government.  It would be wholly unrealistic to suggest	that
since  the State Government is distinct from the State,	 any
action	or  capacity or lack of it in the  State  Government
would  not  affect  the State and the  State  would  not  be
interested  in	it.  This is to ignore	the  integral  rela-
tionship  between  the 'State' and the	'State	Government'.
Any  action  which  affects  the  State	 Government  or	 the
ministers  in  their  capacity	as  ministers-for  in	that
capacity  they would be acting on behalf of the	 State-would
raise a matter in which the State would be concerned.  It is
true that analogies and metaphors are apt to mislead and  it
would  be  unsafe  to base an argument	upon  them,  but  to
reinforce what I have said, I may take the analogy given  by
Willoughby in the above quoted passage and ask the  question
:  if any action or capacity or lack of it is attributed  to
the "material physical body", would it not be ascribable  to
the individual whose body it is and would he not be affected
by it ? I agree with Dr. Rajeev Dhavan and Prof.  Alice
(1)  29 Law.  Ed., 185.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">118</span>
<p id="p_358">Jacob  when  they say in their forthcoming  article  on	 the
Assembly dissolution case namely, the <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_472">State of Rajasthan  v.
Union  of India</a> that: "Any communication that is made  to  a
Chief  Minister	 in  his capacity  as  Chief  Minister"	 and
equally	 to a minister in his capacity as minister,   " must
create a matter which involves the State".  S. Murtaza Fazal
Ali, J., in the <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_473">State of Rajasthan v. Union of India</a>  sought
to make a distinction between permanent institutions of	 the
State  and  their  changing personnel and  observed  :	"The
question  as to the personnel to run these  institutions  is
wholly unrelatable to the existence of a dispute between the
'State'	 and  the 'Government of India'.  It  is  only	when
there  is  a  complete abolition of  any  of  the  permanent
institutions of a State that a real dispute may arise." I do
not  think that this is a valid distinction for	 determining
when  a	 dispute  can be said to be one with  the  State  as
distinct   from	  the  per-sons	  constituting	 the   State
Government.  To quote again from the forth-coming article of
DR.  Rajeev  Dhawan  and  Prof.	  Alice	 Jacob:	 "The	hair
splitting  distinction	cannot	be  between  the,  permanent
institutions of the State and the nonpermanent	institutions
of the, State; nor can it be between actions which limit the
powers	of  the officials of the Government of a  State	 and
those that abolish the institutions of the State.  The	hair
splitting distinction is between those actions which can  be
attributed  to the State or any official thereof  and  those
actions which are personal and not ascribed to the officials
in their capacity as officials of the State-A letter sent to
the  Chief  Minister questioning his- capacity or  power  to
rule as Chief Minister may not allege lack of confidence  in
the  Chief  Minister  as person, wife,	husband,  father  or
friend.	 It alleges lack of confidence in the Chief Minister
in  his	 capacity  as  Chief Minister."	 I  find  myself  in
agreement  with	 this opinion and I wholly  endorse  it.   I
would,	therefore, hold that when any right or	capacity  or
lack of it is attributed to any institution or person acting
on  behalf  of the State, it raises a matter  in  which	 the
State  is  involved or concerned.  The State would,  in	 the
circumstances, be affected or at any rate interested, if the
Chief  Minister	 and other ministers in	 their	capacity  as
such,  or to put it differently, in the matter of  discharge
of    their   official	 functions,   are    subjected	  to
unconstitutional   exercise   of  power	  by   the   Central
Government.   If  the  Central Government were	to  issue  a
direction  to  the  Chief Minister and	other  ministers  to
exercise  the executive power of the State in  a  particular
manner,	 the  State  would  be	clearly	 affected  if	such
direction  is  unconstitutional	 and would  be	entitled  to
complain against it.  Then is the position any different, if
the  Central  Government,  instead,  proceeds,	without	 any
constitutional authority, to inquire how the executive power
of  the State is exercised by the Chief Minister  and  other
ministers  and whether it is exercised in a  proper  manner.
The  State  would  clearly  in such a  case  have  locus  to
challenge   the	 unconstitutional  action  of  the   Central
Government-
</p><p id="p_359">It  may	 also  be noted that, on a  proper  construction  of
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_474">Article	 131</a>, it is not necessary that the plaintiff  should
have  some legal right of its own to enforce, before it	 can
institute  a suit under that article.  It is not a sine	 qua
non of the applicability of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_475">article 131</a> that there should be
infringement  of  some legal right of the  plaintiff.	What
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_476">article	 131</a> requires is that the dispute must be one  which
involves a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">119</span>
question  "on which the existence or extent of	legal  right
depends".   The	 article does not say that the	legal  right
must be of the plaintiff.  It may be of the plaintiff or  of
the  defendant.	 What is necessary is that the existence  or
extent	of the legal right must be in issue in	the  dispute
between the parties.  We cannot construe <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_477">Article 131</a> as con-
fined to cases where the dispute relates to the existence or
extent	of  the legal right of the plaintiff for to  do	 so,
would  be to read words in the article which are not  there.
It  seems  that because the mode of proceeding	provided  in
Part  III of the Supreme Court Rules for bringing a  dispute
before	the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_478">Article 131</a> is a suit,	that
we  are	 unconsciously influenced to import  the  notion  of
'cause	of  action,  which  is germane in  a  suit,  in	 the
interpretation	of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_479">Article 131</a> and to read this	 article  as
limited	 only  to  cases  where	 some  legal  right  of	 the
plaintiff is infringed and consequently, it has a 'cause  of
action'	 against the defendant.	 But it must  be  remembered
that there is no reference to a suit or 'cause of action' in
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_480">Article	 131</a>  and that article confers jurisdiction  on	 the
Supreme Court with reference to the character of the dispute
which  may  be	brought before	it  for	 adjudication.	 The
requirement of 'cause of action', which is so necessary in a
suit,  cannot, therefore, be imported while  construing	 the
scope  and ambit of Art 131.  It is no doubt true, that	 the
judgment delivered by me in the <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_481">State of Rajasthan v.  Union
of  India</a>  proceeds  on the assumption	that  a	 suit  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_482">Article	 131</a>  can be Instituted only if some  right  of	 the
plaintiff  is infringed, but there was no proper  discussion
of this question in the course of the arguments in that case
and   on  fuller  consideration,  I  think  that   no	such
restriction  can be imported in the construction of  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_483">Article
131</a>  so	 as to narrow down the ambit and  coverage  of	that
article.  The only requirement necessary for attracting	 the
applicability of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_484">Article 131</a> is that the dispute must be one
involving any question "on which the existence or extent  of
a legal right" depends, irrespective whether the legal right
is claimed by one party or the other and it is not necessary
that  some legal right of the plaintiff should be  infringed
before	a  suit	 can be brought	 under	that  article.	 The
plaintiff  must	 of  course be a party to  the	dispute	 and
obviously  it cannot be a party to the dispute unless it  is
affected  by  it.  The plaintiff cannot raise a	 dispute  in
regard	to a matter which does not affect it or in which  it
is  not	 concerned.   It  cannot  act  as  a  mere  busybody
interfering with things which do not concern it.  But if the
plaintiff  has interest in raising the dispute in the  sense
that  it is affected by the action taken, it can  bring	 the
dispute before the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_485">Article 131</a>, even  if
no  legal right of its is infringed, provided of course	 the
dispute	 is relatable to the-existence or extent of a  legal
right.
</p><p id="p_360">It  would also be convenient at this stage to consider	what
is  the meaning of the expression 'legal right' as  used  in
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_486">Article	 131.</a>  It is obvious that the word 'right'  is	used
here  in  a generic sense and not according to	its-  strict
meaning.   'Right'  in	its  narrow  sense  constitutes	 the
correlative  of duty, but in its generic sense	it  includes
not  only  right  strict to sensu,  but	 "any  advantage  or
benefit conferred upon a person by a rule of law".  Dias  in
his jurisprudence, 1976 ed., pages 33-34, says that the word
'right'	 has  undergone	 successive shifts  in	meaning	 and
Hohfeld in his "Fundamental Legal Concepts as Applied
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">120</span>
to  Legal  Reasoning" gives four different meanings  of	 the
word  right,.	One is right strict to sensu, the  other  is
liberty, the third is power and the fourth is immunity.	  In
its  strict sense 'right' is defined-as interest  which	 the
law  protects  by  imposing corresponding  duty	 on  others.
'Liberty'  is  exemption from the right of another  and	 its
correlative  is	 no-right' and in the same  way	 'power'  is
ability	 to  change the legal relations of another  and	 its
correlative   is   liability.	Similarly,   'immunity'	  is
exemption   from  the  legal  power  of	 another   and	 the
correlative of immunity is disability.	To illustrate, where
there is a right stricto sensu in A, there is a	 correlative
duty  in B to do X. Similarly, where A has liberty to do  X,
there is a correlative no-right in B to interfere in  regard
to it.	The correlative of, power in A is liability in B  as
regards	 X and similarly, where there is immunity in A	from
the legal power of B, its correlative is disability in B  as
regards X. These are the four different jural  relationships
recognised  by	law  and they are  comprehended	 within	 the
generic	 term 'right'.	Now, there can be no doubt that	 the
word  'right' is used in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_487">Article 131</a> in this generic  sense.
If,  for  example,  the	 State	claims	to  be	entitled  to
legislate  exclusively on a particular matter on the  ground
that  it  falls within List III of the VII Schedule  to	 the
Constitution and the Union of India questions this right  of
the  State,  the dispute would be one relating, not  to	 any
right  of the State in the strict sense of the term, but  to
the  'liberty' of the State to legislate on such matter	 and
it would come directly within the terms of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_488">Art. 131.</a>  Even a
dispute	 relating  to  the power of the Union  of  India  to
abolish	 the legislative assembly of a State or to  dissolve
it would fall within the scope and ambit of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_489">Art. 131</a> as held
expressly  by  Chandrachud, J., Gupta, J.,  and	 myself	 and
impliedly  by Beg, C.J., in the <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_490">State of Rajasthan v.  Union
of  India</a>.   What  has, therefore, to be seen  in  order  to
determine the applicability of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_491">Art. 131</a> is whether there is,
any  relational	 legal matter involving	 a  right,  liberty,
power or immunity qua the parties to the dispute.  If  there
is, the suit would be maintainable, but not otherwise.
The   question	which  arises  for  consideration  on	this
interpretation	of <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_492">Art. 131</a> is whether there is any  dispute
between	 the  State  of Karnataka and  the  Union  of  India
involving  a  question as to the existence or  extent  of  a
relational  legal  pattern within the generic sense  of	 the
term 'right.  It is true that it may not be possible to	 say
that  by  reason  of  the impugned  action  of	the  Central
Government in setting up a Commission of Inquiry against the
Chief Minister and other ministers who constitute the  State
Government, any legal right of the State is infringed,	but,
as already pointed out above, it is not necessary, in  order
to  invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_493">Art.
131</a>,  that the State should be able to show that some  legal
right of ots ps breacheds.  That is enough to show that	 the
averments in the led, not as a busy body or as a  meddlesome
interloper, but in a real sense in questioning the power  of
the Central Government to set Up such Commission of Inquiry.
If  we	look  at the averments in the plaint,  and  for	 the
purpose of determining the question of jurisdiction we	must
proceed on the assumption that the averments are correct, it
is clear that according to the claim made by the State,	 the
legislature of the State and the State Government alone have
power  to  investigate and control  misuse  of	governmental
power by the Chief Minister
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">121</span>
other ministers of the State and the Central Government	 has
no power to inquire into the same or to set up a  Commission
of Inquiry or that purpose.  This claim of the State clearly
raises a dispute as to the extent of the power of the  State
and  the existence of a superior or coordinate power in	 the
Central Government to inquire into the conduct of the  Chief
Minister and other ministers of the State in the.  discharge
of  their governmental functions.  Such a  dispute  concerns
the  content of the respective powers of the State  and	 the
Union of India and the inter se relationship between the two
entities  :and the State is vitally interested in  it.	 The
State  is  very much concerned whether the  conduct  of	 its
council	 of  ministers	in  the	 discharge  of	governmental
functions  can be inquired into only by itself	through	 its
own  agency or it can also be subjected to scrutiny  by	 the
Union of India.	 The State would certainly have locus to say
that  the Union of India has no right to encroach  upon	 its
exclusive  power to investigate into misuse of	governmental
power  by its council of ,ministers.  There can be no  doubt
that, apart from its council of ministers the State can also
competently  make  a  claim that the  council  of  ministers
acting on its behalf is immune from subjection to the  power
of  the Central Government to inquire into their conduct  as
ministers.  This immunity claimed in respect of the  council
of  ministers  can  be	ascribed to the	 State	and  it	 can
certainly  raise  a dispute touching upon the  existence  of
this  immunity.	  So  far  as dispute as  to  the  scope  of
respective  legislative fields between the Commonwealth	 and
the States in Australia is concerned, it is now well settled
as a result of the decision in Attorney General for Victoria
v. The Commonwealth(1) that the Attorney-General of a  State
,can  sue  for a declaration of the  invalidity	 of  Federal
legislation  as	 an  invasion of a  purely  State  field  of
legislative power and similarly the Attorney-General for the
Commonwealth   can  sue	 a  State  in  order  to  obtain   a
declaration of the invalidity of State legislation where  it
encroaches  upon  the  legislative Dower  entrusted  to	 the
,Commonwealth.	 The High Court of Australia pointed out  in
this  case  that the position was  correctly  summarised  by
Gaven  Duffy, C.J., Evatt and Me Tiernan, JJ.  in  Attorney-
General	 for  Victoria	v.  The	 Commonwealth  (2)  in	 the
following words : "It must now be taken as established	that
the  Attorney-General of a State of the Commonwealth  has  a
sufficient   title   to	 invoke	 the   provisions   of	 the
Constitution for the purpose of challenging the validity  of
Commonwealth  legislation  which extends  to,  and  operates
within. the State whose interests be represents".  Now, if a
State  has  sufficient title to challenge  the	validity  of
Union legislation on the ground that it interferes with	 the
exercise  of  State  legislative power,	 it  must  follow  a
fortiori  that	the  State would  have	locus  to  challenge
unconstitutional exercise of power by the Central Government
which  encroaches upon its exclusive sphere in	relation  to
the  conduct of its Council of ministers.  The	State  would
also  be  entitled to challenge the impugned action  of	 the
Central Government as unconstitutional, because it  prevents
the  State from exercising its power to direct inquiry	into
matters	 which are specified in the notification  issued  by
the Central Govern-

in   the   suit	 on  merits.	While	generally   agreeing
respectfully with the leading judgment of the learned  Chief

</p><p id="p_364">The first issue in this suit is
"Is the suit maintainable ?"
</p><p id="p_365">Although the decision of this issue is interlined with other
issues	settled	 for  adjudication, it	can  be	 dealt	with
separately also.
</p><p id="p_366">What, in substance, is this suit filed under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_497">Article 131</a>  of
the   Constitution  of	India  ?  Certain   allegations	  of
corruption,  nepotism  and favouritism in  relation  to	 the
administrative actions of the Chief Minister and some  other
Ministers  of  the  State of Karnataka	were  made  by	some
legislators  of	 that  State.  A  memorandum  signed  by  46
legislators  of	 the State containing  the  allegations	 was
forwarded  to the Central Government.  Its Home Minister  in
his  letter  dated  April  26,	1977,  requested  the  Chief
Minister  to give information and his comments	apropos	 the
allegations  made.  The Chief Minister, in his reply  letter
dated May, 13, 1977, inter alia, challenged the authority of
the  Central Government to call for an explanation and	make
any  inquiry  in  the matter.  He claimed that	it  was	 the
exclusive  right  of  the  State to do	so.   It  seems,  to
forestall  the appointment of any Commission of	 Inquiry  by
the  Central  Government, the State Government	hastened  to
issue a notification on May 18, 1977 to set up some kind  of
inquiry	 in  respect of the allegations made,  although,  in
terms  the inquiry was not specifically in relation  to	 the
various	 charges  of misconduct and  maladministration	made
against	 the  Chief Minister and the other  Ministers.	 The
notification  was  issued  by  the  State  Government  under
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_498">section	 3</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952  <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_499">(Central
Act</a> 60 of 1952) (hereinafter to be referred to as the  Act).
Shri  Justice  Mir  lqbal Hussain, a retired  Judge  of	 the
Karnataka  High Court, was appointed as the sole  member  of
the  Commission	 of Inquiry by the State  Government.	Five
days  later,  on May 23, 1977, the  Central  Government,  in
exercise  of  their  power  under  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_500">section  3</a>  of  the	Act,
appointed another Commission consisting of a single  Member,
namely, Shri Justice A. N. Grover,,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">123</span>
Judge of the Supreme court of India, to inquire into,- the
allegations  in Annexures 'I' and 'II' to  the	notification
excluding,  however, from the latter-"any matter covered  by
the notification of the Government of Karnataka in the Chief
Secretariat  DPAR  7  GAN 77, dated  the  18th	May,  1977".
Thereupon  the of Karnataka filed the present suit  claiming
certain-  relief  mainly on two grounds : (1)  On  a  proper
interpretation	of  the	 Act the  State	 Government  is	 the
appropriate Government and not the Central Government to set
up  a Commission of Inquiry; and (2) in the alternative	 the
provisions  in	the  Act in so far  as	they  authorise	 the
Central	 Government to issue the impugned notification-	 are
ultravires  the	 Constitution.	The first defendant  in	 the
suit  is  the Union of India, the second being	Shri  A.  N.
Grover.	  The  contest is by the first	defendant  only	 and
hereinafter  in this judgment it will be referred to as	 the
defendant.   In	 substance  and	 effect	 the  claim  of	 the
defendant  is that it has got the legal right to  issue	 the
impugned  notification; the right conferred by <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_501">Section 3</a>  of
the  Act is not ultravires the Constitution.  The  right  of
the  State of Karnataka to institute the suit under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_502">Article
131</a>  is challenged mainly on the ground that the  nature  of
the dispute, in the suit is such that it does not affect any
legal right of the State.
</p><p id="p_367">Under  Article	I of the Constitution, India is a  Union  of
States.	  The State of Karnataka is one of  the	 constituent
units  of the Union of India.  The concept of State is	that
by  itself  it is an ideal person, a legal  entity.   It  is
intangible,  invisible and immutable.  The Government, in  a
sense,	is an agency through which the will of the State  is
formulated,  expressed and executed.  Both  the	 expressions
have  been  separately defined in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_503">General  Clauses	Act</a>,
1917.  In relation to the existence of a dispute between the
Union of India on the one hand and one or more States on the
other, the expression used in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_504">Article 131</a> for the former  is
the Government of India, signifying that the dispute may  be
with  the  Government of India but the other  party  to	 the
dispute	 must  be  the State only and not any  limb  of	 the
State-the  Government, this Legislature or-  the  Judiciary.
<a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_505">Article	 300</a>  is  an  enabling	provision  to  describe	 the
Government  of India in a suit as the Union of India and  to
enable	the Government of a State to sue or. be sued in	 the
name  of  the State.  If there is an invasion an  the  legal
right of a State the agency through which the action will be
commenced  may	well  be the Government of  the	 State.	  An
inroad	upon  the right of the Government  may,	 in  certain
circumstances,	be  an inroad upon the legal  right  of	 the
State.	 <a href="/doc/1415462/" id="a_506">Article 300</a>, therefore, merely prescribes the	mode
of  describing a party to the suit.  The real answer to	 the
question  of maintainability, however, has got to  be  found
from  the  words  of  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_507">Article  131</a>  itself.   The  following
conditions must exist for invoking the original jurisdiction
of the Supreme Court under the said <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_508">Article
	      (1)</a>   The	  dispute   must  be   between	 the
	      Government of India and one or more States  or
	      between	 two or more States; and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">	      124</span>
	      (2)   The	 dispute must involve  any  question
	      whet law or of fact on which the existence  or
	      extent the legal-right depends.
</p><p id="p_368">There  is some departure in this regard from the  correspond
provision of Section 204 of the Government of India Act,  19
which is not necessary to be pin-pointed here.	In  specific
terms  has not been stated in the Article as to whose  legal
right  the question involved in the dispute must relate	 and
in  what  respect.   Chandrachud  J.,  in  this	 regard	 has
expressed  his opinion	in the case of <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_509">State of Rajasthan  &amp;
Ors. v. Union of India</a>( 1) at page 1396 as follows
	      "It is sufficient in order that its provisions
	      may  apply that the plaintiff,  questions	 the
	      legal or constitutional right asserted by	 the
	      defendant,  be it the Government of  India  or
	      any other State".
</p><p id="p_369">The  learned Chief Justice in his leading judgment  did	 not
decide	this question.	The other five Judges including	 one
of us (Untwalia J.) took a contrary view.  Yet, Bhagwati and
Gupta  JJ.  on the facts of that case held  that  the  legal
right of the State, the plaintiff, had been infringed.	 The
other three, even on merits, expressed an opposite view.  If
we  may	 say so with great respect, we are unable  to  agree
with  the  view	 aforesaid,  expressed	by  Chandrachud	  J.
Ordinarily  and	 generally, in any suit	 including  the	 one
under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_510">Article 131</a> the competition is between the legal right
of  the	 plaintiff and the defendant.	But  primarily,	 and
almost invariably, the plaintiff has to establish his  legal
right in order to succeed in the suit.	As against the claim
of  the	 plaintiff, if the legal right of the  defendant  is
established,  the suit is bound to fail.  But on failure  of
either to establish his own legal right, the suit will still
fail   because	the  plaintiff	cannot	succeed	 unless	  he
establishes his legal right.  This proposition of law is  so
clear  and axiomatic that the expression-"the  existence  or
extent of a legal right" used in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_511">Article 131</a> undoubtedly  is
meant to bring about this result.  It was neither necessary,
nor perhaps advisable, to state further in the article	that
the  dispute  must involve any question on which  the  legal
right of the plaintiff must depend.  It is matter of  common
experience that more often than not absence of a legal right
in  one party helps the other party to establish  its  legal
right and vice versa.

<p id="p_375">It  may be open to them to, take the plea in an	 appropriate
proceeding, such as a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_512">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution, ,that the action of the Central Government  is
legal  and ultra vires.	 Under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_513">Article 131A  (introduced  by
the  42nd Amendment</a>), the question of vires of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_514">section 3</a>  of
the Act may then have to be referred for the decision of the
Supreme	 Court	by  the	 High Court.  But  that	 in  no	 way
entitled  the State to invoke the original  jurisdiction  of
the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_515">Article 131.</a>  The submission made by
Mr. Lal Narayan Sinha on behalf of the plaintiff-State	that
the  legal  right  of  the State has  been  invaded  by	 the
impugned  notification, is not correct.	  Counsel  submitted
that  it is only the States right to order an inquiry  under
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_516">section	 3</a> of the Act against its Ministers  acting  through
its  Government, that the Central Government has  no  right,
that  it  has put an impediment in the right of	 the  State,
Government to modify or issue a subsequent notification	 for
the  purpose  of enlarging or clarifying the  scope  of	 the
inquiry	 and that it has, thus affected the legal  right  of
the  State.  We find no substance in this  argument.   There
may be a competition between the power of one authority	 and
the other, here in this case between the Central  Government
and the State Government.  But unless the power exercised by
one  authority	brings about a dispute	impinging  upon	 the
legal  right of the other authority, the latter cannot	come
under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_517">Article 131</a> and say that merely because it was  within
its  power  to	do so its legal right  is  affected  by	 the
illegal	 exercise of the power by the other authority.	 The
said  exercise	of the power must directly or  by  necessary
implication affected the legal right of the other authority.
We may support the proposition by an illustration.  Suppose,
the  Central Government, in pursuance of a law made  by	 the
Parliament  in respect of an: Entry in List II,, say,  Entry
8, relating to, intoxicating liquors, makes an order against
a person residing in or an officer of any State.  The  order
will  be  obviously  bad, as having  been  issued  under  an
invalid law made by the Parliament.  Who can challenge	this
order  ? Obviously the person affected or aggrieved  by	 the
order.	If the order does not affect the legal right of	 the
State  or the State Government (for the purpose	 of  testing
the argument, the two may be equated), can the State file  a
suit  under  <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_518">Article 131</a> merely because the order  has	been
made  against  its resident in accordance with a  law  which
encroached upon the exclusive legislative field of the State
? The answer, in our ,opinion, must be in the negative.	  In
the  instant case if the stand on merits taken on behalf  of
the   State   Ministers	 in  correct,  then   the   impugned
notification is an invasion on their legal right.  They can'
press  into  service the power of the  State  Government  to
order an
inquiry	 and  challenge the impugned notification,  but	 the
said notification can in no way be said to have affected  or
restrained  the State Government from giving effect  to	 its
notification.
</p><p id="p_376">	      Some  help may be derived from the  definition
	      of  the word "State' given at page  856-57  of
	      Vol. 81 Corpus, Juris Secundum. It says :
</p><p id="p_377">	      "The word 'State' has various meanings, but as
	      used  in	the federal  Constitution,  acts  of
	      congress, and State statutes,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">	      126</span>
	      it  has a definite, fixed, and  certain  legal
	      meaning  as designating a member of the  Union
	      in contradistinction to the United States as a
	      nation................................
	      The  State is a legal entity, and is  entitled
	      to  the  fundamental rights,  privileges,	 and
	      immunities belonging to every legal entity."
If a restricted meaning were not to be given to the scope of
the  suit  which  can  be  filed  under	 <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_519">Article  131</a>,	very
anomalous,  and sometimes absurd, results may follow and  it
will  be difficult to put a dividing line and a stop to	 the
very  wide  scope  of  the  suit  resulting  from  such	  an
interpretation.	 Any action taken by the Central  Government
either	under  the  Act or otherwise.  against	any  citizen
residing in, or an officer of the State could be  challenged
by institution of a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_520">Article 131</a> by the State	 on'
the  ground  that the action of the  Central  Government  is
ultra vires and Without any legal right.  The argument	that
the  State  is	interested  in	protecting  its	 people	 and
officers  when their legal right has been illegally  invaded
by the Central Government and, therefore, it has a locus  to
invoke	<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_521">Article 131</a>, in our opinion, is too obviously  wrong
to be accepted.
</p><p id="p_378">As  we	have  said above, a Minister is an  Officer  of	 the
State.	An order affecting him cannot confer a right of suit
on the State under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_522">Article 131.</a>	 So the present suit, in our
opinion,  is not maintainable.	We, however, do not  propose
to non-suit the plaintiff on that ground alone, and  proceed
to discuss the other issues.
</p><p id="p_379">The  other two issues framed for consideration in this	suit
are in the following terms :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_124">	      "2.   Is the impugned notification ultra vires
	      the  powers  of the Central  Government  under
	      Sec. 3 of the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_523">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a> ?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_125">	      3.    If	<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_524">section	 3</a>  of	the  Commissions  of
	      Inquiry Act authorises the Central  Government
	      to  issue	 the impugned notification,  is	 the
	      Section itself unconstitutional ?"
</blockquote><p id="p_380">Both  these issues may conveniently be dealt with  together.
Several	 points	 of view were canvassed by Mr.	Lal  Narayan
Sinha for the plaintiff with his usual clarity and precision
but,  at times, because of the inherent difficulties of	 the
points involved and the case being one of first	 impression,
he  was obliged to change and modify his line  of  argument.
Mr. Soli Sorabjee, the learned Additional Solicitor General,
combated  the  arguments  of the  plaintiff  very  ably	 and
succinctly.   Eventually, the main points of attack  of	 the
plaintiff were crystallized in the following terms
</p><p id="p_381">	      1.    Our	  Constitution	is  of	 a   Federal
	      character	 clearly defining and  dividing	 the
	      legislative and the executive functions of the
	      Centre  and  the	States	and  their  inter-se
	      relationship.-  The judicial functions of	 the
	      Judiciary are in a well-defined and demarcated
	      separate compartment..
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">	      127</span>
<p id="p_382">	      2.    Except  to the extent permitted by	the,
	      Constitution  the Centre cannot encroach	upon
	      the  legislative	or executive  field  of	 the
	      State.
</p><p id="p_383">	      3.    <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_525">The	 Act</a> does not and  cannot  authorise
	      the Centre to set up a, Commission of  Inquiry
	      against the State Executive; <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_526">Section 3</a> must be
	      read    down   to	  save	 it   from    'being
	      constitutionally invalid.
</p><p id="p_384">	      4.    If	it be not possible to read down	 the
	      Act  in the manner suggested then the  Act  is
	      invalid in so far as it authorises the  Centre
	      to set up a Commission of Inquiry against	 the
	      State Executive.
</p><p id="p_385">	      5.    Such  a  law is beyond  the	 legislative
	      competence  of  the  Union  Parliament  as  in
	      substance	 and  in effect it  violates  either
	      expressly or by necessary implication  certain
	      provisions  of  the  Constitution,  its  basic
	      scheme,  or the fundamental back-bone  of	 the
	      Centre-State relationship as enshrined in	 the
	      Constitution.
</p><p id="p_386">	      6.    The	 law having the effect as  aforesaid
	      will  really be a constitutional law  bringing
	      about  an amendment in the Constitution  which
	      is  obviously  not  permissible;	an  ordinary
	      legislation unless expressly permitted by	 the
	      provision	 of the Constitution cannot  in	 any
	      way amend the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_387">	      7.    <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_527">The	  Act</a>  is  beyond  the	 legislative
	      competence  of  the Central Parliament  if  it
	      means authorisation by the Central  Government
	      of  any machinery for making inquiries in	 the
	      executive	 actions of the State Government  or
	      the  Chief  Minister  or	any  other  Minister
	      either collectively or individually.
</p><p id="p_388">	      8.    Strictly speaking the subject-matter  of
	      the present inquiry is not covered by the	 Act
	      if  it  be held that it has  been	 enacted  in
	      exercise of the power of the Parliament  under
	      Entry  94 of List I, Entry 45 of List  III  or
	      the  Residuary  Entry 97 of List I  read	with
	      <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_528">Article 248</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_389">	      9.    Lastly  it was also submitted  that	 the
	      scope, of the two inquiries one set up by	 the
	      State  Govt. &amp; the other by the Central  Govt.
	      are more or less the same.  Almost all matters
	      of  inquiry are over-lapping  and,  therefore,
	      the,  impugned  notification is  bad  on	that
	      account too.
</p><p id="p_390">We  proceed  to	  discuss and consider briefly,	 as  far  as
possible,  the propositions aforesaid, but not	strictly  in
the order we have set out above.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">128</span>
<p id="p_391">Strictly  speaking,  our Constitution is not  of  a  federal
character  where separate, independent and sovereign  States

United	States of America or as may be the position in	some
other countries of the World.  It is because of. that reason
that sometimes it has been characterised as quasi-federal in
nature.	  Leaving the functions of the Judiciary  apart,  by
and large the legislative and the executive functions of the
Centre	and  the States have been defined  and	distributed,
but, even so, through it all runs an overall thread or	rein
in  the	 hands	of  the Centre	in  both  the  fields.	 The
Parliament  has	 the  exclusive authority  to  legislate  on
matters	 enumerated in List I. So has the State	 Legislature
the exclusive legislative power with respect to the  various
entries	 in List II.  Both have concurrent powers in  regard
to  the	 entries  of  List  III.   The	residuary  power  in
accordance  with  <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_529">Article 248</a> and Entry 97 of List  I,	lies
with the Central Parliament.  It has got a predominant	hand
in  respect  of	 the matters in the concurrent	list  as  is
apparent  from	<a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_530">Article 254.</a>  <a href="/doc/1883579/" id="a_531">Article 249</a> confers  power  on
Parliament  to	legislate with respect to a  matter  in	 the
State  List, in the national interest.	When a	proclamation
of emergency is in operation as provided for in <a href="/doc/497125/" id="a_532">Article 250</a>,
the  Parliament has got the power to legislate with  respect
to  any matter in the State List.  Some inroad in the  State
legislative  field  by	the  Centre  is	 permissible   under
circumstances  mentioned  in  Articles	252  and  253.	  As
provided for in <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_533">Article 254</a> in some situations, the State is
under an obligation to reserve a Bill for the  consideration
of  the President and receive his assent before it  is	made
into a law.
</p><p id="p_392">"It  shall be the duty of the Union to protect	every  State
against external aggression and internal disturbance and  to
ensure	that the Government of every State is carried on  in
accordance with the provisions of this Constitution".  (vide
<a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_534">Art.  355</a>,  emphasis supplied). In case of  failure  of	 the
constitutional machinery in States, provision has been	made
in <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_535">Article 356</a> for the Centre to assume legislative and exe-
cutive powers but not the powers vested in or exercisable by
a  High	 Court of a State.  The effect	of  proclamation  of
emergency  under  <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_536">Article 352</a> is to  enlarge  the  executive
power of the Union and extend it to the giving of  direction
to  any State as to the manner in which the executive  power
thereof	 is to be exercised as provided for in <a href="/doc/818031/" id="a_537">Article	353.</a>
There  could  not have been, for obvious reasons,  any	such
provision in regard to the administration of the Centre.
The  administrative  relations between the  Centre  and	 the
States	are  by	 and large governed  by	 the  provisions  of
Chapter II of Part XI of the Constitution.  While  providing
in  <a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_538">Article  256</a> that "two executive power  of	every  State
shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the	laws
made by Parliament and any existing laws which apply in that
State",	 it is significant to note that it has further	been
engrafted  therein that "executive power of the Union  shall
extend	to the giving of such directions to a State  as	 may
appear	to the Government of India to be necessary for	that
purpose."  The	control	 of the Union  over  the  States  in
certain	 cases	has been provided for in <a href="/doc/117780/" id="a_539">Article  257.</a>	 Mr.
Sinha  pointedly referred to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_540">Article 258A</a> introduced in	 the
Constitution  by the Constitution (Seventh  Amendment)	Act,
1956, to lend support to his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">129</span>
argument.  But, in our opinion, instead of strengthening the
point  as  urged,  it weakens it because  the  said  Article
provides:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_126">	      "258A.	Power  of  the	States	to   entrust
	      functions	  to   the    Union.-Notwithstanding
	      anything in the Constitution, the Governor  of
	      a	  State	 may,  with  the  consent   of	 the
	      Government    of	 India,	   entrust    either
	      conditionally   or  unconditionally  to	that
	      Government  or  to its officers  functions  in
	      relation to any matter to which the  executive
	      power of the State extends."
</blockquote><p id="p_393">of  course,  the Governor of a State would  mean  the  State
Government  or the Council of Ministers and it is not  meant
to  authorise the Governor to act in his discretion in	this
regard.
</p><p id="p_394">We may now refer to some other characteristics and  features
of our Constitution to demonstrate the weak character of our
federal structure and the controlling hand of the Centre  on
States in certain matters.  Some of the salient ones are the
following :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_127">	      1.    The Governor of a State is appointed  by
	      the   President  and  holds  office   at	 his
	      pleasure.	  Only in some matters he has got  a
	      discretionary  power  but in  all	 others	 the
	      State  administration is carried on by him  or
	      in  his name by or with the aid and advice  of
	      the  Ministers.	Every  action,	even  of  an
	      individual  Minister,  is the  action  of	 the
	      whole Council and is governed by the theory of
	      joint and collective responsibility.  But	 the
	      Governor	is there, as the head of the  State,
	      the Executive and the Legislature, to,  report
	      to the Centre about the administration of	 the
	      State.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_128">	      2.    Making    a	   departure	from	 the
	      corresponding  provision in the Government  of
	      India Act, Entry 45 in List III of the Seventh
	      Schedule empowers the Parliament to  legislate
	      on  the  subject of "inquiries......  for	 the
	      purpose  of  any of the matters  specified  in
	      List II" also besides List III, and List I  as
	      mentioned	 in  Entry  94 of  that	 List.	 The
	      constituent   power   of	amendment   of	 the
	      Constitution  lies with the  Parliament  under
	      <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_541">Article 368</a> providing for concurrence by	half
	      the number of the States in certain matters.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_129">	      3.    <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_542">Article 2</a> empowers the Parliament by law
	      to  admit	 into the Union, or  establish,	 new
	      States  on  such terms and  conditions  as  it
	      thinks fit.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_130">	      4.    Parliament is also empowered by  <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_543">Article

	      and  alteration of areas, boundaries of  names
	      of existing States.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">130</span>
<p id="p_396">our  federal  structure, has been discussed from  pages	 396
onwards.   The	learned Chief Justice observed at  page	 397
that in our Constitution the supreme authority of the Courts
to  interpret  the  Constitution and  to  invalidate  action
violative of the Constitution is to be found in full  force.
"The  exercise	of powers legislative and executive  in	 the
allotted  fields is hedged in by numerous  restrictions,  so
that  the powers of the States are not coordinate  with	 the
Union  and are not in many respects independent".   At	page
398   it  is  observed	:  "The	 political  sovereignty	  is
distributed  between, as we will presently demonstrate,	 the
Union  of  India and the States with greater  weight-age  In
favour of the Union".
</p><p id="p_397">If  any	 Article of the, Constitution in terms	permits	 the
Centre	to encroach upon the legislative and  the  executive
field  of the State, as some of the Articles do, then  there
could  be no doubt that the encroachment is perfectly  legal
and valid.  If, however, either the law or the action  taken
under it makes an inroad on the executive power of the State
in  express violation of any provision of  the	Constitution
or, even assuming, as was argued by Mr. Sinha, violating the
provisions  of	the Constitution by  necessary	implication,
then  such  a law or the action taken  thereunder  would  be
invalid.   The	Constitution does not permit the  Centre  to
violate it in any matter.
</p><p id="p_398">But  in	 order to appreciate as to whether the	Act  or	 the
action taken by the Centre under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_545">Section 3</a> thereof has	gone
against	 the Constitution either expressly or  by  necessary
implication,  one  has	to appreciate  the  nature  of.	 the
provisions   made  and	the  scope  and	  functions.of	 the
Commission  in question.  The extent of the executive  power
of  the Union is co-extensive with the legislative Power  of
the  Parliament.  The position in respect of  the  executive
power of the State is identical ('vide' Articles 73 and	 162
respectively).	 Entry	94 in the Union	 List  empowers	 the
Parliament to legislate concerning inquiries for the purpose
of  any of the matters in that list, that is to say, if	 any
kind  of inquiry is necessary for any kind of  purpose	con-
nected with any of the matters in List I then the Parliament
is empowered to make a law for the setting up of a machinery
or a Tribunal for the purpose of the said inquiry.  List  II
does  not  contain any such entry.  Then comes Entry  45  in
List III which has already been alluded to.  This authorises
both  the  Central  and the State  Legislatures,  of  course
subject	 to  the other provisions of the  Constitution	e.g.
<a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_546">Article	 254</a>, to enact law for the purpose of providing	 for
the  machinery	of inquiry for the purposes of	any  of	 the
matters	 specified in List II and List III.  It has been  so
held in the case of <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_547">Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri  Justice
S.  R.	Tendolkar  &amp;  Ors</a>.(1) where  Das  C.J.	has  lucidly
discussed  the	matter, if we say so with great	 respect  at
pages 289-291.
</p><p id="p_399">Empowering  the	 Central Legislature to make a law  for	 the
purpose	 of  inquiry in regard to the matters  specified  in
List II is in no sense empowering it to legislate  vis-a-vis
such  matters.	It is only for the purpose of achieving	 the
object of the inquiry to be set up in regard
(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 279.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_124">131</span>
<p id="p_400">to  the matters enumerated in List III.	 The purpose may  be
as  a  matter  of  policy in  relation	to  the	 legislation
proposed  to be passed by the various States or may be	with
regard	to  their  executive  actions  taken  apropos	such
matters.   We may just. illustrate our view by referring  to
Entry  6  of  List  II., The.	State  Legislature  has	 the
exclusive  authority  to  legislate on	"public	 health	 and
sanitation;  hospitals and dispensaries"; of course,  within
the territory of that State.  The executive power being	 co-
extensive,  the	 hospitals may be  established	and  doctors
appointed therein by the State Government either in  accord-
ance  with  the	 law made in that regard  or  even  in	pure
exercise  of  the  executive  power.   If  there  has	been
corruption,  nepotism, favouritism or  maladministration  in
connection  with  the  said executive action  of  the  State
Government,  the law made under Entry 45 of  the  Concurrent
List  can undoubtedly cover an inquiry in such matters.	  It
neither	 interferes with the legislative power of the  State
nor with its executive action.	A mere inquiry under the Act
by a Commission appointed thereunder which is a fact-finding
body, is for the purpose of finding the facts.	No body is a
prosecutor;  no	 body  is an accused; all  are	invited	 and
welcomed  by  the  Commission  to  assist  it  to  find	 the
necessary facts within the scope of the inquiry set up.
In  passing  we may also refer to Entry 8 of List I  in	 the
Seventh	 Schedule to the Constitution.	It is in respect  of
"Central  Bureau.  of Intelligence and	Investigation."	 The
Central	 Parliament is therefore ,competent to legislate  on
this topic and the Central Government can make an  executive
order	asking	the  Central  Bureau  of  Intelligence	 and
Investigation to make any enquiry in relation to the acts of
commission  and omission whether amounting to an offence  or
not  of any person including any officer or Minister of	 any
State.	It that be so, will it be reasonable to say that the
Commission appointed by the Central Government under the Act
cannot	be  appointed for finding facts in relation  to	 the
allegations made against the Minister of a State ? Obviously
not.
</p><p id="p_401">It was strenuously submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that
no  such  fact-finding Inquiry Commission could	 be  set  up
against	  the  Judiciary  either  Subordinate	or   Higher.
Reference was made to the cases of <a href="/doc/1510841/" id="a_548">The State of West  Bengal
v.  Nripendra Nath Bagchi</a>,(1) and <a href="/doc/1382698/" id="a_549">Shamsher Singh &amp;  Anr.  v.
State of Punjab</a> (2) in support of this proposition.  But the
exclusion of the inquiry under the Act against the Judiciary
is  based on entirely different principles.  So far  as	 the
Subordinate  Judiciary is concerned, inquiry of this  nature
will be impermissible on the. basis of the express  language
of <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_550">Article 235</a> as interpreted by this Court in the two cases
referred to above and in various others.  The setting up  of
such  an  inquiry against a High Court Judge  or  a  Supreme
Court  Judge  will be barred because of	 the  constitutional
provisions  contained in clauses (4) and (5) of <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_551">Article	 124</a>
read  with <a href="/doc/1923298/" id="a_552">Article 218.</a>	 As a matter of fact  in  accordance
with  clause (5) of <a href="/doc/1164880/" id="a_553">Article 124</a> the Parliament	has  enacted

As  already pointed out, in an inquiry set up under the	 Act
there  is no prosecution, no framing of a formal charge,  no
accused	 before	 the  Commission of Inquiry.   There  is  no
exercise of any supervisory or disciplinary jurisdiction  by
the  Central Government against the State Government by	 the
appointment of a Commission, nor is there any usurpation  of
any  executive	function of the State.	 Reference  in	this
connection may be made to the following cases
<a href="/doc/819726/" id="a_555">M.   V.	 Rajwade  v. Dr. S. M. Hasan &amp; Ors</a>,  (1)  <a href="/doc/1776469/" id="a_556">Brajnandan
Sinha  v. Jyoti Narayan</a>(2) <a href="/doc/685234/" id="a_557">Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia  v.	Shri
Justice S. R. Tendolkar &amp; Ors</a>, (3) <a href="/doc/894748/" id="a_558">State of Jammu &amp;  Kashmir

v.  State of Orissa &amp; Ors</a>;(5) and <a href="/doc/502277/" id="a_560">Krishna Ballabh Sahay	 and
Ors. v. Commission of Enquiry &amp; Ors</a>.(6) The Centre, however,
must be and is concerned with and interested in knowing	 and
ascertaining  facts as regards the allegations made  against
any  Chief Minister, Minister or any other Officer  of	the.
State Government.
</p><p id="p_403">Now  let  us  proceed  to examine  the	matter	a  bit	more
carefully  with reference to the other arguments of Mr.	 Lal
Narayan	 Sinha.	 Counsel submitted that neither the  Council
of  Ministers  nor  any individual  Minister  is  under	 the
disciplinary  control of the Central Government, Setting  up
of a Commission of Inquiry to find facts in relation to	 the
alleged misconduct or maladministration of the Ministers is,
in substance and effect, an exercise of disciplinary control
over them.  He further submitted that the State	 Legislature
to whom the Ministers are responsible is competent to set up
an  inquiry against them in accordance with the	 powers	 and
privileges  as provided for in <a href="/doc/74909/" id="a_561">Article 194.</a>  It may  be	 so.
It  may	 well be, as further argued by Mr. Sinha,  that	 not
only  the State Legislature but the State Government  itself
is  competent  to appoint a Commission	of  Inquiry  against
itself	or  its	 Ministers  and	 officers.   But  it  sounds
incongruous  and highly anomalous that the State  Government
would think of instituting an inquiry against itself.  It is
equally strange to think that the Ministers in power,  while
remaining  in office, would set up a Commission	 of  Inquiry
for  inquiring into their alleged misdeeds in the matter  of
administration	of  the	 State.	 We  shall  assume  for	 the
purpose	 of  argument  that  legally  and  technically	 the
position  is  correct.	 Even so, how does it  lead  to	 the
conclusion  that their power is exclusive and  excludes	 the
power  of the Central Government under the Act?	 We fail  to
find any words in any of the Articles of the Constitution to
indicate  that	the power of the State	Legislature  or	 the
State Government in this matter is exclusive.  It may be co-
extensive.  and such a situation is  undoubtedly  postulated
and provided for in the proviso appended to sub-section	 (1)
of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_562">section 3</a> of the Act.  Although technically and literally
the Ministers are appointed by the Governor and hold  office
at his pleasure, in reality, in the constitutional set up of
our parliamentary democracy, the Governor in his  discretion
cannot by

<p id="p_404">himself	 set up a Commission of Inquiry against the  sitting
Ministers,  nor	 can  the President direct  him	 to  do	 so-
emergency  provisions  in  Part	 XVIII	apart.	 What	then
excludes  the  power of the Central Government to set  up  a
Commission  of	Inquiry for finding facts in regard  to	 the
alleged maladministration of the Ministers or officers of  a
particular  State.   Government?   After  ascertainment	  of
facts,	further action may follow or be taken in  accordance
with  the  provisions of the Constitution or the  law.	 But
surely the Act does not, nor could it, provide for any	kind
of  disciplinary action such as removal or suspension  of  a
Minister  in  office by the Centre on ascertainment  of	 the
truth  of the alleged facts- against him-provisions  in	 the
Emergency  Chapter apart.  If it were otherwise	 undoubtedly
it will be encroaching upon he power of the State Government
or  the State Legislature.  India is a single country  as  a
whole.	 The nation is one and one alone.  Leaving also	 the
special	 provisions of <a href="/doc/666119/" id="a_563">Article 370</a> in relation to the  State
of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, there is no dual citizenship; there	 are
no. different nationalities.
</p><p id="p_405">While  assailing the impugned notification Mr.	Lal  Narayan
Sinha  has strenuously contended that <a href="/doc/331399/" id="a_564">Article 164(2)</a> of	 the
Constitution   which   makes  the   Council   of   Ministers
collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of	 the
State  indicates  that	a  Minister  is	 in  no	 other	 way
responsible, answerable or accountable for anything that  he
does  while  in	 office and he cannot  be  subjected  to  an
inquiry	  under	 the  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_565">Commissions  of  Inquiry	Act</a>.	This
contention  is based on a misconception of the	true  import
and meaning of the doctrine of collective responsibility and
as such cannot be countenanced.	 The following discussion on
the  subject in "Representative and Responsible	 Government"
by A. H. Birch will be found useful in this connection :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_131">	      "Ministerial accountability to Parliament	 has
	      two aspects : the collective responsibility of
	      Ministers	 for the policies of the  Government
	      and  their individual responsibility  for	 the
	      work  of	their departments.   Both  forms  of
	      responsibility  are  embodied  in	 conventions
	      which   cannot  be  legally  enforced.	Both
	      conventions  were developed during  the  nine-
	      teenth century, and in both cases the practice
	      was   established	 before	 the  doctrine	 was
	      announced (page 131)."
</blockquote><p id="p_406">In  "Government	 and  Law" by T. C. Hartlay  and  J.  A.  C.
Griffith,   the	 position  in  regard  to   the	  collective
responsibility	of Ministers to the Legislature	 is  tersely
stated as under
	      "Ministers   are	said  to   be	collectively
	      responsible.   This  is  off-en  elevated	  by
	      writers to the level of a 'doctrine' but is in
	      truth  little more than a	 political  practice
	      which    is   commonplace	  and	 inevitable.
</p><p id="p_407">	      Ordinarily,  Ministers form  the	governmental
	      team,   all  being  appointed  by	 the   Prime
	      Minister from one political party.  A  Cabinet
	      Minister deals with his own area of policy and
	      does  not	 normally have much to do  with	 the
	      area of other Ministers.	Certainly no Cabinet
	      Minister	would  be  likely  to  make   public
	      statements which impugned
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">	      134</span>
	      on the work of another Minister's	 department.
	      On   a   few  important  issues,	 policy	  is
	      determined  by the Cabinet  after	 discussion.
	      Collective  responsibility means that  Cabinet
	      decisions bind all Cabinet Ministers, even  if
	      they  argued  in	the  opposite  direction  in
	      Cabinet.	 But this is to say no more  than  a
	      Cabinet  Minister	 who  finds  himself  in   a
	      minority must either accept the majority	view
	      or  resign.  The team must not be weakened  by
	      some  of	its members making clear  in  public
	      that  they  disapprove  of  the	Government's
	      policy.	And  obviously	what  is  true	 for
	      Cabinet Ministers is even more true for  other
	      Ministers.  If they do not like what the	team
	      is  doing,  they	must either  keep  quiet  or
	      leave" (page 60).
</p><p id="p_408">Dealing with the collective responsibility of the Council of
Ministers  to the Legislative Assembly of the State,  Sarkar
C. J., speaking for the Court said at page 405 as follows in
<a href="/doc/894748/" id="a_566">State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad</a>(1) :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_132">	      "<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_567">Section 37</a> talks of collective responsibility

	      member being responsible for the action of
	      any other."
</blockquote><p id="p_409">From  the above, it is crystal clear- that the	doctrine  of
collective responsibility on which Mr. Lal Narayan Sinha has

explained  by  eminent scholars, surely the  Parliament	 has
transgressed  its  limits  in enacting such a  law.   It  is
axiomatic  that the amendment of the Constitution cannot  be
allowed	 except as provided for in <a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_570">Article 368.</a>	  There	 are
certain	 exceptions to it.  Examples of exceptions are	very
few.  Numerous such examples given by Wanchoo J., as he then
was,  in Golak Nath(2) case, at page 827, if we may  say  so
with  great  respect, are not quite  accurate.	 The  powers
given  to a particular Legislature under any of the  Entries
in  the respective Lists of the Seventh Schedule or  by	 any
particular Article of the Constitution are ,of the same kind
and  quality;  as for example, when Articles 10,  59(3)	 and
65(3) speak about a law to be made by the Parliament then it
is  not	 conferring a power in the Parliament to  amend	 the
Constitution.	The  power is an ordinary  legislative	one.

</p><p id="p_413">A quotation from Hood Phillips' Constitutional Law was given
to us by Mr. Sinha to say:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_133">	      "The Constitutional Law of a State is the	 law
	      relating	to  the constitution of	 that  State
	      (Page 1).	 The Constitution of a State is	 the
	      system  of laws, customs and convention  which
	      define the composition and powers of organs of
	      the  State and regulate the relations  of	 the
	      various State organs to one another and to the
	      private citizen." (p. 4)
It is not necessary to multiply the quotations.	 In no sense
the impugned law is a constitutional, law.
</blockquote><p id="p_414">Mr.  Sinha  also contended that an ordinary  law  cannot  go
against the basic scheme or the fundamental back-bone of the
Centre-State relationship as enshrined in the  Constitution.
He put his argument in this respect in a very ingenious	 way
because he felt difficulty in placing it in a direct  manner
by  saying  that an ordinary law cannot	 violate  the  basic
structure  of the Constitution.	 In the case of <a href="/doc/1240174/" id="a_577">Smt.  Indira
Nehru  Gandhi  v.  Shri	 Rai  Narain</a>(1)	 such  an   argument
expressly  rejected by this Court.  We may rest	 content  by
referring  to  a passage from the judgment  of	our  learned
brother Chandrachud J., at pages 669-670 which runs thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_134">	      "The  Constitutional  amendments may,  on	 the
	      ratio  of	 the  Fundamental  Rights  case,  be
	      tested  on the anvil of basic structure.	 But
	      apart  from the principle that a case is	only
	      an authority for what it decides, it does	 not
	      logically follow from the majority judgment in
	      the  Fundamental	Rights	case  that  ordinary
	      legislation must also answer the same test  as
	      a	 constitutional	 amendment.   Ordinary	laws
	      have to answer two tests for their validity  :
	      (1  ) The law must be within  the	 legislative
	      competence  of the legislature as defined	 and
	      specified	 in  Chapter  1,  Part	XI  of	 the
	      Constitution  and	 (2)  it  must	not   offend
	      against the provisions of Articles 13 (1 ) and
	      (2)  of the Constitution.	 'Basic	 structure',
	      by the majority judgment, is not a part of the
	      fundamental  rights nor indeed a provision  of
	      the Constitution.	 The theory of basic  struc-
	      ture  is	woven out of the conspectus  of	 the
	      Constitution   and  the  amending	  power	  is
	      subjected	 to it because it is  a	 constituent
	      power.   'The power to a mend the	 fundamental
	      instrument  cannot carry with it the power  to
	      destroy its essential features this, in brief,
	      is the arch of the theory

</blockquote><p id="p_415">The  doctrine of "implied prohibition", relied upon  by	 Mr.
Sinha,	lids  repeatedly  been rejected	 by  the  Courts  in
England, Australia and by this Court.  There is a  veritable
roll call of such cases.  We may just refer to a few :	Webb
and  Outrim,  (1)  followed in The  Amalgamated	 Society  of
Engineers  and	The Adelaide Steamship Company	Limited	 and
others(2) wherein at page 150 it has been stated :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_136">	      "The doctrine of "implied prohibition" against
	      the  exercise of a power once  ascertained  in
	      accordance    with    ordinary	rules	  of
	      construction,  was definitely rejected by	 the
	      Privy Council in Webb v. Outrim, (1907)  A.C.,
	      81".
</blockquote><p id="p_416">Reference may also be made to The State of Victoria and	 The
Commonwealth of Australia. (8) These and many earlier  cases
of  this  Court	 were all considered  and  the	doctrine  of
"implied    prohibition'   was	 definitely   rejected	  by
overwhelming   majority	  in  the  case	 of   <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_578">His   Holiness
Kesavananda  Bharati Sripadagalavaru v. State of  Kerala</a>,(4)
popularly  known  as Fundamental Rights case.  We  may	just
refer  to  the	observations of Palekar	 J.,  at  page	608,
Dwivedi J., at page 916 and Chandrachud J., at page 977.  To
the same effect is the view expressed by Ray J., as, he then
was,  Khanna  J.,  and others.	The  power  granted  to	 the
Central Legislature under Entry 45 of the Concurrent List is
clear and explicit I for passing a law of inquiry in  regard
to any of the matters in List II.  That being so, the  power
cannot	 be   curtailed	  on  the   doctrine   of   "implied
prohibition".  As a matter of fact one had to search in vain
the basis for even applying this doctrine in this, case.
Wynes  in  his	book "Legislative,  Executive  and  Judicial
Powers	in Australia," Fourth Edition has said at  pages  12
and 13:

</p><p id="p_418">It  is	not  necessary for us to discuss or  deal  with	 any
detail the last submission made on behalf of the  plaintiff.
It  was	 a faint, weak and hesitant argument to	 escape	 the
Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Centre.	The  grounds
of  mala tides, somewhat vaguely and faintly alleged in	 the
plaint,	 could not be and were not, pressed at the  time  of
the hearing of the suit.  What was, however, argued for	 our
consideration  was that the two inquiries-one set up by	 the
State  earlier and the other appointed by the Centre  later-
are  almost one and the same; they cannot be allowed  to  go
side  by  side.	  However the fact that	 the  Commission  of
Inquiry appointed by the Centre is for the purpose of making
an  inquiry  into the definite matter of  public  importance
within	the meaning of <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_581">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act could not  be
and  was not disputed.	The only point debated	was  whether
another	 Commission appointed by the Central  Government  to
inquire	 into  the same matter for which  a  Commission	 had
already been set up by the State Government is violative  of
proviso	 (b) to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_582">section 3(1)</a>.  But there is no substance  in
this  argument.	  Firstly,  the notification  of  the  State
Government  has	 not in terms appointed any  Commission	 for
inquiry	 into the matters of alleged  corruption,  nepotism,
favouritism  and maladministration of the Chief Minister  or
any  other  Minister of the Government	of  Karnataka.	 The
items  specified  in clauses (I) to (XXXII) are said  to  be
"irregularities committed or excess payments made in certain
matters	 relating to contracts, grant of land, allotment  of
sites, purchase of furniture, disposal of food-grains  etc.'
In  none of those clauses it is mentioned as to who is	said
to   be	 responsible  for  the	alleged	 irregularities	  or
maladministration.   There  is no reference to	any  alleged
misconduct,  corruption	 or maladministration of  the  Chief
Minister or of any other Minister.  The last clause (XXXIII)
is very vaguely and conveniently worded.  It says-
"Who  are  the persons responsible for the lapses,  if	any,
regarding the aforesaid and to what extent ?"
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">138</span>
<p id="p_419">The  terms  of reference in the Notification issued  by	 the
Centre is to inquire into the specific matters enumerated in
Annexure 1, none of Which is covered by the notification  of
the  State Government, as for example, item I of Annexure  I
reads thus
	      "Whether	 the   Chief   Minister	   practised
	      favouritism and nepotism by appointing his own
	      brother,	Shri D. Komparaj Urs, as a  Director
	      of   the'	 Karnataka  State  Film	  Industries
	      Development Corporation in place of Shri R. J.

	      1974, and later as Director-in-Charge with the
	      powers  to  exercise  all the  powers  of	 the
	      Managing Director.'
In  regard to the specific matters in Annexure II there	 may
be found some common matters which are the subject-matter of
inquiry by the State Government but then, as we have already
stated,	 in  regard  to	 the  matters  in  Annexure  II	 the
notification in clear terms excludes ,any matter covered  by
the  notification of the Government of Karnataka dated	18th
May,  1977.   The  Grover Commission,  therefore,  would  be
competent  to exclude such matters from the purview  of	 its
inquiry.

</blockquote><p id="p_421">The facts of the case briefly are : The Union Home  Minister
addressed a communication dated April 26, 1977 to the  Chief
Minister  of  the State of Karnataka enclosing a copy  of  a
memorandum  of	allegations purporting to  be  submitted  by
certain	 members  of the opposition party in  the  Karnataka
State Legislature seeking his comments thereon.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">139</span>
<p id="p_422">The Chief Minister of the State of Karnataka replied to	 the
Union  Home Minister on May 13, 1977 answering	the  various
allegations  and charges.  The Chief Minister  of  Karnataka
also questioned the powers of the Central Government to	 ask
for  the comments of the State Government.  On May 18,	1977
the   State  Government	 by  a	notification   appointed   a
Commission of Inquiry under <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_587">section 3(1)</a> of the	 Commissions
of Inquiry Act, 1952 to inquire into various allegations and
irregularities	specified  in the notification.	  The  Chief
Minister  also	addressed a letter on May 18,  1977  to	 the
Union Home Minister informing him on the appointment of	 the
Commission.  On May 23, 1977 by a notification the Union  of
India  appointed  another  Commission  of  Inquiry  for	 the
purpose of inquiring into charges of corruption, favouritism
and misuse of governmental power against the Chief  Minister
and other Ministers of the State of Karnataka.
In  this  suit	the  action  of	 the  Union  Government	  in
constituting  a Commission of Inquiry under <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_588">section 3(1)</a>  is
challenged  as	illegal, ultra vires  and  unconstitutional.
The  contention of the State Government is that the  Central
Government  has no jurisdiction or authority  to  constitute
the  Commission	 of Inquiry in the exercise  of	 its  powers
under  the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_589">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952.  The  plaintiff
contended  that the impugned notification is destructive  of
the  federal  structure of the Constitution  and  scheme  of
distribution of powers that the Constitution does not confer
any  supervisory  or  disciplinary  control  by	 the   Union
executive  over	 the State Government or its  Ministers	 and
that  the Constitution does not vest the Central  Government
with any general supervisory or inquisitorial power over the
functioning  of the State Governments within the  respective
fields.	 As the matter in dispute affects the legal right of
the State it was submitted that a suit under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_590">Article 131</a>  of
the Constitution is maintainable in the Supreme Court.
On  behalf of the 1st defendant, the Union of India, it	 was
averred	 that  the  suit by the State of  Karnataka  is	 not
maintainable  in as much as the impugned notification  dated
May  23,  1977	does not affect the  plaintiff	State.	 The
inquiry	 against the Chief Minister and the other  Ministers
is  against  individuals  and  not  against  the  State	  of
Karnataka.  There being no dispute between the Government of
India and the State, a preliminary objection was taken	that
the  suit  was	not maintainable under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_591">Article	131</a>  of	 the
Constitution.	 The  various  pleas  put  forward  by	 the
plaintiff were denied and it was submitted that the impugned
notification  was  well	 within the powers  of	the  Central
Government  and	 that  there had  been	no  infringement  or
interference with the State's executive functions.
On the pleadings the following issues were framed
</p><p id="p_423">1.   Is the suit maintainable?
</p><p id="p_424">2.   Is the impugned notification ultra vires the powers' of
the Central Government under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_592">section 3</a> of the Commissions of
Inquiry Act ?
</p><p id="p_425">3.   If	 <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_593">section  3</a>  of	 the  Commissions  of  Inquiry	 Act
authorises  the	 Central Government to	issue  the  impugned
notification. is the section itself unconstitutional?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">140</span>
<p id="p_426">The  main  question involved in the suit is one	 of  Centre-
State relationship and whether the impugned notification  is
within the powers of the Central Government under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_594">section  3</a>
of   the  Commissions  of  Inquiry  Act.    Though   certain
allegations  are made in the plaint that the impugned  order
was mala fide it was not pressed during arguments.  So	also
the power of the State Government to appoint a commission of
inquiry is not challenged.  It is therefore not necessary to
go  into the reasons which induced the State  Government  to
appoint	 a commission of inquiry.  Before dealing  with	 the
various	 contentions of the counsel on behalf of  the  State
and  the Central Government it is necessary to set  out	 the
background  and the relevant provisions of the	Constitution
dealing with the Centre-State relationship and the scope  of
the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_595">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952.
</p><p id="p_427">The  British Crown assumed sovereignty over India from	East
India Company in 1858 and the British Parliament enacted the
first statute for the governance of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_596">India Act</a>, 1858 (21 &amp; 22
Vict.,	106).	<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_597">The Act</a> provided absolute  imperial  control
without	 any popular participation in the administration  of
the country.  The powers of the Crown were exercised by	 the
Secretary  of  State  for India assisted  by  a	 Council  of
Members.   Subsequently the Indian Councils Act, 1861,	1892
and 1909 were passed.  Later on the Government of India Acts
1912 and 1915 were passed by the British Parliament.
The Government of India Act, 1919, was the first step  taken
by the British Government for, increasing the association of
Indians	 in every branch of administration and	the  gradual
development  of self governing institutions with a  view  to
progressive realisation of responsible government in British
India.	The Government of India Act, 1919 introduced for the
first  time dyarchy in the provinces.  The central  subjects
were  exclusively  kept	 under the control  of	the  Central
Government.    The  provincial	subjects were  divided	into
'transferred' and 'reserved'  subjects.		 Transferred
subjects  were administered by the Governor with the aid  of
Ministers  while reserved subjects were administered by	 the
Governor    and	  his	Executive   Council   without	 any
responsibility to the Legislature.  By Devolution Rules made
under the Government of India Act, 1919 a separation of	 the
subjects  of administration into Central and Provincial	 was
made.	To some extent the relation of central control	over
the  provinces	was  relaxed.  <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_598">Under the  Act</a>  of  1919	 the
provinces  were	 delegates  of the centre  and	the  central
legislature retained the power to legislate for the whole of
India	relating  to  any  subject.   The  passing  of	 the
Government of India Act, 1935 introduced for the first	time
a  change in the from of the Government i.e. the  Government
which  was unitary under the Government of India  Act,	1919
gave  way to a federation with the provinces and the  Indian
State as the units.  Under the unitary system the  provinces
were  under  the administrative as well as  the	 legislative
control of the Central Government.  The Governor-General  in
Council was the keystone of the whole constitutional edifice
and  the, British Parliament discharged	 its  responsibility
through	 the Secretary of State and the Governor-General  in
Council.
</p><p id="p_428">The  intention of the Government of India Act. 1 35  was  to
unite the provinces and the Indian States into a  federation
under the Crown.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">141</span>
<p id="p_429">The  unitary  State  was  to be	 broken	 into  a  number  of
autonomour, provinces deriving their authority directly from
the  Crown instead of from the Central Government  and	then
building them up into a federal structure in which both	 the
federal and provincial governments Would get Powers directly
from  the Crown.  The basis of the change is the  resumption
into the hands of the Crown all rights, authority and juris-
diction in or over the territories of the British India	 and
redistribution of the powers between the Central  Government
and   the   provinces.	  Though   the	 federal   structure
contemplated under the Government of India Act, 1935 did not
come  into existence as the Indian States ,refused to,	join
the  federation, so far as the provinces were  concerned  it
took  effect.	The Government of India	 Act,  1935  divided
legislative  powers between the Central and  the  provincial
Legislatures  and within 'its defined sphere, the  Provinces
were no longer delegates of the Central Government but	were
autonomous units of administration.  The Government of India
assumed the role of the federal government.  With regard, to
provincial  governments	 the  executive	 authority  of	 the
provinces  was	exercised by the Governor on behalf  of	 the
Crown  and  not ,is a subordinate of  the  Governor-General,
with the advice of Ministers responsible to the Legislature.
In  the centre the executive authority was vested  with	 the
Governor  General  and	with regard  to	 reserved  subjects,
defence, external affairs, etc., the Governor General was to
act  in	 his  discretion,  with	 the  help  of	 counsellors
appointed   by	 him  without  being  responsible   to	 the
Legislature.   Governor-General was to act on the advice  of
the  Council  of  Ministers who	 were  responsible,  to	 the
Legislature  with  regard to subjects  other  than  reserved
subjects.  The Governor General was to act under the control
and  directions	 of  the Secretary of  State  regarding	 his
special responsibilities.  The Government of India Act, 1935
distributed  the powers between the federal legislature	 and
the  provincial governments by having (i) Federal List	over
which the Federal Legislature had exclusive powers of legis-
lation;	 (ii)  A Provincial List over which  the  Provincial
Legislature   had  exclusive  jurisdiction;  and   (iii)   A
Concurrent  List over which both the Federal and  Provincial
Legislatures  bad  competence.	The 'Federal  law  prevailed
over  a Provincial law if there was any repugnancy  and	 the
residuary  power  of legislation under the 1935	 Act  vested
with   the   Governor-General.	 Under	 the   scheme,	 the
legislative  powers  of	 both  the  central  and  provincial
legislatures were subject to various limitations and  either
of them was not a sovereign legislature.  Another feature of
the  1935 Act was that the Federal Court was set lip  mainly
for  determining  the  disputes between the  units  and	 the
federation.    The  separation	of  legislative	 powers	  as
Federal.   Provincial and Concurrent Lists and the  division
of  powers  between  the centre and the	 provinces  and	 the
setting up of the Federal Court under the 1935 Act were	 all
adopted in the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_430">The  Indian Independence Act 1947 was passed as	 an  interim
measure	 before the coming into force of  the  Constitution.
The ,object of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 as  amended
by  Adaptation Orders was to make provisions for an  interim
Constitution until the Constituent Assembly could draw up  a
future Constitution.  Indian Independence Act. 1947  altered
the  constitutional position by declaring that	with  effect
from August 15, 1947 the suzerainty of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">142</span>
British	 Crown over the Indian States would lapse  and	from
that   date   United  Kingdom  would  cease  to	  have	 any
responsibility	 in  respect  of  the  Government   of	 the
territories   included	in  British  India.    The   Central
Legislature  of India ceased to exist from August 14,  1947.
The Constituent Assembly came into existence for framing  of
the   Constitution  and	 also  functioned  as  the   Central
Legislature  of the Dominion.  The new Constitution  adopted
the  bulk of the provisions of the Government of India	Act,
1935.	The  provisions relating to distribution  of  powers
between	 the units and the centre were adopted and  in	fact
extended.  The. constitution-makers gave up the unitary bias
and  adopted detailed provisions regarding the	distribution
of powers and functions between the Union and the States  in
all  aspects of their administrative and  other	 activities.
Inter-state  relations,	 co-ordination and  adjudication  of
disputes amongst the States were also provided for.
The  Indian  Constitution cannot be described as  a  federal
Constitution as the Indian Federation is not a result of  an
agreement by various States and the territorial integrity of
the  States  is	 not guaranteed as the	territories  of	 the
States can be changed or a State completely abolished  under
<a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_599">Article	 4</a> of the Constitution.	 But it has to be  borne  in
mind  that  after the lapse of paramountly  of	the  British
Crown,	the Indian States which acceded to the	Dominion  of
India  were  brought  within  the  union  envisaged  by	 the
Constitution.	The  Indian  States  which  acceded  to	 the
Dominion  were brought under the federal system on the	same
footing	 as  other  Units  of  the  Federation,	 namely	 the
Provinces.   The position of the States in the	Constitution
is in several respects subordinate to the Central Government
in that the formation of the federation was not as a  result
of  any	 treaty between the States and the  federation,	 and
that  the  State may be reformed  or  altogether  eliminated
under  <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_600">Art. 4</a> of the Constitution.  Though the	Constitution
divides	 executive power between the Union and	the  States,
the  States, are bound to execute certain directions of	 the
Union.	 The executive power regarding the laws made by	 the
Union  hi the Concurrent subjects will be exercised  by	 the
States	unless	the  Parliament	 direct%  otherwise  and  as
regards	 the  Union  subjects the  Union  may  delegate	 its
executive  functions  to a State either	 by  legislation  by
Parliament  or by consent of the State Government.  It is  a
duty of the State to execute the Union law and the executive
power  of the State must be exercised in such manner as	 not
to  interfere with the executive power of the union and	 the
State  shall be under the direction of the  union  regarding
the  Union laws.  The failure of the State to carry out	 the
directions of the Union would empower the Union to supersede
the State Government by assuming to itself the powers of the
State  Government.   These features  make  the	Constitution
strictly not a federal constitution.  It has been  variously
called	as quasi-federal or federal in structure or  federal
system	with  a	 strong	 central  bias.	  But  whether	 the
Constitution is recognised as federal or not the position of
the  States is distinctly recognised.  Under Art.  I of	 the
Constitution  of  India, India shall be a Union	 of  States.
Without	 States there can be no Union.	Historically as	 the
Princely  Indian  States  joined the  Union  and  for  other
reasons	 the  State  as	 an  entity  was  recognised.	The,
,Constitution  is the source of power for the Union as	well
as the States.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">143</span>
<p id="p_431">While under the Government of India Act, 1935 the source  of
power for the Federal and the Provincial Government was	 the
Crown, under the Constitution of India, the source of  power
for the States as well as the Union is the Constitution.  In
its  own  field i.e. as regards the power conferred  on	 the
State,	it is supreme so also the Central, Government.	 But
in  determining	 what are the powers of the  Union  and	 the
State  one  has to look into the  Constitution	and  nowhere
else.	The  States  are not the delegates  of	the  Central
Government  and the ,Central Government cannot exercise	 any
power  over  the  State which is not  provided	for  in	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_432">Part  V of the Constitution deals with the  Union.   Chapter
deals  with  the  Executive,  Chapter  11  with	 Parliament,
Chapter	 III  with  Legislative	 Powers	 of  the  President,
Chapter	 IV  the  Union Judiciary :and Chapter	V  with	 the
Comptroller  and Auditor-General of India.  Part VI  of	 the
Constitution  deals with the States.  Chapter I is  General,
Chapter 11 deals with the Executive, Ch.  III with the State
Legislature.	Ch.   IV  with	legislative  Power  of	 the
Governor, Ch.  V with the High Courts in the States and	 Ch.
VI  with  Subordinate  Courts.	 Part  XI  deals  with	 the
Relations between the Union and the States. ,Ch.  I of	Part
XI  deals  with Legislative Relations  and  distribution  of
Legislative  Powers while Ch.  II deals with  Administrative
Relations  'between the Union and the States.  A few of	 the
Articles  in these ,Chapters will be referred to  in  detail
later.	 But  it is sufficient at this stage  to  note	that
while Part V is assigned to the Union executive and Part  VI
to the, States, Part XI deals with the Relations between the
Union  and the States.	The distribution of  powers  between
the  Union and the States can be discerned from the  various
provisions  of	the  Constitution.   A	machinery  is	also
provided   for,	  for  settling	 their	 disputes   in	 the
Constitution.	In  the distribution of powers it  is  clear
there  is strong tilt in favour of the Union.  According  to
the  Constitution, the Union can assume powers of the  State
Government  by	taking over the State  Administration  under
certain contingencies provided for in the Constitution.	 But
the  Union  Government cannot claim any power which  is	 not
vested	in  it	under the provisions  of  the  Constitution.
There is no overriding power with the Union Government.	  It
cannot	deal with the State Government as its delegate,	 for
the  source of power for the Union as well as the State,  is
the  Constitution and the Union Government cannot claim	 any
powers	 over  the  State  which  are  not  found   in	 the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_433">The  nature  of our Constitution has been discussed  by	 the
Supreme Court in a few decisions which may be referred to at
this stage.  <a href="/doc/514162/" id="a_601">In Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v. The State of  Assam
&amp; Others</a>,(1) Gajendragadkar J. as he then was, in construing
<a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_602">Art. 301</a> observed : "We must adopt a realistic approach	 and
bear  in  mind the essential features of the  separation  of
powers	on  which our Constitution rests.  It is  a  federal
constitution  which we are interpreting, and so that  impact
of <a href="/doc/121190/" id="a_603">Art.	  301</a>  must be judged accordingly". The	 matter	 was
dealt with by S.    K.	Das J. in the  Automobile  Transport
(Rajasthan) Ltd v. The
(1)  [1961] 1 S.C.R. 809.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">144</span>
<p id="p_435">State  of Rajasthan and Others.(2) The learned	Judge  after
tracing	 the history of the' Indian Constitution observed  :
"The  evolution	 of afederal structure	or  a  quasi-federal
structure  necessarily	involved,  in  the  context  of	 the
conditions  then prevailing, a distribution of powers and  a
basic part of our Constitution relates to that	distribution
with  the three legislative lists in the  Seventh  Schedule.
The  Constitution  itself says by Art.	I that	India  is  a
Union  of States and in interpreting. the  Constitution	 one
must  keep in view the essential structure of a	 federal  or
quasi-federal  Constitution, namely, that the units  of	 the
Union have also certain powers as has the Union itself." The
learned' Judge further observed : "In evolving an integrated
policy on this subject our Constitution-makers seem to	have
kept in mind three main, considerations which may be broadly
stated thus : first, in the larger interests of India  there
must  be free flow of trade, commerce and intercourse,	both
inter-State and intra-State; second, the regional interests.
must  not be ignored altogether; and third, there must be  a
power of' intervention by the Union in any case of crisis to
deal with particular problems that may arise in any part  of
India."	 rhe  learned  Judge  concluded	 :  "Therefore,	  in
interpreting the relevant articles in PartXIII we must	have
regard	to the general scheme of the Constitution  of  India
with  special  reference to Part III  (Fundamental  Rights),
PartXII	 (Finance,  Property etc. containing Arts.  276	 and
</p><p id="p_436">286) and their inter-relation to Part XIII in the context of
a federal or quasi-federal constitution in which the  States
have  certain powers including the power to  raise  revenues
for  their  purposes by taxation." The	decision,  is  clear
authority  for the proposition that the essential  structure
of   Indian  Government	 is  of	 federal  or   quasi-federal
character, the units havingalso certain powers as the  Union
itself.
</p><p id="p_437">On  this aspect the learned Solicitor-General very  strongly
relied on certain passages in <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_604">State of West Bengal v.  Union
of  India</a>,, (1) in the Majority judgment delivered by  Sinha
C. J. Referring to <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_605">Art. 4of</a> the Constitution which  empowers
the Parliament by legislation to alter the territory of	 the
State or abolish it altogether Sinha C. J. observed :  "When
the  Parliament	 is  invested with authority  to  alter	 the
boundaries  of any State and to diminish its areas so as  to
even  destroy a State with all its power and  authority,  it
would  be  difficult to hold that the  Parliament  which  is
competent  to  destroy	a  State  is,  on  account  of	some
assumption   as	 to  absolute  sovereignty  of	the   State,
incompetent  effectively to acquire by legislation  designed
for  that  purpose  the	 property owned	 by  the  State	 for
Governmental  purposes." The learned Chief Justice,  further
observed that "Even if the, Constitution were heldto be
a federal and the States regarded qua the Unionas  sovereign
the  power  of	the Union to legislate	in  respect  of	 the
property Situate    in	  the	State	 would	  remain
unrestricted."	The Court was, considering an Act passed  by
the,  Parliament,  the Coal Bearing Areas  (Acquisition	 and
<a href="/doc/1515277/" id="a_606">Development)  Act</a>,  1957,  enabling the Union  of  India  to
acquire	 certain  coal bearing areas in the  State  of	West
Bengal.	 The State filed a suit contending that the Act	 did
not apply to lands vested in or owned by the State and	that
if it applied to such lands the-

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_138">145</span>
<p id="p_439">Act was beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament.
The,  decision	as  far	 as  it	 holds	that  even  if	 the
Constitution were held to be a federal Constitution and	 the
States regarded qua the Union as sovereign, the power of the
Union  to legislate in respect of the property would  remain
unrestricted,  may be right as falling within power  of	 the
Parliament under Entry 42, List III aid Entries 52 and 54 of
List  I.  But with very great respect the  observation	that
"the   Constitution  of	 India	is  not	 truly	Federal	  in
character  .... that only those powers which  are  concerned
with  the  regulation of local Problems are  vested  in	 the
States"	 is  not in accordance with the	 decisions  of	this
Court  in  <a href="/doc/514162/" id="a_607">Atiabari  Tea Co. Ltd. v. The State	of  Assam  &amp;
Others</a> (supra) and the <a href="/doc/304499/" id="a_608">Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.
vs.  the  State of Rajasthan and Others</a> (supra) which  is  a
decision  of  a Bench of seven Judges of  this	Court.	 The
observation  of the Court that from the powers conferred  on
the  Parliament	 under <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_609">Art. 4</a> it cannot be held that  it  is
incompetent  for  the Parliament to acquire  by	 legislation
the,  property	owned  by the States on the  theory  of	 the
absolute sovereignty of the, States, cannot be understood as
having laid down that the States have no sovereignty even in
their  own sphere or that Parliament has any  overriding  or
supervening powers.  The observation of Subba Rao
J.   as	 he  then was in the dissenting	 judgment  that	 the
Indian	 Constitution  accepts	the  federal   concept	 and
distributes  the  sovereign powers  between  the  coordinate
constitutional	entities, namely, the Union and	 the  States
and that this concept implies that one cannot encroach	upon
the  Governmental  functions  or  instrumentalities  of	 the
other,	unless the Constitution expressly provides for	such
interference,  is in accordance with the. accepted  view  of
this Court.  It is unfortunate that the earlier decisions of
this  Court in <a href="/doc/514162/" id="a_610">Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v. The State  of  Assam</a>
and <a href="/doc/304499/" id="a_611">Others and the Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd.  v.
The  State of Rajasthan and Others</a> were not brought  to	 the
notice of the Court. In Special Reference No. 1 of  1964(1),
dealing	 with  the  Centre-State  relationship	this   Court
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_145">	      "Our  Legislatures  have	undoubtedly  plenary
	      powers, but these powers are controlled by the
	      basic  concepts  of the  written	Constitution
	      itself   and  can	 be  exercised	within	 the
	      legislative    fields   allotted	 to    their
	      jurisdiction  by	the three  Lists  under	 the
	      Seventh  Schedule; but beyond the	 Lists,	 the
	      Legislatures cannot travel.  They can no doubt
	      exercise	their plenary legislative  authority
	      and discharge
	      their  legislative functions by virtue of	 the
	      powers  conferred	 on  them  by  the  relevant

	      of  the  power  is  the  Constitution  itself.

	      Legislatures   including	the  Parliament	  is
	      normally	controlled  by the  provisions	con-
	      tained  in part III of the  Constitution.	  If

	      It was further observed:

</blockquote><p id="p_440">The political _development of British India took the form of
dismantling a unitary Constitution and introducing a federal
scheme through Devolution Rules and the Government of  India
Act, 1935. Our Constitution accepted a federal scheme though
limited	 in extent having regard to the regional  interests,
resources,  language and other diversities existing  in	 the
vast subcontinent.  These facts have been taken into account
by the Constitution-makers and a limited federalism was made
a  part of the Constitution by <a href="/doc/1406924/" id="a_613">Art. 1</a> itself providing	that
India  shall be a Union of States.  Effect is given to	this
intention  by  separation  of the  Lists  and  by  providing
legislative and executive power to the Union and the  States
in  separate chapters of the Constitution.   This  principle
has been accepted by the- Supreme Court in the decisions  in
<a href="/doc/514162/" id="a_614">Atiabari  Tea Co. Ltd.	V. The State of Assam &amp;	 Others</a>	 and
'the  <a href="/doc/304499/" id="a_615">Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. The State  of
Rajasthan  and Others</a> cited earlier.  The observations	made
in the West Bengal case (supra) which have been referred  to
already are not in conformity with the otherwise  consistent
view  of the Supreme Court that the Constitution is  supreme
and that the Union as well as the States will have to  trace
their  powers  from the provisions of the  Constitution	 and
that the Union is not supreme and the States are not  acting
as delegates of the Union.
</p><p id="p_441">It  may	 be useful to refer to the views  expressed  by	 the
Supreme Court in the Kesavananda (1) and Election (2)  cases
on this subject.  The question that arose in those cases was
how  far the Constitution could be amended.  In	 Kesavananda
case, the majority was of the view that the basic  structure
of  the	 Constitution cannot be amended. The  Election	case
proceeded on the basis of Kesavananda's case that the  basic
structure could not be amended.	 The learned counsel for the
plaintiff Mr. Lal Narain Sinha made it very clear that he is
not inviting the Court to find any undefined basic structure
but is confining his arguments to point out that the federal
structure  in the limited sense is an integral part  of	 the
Constitution  and that the Union Government is	not  supreme
and it has no power apart from what is found
(1)  [1973] Supp.  S.C.R. 1.
</p><p id="p_442">(2)  [1976] 2 S.C.R. 347.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_140">147</span>
<p id="p_443">in the Constitution.  In Kesavananda case it was held by the
majority  that	<a href="/doc/594125/" id="a_616">Art. 368</a> does not enable the  Parliament  to
alter	the  basic  structure  or  the	framework   of	 the
Constitution.  Chief Justice Sikri in discussing as to	what
is  the	 basic structure of the Constitution  held  that  it
consisted  of (1) Supremacy of the Constitution, (2)  Repub-
lican  and  democratic	form  of  Government,  (3)   Secular
character  of  the Constitution, (4)  Separation  of  powers
between	 legislatures,	executive and  judiciary',  and	 (5)
Federal character of the Constitution.	For the purposes  of
the  present  discussion it is unnecessary to  go  into	 the
question  as. to whether the federal structure as  found  in
the Constitution could be amended or not as it is sufficient
to note that it is recognised that the States do  constitute
an   integral	part  of  the  Constitution   having   their
legislative  and  executive  powers and	 that  these  powers
cannot be interfered with by the Union Government unless  in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.
Before	dealing	 with  the position of	the  States  in	 the
Constitution,  it  has	to  be borne in	 mind  that  in	 the
distribution  of  powers between the Union  and	 the  States
there is a strong bias in favour of the Union.	In the event
of  an Emergency the federal Government can  convert  itself
into a unitary one.  The Union Government can supersede	 the
state  Government which refused to carry out its  directions
as are authorised under <a href="/doc/897579/" id="a_617">Art. 365</a> of the Constitution.  While
the  Union Government is given powers to give directions  in
certain specified matters under Articles 256 and 257, when a
Proclamation of Emergency is made under <a href="/doc/1018568/" id="a_618">Art. 352</a>, the  power
of  the	 Union	executive to give directions  to  the  State
Government  will  extend to any matter and  the	 legislative
power  of the Union Parliament. will extend to	matters,  in
the State List under <a href="/doc/497125/" id="a_619">Art. 250.</a>	There are provisions in	 the
Constitution conferring wider powers on the Union in case of
Financial  Emergency. The executive authority of  the  Union
becomes	 enlarged enabling the Union to give  directions  to
the   State  requiring	financial  discipline.	 The   Union
Parliament  can	 assume	 the  legislative  powers  over	 any
subject	 included  in the State List by a  Resolution  under
<a href="/doc/1883579/" id="a_620">Art.249</a>	 if  such legislation is necessary in  the  national
interest.  Whenever the State Government cannot be,  carried
out  in accordance with the provisions of  the	Constitution
the  President is empowered to take over and the  Union	 can
assume	the executive and.  Legislative powers of the  State
under  <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_621">Art.  356.</a>   Though there is  a	division  of  powers
between	 the  Union and the States there  is  provision	 for
control by the Union Government both over the administration
and legislation of the State.  These are provided for  under
<a href="/doc/1776802/" id="a_622">Art. 201</a> which empowers the President to disallow any  State
Legislation  which is reserved for his consent.	 A  duty  is
cast upon the States by the Constitution under Arts. 256 and
257 to execute the Union laws.	The executive power of every
State  shall  be so exercised as not to interfere  with	 the
executive  power of the Union and that in these matters	 the
States	shall be under the directions of the  Union.   These
powers are specifically mentioned in the Constitution and it
is not disputed that the Union Government can exercise them.
The  question that arises for consideration is	whether	 the
Union Government can order an inquiry into the	Governmental
functions  of the State which is not specifically  conferred
on the Union by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_141">148</span>
Constitution.	Ile  preliminary  objection  of	 the   Union
Government that it is not the State but only the  Government
of  the	 State or the Ministers that are aggrieved  will  be
dealt  with  in due course.  The position of the  States  is
indicated  in Art.  I which declares that India shall  be  a
Union  of States and the States and the territories  thereof
shall  be  as  specified  in  the  First  Schedule  and	 the
territory  of  India shall comprise the territories  of	 the
States, the Union territories and such other territories  as
may be acquired.  Part VI of the Constitution deals with the

other  provisions  of  the  Constitution  Part	XI  of	 the
Constitution deals with relations between the Union and	 the
states : Ch.  I with legislative relations and Ch.  II	with
administrative relations between the Union and' the  States.
The scheme for the distribution of legislative power between
the  Union  and	 the States has been  taken  over  from	 the
Government of India Act, 1935 and Arts. 245 and 246 more  or
less reproduce <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_629">sections 99</a> and <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_630">100</a> of the 1935 Act.  <a href="/doc/369702/" id="a_631">Article
245  (1)</a>  provides  "Subject  to  the  provisions  of	this
Constitution, Parliament may make laws ?or the whole or	 any
part  of  the territory of India, and the Legislature  of  a
State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State".

make laws with respect to, any of the matters enumerated  in

<p id="p_444">current	 List.	 It is important to note  that	the,  powers
conferred  under  Articles 245 and 246 are  subject  to	 the
provisions of the Constitution.	 Therefore the laws made  by
a   Legislature	 may  not  be  valid  for  either  lack	  of
jurisdiction  in  respect of the subject matter	 or  on	 the
ground that they violate the provisions of the Constitution.
The  residuary	power  of legislation is  conferred  on	 the
Parliament under <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_633">Art. 248</a> which provides that the Parliament
has  exclusive	power to make any law with  respect  to	 any
matter not enumerated in the concurrent List or in the State

Union  law which Parliament is competent to enact the  Union

extent of repugnancy.  But an attempt should be made to	 see
whether the conflict could be avoided by construction.	If a
reconciliation	is  impossible only then the  federal  power
should	prevail.  <a href="/doc/375101/" id="a_637">Article 248(1)</a> and Entry 97 in List  I  of
the Seventh Schedule make it clear that the residuary  power
is  with  the  Parliament and when a  matter  sought  to  be
legislated  is	not  included in List II  or  List  III	 the
Parliament  has	 power	to make laws with  respect  to	that
matter	or tax.	 But function of the Lists is not to  confer
powers	 on  the  Legislature.	 They  only  demarcate	 the
legislative  field.   The Federal Court,  in  The  Governor-
General in Council v. The Raleigh Investment Co.(1) observed
that  "the purpose of the List was not to create  or  confer
power  but  only  to distribute to  federal  and  provincial
legislatures  the powers which had been conferred by<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_638"> ss.  99</a>
and <a href="/doc/1159761/" id="a_639">1</a> <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_640">00</a> of the Act".While approving the observations of
the  Federal Court in Union ofIndia  v. ff. S.	Dhillon
(2) the majority for	 whom Chief Justice Sikrispoke held
that "It (<a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_641">Art. 248</a>) is framed in   the	  widest    possible
terms.On  its  terms the only question to be  asked'  is
is the matter soughtto	be legislated included in  List
II  or	in  List  III or is the	 tax  sought  to  be  levied
mentioned  in List II or in List III  No question has to  be
asked  about List I. If the answer is in the negative,	then
it  follows  that  Parliament has power to  make  laws	with
respect	 to that matter or tax." But this  observation	does
not  decide the question whether the  residuary	 legislative
power  of the Union includes a right to direct inquiry	into
the governmental functions of the State for as laid down  by
the Federal Court in the Governor-General in Council v.	 The
Raleigh	 Investment Co. the purpose of the Lists is  not  to
create	or  confer  powers and the  powers  conferred  under
Articles  245 and 246 are subject to the provisions  of	 the
Constitution.  As there is no provision in the	Constitution
conferring   on	 the  Union  the  power	 to  supervise	 the
governmental  functions	 of the State the reference  to	 the
Lists will not solve the problem.
</p><p id="p_445">The  crux of the, controversy is while the, Karnataka  State
would contend that relation between the Union and the States
is a subject matter of the Constitution and is not a subject
covered by any of the three Lists, the contention on  behalf
of  the Union Government is that the notification  does	 not
contravene   any   of  the  specific   provisions   of	 the
Constitution  and as such the legislative competence of	 the
Union cannot be questioned.  While on behalf of the State of

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">150</span>
<p id="p_447">who  is	 responsible  to the Legislature is  only  with	 the
Legislature  of the, State, the submission on behalf of	 the
Union  is  that the power of the Union is  not	specifically
taken away by any of the provisions of the Constitution	 and
therefore the contemplated inquiry is within the  competence
of  the	 powers, of the Union.	According to  the  Solicitor
General, the right question to ask is "Does the	 legislation
provide	 for  some  matter  which  runs	 counter  to  or  is
inconsistent  with or brings about a change in the  existing
provisions  of	the  Constitution in such  manner  that	 the
original  and  the  amended  provisions	 are  different	 and
inconsistent  ?"  If it does so then it can be	regarded  as
amendment  howsoever  it  may  be  brought  about  i.e.	  by
addition,  variation  or  repeal.  At the,  same  time	mare
enactment  of  provisions  which  are  not  in	any   manner
qualitatively  inconsistent with the existing provisions  of
the   Constitution   but  deal	with  certain	aspects	  of
legislative  topics  or a Constitutional subject,  does	 not
postulate exercise of constituent power for amendment of the
Constitution.	In support of his contention that unless  an
express provision of the Constitution is contravened the law
can  not be questioned on the ground of implied	 prohibition
the  learned  counsel  relied  on  Webb	 v.  Outrim.(1)	 The
question  that	arose for decision by the Privy	 Council  in
that  case  was whether the respondent, an  officer  of	 the
Australian Commonwealth, resident in Victoria and  receiving
his official salary in that State, is liable to be  assessed
in  respect thereof for income tax imposed by an Act of	 the
Victorian Legislature. It  was	not contended  before  the
Court that the restriction on the powersof the Victoria
Constitution  is  enacted by any express  provision  of	 the
Commonwealth  Constitution Act but was argued that  inasmuch
as the imposition of an income-tax might interfere with	 the
free  exercise of the legislative or executive power of	 the
Commonwealth, Such interference must be impliedly  forbidden
by  the Constitution of the Commonwealth, although  no	such
express prohibition can be found therein.  The Court held  :
"The enactments to which attention has been directed do	 not
seem  to  leave any room for implied  prohibition."  It	 was
further	 held  that "It is impossible to  suppose  that	 the
question  now  in  debate was left to  be  decided  upon  an
implied	 prohibition when the power to enact laws  upon	 any
subject	 whatsoever was before the Legislature."  The  basic
principles of construction of the Constitution are laid down
by  Lord Selbourne in R v. Burah (2) which is  accepted	 and
applied	 by Earl Lorebum L. C. in Attorney-General  for	 the
Province  of Ontario and Others v. Attorney General for	 the
Dominion of 'Canada and another. (3) The rule laid down in R
v.  Burah  is  that  "when a  question	arises	whether	 the
prescribed  limits have been exceeded the only way in  which
it  can	 be  done  is  by looking  into	 the  terms  of	 the
instrument  by	which affirmatively the	 legislative  powers
were  created and by which negatively they  are	 restricted.
If  what  has been done is legislation	within	the  general
scope ,of the affirmative words which give the power and  if
it  violates no express, condition or restriction  by  which
that power is limited, it is not for any court of justice to
inquire, further, or to enlarge constructively

<p id="p_450">those  conditions and restrictions".  In 1912 A. C.  571  it
was  held  that	 "if  the  text	 is  explicit  the  text  is
conclusive,  alike in what it directs and what	it  forbids.
When the text is ambigious, as, for example. when the  words
establishing two mutually exclusive jurisdictions are,	wide
enough	to bring a particular power within either,  recourse
must  be  had  to the context and scheme of  the  Act."	 The
decision  of  the Australian High Court in  The	 Amalgamated
Society of Engineers v. The Adelaide Steamship Company	Ltd.
and  Others, (1) in which it was held that the	doctrine  of
implied	 prohibition  against, the exercise  of	 power	once
ascertained  in	 accordance  with ordinary  rules  of  cons-
truction  was  rejected	 by the Privy  Council	in  Webb  v.
Outrim.
</p><p id="p_451">The  decision in The State of Victoria v. The  Common-wealth
of  Australia  (3)  was referred to  but  as  that  decision
reiterates the principles laid down in R. v. Burah (4) it is
not  necessary to refer to it.	The principle laid  down  is
that if what has been done is legislation within the general
words  which  give the power and if it violates	 no  express
condition  or  restriction by which that power	is  limited,
then  it is not for the court of justice to inquire  but  it
cannot be understood as meaning that the word 'express' does
not exclude what is necessarily implied. In Liyanage v. R(5)
the  Privy  Council while interpreting the  Constitution  of
Ceylon held that the Constitution did not expressly vest the
judicial  power exclusively in the judiciary but, that	fact
was   not  decisive  as	 the  scheme  of  the	Constitution
particularly the provisions relating to the judiciary viewed
in the light of the fact that the judicial power had  always
been  vested in courts, held that the judicial power  vested
exclusively  in	 the judiciary.	 To the same effect  is	 the
decision  of  this  Court in <a href="/doc/1510841/" id="a_642">The State	of  West  Bengal  v.
Nripendra Nath Bagchi</a> (6).  The question that arose in	that
case  was whether the inquiry ordered by the Government	 and
conducted by an Executive Officer of the Government  against
a District and Sessions Judge contravened the provision-, of
<a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_643">Article	 235</a>  of the Constitution which vests  in  the	High
Court  the  control over the District Court and	 the  courts
subordinate thereto.  The Court construed the word 'control'
used  in  <a href="/doc/1345754/" id="a_644">Article 235</a> as including disciplinary	 control  or
jurisdiction  over District Judges.  Relying on the  history
which  lay behind the enactment of these articles the  Court
came to the conclusion that 'control' was vested in the High
Court  to effectuate a purpose, namely, the securing of	 the
independence  of  the subordinate judiciary  and  unless  it
included disciplinary control as well, the very object would
be frustrated.	It also took into account the fact that	 the
word 'control' is accompanied by the word 'vest' which is  a
strong	word  which showed that the High Court is  made	 the
sole custodian of the control over the judiciary.  The Court
observed : "This aid to construction (the history which lies
behind the enactment) is admissible because to find out	 the
meaning	 of a law, recourse may legitimately be bad  to	 the
prior  state of the law, the evil sought to be	removed	 and
the  process by which the law was evolved." Though there  is

the  decision of this Court in the <a href="/doc/1510841/" id="a_645">State of West  Bengal  v.

Burah  (Supra)	should	be construed as	 including  what  is
necessarily  implied.  Taking into account the	history	 and
the  scheme  of	 the  Constitution  the	 safeguards  in	 the
Constitution  regarding	 the States have necessarily  to  be
implied,  though  it is conceded on behalf of the  State  of
Karnataka  that no particular provision of the	Constitution
has been expressly modified, amended or altered.
The  extent of the executive power of the Union is found  in
<a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_646">Art. 73</a> and that of the State is given in <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_647">Art. 162.</a>  In Part

<a href="/doc/76145/" id="a_648">Article 256</a> provides that the executive power of every State

the  Government of India to be necessary for  that  purpose.
Under  this  Article it is obligatory on every State  to  so
exercise  its  executive power as to ensure  the  compliance
with the laws made by the Parliament and the executive power

introduced  by	which Government of India  is  empowered  to

the  Government	 of  India may issue  and  shall  not,	save
otherwise  provided  in such directions, be subject  to	 the
superintendence	 or control of the State Government  or	 any
officer	 or authority subordinate to the  State	 Government.
No reliance was placed by the, Government of India on any of
its inherent or overriding powers.  Except in cases referred
to  in articles 256 and 257 and 257A, the Constitution	does
not provide for the Union Government to give any  directions
to the State Government.  Though under <a href="/doc/490234/" id="a_655">Article 355</a> it  shall

As there is no specific Article in the Constitution enabling

goods" in Entry 48 of List II i.e. the State List, held that
the  conflict  could be resolved by  giving  the  expression
"duties	 of  excise" a restricted meaning, namely  that	 the
duty  of  excise is a tax on manufacture  or  production  of
goods.	Thus it is permissible to, give a restricted meaning
in  construing the language of conflicting  provisions.	  <a href="/doc/1425329/" id="a_669">In
Madras	v. Gannon Dunkerly &amp; Co. (Madras) Ltd</a>. (2),  it	 was
held  that though in construing a legislative  entry  widest
construction  must  be	put  on	 the  words  used,  as	 the
expression  "sale  of goods" was a term	 of  well-recognised
legal  import  in the general law; relating to the  sale  of
goods  and  in	the legislative practice  relating  to	that
topic,	it must be interpreted in Entry 48, List II, Sch.  7
of  the	 Act as having the same meaning as in  the  <a href="/doc/651105/" id="a_670">Sale  of
Goods  Act</a>.   The  rule that in construing the	words  in  a
Constitution  most liberal construction should be  put	upon
the  words  is	not a universal rule as	 is  seen  from	 the
judgment  of Lord Blackburn in River Wear  Commissioners  v.
Adamson(3)  where Lord Blackburn expressed his view that  in
interpreting  the  words,  the object is  to  ascertain	 the
intention expressed by the words used and that the object of
interpretation of documents and statutes is to ascertain  of
the intention of them that made it".  Lord Coke in  Heydon's

</p><p id="p_465">It  is therefore necessary to discern the intention  of	 the
Parliament in enacting the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_673">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952.
The inquiry under Entry 45 is for the purpose of any of	 the
matters	 specified in List II or List III.  It is seen	that
inquiry	 into  the  misconduct	in  exercising	governmental
functions  by  the  Chief  Minister of	a  State  cannot  be
discerned  from any of the entries in List II or  List	III.
Entry  45  is in the Concurrent List and if a law  could  be
enacted by the Parliament empowering the Union Government to
conduct	 an  inquiry  into the misuse  of  the	governmental
functions  by a Minister of State, it cannot be denied	that
the  State  Government	will have  the	power  to  legislate
empowering  the State to inquire into the misuse of  govern-
mental	powers	by a Union Minister relating to	 matters  in
List II and List III. Obviously	  the  powers	conferred
under Entry 45 cannot be construedin  such manner,  for	 it
could never have been intended. Otherwisethe result will
not be conducive to the harmonious functioning ofthe  Union
and  the States.  This circumstance is a  strong  indication
that Entry 45 in List III 'inquiries' should not be given  a
wide  meaning  as  conferring on the  Union  and  the  State
Governments  powers  to enact a provision to embark  on	 an,
enquiry	 as to the misuse of the Governmental powers by	 the
other.

<a href="/doc/633902/" id="a_676">Section	 2</a> defines the "appropriate Government"	 as  meaning
the Central Government in relation to a Commission appointed

in  the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and  the  State
Government,  in relation to a Commission appointed by it  to

</blockquote><p id="p_468">The proviso to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_678">section 3(1)</a> bars the State Government except
with  the  approval  of the Central  Government	 to  appoint
another	 Commission to inquire into the same matter  when  a
Commission   appointed	 by  the   Central   Government	  is
functioning and bars the Central Government from  appointing
a commission from inquiring into the same matter so long  as
the   Commission  appointed  by	 the  State  Government	  is
functioning  unless the scope of the inquiry is extended  to
two  or	 more States.  Under <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_679">section  3(1)</a>  the	 appropriate
Government may appoint a commission but shall appoint one if
a  resolution is passed by the House of the People  or,	 the
Legislative  Assembly of the State as the case may be.	 The
purpose	 of  the commission is to make an inquiry  into	 any
"definite matter of public importance?'.
The  Parliament under the Act has delegated its	 legislative
functions  to the appropriate Government and  has  conferred
the  discretion	 to  appoint a commission if it	 is  in	 its
opinion	 necessary  to do so and make it obligatory  on	 the
Government to appoint a commission if there is a  resolution
by the Legislature concerned.  The purpose of appointment of
the  commission is for making an inquiry into  any  definite
matter	of public importance.  There is no mention or  guid-
ance  as  to  the person against whom an inquiry  is  to  be
conducted.   In the proviso which bars the State  Government
from  appointing  the commission to inquire  into  the	same
matter	when already the Central Government has appointed  a
commission  and	 vice versa, it is clear  that	the  section
could  not have contemplated the appointment by the  Central
Government of a commission to inquire into the abuse of	 the
power  by the State Government being aware of the fact	that
such  a	 construction would enable the State  Government  to
appoint a commission to inquire into the misuse of the power
of the Central Government in any of the matters relating  to
Lists  11 and III.  Such a construction would  not  reflect,
the intention of the Parliament.  Before dealing fully	with
the  scope of the powers of the appropriate Government as  a
delegate  and  the construction that has to be	put  on	 the
scope of appointment of a commission of inquiry 'under	this
section, it is necessary to notice other relevant provisions
of  the	 Act.	Subsection (4) of  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_680">section  3</a>  requires	 the
appropriate  Government	 to  lily before the  House  of	 the
People	or  the	 House of the Legislative  Assembly  of	 the
State,	the report of the commission on the inquiry made  by
the  commission	 together with a memorandum  of	 the  action
taken thereon, with a period of six months of the submission
of   the  report  by  the  Commission  to  the	 appropriate
Government.   Subsection  (4)  therefore  contemplates	some
action to be taken by the appropriate Government.  <a href="/doc/631792/" id="a_681">Section 4</a>
deals  with the powers of a commission.	 It shall  have	 the
powers of a civil court while trying the suit under the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908, in respect of matters
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">157</span>
mentioned in the section.  <a href="/doc/1113701/" id="a_682">Section 5</a> enables the  Commission
to require any person to furnish information on the  subject
matter	of the inquiry and any person so required  shall  be

commission  is	deemed	to be a	 civil	court,	for  certain
purposes mentioned in sub-sections (4) and (5) of <a href="/doc/1113701/" id="a_685">section 5</a>.
<a href="/doc/1401198/" id="a_686">Section	 5A</a> empowers the commission to utilize the  services
of certain officers in the case of a commission appointed by

While  considering  the scope of Entry 45 in  List  III	 and
particularly the, word 'inquiries' it has been found that in
the context a restricted meaning should be given and if	 the
word  is  given	 a wide meaning as to an  inquiry  into	 the
governmental  action of the State or the Union, as the	case
may  be, it would not be conducive to the smooth running  of
the  Constitution.   Under  <a href="/doc/49537238/" id="a_691">section  3</a>	the  Parliament	 has
conferred the power on the appropriate Government to appoint
a commission of inquiry to inquire into any definite  matter
of  public  importance.	  On  behalf of	 the  Union  it	 was
submitted   that  the  words  "definite	 matter	 of   public
importance?'  would embrace the inquiry into the  misuse  of
the  governmental functions of the State and in	 support  of
this contention several decisions were cited.
<a href="/doc/819726/" id="a_692">In  M.	Y.  Rajwade v. Dr. S. M.  Hasan	 and  others</a>(1)	 the
question  arose as to whether a commission  appointed  under

court.	The High Court at Nagpur held that the Act does	 not
confer on it the status of a Court.

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">158</span>
<p id="p_471">The  facts  of the case are that the  Government  of  Madhya
Pradesh	  appointed  a	commission  of	inquiry	 under	 the
<a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_694">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>, 1952, with Hon'ble Shri  Justice
B.  K.	Choudhuri as the sole member.	The  Commission	 was

maintain  peace	 and  order,  to  prevent  recrudescence  of
trouble	 and to give adequate medical and other aid  to	 the
injured.
</p><p id="p_475">Dealing	 with the nature of the inquiry the court held	that
the  commission in question was obviously appointed  by	 the
State  Government  for the information of its own  mind,  in
order that it should not act,, in exercise of its  executive
power,	otherwise  than in accordance with the	dictates  of
justice	 and  equity,  in ordering  a  departmental  inquiry
against its officers.  It was therefore a fact finding	body
meant  only to instruct the mind of the	 Government  without
producing any document of a judicial nature.  So far as	 the
scope  of  the inquiry in the case was	concerned  it  falls
strictly  within  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_695">section  3</a> as the  inquiry  related  to  a
definite matter of public importance and not an inquiry into
the misuse of governmental functions of a Chief Minister  or
a  State  Minister.   On  the  facts  of  the  case  it	 was
appropriate  that the court found that it was merely a	fact
finding	 body meant to instruct the mind of the	 Government.
<a href="/doc/1776469/" id="a_696">In  Branjnandan Sinha v. Jyoti Narain</a>(1) the  Supreme  Court
considered  the	 question whether the  Commission  appointed
under  the <a href="/doc/1774870/" id="a_697">Public Servants (Inquiries) Act</a>, 1850, is  not  a
court  within  the meaning of the <a href="/doc/1396751/" id="a_698">Contempt  of	Courts	Act</a>,
1952.  The Court approved the view taken by the Nagpur	High
Court that the Commission was only a fact finding Commission
meant only for instruct the mind of the Government and found
that a Commission under the <a href="/doc/1774870/" id="a_699">Public Servants (Inquiries) Act</a>,
1850,  is  not a court. In Shri Ram Krishna  Dalmia  v	Shri
Justice S. R. Tendolkar and Others(2) the Central Government
appointed a Commission of Inquiry to inquire into and report
in  respect of certain companies mentioned in  the  schedule
attached  to the notification and in respect of	 the  nature
and extent of the control and interest which certain persons
named  in the notification exercised over  these  companies.
The   validity	of  the	 <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_700">Commissions  of  Inquiry  Act</a>	 was
questioned.   The Supreme Court held that the Act was  valid
and  intra  vires  and	the  notification  was	also   valid
excepting  the words "as and by way of securing	 redress  or
punishment' in clause 10 thereof which went beyond the scope
of the Act.  The Court also held that the Act does not dele-
gate  to the Government any arbitrary or uncontrolled  power
and  does  not offend <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_701">Article 14</a> of the	 Constitution.	 The
Court  further	observed that the discretion  given  to	 the
Government  to set up a commission of inquiry is  guided  by
the policy laid down in the Act and the executive action  is
to  be	taken only when there exists a	definite  matter  of
public	importance into which an inquiry is necessary.	 The
facts of the case are that the Central Government  appointed
a Commission

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_152">159</span>
<p id="p_477">of  Inquiry  under <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_702">section 3</a> of the Commissions	 of  Inquiry
Act,  1952,  to	 inquire  and  report  in  respect  of	 the
administration of the affairs of companies specified in	 the
schedule and other matters mentioned in clauses (2) to	(11)
of the Order.  The inquiry under clause (3) is regarding the
nature	and  extent  of the control,  direct  and  indirect,
exercised  over such companies and firms or any of  them  by
Shri  R. K. Dalmia and 3 others, their relatives,  employees
and  persons  connected with them.  Under  clause  (10)	 the
inquiry	 was against any irregularities, frauds or  breaches
of  trust etc. and required the Commission to recommend	 the
action	which  in the opinion of the  Commission  should  be
taken as and by way of securing redress and arrangement	 or'
to  act	 as a preventive in future cases.  This	 Court	held
that  the Commission in the case was merely  to	 investigate
and record its findings and re,commendations without  having
any  power  to	enforce them.  It was further  held  that  a
portion	 of  last  part of cl. (10) which  called  upon	 the
Commission  of	Inquiry to make	 recommendations  about	 the
action	to  be taken as and by way of  securing	 redress  or
punishment  cannot  be	said  to  be  at  all  necessary  or
ancillary to the purpose of the Commission.  The Court	held
that  the  words  "as  and by way  of  securing	 redress  or
punishment"  clearly  go outside the scope of the  Act,	 and
such  a	 provision was not covered by  the  two	 legislative
entries in the Constitution and should therefore be deleted.
Considering  the  scope of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_703">section 3</a> it	 observed  that	 the
"answer	 is  furnished	by the statute	itself	for  section
indicates  that	 the appropriate Government  can  appoint  a
Commission  of	Inquiry only for the purpose of	 an  inquiry
into  any  definite matter of public importance	 and  to  no
other matter.  In other words, the subject matter of inquiry
can  only  be of a "definite matter of	public	importance".
Rebutting the contention on behalf of the appellant that the
delegation of the authority to the appropriate Government is
unguided  and  uncontrolled, the Court	observed  that	"the
executive action of setting up a Commission of Inquiry	must
conform	 to the condition of the- section, that is  to	say,
that there must exist a definite matter of public importance
into which an inquiry is, in the opinion of the	 appropriate
Government, necessary or is required by a resolution in that
behalf passed by the House of the People or the	 Legislative
Assembly of the State".	 The Court proceeded to observe that
if  the Parliament had declared with sufficient clarity	 the
policy and laid down the principles for the guidance of	 the
exercise of the powers conferred on the appropriate  Govern-
ment  it cannot be said that an arbitrary  and	uncontrolled
power had been delegated to the appropriate Government.	  On
the  facts of the case before the Court the  conclusion	 was
reached that the power was exercised within the policy	laid
down  by  the Parliament and the guidance  afforded  by	 the
preamble  and  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_704">section 3</a> of the Act.  The decision  was	 not
dealing with a case in which the inquiry is ordered into the
misuse of governmental functions of the Chief Minister of  a
State exercising the executive functions of the State.	 The
Court also rejected the plea on behalf of the appellant that
the  Act  and  conduct of individual persons  can  never  be
regarded as definite matter of public importance,  observing
that  the  act and conduct of individuals  may	assume	such
dangerous  proportions as may well affect the  public  well-
being and thus become a definite matter of public import-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_153">160</span>
<p id="p_478">ance. An inquiry into "definite matter of public importance"
may  be	 incidental  or ancillary to  such  inquiry  require
inquiring  into the conduct of persons.	 <a href="/doc/1236777/" id="a_705">Section  8-B</a>  which
was  introduced by an amendment by Act 79 of  1971  provides
that if at any stage of the inquiry the Commission considers
it necessary to inquire into the conduct of any person or is
of opinion that the reputation of any person is likely to be
prejudicially affected by the inquiry, the Commission  shall
give to that person a reasonable opportunity of being  heard
in the inquiry and to produce evidence in his defence.	 The
amendment  would indicate the procedure to be adopted if  in
the  course of the inquiry it becomes necessary	 to  inquire
into  the  conduct of any person.  This would  suggest	that
principally  the inquiry is as regards a matter of  definite
public importance.  It may be that in some cases the conduct
of  individuals	 may  become a	definite  matter  of  public
importance  as	laid down in R. K. Dalmias  case.   But	 the
decision does not conclude the point that has arisen in this
case,	namely	whether	 the  definite	matter	 of   public
importance)  should be construed as to include the right  to
inquire	 into  the abuse of governmental  functions  by'  a,
State  Government when no such intention could have been  in
the minds (if the Parliament.

the   State  Government	 of  Jammu  and	 Kashmir  issued   a
notification  under  <a href="/doc/1792136/" id="a_707">section  3</a> of  the	 Jammu	and  Kashmir
Commission of Inquiry Act, 1962, setting up a commission  to
inquire into the wealth acquired by the first respondent and
certain specified members of his family during his period of
office.	 It may be noted +that the Commission of Inquiry was
set up by the State Government after Bakshi Ghulam  Mohammad
resigned and ceased to be, the Chief Minister of the State.
Two  of	 the three Judges of the High Court  took  the	view
that,  the matter referred to was not of  public  importance
because	 on  the  date of  the	notification  Bakshi  Ghulam
Mohammad did not hold any office in the Government and	that
there was no evidence of public agitation in respect of	 the
conduct	 complained  of and that showed that they  were	 not
matters	 of public importance.	The Supreme  Court  rejected
the  view  taken  by  the High	Court  observing  :  "It  is
difficult  to  imagine how a Commission can be set up  by  a
Council	 of Ministers to inquire into the acts of its  head,
the  Prime  Minister, while he is in office.   It  certainly
would be a most unusual thing to happen.. If the rest of the
Council of Ministers resolves to have any inquiry, the Prime
Minister  can be expected to ask for their resignation.	  In
any  case, he would himself go out.  If he takes. the  first
course, then no Commission would be set up for the Ministers
wanting	 the  inquiry  would  have gone.   If  he  went	 out
himself, then the Commission would be set up to inquire into
the  acts  of a person who was no longer in office  and	 for
that  reason, if the learned Judges of the High	 Court	were
right,	into  matters which were not of	 public	 importance.
The result would be that the acts of a Prime Minister  could
never be inquired into under the Act.  We find it  extremely
difficult to accept that

the  past  and which have affective  the  public  well-being
would be matters of public importance and it was  irrelevant
whether	 the  person who committed those acts  is  still  in
power  to be, able to repeat them.  The pronouncement is  an
authority  for the proposition that inquiry into the acts  a

8-B</a>  and <a href="/doc/606986/" id="a_713">8-C</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry Act,	 1952.	 The
section	 states	 that  if at any stage of  the	inquiry	 the
Commission  considers  it  necessary  to  inquire  into	 the
conduct	 of any person or is of opinion that the  reputation
of any person is likely to be prejudicially affected by	 the
inquiry	  the  Commission  shall  give	to  that  person   a
reasonable opportunity of being heard in the inquiry and  to
produce	 evidence in his defence.  Basing on the wording  of
the  section it was submitted that the inquiry	is  normally
only  into  a  definite	 matter	 of  public  importance	 and
inquiries  into	 the conduct of a person can arise  only  as
incidental or ancillary to such an inquiry.  As the  section
contemplates the necessity of inquiry into the conduct of  a
person	arising	 at any stage of  the  Inquiry	Commission's
proceedings,  it  was submitted that the  inquiry  into	 the
conduct of a person is only incidental.	 This Court rejected
the contention on the ground that <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_714">section 3</a> which permits  a
Commission  of	Inquiry to be appointed is  wide  enough  to
cover  an inquiry into the conduct of an individual  and  it
could  not  be natural reading of the Act to  cut  down	 the
scope of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_715">section 3</a> by an implication drawn from <a href="/doc/349271/" id="a_716">section	 10</a>.
This  observation was, as the subsequent sentence  makes  it
clear,	made in rejecting the plea that <a href="/doc/349271/" id="a_717">section 10</a> does	 not
apply  to  a  person whose conduct  comes  up  directly	 for
inquiry	 before	 a  Commission set up under  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_718">section  3</a>.  In
Bakshi's  case	as  the inquiry was  ordered  by  the  State
Government  into  the affairs of a Chief  Minister  who	 had
ceased	to  be in office, the Court was not called  upon  to
consider  the  question	 whether the  Union  Government	 can
appoint a commission of inquiry into the conduct of a  Chief
Minister   of	a  State  in  office   which   implies	 the
determination	of  Centre-State  relationship	 under	 the
Constitution. In this case the appointment was by the  State
Government against the erstwhile Chief Minister.  Apart from
this  question	it  is	seen  that  if	<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_719">section	 3</a>  of	 the
Commissions  of Inquiry Act, 1952 is construed	as  enabling
the appointment of a commission of inquiry into the  conduct
of  a  State  Chief Minister in office it  would  result  in
empowering the Central Government which is a delegate of the
Parliament  to	exercise the powers which would	 never	have
been contemplated by the Parliament, for as already  pointed
out  the result of such construction would be  inviting	 the
State Government to appoint a commission of inquiry
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_155">162</span>
to  the	 conduct of Central Ministers regarding	 matters  in
List II and List III.  It is significant to note that  after
Bakshi's  case	was decided by the Supreme  Court  in  1966,
amendments were introduced to the <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_720">Commissions of Inquiry Act</a>
by Act 79 of 1971.  <a href="/doc/1236777/" id="a_721">Section 8-B</a> ins as follows :-

</blockquote><p id="p_482">No  doubt, there was corresponding section, <a href="/doc/349271/" id="a_722">section  10</a>,  of
the  Jammu &amp; Kashmir Commission of Inquiry Act, 1962,  which
was  considered in Bakshi's case by the Supreme	 Court,	 and
the Court had held that <a href="/doc/1159761/" id="a_723">section 1</a> <a href="/doc/1788561/" id="a_724">0</a> was also applicable to a
case  in  which the conduct of a person was  directly  under
inquiry.  It observed that the scope of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_725">section 3</a> cannot  be
cut  down  by  an implication drawn  from  <a href="/doc/349271/" id="a_726">section  10</a>.	 The
subsequent  amendment of the Act by introduction of  <a href="/doc/1236777/" id="a_727">section
8-B</a> which provides that if at any stage of the inquiry,	 the
Commission  considers  it  necessary to	 inquire,  into	 the
conduct of any person, or is of opinion that the  reputation
of  any	 person is likely to be	 prejudicially	affected  by
enquiry would indicate that the Parliament was aware, of the
consequence  of	 such wording, and intended the	 Act  to  be
applicable  in	the main to any definite  matter  of  public
importance  while  an inquiry into the	affairs	 of  persons
would be permissible if it arose-as incidental or  ancillary
to   such   inquiry.   This  construction  appears   to	  be
justifiable,  for otherwise <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_728">section 3</a> would have the  result
of  empowering	the delegate i.e. the Union  Government,  to
order an inquiry into the affair of the Chief Minister of  a
State  and  inviting  the  same	 treatment  from  the  State
Government.
</p><p id="p_483">The  decision  in P. V. Jaganmohan Rao &amp; Ors.  v.  State  of
Orissa	&amp;  Ors.(1) also relates to the	appointment  by	 the
State Government of a Commission of Inquiry into the conduct
of  the	 Chief	Minister and Ministers who  ceased  to	hold
office	on the date of the notification in regard to the  in
regularities committed during the tenure of their office and
it does not relate to the Commission of Inquiry appointed by
the  Central  Government  to  inquire  into  the  abuse	  of
governmental  functions	 by  the Chief	Minister  and  other
Ministers.
</p><p id="p_484">It will be, seen on an examination of the cases cited  above
that  in  no  case the Central	Government  bad	 ordered  an
inquiry into the abuse of powers by the State Chief Minister
in office.  It is stated that an inquiry was ordered by	 the
Central Government against Pratap Singh
(1)[1968] 3. S.C.R. 789.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_156">163</span>
<p id="p_485">Kairon,	 a  State Chief Minister, while in  office  but	 the
validity  of  such  an ,order was not  questioned  before  a
court.	The Sarkaria Commission
was appointed by the Central Government to inquire into	 the
conduct	 of the Chief Minister when lie ceased to hold	that
office and the President took over the administration of the
Tamil  Nadu  State.   While in	office	the  Chief  Minister
questioned  the Union Government's power to appoint  such  a
Commission.
</p><p id="p_486">The  impugned  notification by the  Central  Government	 was
challenged  on	the ground that it is in  violation  of	 the
proviso	 to <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_729">section 3(1)</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry	Act.
Under  the proviso when a State Government has	appointed  a
commission  of	inquiry, the Central  Government  shall	 not
appoint	 another commission to inquire into the same  matter
for  so	 long  as  the commission  appointed  by  the  State
Government is functioning, unless the Central Government  is
of opinion that the scope of the inquiry should be  extended
to  two	 or more States.  In this case it is  common  ground
that  the  State Government had appointed  a  Commission  of
Inquiry	 earlier.  The scope of the inquiry ordered  by	 the
Central	 Government does not extend to two or ,more  States.
In  the	 circumstances	the notification  is  sought  to  be
supported  by  the Central Government on the plea  that	 the
inquiry ;does not relate to the "'same matter" and therefore
the  validity  of  the notification  cannot  be	 challenged.
Reading <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_730">section 3(1)</a> along the proviso, it is apparent	that
the  intention	of  the Act is to  en.able  the	 appropriate
Government  i.e.  the  Central or the  State  Government  to
appoint a Commission of Inquiry for the purpose of making an
inquiry into any definite matter of public importance.	 The
Central	 Government  can  appoint a commission	to  make  an
inquiry	 into  any matter relatable to any  of	the  Entries
enumerated  in	List I, List II or List III of	the  Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution while the State Government	 can
appoint a commission to inquire into any matter relatable to
any of the entries enumerated in List II and List III of the
Constitution.  As both the Central Government and the  State
Government  have  power to appoint a commission	 of  inquiry
relating  to  entries in List II and List  III	there  might
arise occasions when there may be overlapping.	In order  to
avoid  such  a contingency provisos (a) and (b)	 to  <a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_731">section
3(1)</a> enact that when the Central Government has appointed  a
commission  of	inquiry	 the  State  Government	 'shall	 not
appoint	 another commission to inquire into the same  matter
without	 the approval of the Central Government-,as long  as
the  commission	 appointed  by	the  Central  Government  is
functioning  and  the Central Government shall	not  appoint
another	 commission to inquire into the same matter as	long
as  the	 commission  appointed by the  State  Government  is
functioning.   These  provisions  are  for  the	 purpose  of
avoiding any conflict by the two Governments appointing	 two
separate  commissions to inquire into the same matter. in  a
speech made by the Minister for Law Shri C. C. Biswas  while
introducing  the Bill on August 6, 1952 in the Rajya  Sabha,
he explained the provisions of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_732">section 3</a> and its  underlying
purposes as follows :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_154">	      "Then  there is also the question whether	 and
	      bow far there may be overlapping inquiries  by
	      the  Centre appointing Commission on  its	 own
	      and a State also a commission of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_157">	      164</span>
	      its  own to deal with the 'same matter.	That
	      is dealt with here in the proviso.  The danger
	      of overlapping is avoided by providing that if
	      there is a Commission appointed-by the Central
	      Government  already functioning then  it	will
	      not be open to a State Government, except with
	      the approval of the
	      Centre,  to  appoint  another  commission	  to
	      inquire into the
	      same matter.  Similarly, if there is already a
	      Commission  appointed  by a  State  Government
	      functioning with respect to a matter which  is
	      within  the jurisdiction of the State it	will
	      not  be  open  to the  Central  Government  to
	      override	 the  State  Commission	 except	  in
	      certain  circumstances  which  are  indicated,
	      that  is, unless the Central Government is  of
	      the  opinion that the scope of inquiry  should
	      be  extended to two or more States.   Then  of
	      course this will be done, obviously not  with-
	      out  reference to the State.  So as  you	will
	      see, Sir, provision is made in this clause for
	      avoiding	conflict between the Centre and	 the
	      State."
</blockquote><p id="p_487">It  will  be  seen that the provisos were  enacted  for	 the
purpose	 of  avoiding  conflict between the  Union  and	 the
State.	 The  very  object of the proviso to  <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_733">section  3</a>  is
defeated  by the construction sought to, be put upon by	 the
Union  Government.   The objection to the appointment  of  a
commission  by the Union Government when there is already  a
commission appointed by the State functioning is 'sought  to
be  got over by the Union on the plea that by  the  impugned
notification  the. inquiry is not directed against the	same
matters	 for which the State: has appointed a commission  of
inquiry.   In the written statement filed on behalf  of	 the
Union of India it is contended that the matters. referred to
the  Grover  Commission of Inquiry appointed  by  the  Union
Government  are those which are not covered by the terms  of
reference of the Hussain Commission of Inquiry appointed  by
the  Government	 of  Karnataka and that Annexure  I  to	 the
notification  dated  May  23, 1977  lists  such	 allegations
contained in the Memorandum dated April 11, 1977 as are	 not
at  all	 included in the terms of reference of	the  Hussain
Commission  of	Inquiry and that  relating  to	allegations,
contained  in  Annexure II the said  allegations  stipulated
that the Grover Commission of Inquiry will inquire into	 the
said  allegations  excluding  any  matter  covered  by	 the
notification  of the Government of Karnataka dated  May	 18,
1977.  It was submitted that while the matter referred to by
the  State Government is regarding  various  irregularities,
the inquiry directed by the Central Government is for making
an  inquiry on charges of corruption, nepotism,	 favouritism
or  misuse of governmental power against the Chief  Minister
and certain other Ministers of the State of Karnataka.	 The
notification of the Karnataka: State Government appointing a
Commission of Inquiry runs as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_155">	      "Whereas	allegations  have been made  on	 the
	      floor  of the Houses of the State	 Legislature
	      and elsewhere that irregularities have ,	been
	      committed/excess	payments  made	in   certain
	      matters relating to contracts, grant of  land,
	      allotment	 of  sites, purchase  of  furniture,
	      disposal of food grains, etc.;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_158">	      165</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_156">	      Whereas the State Government is of the opinion
	      that  It is necessary to appoint a  Commission
	      of   Inquiry   to	 inquire   into	  the	said
	      allegations;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_157">	      NOW  THEREFORE,  in  exercise  of	 the  powers
	      conferred	 by sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_734">section 3</a>  of

	      Act</a>  60 of 1952) the Government  of  Karnataka
	      hereby appoint Justice Shri Mir Iqbal Hussain,
	      Retired  Judge of the Karnataka High Court  to
	      be the Commission of Inquiry............."
</blockquote><p id="p_488">The  plea  on  behalf of the State is that  the	 inquiry  is
directed against all the allegations that have been made  on
the  floor  of	the Houses of  the  State  ]Legislature	 and
elsewhere  and	the  charges therefore	comprehend  all	 the
matters	 that  are  found  in  the  impugned   notification.
Further	 it  was submitted that as the commission is  to  go
into and determine as to who are the persons responsible for
the  lapses  the inquiry would include charges	against	 the
Chief Minister also.  As the purpose of the two provisos  to
<a href="/doc/689065/" id="a_736">section	 3(1)</a>  is  to avoid conflict, the  words  "the	same
matter"	  in   the   provisos  should  be   given   a	wide
interpretation	and only matters that are not  referable  to
the  subject  matter  of  the  inquiry	by  the	  Commission
appointed  by  the State can be taken over  by	the  Central
Government.   We  were not called upon to go  into  the	 two
notifications  and determine which item in the	notification
of.  the  Central  Government is not covered  by  the  State
Government  notification.  In giving a wider meaning to	 the
words  'the same matter' with a view to avoid conflict,	 the
contention of the Central Government that the inquiry  into-
the  conduct of the Chief Minister about the  same  incident
will make it a different matter cannot be accepted.
The  contention as to the maintainability of the suit  under
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_737">Article	 131</a>  of  the Constitution may	now  be	 considered.
<a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_738">Article 131</a> is as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_158">	      "Subject	  to   the   provisions	  of	this

</blockquote><p id="p_489">The  point  is	whether the dispute  involves  any  question
whether of law or fact on which the existence or extent of a
legal  right of the State depends.  In other Words,  a	suit
would  be  maintainable if there is any	 infringement  of  a
legal  right of the State.  The submission on behalf of	 the
Union  Government is that what is affected is not the  legal
right  of  the	State  but  if at  all	that  of  the  State
Government or the Ministers concerned.	Ministers may have a
cause of action in which case the remedy will be by way of a
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_739">Article 226.</a>  If the State
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_159">166</span>
Government  feels aggrieved they can also take action  under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_740">Article	 226</a>  but  unless the legal right of  the  State  is
affected recourse to <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_741">Art. 131</a> cannot be had.  Relying on the
<a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_742">General	 Clauses Act</a> and the distinction that is  maintained
in  the	 Constitution  between	the  State  and	 the   State
Government  it	was submitted that the State  itself  is  an
ideal  person intangible, invisible, and immutable, and	 the
Government  is	its  agent.   In  order	 to  appreciate	 the
contentions  of the parties it is necessary to refer to	 the
relevant  articles  of the Constitution	 to  determined	 the
question as to whether any of the legal rights of the State
is affectedPart	 VI of the Constitution relates	 to  the
States and <a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_743">Art. 154</a> providesthat  the executive	 power	of
the State shall be vested in the Governorand  shall   be
exercised  by  him either directly or through  the  officers
subordinate  to	 him in accordance  with  the  Constitution.
<a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_744">Article	 162</a> provides that subject to the provisions of	 the
Constitution  the executive power of the State shall  extend
to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of	 the
State has power to make laws.  In other words the  executive
power  of  the State is co-extensive  with  the	 legislative
power  of the State.  The executive power of the State	will
be exercised by the Governor with the aid and advice of	 the
Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State.   According
to  the	 impugned  notification	 Commission  of	 Inquiry  is
appointed  for	the  purpose of making	an  inquiry  into  a
definite  matter  of public importance,	 namely	 charges  of
corruption, nepotism, favouritism or misuse of	governmental
power against the Chief Minister and certain other Ministers
of the State of Karnataka.  The inquiry therefore is amongst
other things regarding the misuse of the governmental  power
against the Chief Minister and other Ministers of the State.
The  executive function of the State which is vested in	 the
Governor is exercised by him with the aid and advice of	 the
Chief  Minister and the Council of Ministers.  The power  is
also exercised by the Governor either directly or indirectly
through	 officers subordinate to him in accordance with	 the
Constitution.	The governmental functions of the State	 are
performed  by the Governor as required by  the	Constitution
with the aid and advice of the Ministers The scope  of	 the
enquiry	 would	inevitably involve the	functioning  of	 the
executive of the State.	 The plea of the State Government is
that its  powers  are derived from the Constitution and	 its
existence  and	its exercise of powers as executive  of	 the
State  is  guaranteed by the Constitution,  and	 the  Centre
cannot interfere with 'such exercise of executive functions.
The  question involves the extent of the executive power  of
the  State  and	 any interference with	that  power  by	 the
Central	 Government  would  affect the legal  right  of	 the
State.	 The plea on behalf of the Union Government is	that
<a href="/doc/1995256/" id="a_745">Art.  154</a> contemplates the exercise by the Governor  of	 his
executive  power  through  officers subordinate	 to  him  in
accordance  with the Constitution.  The submission  is	that
when the powers are exercised through Ministers who. accord-
ing to the learned counsel for the respondent, are  officers
the rights of such Ministers or officers are only interfered
with and not the legal rights of the State.  Further it	 was
submitted  that State is different from the Government of  a
State and if any action of the State or the Ministers of the
State  is  questioned  the State as 'such  cannot  have	 any
grievance.  When the exercise of the executive functions  of
the  State  through its officers is interfered with  by	 the
Central Government it cannot be said that the legal right of
the State is not affected.

<p id="p_490">Strong	reliance,  was placed by the Union Government  on  a
recent	decision of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/174974/" id="a_746">State of  Rajasthan
and  Others v. Union of India</a>.(1) The States  of  Rajasthan,
Madhya	Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and  Orissa
filed  suits under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_747">Art. 131</a> of the Constitution against	 the
Union of India challenging a directive contained in a letter
dated  April 18, 1977 issued by the Union Home	Minister  to
the  Chief  Ministers  of the  States  as  unconstitutional,
illegal,  and  ultra  vires of the Constitution	 and  for  a
declaration    that   the   plaintiffs	 States	  are	 not
constitutionally  or legally obliged to comply with or	give
effect	to the directive contained in the said letter.	 The
power  of  the	Central Government  to	dissolve  the  State
Assemblies  was	 questioned.  A	 preliminary  objection	 was
raised to the maintainability of the suit on the ground that
no  legal  rights of the State were infringed and  that	 the
State  is different from the State Government and if at	 all
any  one was aggrieved it was the State Government  and	 not
the State.  Chief Justice Beg observed that even if there be
some  grounds  for making a distinction	 between  a  State's
interests  and	rights and those or it,, Government  or	 its
members,  the  Court need not take a too  restrictive  or  a
hyper-technical	 view of the State's rights to sue  for	 any
rights,	 actual,  or  fancied, which  the  State  Government
chooses	 to  take up on behalf of the State concerned  in  a
'suit  under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_748">Art. 131.</a>	Mr. Justice Chandrachud was  of	 the
view that when the States question the constitutional  right

Chief Ministers a legal, not a political, issue arising	 out
of the existence and extent of a legal right squarely arises
and  the suits cannot be thrown out as falling	outside	 the

Minister  asks the Chief Minister of the Government  of	 the
States	to advice the Governors to dissolve the	 Legislative
Assemblies  and	 the Chief Ministers decline to	 accept	 the
advice it is not a dispute between the State on the one hand
and the
(1)[1978] 1 S.C.R. 1.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_161">168</span>
<p id="p_492">Government  of	India on the other.  It is  a  real  dispute
between	 the Government of the State and the  Government  of
India.	It is no doubt a question of life and death for	 the
State  Government but not so far the State as legal  entity,
as even after the dissolution of the Assembly the State will
continue to have a government for the time being as provided
for in the Constitution.  Fazal Ali, J. was of the view that
the mere fact that letters were sent to the State Government
containing gratuitous advice would not create any dispute if
one did not exist before nor would such a course of  conduct
clothe the State Government with a legal right to call for a
determination under <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_753">Art. 131</a> as the State did not possess  a
legal  right.  The State Government who have raised  dispute
are not covered by the word 'State appearing in <a href="/doc/786824/" id="a_754">Art. 131</a> and
therefore  the	suits were not maintainable on	that  ground
also.  It will be seen that four of the seven Judges were of
the view that the suits are maintainable though Bhagwati and
Gupta  JJ.  were  of the view that  there  is  a  difference
between	 the State and the State Government.   Whatever	 the
question that might have risen regarding the dissolution  of
the  Assemblies, in the present case the dispute relates  to
the  functioning  of  the State in exercise  of	 the  powers
conferred  under  the  Constitution and	 the  State's  legal
rights	are affected.  The preliminary	objection  therefore
fails.
</p><p id="p_493">To sum up taking into account the history of the development
of  the	 Indian	 Constitution and its  scheme  the  impugned
notification impinges on the right of the State to  function
in  its limited sphere.	 Further, the impugned	notification
is beyond the powers conferred on the Union Government under
<a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_755">Section 3</a> of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.  In	this
view  the question whether <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_756">section 3</a> of the  Commissions  of
Inquiry Act, 1952 is ultra vires of the power of  Parliament
or not does not arise.
</p><p id="p_494">it  is	necessary  that	 Commission  of	 Inquiry  should  be
appointed  in order to maintain and safeguard the purity  of
the Union and the State administration.	 But such Commission
of  Inquiry  should  be strictly  in  accordance  with	the,
Constitution  and  should  not	affect	the  Centre-'  State
relationship.	The proposal now pending  before  Parliament
for  appointment of Lok Pal to conduct such inquiries  is  a
move  in the right direction, if  sufficient  constitutional
safeguards are provided for the institution of Lok Pal.
In view of the Judgment the first issue whether the suit  is
maintainable  is answered 'in the affirmative.	Under  Issue
No. 2 the impugned notification is ultra vires of the powers
of  the Central Government conferred on it by <a href="/doc/159760/" id="a_757">Section  3</a>  of
the  Commissions of Inquiry Act.  In this view Issue  No.  3
does not arise for consideration The suit has to be  decreed
as prayed for.

In  accordance	with the view of the majority, the  Suit  is
dismissed with costs.
