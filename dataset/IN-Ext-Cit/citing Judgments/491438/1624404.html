<p id="p_3">2)    Brief facts:
</p>

<p id="p_4">(a)  The appellant-accused was working as a Head Clerk in the 



Traffic   Cadre   Section   in   the   Office   of   the   Senior   Divisional  



Personnel   Officer,   South   Central   Railway,   Vijayawada   during 



the period from April, 1992 to November, 1997.  The nature of 



duties   of   the   appellant-accused   included   dealing   with   and 



processing of the matters like promotions, transfers, seniority 



list,   roster   list,   pay   fixation   on   promotions,   retirements, 



resignations etc. of the personnel.   
</p>


<p id="p_5">b)   One K. Rama Rao-the Complainant, who was examined as 



PW-1, was posted as Yard Points Man, Grade `A' under Station 



Superintendent,   South   Central   Railway,   Tanuku   from 



December, 1995 to June, 1997.  In June, 1997, due to excess 



staff at Tanuku, he was instructed to report at Head Quarters, 



Vijayawada   and   accordingly,   when   he   reported   there,   he   was 



asked   to   go   back   to   Tanuku.     Thereafter,   he   went   back   to 



Tanuku   from   where   he   was   subsequently   transferred   to 



Rajahmundry.   Thereafter, PW-1 made a representation to his 



senior   officer   requesting   him   for   posting   at   Vijayawada, 





<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                                                            2</span>


Cheerala, Vetapalam or Tenali.  Later, PW-1 was transferred to 



Vijayawada.
</p>


<p id="p_6">(c)     As   the   appellant-accused   was   dealing   with   the   transfers, 



the complainant (PW-1) met him on 05.11.1997 at his office to 



pursue   about   the   issuance   of   the   said   transfer   order.     The 



appellant-accused   asked  him   to   come   on   10.11.1997.     When 



he met him on  10.11.1997, the  appellant asked him  to come  



on   the   next   day   as   he   was   busy   in   pay-fixation   work.     On 



11.11.1997, again he went to the office of the appellant but he  



could   not   find   him   on   his   seat.     Again   a   day   after   i.e.   on  



13.11.1997, when he met the appellant-accused, he informed 



him that his request for transfer has been processed and the 



order is ready and the same has been placed before the A.P.O. 
</p>


<p id="p_7">for signature and asked him to come on the next day, i.e., on  



14.11.1997,   and   demanded   Rs.200/-   for   releasing   the   said 



office order.
</p>


<p id="p_8">(d) On the same day, (PW-1) reported the matter in writing to  



the   Inspector   of   Police,   Central   Bureau   of   Investigation   (in 



short  `the  CBI), Vijayawada.    On  14.11.1997, a trap was  laid 



by the CBI officials along with panchas and when the accused

demanded   and   accepted   a   sum   of   Rs.200/-   as   illegal 



gratification, he was caught red handed along with the money 



which   was   recovered   from   the   right   hand   side   pocket   of   his 



pant.  
</p>


<p id="p_9">(e)    On   15.11.1997,   at   7.30   a.m.,   an   FIR   was   registered   by 



the   Inspector,   CBI,   Visakhapatnam   Branch   in   Crime   No.   RC 



20(A)/97-VSP.          After   recording   the   statements   of   the 



witnesses,   Inspector   of   Police,   CBI,   Visakhapatnam   filed 



charge   sheet   being   No.   2/98-YTR   dated   29.04.1998   against 



the   appellant-accused   for   an   offence   punishable   under

<p id="p_10">(f)    The   Special   Judge,   CBI,   by   order   dated   19.03.2001, 



convicted   the   appellant   and   sentenced   him   to   undergo 



rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months  and to pay a  



fine of Rs.500/- and, in default, to suffer simple imprisonment 



for   one   month   for   the   offence   punishable   under   <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_2">Section   7</a>   of

<p id="p_12">(g)    Against   the   said   order,   the   appellant-accused   filed 



Criminal   Appeal   No.   436   of   2001   before   the   High   Court   of 



Andhra   Pradesh.     The   High   Court,   by   impugned   judgment 



dated 03.10.2007 dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant-

<p id="p_13">accused   and   confirmed   the   conviction   passed   by   the   trial 



Court.       Hence,   the   appellant-accused   has   preferred   this

<p id="p_16">4)     On   28.01.2008,   this   Court   consisting   of   three   Hon'ble  



Judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum 



of sentence only.  In pursuance of the same, we permitted Mr.  



Rangaramanujam, learned senior counsel for the appellant to 



address   his   arguments   confining   to   quantum   of   sentence 



imposed on the appellant-accused.  As stated in the narration 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                                                          5</span>


of facts, the appellant was convicted under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_5">Section 7</a> of the Act 



for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment 



for   six   months   and   to   pay   a   fine   of   Rs.   500/-,   in   default,  



simple   imprisonment   for   one   month.     He   was   also   convicted 



for   the   offence   under   <a href="/doc/1226868/" id="a_6">Section   13(1)(d)(ii)</a>   read   with   <a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_7">Section 



13(2)</a>   of   the   Act   and   sentenced   to   undergo   rigorous 



imprisonment   for   one   year   and   fine   of   Rs.500/-,   in   default, 



simple imprisonment for one month.   The trial Court ordered 



that   both   the   sentences   of   imprisonment   shall   run 



concurrently.   The said conviction and sentence was affirmed 



by   the   High   Court.     If   we   confine   ourselves   to   the   limited 



extent of notice dated 28.01.2008, we have to hear both sides 



only   on   the   quantum   of   sentence.                     However,   Mr. 



Rangaramanujam, learned senior counsel for the appellant by 



drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this Court in  


<a href="/doc/803279/" id="a_8">Yomeshbhai   Pranshankar   Bhatt  vs.  State   of   Gujarat</a>, 


(2011)   6   SCC   312,   submitted   that   in   spite   of   limited   notice,  



this   Court,   while   exercising   jurisdiction   under   <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_9">Article   142</a>   of 



the Constitution, in order to do complete justice while hearing

by the  trial  Court and  the  High  Court.   In the  reported case, 



the   appeal   was   against   the   concurrent   finding   of   both   the 



courts   convicting   the   appellant   under   <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10">Section   302</a>   IPC   and 



sentencing   him   to   suffer   imprisonment   for   life.     At   the   SLP 



stage,   this   Court,   by   order   dated   27.07.2009,   issued   notice 



confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was 



guilty   of   commission   of   an   offence   under   any   of   the   parts   of  



<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_11">Section   304</a>  Indian   Penal   Code, 1860  (in   short  `<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a>')  and   not 



under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_13">Section 302</a> IPC.   Similar request was made before the  



Bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions 



including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted 



in   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   the   case.     This   Court,  



referred   to   the   Supreme   Court   Rules,   1966   which   have   been 



framed   under   <a href="/doc/1537130/" id="a_14">Article   145</a>   of   the   Constitution   and   also 



considered   scope   of   its   power   under   <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_15">Article   142</a>   as   well   as 



Order 47 Rule 6<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_16"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908 (in short 



`the   Code).     While   deciding   the   said   question,   the   Bench   has 



also   considered   the   scope   of   <a href="/doc/714464/" id="a_17">Section   100</a>   of   the   Code   for 



entertaining   the   second   appeal.     It   further   shows   that   the 



Court considered the plea of the appellant therein for acquittal  




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                                7</span>


despite   the   fact   that   the   notice   was   limited   in   terms   of   the 



order   dated   27.07.2009.     It   is   relevant   to   point   out   that   the  



Bench in para 15, clarified the position and reopened the case 



in   its   entirety   even   though   notice   was   issued   confining   to   a 



particular   aspect.     After   permitting   the   appellant   therein   to 



argue the case for acquittal on merits, it observed:
</p>


<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "15. ... .... We, however, make it clear that  this cannot be a 

      universal   practice   in   all   cases.     The   question   whether   the 

      Court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final  

      hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. 

      Since   in   the   facts   of   this   case,   we   find   that   the   appellant  

      should be heard on all points, we have come to the aforesaid

It is clear that the Bench itself has clarified that they are not  



laying down the law that in spite of issuing notice confining to 



a   particular   aspect   (in   the   case   on   hand   -   "quantum   of 



sentence")   the   parties   are   entitled   to   urge   all   points   and   re-

makes   it   clear   that   in   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   that 



case,   they   permitted   the   appellants   to   urge   all   points   on 



merits.

<p id="p_18">5)     In the case on hand, it is to be noted that on appreciation 



of   oral   and   documentary   evidence   led   in   by   the   prosecution 



and   the   defence   and   on   appreciation   of   entire   materials,   the 



court   of   first   instance   i.e.   the   trial   Court   convicted   the 



appellant   and   sentenced  him  as   mentioned  above.     The   High 



Court,   as   an   appellate   Court,   once   again   analysed   all   the 



material,   discussed   the   oral   and   documentary   evidence   and 



finding   that   the   prosecution   had   proved   the   guilt   of   the 



accused   beyond   reasonable   doubt   concurred   with   the 



conclusion   arrived   at   by   the   trial   Court   and   dismissed   the 



appeal   of   the   appellant.     Inasmuch   as   both   the   courts   have  



thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with 



reference   to   the   charges   leveled   against   the   appellant   and   in 



view   of   the   limited   order   dated   28.01.2008   by   this   Court  



issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even 



applying   the   analogy   enunciated   in  Yomeshbhai   (supra),  we 



feel   that   it   is   not   a   case   of   such   nature   that   the   appellant 



should   be   heard   on   all   points,   consequently,   we   reject   the 



request   of   the   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the

<p id="p_20">6)    Mr.   Rangaramanujam,   learned   senior   counsel   for   the 



appellant   submitted   that   inasmuch   as   the   alleged   incident 



took   place   on   14.11.1997   and   14   years   have   elapsed   since 



then, the  amount  of  Rs. 200/- said to  have   been  received  by 



the appellant is trivial in nature and also of the fact that due 



to   the   said   conviction   and   sentence   he   lost   his   job,   leniency 



may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already  



undergone.     He   fairly   admitted   that   out   of   the   maximum 



period   of   one   year,   the   appellant   had   served   only   52   days   in 



prison.  With this factual position, let us consider whether the 



request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be 



accepted   and   sentence   be   reduced   to   the   period   already 



undergone.

</p>

<p id="p_23">10)    In order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the 



above,   learned   senior   counsel   for   the   appellant   has   relied   on 



the   decision   of   this   Court   in  <a href="/doc/54626/" id="a_30">Bechaarbhai   S.   Prajapati  vs. 


State of Gujarat</a>, (2008) 11 SCC 163 and based on the same 


requested   this   Court   to   modify   the   sentence   to   the   extent   of  



period already undergone.  We have gone through the facts in 



that   case.     It   is   true   that   even   in   the   cited   decision,   the 



appellant   accused   demanded   only   Rs.   250/-   and   it   was   paid 



and   accepted.   Finally,   the   Special   Judge   framed   charges   for 



offence   punishable   under   <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_31">Sections   7</a>,   <a href="/doc/642316/" id="a_32">12</a>,   <a href="/doc/1101716/" id="a_33">13(1)(d)</a>   read   with 



<a href="/doc/1259316/" id="a_34">Section 13(2)</a> of the Act.   The appellant therein was convicted 



for offence under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_35">Section 7(2)</a> of the Act and appeal before the 



High   Court   was   also   dismissed.     Thereafter,   the   same   was 



challenged   before   this   Court.     This   Court,   after   holding   that  



the   conclusion   of   the   trial   Court   and   High   Court   does   not 



suffer   from   any   infirmity   considered   the   alternative 



submission   which   related   to   harshness   of   sentence.     In   that 



case,   taking   note   of   the   fact   that   the   occurrence   took   place 



nearly seven years back and also of the fact that the appellant

had suffered custody for more than six months, considering all 



these   aspects,   while   maintaining   the   conviction,   this   Court 



reduced the sentence to the period already undergone.   Since 



the appellant therein was convicted only under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_36">Section 7</a> and 



<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_37">Section  161</a> Cr.PC., the  minimum sentence being six months 



and of the fact that he had suffered custody for more than six  



months, the course adopted by this Court is perfectly in order 



and the same cannot be applied to the case on hand, wherein 



the appellant had undergone only 52 days when the minimum 



sentence was six months under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_38">Section 7</a> and one year under 



<a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_39">Section 13</a>.

<p id="p_24">11)    Learned   senior   counsel   for   the   appellant   further

is   no   need  to   retain   the   same   sentence   and   the   Court   is   not

the   conviction   on   both   counts   have   been   confirmed   by   this

of the minimum sentence prescribed under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_40">Sections 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_41">13</a> 



of the Act, we are of the view that though long delay may be a 



ground for reduction of sentence in other cases, the same may 



not   be   applicable   to   the   case   on   hand   when   the   statute  



prescribes minimum sentence.  Accordingly, we reject the said 



contention.

<p id="p_25">12)    It was further contended that the amount alleged to have 



been  received  by  the   appellant   accused  is   only   Rs.200/-   and 



he also lost his job after conviction by the trial court.  Though, 



these   grounds   may   be   attractive   in   respect   of   other   offences  



where   minimum   sentence   is   not   prescribed,   in   view   of   our  



reasonings in the earlier paras, the same cannot be applied to  



the case on hand.

       everywhere.   No   facet   of   public   activity   has   been   left

       pervasive   impact   on   the   functioning   of   the   entire   country. 

       Large-scale   corruption   retards   the   nation-building   activities

accept   any   of   the   contentions   raised   by   the   learned   senior 



counsel for the appellant, on the other hand, we are in entire 



agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the trial Judge as 



affirmed   by   the   High   Court.     Consequently,   the   appeal   fails 



and the same is dismissed.  Since the appellant is on bail, the  



bail bonds executed by him stand cancelled.   The trial Judge 



is   directed   to   secure   his   presence   for   serving   the   remaining 



period of sentence.
