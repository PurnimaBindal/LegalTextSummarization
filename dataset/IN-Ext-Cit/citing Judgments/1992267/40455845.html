<p id="p_1">1.          The instant appeal under clause X of the Letters Patent

is directed against judgment dated 28.4.2004 rendered by learned

Single Judge holding that the acquisition in respect of the plot of

the writ petitioner-respondent was bad in the eyes of law for two

reasons. The first reason which emerges from the perusal of the

order is that the provisions of emergency/urgency under <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_1">Section 17</a>

of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for brevity, 'the Act') had been

invoked without any justifiable reason.     According to the learned

Single Judge, the notification invoking the emergency/urgency

provisions for acquiring the land in question was issued on

22.11.1972 and for 12 long years       possession was not taken i.e.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> L.P.A. No. 434 of 2004 (O&amp;M)                                       2</span>



when the writ petitioner-respondent filed the writ petition relatable

to the instant appeal. According to the learned Single Judge, once

emergency provisions had been invoked, then it is natural that the

land would be utilized for a public purpose without any delay

whereas in the instant case, the land has not been utilized for a

long time taking into consideration the time which elapsed for

deciding the controversy. The learned Single Judge further noticed

that from the date of issuance of Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_2">Section 4</a> of the

Act three decades have passed and the writ -petitioner-respondent

continued to be in possession of the acquired land. In fact she has

built two big rooms, a kitchen and a boundary wall which is a

residential house. The second reason given by the learned Single

Judge for allowing the writ petition and quashing the acquisition is

the discrimination perpetrated by the appellant on her.      In that

regard the learned Single Judge has noticed that the plot measuring

1000 square yards owned by one Parmod Kumari was released

from acquisition by exercising powers under <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_3">Section 48</a> of the Act.

That plot falls in the same khasra number in which the plot of the

writ petitioner-respondent measuring 450 square yards falls. There

was hardly any justification given for discriminating between the

case of the writ petitioner-respondent and that of Parmod Kumari.

It was on the aforesaid basis that the order dated 1.8.1984

rejecting the prayer of the writ petitioner-respondent for releasing

her plot measuring 450 square yards      from acquisition had been

quashed and     direction has been issued to pass an order de-

notifying the land measuring 450 square yards belonging to her in

accordance with law.

</p><p id="p_3">2.         We have heard learned State counsel for the appellants

and have perused the paper book with his able assistance.         It is

pertinent to notice that on 28.10.2005, a Division Bench of this

Court had ordered for maintenance of status quo with regard to the

nature, title and possession of the property in question. We are of

the considered view that the writ petition has been rightly accepted

by the learned Single Judge although for different and additional

reasons.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.         The principles on which the urgency provision could be

invoked have been laid down in various judgments of Hon'ble the

Supreme Court.     In a recent judgment rendered in <a href="/doc/1481537/" id="a_4">Union of India

and others v. Mukesh Hans</a>, (2004) 8 SCC 14, it has been laid down

that invoking <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_5">Section 17(4)</a> of the Act would not automatically

result into dispensing with a right of hearing granted by <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_6">Section 5A</a>

of the Act where an individual owner can file objections in support

of the claim that his/her land cannot be acquired.       Invoking the

emergency /urgency provisions is one thing and dispensing with an

enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_7">Section 5A</a> of the Act is quite another. Therefore, the

requirement of law as laid down by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in

the case of Mukesh Hans (supra) is that it is not merely by directing

that the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_8">Section 5A</a> of the Act would not apply, which

would automatically result into dispensation of an enquiry under

that provision.   Such type of cases would be where on account of

river action the bridges are to be built and there is hardly any time

with the State to grant an opportunity of hearing or holding enquiry

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_9">Section 5A</a> of the Act.

emergency provisions of <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_10">Section 17(1)</a> and (2) dispensing with

enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_11">Section 5A</a> of the Act have been comprehensively

their Lordships' have summed up these principles. Those principles

in so far applicable to the facts of present case are as under:-

           acquisition of private property by the State fall in the

           domain,        the   Government   can   acquire   the   private

           property for public purpose, it must be remembered that

           compulsory taking of one's property is a serious matter.

           If the property belongs to economically disadvantaged

           segment of the society or people suffering from other

           handicaps, then the Court is not only entitled but is duty

           bound to scrutinize the action/decision of the State with

           greater vigilance, care and circumspection keeping in

           view the fact that the land owner is likely to become

           landless and deprived of the only source of his livelihood

           and/or shelter.

          the Act. A public purpose, however, laudable it may be

          does not entitle the State to invoke the urgency

          provisions because the same have the effect of depriving

          the owner of his right to property without being heard.

          Only in a case of real urgency, the State can invoke the

          urgency provisions and dispense with the requirement of

          hearing the land owner or other interested persons.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">               (vi)   The satisfaction of the Government on the

          and the same can be challenged on the ground that the

          purpose for which the private property is sought to be

          exercise of power is vitiated due to mala fides or that the

          concerned authorities did not apply mind to the relevant

          factors and the records.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">               (vii) The exercise of power by the Government

          under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_25">Section 17(1)</a> does not necessarily result in

          exclusion of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_26">Section 5-A</a> of the Act in terms of which any

          person interested in land can file objection and is

          entitled to be heard in support of his objection. The use

          of word "may" in sub- section (4) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_27">Section 17</a> makes it

          clear that it merely enables the Government to direct

          that the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_28">Section 5-A</a> would not apply to the

          cases covered under Sub-section (1) or (2) of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_29">Section 17</a>.

          In other words, invoking of <a href="/doc/68773460/" id="a_30">Section 17(4)</a> is not a

          necessary concomitant of the exercise of power under

          treated as an acquisition for public purposes within the

          meaning of <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_32">Section 4</a> but that, by itself, does not justify

          17(1)</a> and/or 17(4). The Court can take judicial notice of

          the fact that planning, execution and implementation of

          the schemes relating to development of residential,

          commercial, industrial or institutional areas usually take

          few years. Therefore, the private property cannot be

          acquired for such purpose by invoking the urgency

          provision contained in <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_34">Section 17(1)</a>. In any case,

          exclusion of the rule of audi alteram partem embodied in

          <a href="/doc/1229923/" id="a_35">Section 5-A(1)</a> and (2) is not at all warranted in such

          matters."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">5.        The present case is a classical example of invoking the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1797812/" id="a_36">Section 17</a> of the Act without any application of mind

exercising the power of emergency/urgency. There is nothing on

the record to show that there was any factor for reaching to a

conclusion that there was such an emergency that 30 days' period

for making enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_37">Section 5A</a> of the Act could not have been

granted whereas there is delay of more than 12 years on the date

of filing of the writ petition and even in taking possession.

Therefore, the invocation of emergency/urgency itself suffers from

colourable exercise of power and is unsustainable in the eyes of

law.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.        Apart from the aforesaid, we agree with the learned

Single Judge that lapse of 12 years itself be a circumstance to show

that there was a colourable exercise of power.        Even on the

question of discrimination reference may be made            to the

observations made by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/834893/" id="a_38">Hari Ram and

another v. State of
                 of Haryana and others,
                                others</a>, (2010) 3 SCC 621.

case the plot owners of the adjoining area were granted the benefit

of <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_39">Section 48</a> of the Act by releasing their land whereas those

approached the Court were denied the benefit.     In para 40, their

Lordships of Hon'ble the Supreme Court has held that       an order

which may not be consistent with law, would not confer any right

upon any person for grant of similar treatment.    However, it has

been observed that the land owners whose land has been acquired

for public purpose by following the prescribed procedure cannot

claim as a matter of right for release of his/her land from acquisition

and where the State Government has exercised its power under

<a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_40">Section 48</a> of the Act for withdrawal from acquisition in respect of a

particular land, the land owners who are similarly situated have a

right of similar treatment by the State Government.              Equality of

citizens' rights is one of the fundamental pillars on which the edifice

of the rule of law rests. All actions of the State have to be fair and

for legitimate reasons.   The view of their Lordships is discernible

from para 41, which reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           "The    Government     has     obligation    of      acting    with

           substantial fairness and consistency in considering the

           representations of the landowners for withdrawal from

           acquisition whose lands have been acquired under the

           same acquisition proceedings.       The State Government

           cannot pick and chose some landowners and release

           their land from acquisition and deny the same benefit to

           other   landowners    by     creating   artificial    distinction.

           Passing different orders in exercise of its power under

           <a href="/doc/460525/" id="a_41">Section 48</a> of the Act in respect of persons similarly

           situated relating to the same acquisition proceedings

           and for the same public purpose is definitely violative of

           <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_42">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and must be held               to be

           discriminatory."

of the present case. Therefore, we are of the view that the order

notify the land does not suffer from any legal infirmity, which may

warrant interference of this Court.   On equity also we are of the

view that the land which was purchased on 19.3.1974 and of which

possession had not been taken till the year 1985 could not now be

permitted to be utilized by the State Government for the so called

public purpose.    Accordingly the appeal fails and the same is
