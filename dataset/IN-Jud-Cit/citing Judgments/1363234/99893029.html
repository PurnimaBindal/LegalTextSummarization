                        IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

                        CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

                        CIVIL APPEAL NO.8499  OF 2012
                  (Arising out of SLP(Civil) No.31979/2010)


ALOK KUMAR PANDIT                                 ...Appellant

                                   VERSUS

STATE OF ASSAM &amp; ORS.                            ...Respondent(s)

                               O R D E R
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      1.         Leave granted.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2.         The questions which arise for consideration in this  appeal
      filed against the order of the Division Bench  of  the  Guwahati  High
      Court dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant for quashing
      the selection made by the Assam Public Service Commission (for  short,
      ‘he Commission’) are whether a candidate of reserved category, who  is
      adjudged more meritorious than open/general  category  candidates,  is
      entitled  to  be  appointed   in   the   service/cadre/post   of   his
      choice/preference against the post earmarked for the reserved category
      to which he belongs and whether while computing  the  quota/percentage
      of reservation, such candidate should be treated to have been allotted
      a post in the open category.
</p>
<p id="p_3">      3.         On a requisition received from the  State  Government,  the
      Commission issued advertisement  No.6/2006  dated  10.8.2006  for  116
      posts of Assam Civil Service  Class-I  (Junior  Grade),  Assam  Police
      Service  (Junior  Grade),  Labour  Officer,  Assistant  Registrar   of
      Cooperative Societies, Inspector of Labour,  Inspector  of  Taxes  and
      Inspector of Excise.  These included  11  backlog  posts  of  reserved
      categories of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled  Tribes  (P)  and  Scheduled
      Tribes (H).  The appellant, who belongs to OBC applied for recruitment
      against the advertised posts. After clearing the preliminary and final
      examination, the appellant was  called  for  interview.  The  list  of
      selected candidates was published by the Commission on 15.6.2009.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4.     As the appellant’s name did not figure in the  merit  list,  he
      submitted an application under the Right to <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_1">Information Act</a>, 2005  for
      supply of the details of marks awarded to him in  various  papers  and
      interview. Vide reply dated 16.7.2009,  the  Commission  informed  the
      appellant that he had secured 840 marks (669 in the  main  examination
      and 141 in the interview). The  appellant  then  filed  Writ  Petition
      No.3590/2009 for quashing the entire selection  and  for  issue  of  a
      mandamus to the Commission to prepare fresh select list in  accordance
      with the recruitment rules and the reservation policy  framed  by  the
      State Government. Some other unsuccessful candidates also  filed  writ
      petitions questioning  the  selection  made  by  the  Commission.  The
      Division Bench of the High Court disposed  of  all  the  petitions  by
      common order dated 1.9.2009 and directed  the  Commission  to  prepare
      fresh select list.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      5.         In compliance of the direction given by the High Court, the
      Commission prepared fresh select list which was notified on 18.2.2010.
       The appellant’s name did not find place even in the fresh  list.  He,
      therefore, filed Writ Petition No.1040/2010 and prayed for issue of  a
      mandamus to  the  Commission  to  again  revise  the  select  list  by
      contending that more meritorious candidates of the  reserved  category
      of OBC who should have been adjusted against the open  category  posts
      were illegally appointed against the posts earmarked for the  OBC.  He
      pleaded that the Commission committed serious error by  allotting  the
      posts in Assam Civil Service to OBC candidates who,  keeping  in  view
      their overall merit, should  have  been  appointed  against  the  open
      category posts and, in any case, for the purpose of computing quota of
      reservation for OBC, such appointments should  be  treated  as  having
      been made against open category posts.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      6.         The Division Bench of the High Court considered the case of
      one Manjit Barkakoti, who had secured 952  marks  and  was  placed  at
      Sl.No.25 in the overall merit, but could not be appointed to the Assam
      Civil Service against the open category post because  his  marks  were
      less than other open category candidates and held that  no  illegality
      was committed by appointing him  to  that  service  against  the  post
      earmarked for the reserved category. The Division Bench  further  held
      that appointment of the candidates of the reserved category, who  were
      adjudged more meritorious than some of the  open  category  candidates
      against the posts earmarked for the particular reserved  category  did
      not result in usurpation of the quota  earmarked  for  that  category.
      All this is evinced from the following portions of the impugned order:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           “5. The  contention  advanced  by  the  petitioner  that  Manjit
           Barkakoti being at Sl. No.25 of the over all merit  list  should
           be treated  was  a  general  category  candidate  has  dangerous
           portents with the law cannot countenance. If Manjit Barkakoti is
           to be treated as a general category candidate, he will not  make
           it to the Assam  Civil  Service  even  with  lesser  marks  will
           qualify as an OBC candidate for the Assam Civil Service  to  the
           exclusion  of   a  more  meritorious  OBC  candidates.  Such   a
           situation cannot be allowed to prevail.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">           6. The perception of the petitioner is capable of being analysed
           from  another  standpoint.  According  to  the  petitioner,   by
           treating  such  meritorious  candidates  as  reserved   category
           candidates, the actions of the Public  Service  Commission  have
           reduced the posts available for  reserved  category  candidates.
           The aforesaid perception of the petitioner  is  not  correct  on
           facts. Along with a  general  merit  list,  the  Public  Service
           Commission has prepared separate select list  for  each  of  the
           service for which advertisement was issued. The number of  posts
           available in each service and the distribution  thereof  amongst
           the  general  candidates  and  each  of  the  reserved  category
           candidate is mentioned in the select list published. 29 posts in
           all for all the different services in question were available. A
           reading of the select list for each service as prepared  by  the
           Commission clearly indicates that 29 OBC  candidates  have  been
           appointed. If that be so, the concept of usurping the quota  for
           OBC candidates, as sought to be so, the concept of usurping  the
           quota for OBC candidates, as sought to be urged,  will  have  no
           basis. Above all, it is not the case of the petitioner that  any
           OBC candidate securing less  than  840  marks  (secured  by  the
           petitioner) has been appointed in any service.”


</blockquote><p id="p_7">      7.          Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  referred   to   the
      provisions  of  the  Assam  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled   Tribes
      (Reservation of Vacancies in Services  and  Posts)  Act,  1978,  Assam
      Public Service Combined Competitive Examination Rules, 1989 and office
      memo No.ARP-338/83/14 dated Dispur, the 4th January,  1984  issued  by
      the State Government and argued that the reserved category candidates,
      who were more meritorious than  open  category  candidates,  but  were
      appointed against the reserved category posts should be deemed to have
      been appointed against the posts earmarked for the open  category  and
      they cannot be treated as appointed against the  posts  earmarked  for
      the  reserved  category,  which  is   constitutionally   and   legally
      impermissible. He submitted that  if  migration  is  allowed  to  more
      meritorious candidates of the reserved category,  who,  as  per  their
      overall merit should be appointed against the general  category  posts
      then the quota earmarked for reserved category  will  be  reduced  and
      that would be clearly contrary to the provisions of the  rules  framed
      under proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_2">Article 309</a>  of  the  Constitution,  the  reservation
      policy framed by the State Government and Articles 14 and  16  of  the
      Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8.         Learned counsel  for  the  State  of  Assam  supported  the
      impugned order and argued that the view taken by the High Court on the
      entitlement of more meritorious candidates of reserved category to opt
      for the reserved category posts is in consonance  with  the  law  laid
      down by this Court and the appellant who is less meritorious  reserved
      category candidate cannot claim  appointment  to  the  State  services
      because that would  amount  to  violation  of  the  rights  of    more
      meritorious candidates of his own category.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      9.         We have considered the argument/submission of  the  learned
      counsel for the parties. In our view,  the  questions  framed  in  the
      opening paragraph of this order are no longer res integra and must  be
      answered in affirmative in view of the  judgments  of  this  Court  in
      <a href="/doc/717778/" id="a_3">State of Bihar v. M. Neethi Chandra</a> (1996) 6 SCC 36, <a href="/doc/1962361/" id="a_4">Anurag  Patel  v.
      U.P. Public Service Commission</a> (2005)9 SCC 742 and <a href="/doc/1368252/" id="a_5">Union of  India  v.
      Ramesh Ram</a> (2010) 7 SCC 234.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      10.         However,  before  adverting  to  aforesaid  judgments   we
      consider it proper to notice two other judgments in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_6">Indra  Sawhney  v.
      Union of India</a> 1992 Supp. (3) SCC 217 and <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_7">R.K.Sabharwal  v.  State  of
      Punjab</a> (1995) 2 SCC 745. In the first of these cases, the nine  Judges
      Bench considered the constitutional validity of O.M.s dated  13.8.1990
      and 25.9.1991 issued by the  Government  of  India  on  the  issue  of
      reservation of socially and educationally backward classes. B.P.Jeevan
      Reddy, J., wrote the majority opinion on his own behalf and on  behalf
      of Chief Justice M.H. Kania and M.N. Venkatachaliah and  A.M.  Ahmadi,
      JJ. S. Ratnavel Pandian, T.K.Thommen,  Kuldip  Singh,  P.B.Sawant  and
      R.M.Sahai, JJ., wrote separate opinions. In his detailed judgment B.P.
      Jeevan Reddy, J. answered several questions. In paragraph 811  of  the
      judgment he made the following observations:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           “811. In this  connection  it  is  well  to  remember  that  the
           reservations under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_8">Article 16(4)</a> do not operate like a  communal
           reservation. It may well happen that some members belonging  to,
           say, Scheduled Castes get selected in the open competition field
           on the basis of their  own  merit;  they  will  not  be  counted
           against the quota reserved for Scheduled Castes;  they  will  be
           treated as open competition candidates.”



</blockquote><p id="p_11">      11.        In the second case, the Constitution Bench  held  that  the
      State cannot count a reserved candidate selected in the open  category
      against the vacancies in the reserved category.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      12.        If the proposition laid down in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_9">Indra Sawhney v.  Union  of
      India</a> (supra)  and  <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_10">R.K.Sabharwal  v.  State  of  Punjab</a>  (supra)  are
      considered in abstract, it may be possible to say that once a reserved
      category candidate secures higher merit than open category candidates,
      he can be considered for appointment only against open  category  post
      and the quota of the particular reserved category cannot be reduced by
      treating his appointment as one made against the  post  earmarked  for
      the  reserved  category  to  which  he   belongs.   However,   literal
      application of this  proposition  can  lead  to  serious  anomaly  and
      discrimination  inasmuch  as  more  meritorious   candidate   of   the
      particular   reserved   category   could   be    deprived    of    the
      service/cadre/post  of  his  choice/preference  and  less  meritorious
      candidate of the reserved category could get appointment on  the  post
      which would otherwise be available to more meritorious candidate. This
      can be illustrated by the following example: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are members of reserved category. They  compete
                for selection for recruitment to All-India Services,  which
                includes, IAS, IPS, IRS, etc. In the merit list prepared by
                the Commission ‘X’ is placed higher than some of  the  open
                category candidates but on the basis of his  overall  inter
                se merit with the open category  candidates  he  could  get
                appointment only to IRS.  ‘X’  can  get  the  post  of  his
                choice/preference i.e. IAS provided his case is  considered
                for  appointment  against  the  posts  earmarked  for   the
                particular reserved category to which he belongs.  If he is
                not allowed to do so, then why who is less meritorious than
                ‘X’ within the reserved category will  get  appointment  to
                IAS against the reserved post.  In this  manner  ‘X’  will,
                despite his better  merit  within  the  reserved  category,
                stand discriminated in the matter  of  appointment  against
                the post for which he had given his preference.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">      13.         The  anomaly  of  the  type  mentioned   above   was   not
      countenanced  in  <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_11">Indra  Sawhney  v.  Union  of  India</a>   (supra)   and
      <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_12">R.K.Sabharwal v. State of Punjab</a> (supra) and, therefore, the Court did
      not have the occasion to deal with the same. However, we are convinced
      that  appointment  of  less  meritorious  candidate  of  the  reserved
      category against the service/cadre/post of his choice  and  denial  of
      such appointment to more meritorious candidate of that category  would
      result in blatant violation of the doctrine of equality  enshrined  in
      Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      14.        <a href="/doc/717778/" id="a_13">In State of Bihar v. M. Neethi Chandra</a> (supra), this  Court
      considered  the  question  whether  the  candidates  of  the  reserved
      categories who had secured more marks than  open  category  candidates
      could be placed  in  a  disadvantageous  position  because  they  were
      allotted branches which  were  not  of  their  choice.  If  they  were
      allotted branches as per  their  merit  among  the  reserved  category
      candidates then they would have got the branches of their choice.  The
      writ petitions filed by more meritorious candidates  of  the  reserved
      categories were disposed of by the High Court by  directing  that  the
      seats should be first offered to the candidates of  reserved  category
      on merit and once all the reserved seats  are  filled,  the  remaining
      seats should be offered to the general category. The High Court made a
      further arrangement for the reserved category of girls, who could  get
      seats on merit on their  own  reservation  as  girls  as  well  as  on
      reserved seats as scheduled casts/scheduled tribes etc. The girls were
      to be considered first for admission against the  seats  reserved  for
      them. If any girl belonged to scheduled casts/scheduled  tribe,  etc.,
      she was to be given a choice of one of the two  reservations  and  the
      girls in excess of the reserved vacancies could then seek admission on
      general merit. While partly reversing the order  of  the  High  Court,
      this Court observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">           “Let us take a situation  in  which  in  a  particular  reserved
           category  there  are  ×  number  of  seats  but  the  candidates
           qualifying according to criteria fixed for that category are x+5
           with the best among them also qualifying  on  merit  as  general
           candidates. According to the arrangement made  by  Circular  No.
           20, the first candidate gets a choice  along  with  the  general
           category candidate but being not high enough in the list, gets a
           choice lesser than what he could secure in the reserved category
           to which he was entitled. The × number of seats  could  then  be
           filled up with  the  four  qualifying  candidates  being  denied
           admission for want of seats. This would have been harsh for  the
           best candidate as well as violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the
           Constitution. On the other hand, if the direction  of  the  High
           Court is followed, the first × number of  candidates  get  seats
           according to merit against the reserved seats but the  remaining
           5 will also have to be ‘adjusted’ against  the  open  seats  for
           regular candidates. These 5 will be those who are not  qualified
           according to the general merit criteria and so will  necessarily
           displace 5 general candidates who would be entitled to seats  on
           merit.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           At the same time, as pointed out above, all is not well with the
           Government Circular No. 20  as  it  operates  against  the  very
           candidates for whom the protective  discrimination  is  devised.
           The intention of Circular No. 20 is  to  give  full  benefit  of
           reservation  to  the  candidates  of  the  reserved  categories.
           However, to the extent the meritorious among them are denied the
           choice of college and subject which they could secure under  the
           rule of reservation,  the  circular  cannot  be  sustained.  The
           circular, therefore, can be given effect only  if  the  reserved
           category candidate qualifying on merit with  general  candidates
           consents to being considered as a general candidate on merit-cum-
           choice basis for allotment of college/institution and subject.”

</blockquote><p id="p_15">      15.        <a href="/doc/1962361/" id="a_14">In Anurag Patel v. U.P. Public Service  Commission</a>  (supra)
      this Court was  called  upon  to  consider  whether  more  meritorious
      candidates of reserved category who were adjusted  against  the  posts
      earmarked for general category were not entitled to make a  choice  of
      the post earmarked for reserved category.  The  facts  as  noticed  by
      this Court were that the 3rd respondent, i.e., Rajesh Kumar  Chaurasia
      in CA No. 4794 of 1998, who secured 76th place  in  the  select  list,
      filed Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 46029 of 1993  before  the
      High Court of Allahabad contending that he was appointed  as  a  Sales
      Tax Officer, although the appellant in CA  No.  4794  of  1998,  i.e.,
      Nanku Ram (Anurag Patel) who was also a Backward Class candidate,  was
      appointed as a Deputy Collector, who according to the 3rd  respondent,
      had secured 97th rank in the select  list,  a  rank  lower  than  him.
      Similarly, 8 persons, all belonging  to  Backward  Classes,  who  find
      their names in the select list filed Writ Petition No. 22753  of  1993
      alleging that they were entitled to get postings in  higher  cadre  of
      service as the persons who secured lower rank in the select list  were
      given appointment to higher posts. The first petitioner  in  the  writ
      petition i.e. Shri Rama Sanker Maurya and the 2nd petitioner i.e. Shri
      Abdul Samad were at  Serial  Nos.  13  and  14  in  the  select  list.
      According  to  these  petitioners,  persons  lower  in  rank  who  got
      appointment in the reserved category were given postings on the ground
      that those posts were  earmarked  for  being  appointed  in  Class  II
      services. After noticing the judgments in <a href="/doc/762690/" id="a_15">Ritesh R. Sah v. Dr.  Y.  L.

      (supra), the Court observed:

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">           “In the instant case, as noticed earlier, out of  8  petitioners
           in Writ Petition No. 22753 of 1993, two of them who had  secured
           Ranks 13 and 14 in the merit list, were appointed as  Sales  Tax
           Officer II, whereas the persons who secured Ranks 38, 72 and 97,
           ranks lower to them, got appointment as  Deputy  Collectors  and
           the Division Bench of the High Court held that  it  is  a  clear
           injustice to the persons who are more meritorious  and  directed
           that a list of all selected Backward Class candidates  shall  be
           prepared separately including those candidates selected  in  the
           general category and their appointments to the  posts  shall  be
           made strictly in accordance with merit as per  the  select  list
           and preference of a person higher in the  select  list  will  be
           seen first and appointment given accordingly,  while  preference
           of a person lower in the list will be seen only later.”



</blockquote><p id="p_16">      16.        A somewhat similar question came up before the three  Judge
      Bench in <a href="/doc/1368252/" id="a_17">Union of  India  v.  Ramesh  Ram</a>  (2009)  6  SCC  619.   Some
      candidates belonging to OBC had filed  an  application  before  Madras
      Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal challenging Rule 16(2) of
      the  Civil  Services  Examination  Rules,  2005.   They  pleaded  that
      adjustment of more meritorious OBC candidates against  the  OBC  quota
      was illegal.  According to them, such  candidate  should  be  adjusted
      against the unreserved/general  category  posts  and  allow  more  OBC
      candidates, who were lower in rank, to be recommended  for  the  posts
      earmarked for that category. The Tribunal held that the OBC candidates
      who were selected on  merit  must  be  adjusted  against  the  general
      category posts.  It further held that in terms of the judgment of this
      Court in <a href="/doc/1962361/" id="a_18">Anuraj Patel vs. U.P. Public Service Commission</a> (supra),  the
      allocation of service should be in accordance with rank-cum-preference
      with priority given to meritorious candidates.  The three Judge  Bench
      noticed the judgments in <a href="/doc/762690/" id="a_19">Ritesh R. Sah  v.  Dr.  Y.L.  Yamul</a>  (supra),
      <a href="/doc/1962361/" id="a_20">Anurag Patel v. U.P. Public  Service  Commission</a>  (supra)  and  <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_21">R.  K.
      Sabharwal v. State of Punjab</a> (supra) and referred the  matter  to  the
      Constitution Bench.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      17.        When the matter was placed before  the  Constitution  Bench
      (the judgment of the Constitution Bench is reported as <a href="/doc/1368252/" id="a_22">Union of  India
      v. Ramesh Ram</a> (2010) 7 SCC 234), the following question was framed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">           “Whether candidates belonging  to  reserved  category,  who  get
           recommended against general/unreserved vacancies on  account  of
           their merit (without the benefit of any  relaxation/concession),
           can opt for a higher choice of service  earmarked  for  reserved
           category and thereby migrate to reserved category.”



</blockquote><p id="p_18">      18.        The Constitution Bench referred to the rules, the judgments
      of this Court in <a href="/doc/1961583/" id="a_23">Union of India v. Satya Prakash</a>  (2006)  4  SCC  550,
      <a href="/doc/762690/" id="a_24">Ritesh R. Sah v. Dr. Y.L. Yamul</a> (supra), <a href="/doc/717778/" id="a_25">State of Bihar v.  M.  Neethi

      Service Commission</a> (supra) and observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">           “The decision in Anurag Patel rectified the  anomaly  which  had
           occurred  since  U.P.  PSC  had  allotted  services   of   lower
           preference to  the  candidates  of  Backward  Classes  who  were
           meritorious enough to qualify as per the criteria laid down  for
           general category candidates. Such  meritorious  candidates  were
           disadvantaged on  account  of  qualifying  on  merit  which  was
           patently offensive to the principles outlined in Articles 14 and
           16 of the Constitution. This Court had reached  such  conclusion
           to ensure that allocation of service is in accordance  with  the
           rank-cum-preference basis with  priority  given  to  meritorious
           candidates for service allocation.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">           The decision in Anurag Patel in turn  referred  to  the  earlier
           decision in <a href="/doc/762690/" id="a_29">Ritesh R. Sah v. Dr. Y.L. Yamul</a>.  However,  we  have
           already distinguished  the  judgment  in  Ritesh  R.  Sah.  That
           decision was given in relation to reservation for  admission  to
           postgraduate medical courses and  the  same  cannot  be  readily
           applied in the present circumstances where we are  dealing  with
           the examinations conducted by UPSC. The ultimate  aim  of  civil
           services aspirants is to qualify for the most  coveted  services
           and each of the services have quotas for reserved  classes,  the
           benefits of which are availed by MRC  candidates  for  preferred
           service.  As  highlighted  earlier,  the  benefit   accrued   by
           different  candidates  who  secure  admission  in  a  particular
           educational institution is of a homogeneous nature. However, the
           benefits  accruing  from   successfully   qualifying   in   UPSC
           examination are of a varying  nature  since  some  services  are
           coveted more than others.”

</blockquote><p id="p_19">      19.         The  Constitution  Bench  noticed  the  judgment  in  <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_30">R.K.
      Sabharwal v. State of Punjab</a> (supra) and  distinguished  the  same  by
      making the following observation:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">           “Reference was also made to <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_31">R.K. Sabharwal v. State  of  Punjab</a>,
           this Court had  declared  that  the  State  shall  not  count  a
           reserved  category  candidate  selected  in  the  open  category
           against the vacancies in the reserved category. However, by this
           it could not be inferred that if the candidate himself wishes to
           avail a vacancy in the reserved category, he shall be prohibited
           from doing so. After considering the counsel's  submissions  and
           deliberations among ourselves, we are of the view that the ratio
           in that case is not applicable for the purpose  of  the  present
           case. That case was primarily concerned with the Punjab  Service
           of Engineers in  the  Irrigation  Department  of  the  State  of
           Punjab. The decision was rendered in the context  of  the  posts
           earmarked for the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and Backward
           Classes on the roster. It was noted that  once  such  posts  are
           filled the reservation is complete. Roster  cannot  operate  any
           further and it should be stopped. Any post falling vacant  in  a
           cadre thereafter, is to be filled from the category reserved  or
           general due to retirement or removal of a  person  belonging  to
           the respective category. Unlike the  examinations  conducted  by
           UPSC which includes 21 different services this case pertains  to
           a single service and therefore the same cannot be compared  with
           the examination conducted by UPSC. The examination conducted  by
           UPSC is very prestigious and the topmost services of this nation
           are included in this examination. In this respect, it is obvious
           that  there  is  fierce  competition  amongst   the   successful
           candidates as well to secure appointments in the most  preferred
           services. This judgment is strictly  confined  to  the  enabling
           provision of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_32">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution under  which  the
           State Government has the sole power to decide whether there is a
           requirement for reservations in favour of the backward class  in
           the services under the State Government.  However,  the  present
           case deals with positions in the various  civil  services  under
           the Union Government that are  filled  through  the  examination
           process conducted by UPSC. Therefore, the fact-situation in R.K.
           Sabharwal case is clearly distinguishable.

<p id="p_20">      20.        In view of the above discussion and the law  laid  down  in

           meritorious than open category candidates is entitled to  choose
           the particular service/cadre/post as per  his  choice/preference
           and he cannot be compelled to accept appointment to an  inferior
           post  leaving  the  more  important  service/cadre/post  in  the
