<p id="p_1">                                  One of the products manufactured and marketed by the plaintiff is

                a glucose-based chewy tablet sold under the trademark BOLTS. The

                defendants also manufacture and market a glucose-based chewy tablet under

                the trademark VOLT. The suit was filed seeking relief in respect of alleged

                passing off by the defendants of their products under the mark VOLT as the

                products of the plaintiff bearing the mark BOLTS. The plaintiff also sought

                to restrain the defendants from using the tag line ENERGY OF GLUCON-

                D, ANYWHERE, ANY TIME, on the ground that the said tag line is

                deceptively similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s tag line INSTANT ENERGY,

                ANYTIME ANYWHERE.                     Pursuant to the interim application being

                contested, the defendants removed the tag line ENERGY OF GLUCON-D,

                ANYWHERE, ANYTIME. The plaintiff had also prayed for relief in respect

                of the colour scheme and get up of the defendants&#x27; packaging, as represented

                in Document No.2, which was annexed to the plaint. Such colour scheme

                and get up of the packaging was modified by the defendants, in terms of an

                interim compromise, and O.S.A.Nos.111 to 113 of 2015 were disposed of on

                that basis without prejudice to the plaintiff&#x27;s objection to the use of the mark

                VOLT. Consequently, prayers (b) &amp; (c) of paragraph 24 of the plaint do not

                survive for adjudication.

<p id="p_2">                                  2. The plaintiff stated the following. Wipro Limited entered into a

                scheme of arrangement with Azim Premji Custodial Services Private

                Limited and Wipro Trademarks Holding Limited. By such scheme, the

                customer care products were transferred to and vested in Azim Premji

                Custodial Services Private Limited. The scheme was approved by the

                Hon&#x27;ble Karnataka High Court by order dated 01.03.2013 in Company

                Petition Nos.8, 9 and 10 of 2013.              Thereafter, Azim Premji Custodial

                Services Private Limited changed its name and is presently known as Wipro

                Enterprises Limited, i.e. the plaintiff herein. In course of business, on

                16.04.2003, the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff acquired the

                trademark GLUCOVITA from Hindustan Lever Limited. As a result of the

                de-merger, the said mark vests with the plaintiff.            The plaintiff is the

                proprietor of several trademarks, including BOLTS. The mark BOLTS was

                conceived and adopted the mark in the year 2012 and the plaintiff uses the

                mark along with the house mark GLUCOVITA to market and sell glucose

                based chewy tablets. These tablets contain three active ingredients, namely,

                vitamin-D, calcium and iron. These tablets may be consumed without water

                and therefore they may be carried in the pocket and are a good source of

                instant energy.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                                  3.   The plaintiff further stated as follows. It earned Rs.26.35

                million from the sale of the above mentioned product in the financial year

                2012-2013,             Rs.171.07 million   in the financial year 2013-2014 and

                Rs.233.90 million in the financial year 2014-2015. A considerable amount

                of money was expended in promoting products under the trademark BOLTS.

                In the financial year 2012-2013, it is stated that the sales expenditure of

                Rs.26.35 million and advertising expenditure of Rs.21.60 million was

                incurred. This increased to Rs.171.07 million towards sales expenses and

                Rs.81.54 million towards advertisement expenses in the financial year 2013

</p><p id="p_4">                - 2014 and further increased to Rs.182.65 million towards sales expenses

                and Rs.112.42 million towards advertisement expenses in the financial year

                2014-2015.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                                  4.   In December 2014, the plaintiff stated that it noticed an

                identical product in the market, which was manufactured and marketed by

                the first and second defendants and sold by the third defendant. According

                to the plaintiff, the adoption of the mark VOLT by the defendants is mala

                fide because the said mark is deceptively similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s mark

                BOLTS. The plaintiff further stated that the mala fide intention of the

                defendants is clear from the adoption of an identical colour scheme and get

                up for the packaging. The plaintiff also stated that the adoption of the tag

                line ENERGY OF GLUCON-D ANYWHERE, ANYTIME underscores the

                mala fide intention           because the said tag line   is an imitation    of the

                plaintiff&#x27;s tag line INSTANT ENERGY ANY TIME, ANY WHERE. The

                plaintiff asserted that consumers referred to its product as BOLTS and,

                therefore, the adoption and use of a deceptively similar trademark VOLT by

                the defendant is likely to cause confusion. The suit was instituted in the

                said facts and circumstances.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                  5. In spite of service of suit summons and the names of the

                defendants being printed in the cause list, there was no representation for

                defendants 2 and 3. Therefore, by order dated 25.07.2019, defendants 2 and

                3 were set ex parte.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                                  6. The first defendant refuted the statements in the plaint by filing

                a written statement. In the said written statement, the first defendant raised

                the preliminary objection that leave to sue was obtained in Application

                No.11 of 2015 by suppressing material facts. The first defendant also

                alleged that the plaintiff had made changes to the plaint after obtaining leave

                to sue, and that the changes in the cause of action paragraph substantially

                altered the basis on which leave to sue was obtained earlier. The first

                defendant pointed out that the plaintiff had filed O.S.No.15 of 2015 before

                the City Civil Court, Hyderabad, on substantially the same grounds. In the

                said suit, an ex parte order of injunction was granted on 20.01.2015 and

                thereafter vacated on the ground of suppression of material facts.

</p><p id="p_8">                                  7. The first defendant further stated the following. The word

                BOLTS is common to the trade and was previously adopted and used by


                _____________

                other entities offering products that provide energy or speed. The mark

                VOLT is not visually, phonetically or structurally similar to BOLTS. The

                plaintiff&#x27;s goods are manufactured and marketed under the well known

                trademark GLUCOVITA and similarly the first defendant&#x27;s products are

                manufactured and marketed under the well known trade mark GLUCON-D.

                Therefore, it is not possible for members of the public to be confused or

                deceived. The expression BOLT/BOLTS is a common generic expression

                over which monopoly cannot be claimed. The expression VOLT is the SI

                unit of electromagnetic force and was adopted honestly with a view to

                communicate to consumers that they will experience a sudden charge of

                energy on consuming the product.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                                  8. The first defendant further stated as follows. It launched the

                product GLUCON-D VOLT in December 2014 in the State of Tamil Nadu.

                The sales turnover and marketing expenditure in respect of GLUCON-D

                VOLT runs into several crores. It invested several lakhs in promoting and

                advertising GLUCON-D VOLT.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                                  9.The first defendant denied that the plaintiff adopted the mark

                BOLTS in the year 2017. The first defendant asserted that VOLT is not

                identical or deceptively similar to BOLTS. The first defendant also stated

                that the plaintiff&#x27;s product carries the mark GLUCOVITA and is not known

                by the mark BOLTS.The first defendant denied that the packaging is

                deceptively similar and also denied that it copied the plaintiff&#x27;s tag line. For

                reasons stated earlier, these aspects have become irrelevant on account of

                subsequent changes made by the first defendant to the colour scheme, get

                statement. With regard to the changes made to the plaint after obtaining

                leave to sue, the plaintiff stated that the suit was instituted a few days after

                the first defendant launched the product.              Therefore, at that time, the

                plaintiff had not obtained invoices pertaining to the sale of the first

                defendant&#x27;s products. Such invoices were obtained from four pharmacies in

                Chennai and, therefore, the cause of action paragraph was amended to

                reflect the sale of the product at Saidapet, Parry&#x27;s Corner, Teynampet and

                West Mambalam. With regard to jurisdiction, the plaintiff pointed out that

                the first defendant withdrew the application to revoke leave and, therefore,

                cannot challenge the jurisdiction of this Court.

                BOLTS and that such similarity is visual, phonetic and structural. The

                plaintiff further stated that the products of the plaintiff and the first

                defendant are sold through the same trade channels. Although the trademark

                GLUCOVITA and GLUCON-D are used by the plaintiff and defendant,

                respectively, the products are known as BOLTS and VOLT, respectively.

                The plaintiff denied that BOLTS is generic and stated that VOLT is

                deceptively similar although it has a dictionary meaning.

                P.W.1, 10 documents were exhibited as Exs.P1 to P10. P.W.1 was cross

                examined by learned counsel for the first defendant. Ms.Urvashi Soni, the

                authorized representative of the first defendant, was examined as D.W.1. In

                course of the examination-in-chief of D.W.1, 13 documents were exhibited

                in the year 2012. He invited my attention to Ex.P2, which is the plaintiff&#x27;s

                label, and to Ex.P4, which is the defendants&#x27; label. He submitted that the

                first defendant had adopted not only the deceptively similar mark BOLT but

                had also copied the plaintiff&#x27;s tag line INSTANT ENERGY, ANY TIME,

                ANY WHERE by adopting the tag line ENERGY OF GLUCON-D, ANY

                WHERE, ANY TIME. In addition, he stated that a similar colour scheme

                was adopted. Subsequently, the colour scheme and tag line were modified

                but the first defendant continues to use the deceptively similar mark VOLT.

                The first defendant&#x27;s adoption and use of the mark VOLT is admittedly

                subsequent in point of time because the said defendant adopted the mark in

                the year 2014.

                and used the mark BOLTS previously. By referring to Ex.D11(series), he

                pointed out that the marks depicted therein are not marks used in India. For

                instance, he referred to the use of the mark VOLT for an organic energy

                product at page No.33 of the typed set of exhibits and pointed out that this

                product is sold at US Dollars 29.88. Similarly, with reference to the label at

                page 39, he pointed out that the BOLT energy drink is not available in India.

                His next submission was that GLUCOVITA is the house mark of the

                plaintiff and that the plaintiff manufactures and markets products under

                several trademarks, including BOLTS, by also using the house mark

                GLUCOVITA. However, consumers refer to each product by the specific

                trademark assigned to such product. Consequently, as regards the glucose

                based chewy tablets, he stated that consumers refer to it as BOLTS and not

                as GLUCOVITA. Therefore, he stated that VOLT is deceptively similar to

                BOLTS and that the plaintiff is entitled to restrain the first defendant, which

                is a subsequent user of the deceptively similar mark, from using the same. In

                support of these contentions, he referred to and relied upon the following

                judgments:

                the first defendant entered the market first under the mark GLUCON-D. He

                focused attention on the conduct of the plaintiff and pointed out that the

                plaintiff filed a different version of the plaint along with the application for

                leave to sue, and made material amendments to the cause of action

                paragraph of the plaint subsequently.            Secondly, he submitted that the

                plaintiff instituted a suit in Hyderabad and later withdrew the same. With

                regard to the            sale of the plaintiff&#x27;s product, he submitted that only

                secondary evidence was produced. By referring to Ex.P8, which is an

                invoice in the name of Wipro Enterprises Limited, he pointed out that the

                said invoice is fabricated because the plaintiff was incorporated only on

                19.04.2013, whereas the invoice is dated 12.05.2012. Therefore, he

                submitted that the invoices submitted by the plaintiff should not be relied

                upon.

</p><p id="p_27">                                  18. With regard to the merits of the dispute, he submitted that the

                lightning device is used by the first defendant to represent the sudden surge

                of energy or power. On this issue, he referred to question No.3 and the

                answer thereto of P.W.1 during cross-examination.               With regard to the

                submission that GLUCOVITA is a house or umbrella mark, he stated that

                the only pleading on the said issue is in paragraph 6 of the plaint.

                Consequently, he submitted that the plaintiff failed to establish that

                GLUCOVITA is a house mark.                His next contention was that the plaintiff

                applied for registration of the mark GLUCOVITA BOLTS as a device mark.

                In the application submitted for registration of the said device mark, the

                plaintiff relied on the prior registration of the mark GLUCOVITA in class

                30 and submitted that GLUCOVITA BOLTS is an extension of the already

                well-known brand GLUCOVITA. He also pointed out that the plaintiff

                responded to the objections of the trademark registry by pointing out that

                the mark is a composite mark consisting of the words GLUCOVITA and the

                word BOLTS and that, when compared as a whole, the mark is different

                from the prior marks GLUCOFIT and GLUCOVITS.

                that the plaintiff failed to provide any evidence of actual confusion although

                the first defendant&#x27;s product is in the market from 2014. He further stated

                that there is no likelihood of confusion either because the plaintiff&#x27;s mark

                BOLTS is used with the registered mark                GLUCOVITA and the first

                whether the plaintiff can claim exclusive right to the expression

                BOLT/BOLTS. Since the decision on this issue would have a strong bearing

                A generic mark is one which describes a product or service category, i.e. a

                genus comprising several species; a descriptive mark is one which describes

                the quality, nature, purpose, ingredient or characteristic of a product or

                service; a suggestive mark is one which suggests but does not describe the

                quality, nature, purpose, ingredient or characteristic of a product or service;

                and an arbitrary mark is chosen capriciously and does not bear any

                discernible connection with the product or service.

                is applied. Therefore, the exercise cannot be carried out divorced from

                context. For instance, in the context of a dating and matchmaking service

                app, I concluded in Free Elective that the mark “Jodi” is descriptive. The

                conclusion may have been different if the same mark had been used for a

                different service or product. In Stokely Van Camp, the Division Bench of

                the Delhi High Court refused to protect the tag line Rehydrates, Replenishes

                Refuel, in the context of the use of the trademark “Glucon D Isotonik”

                prominently on the packaging by the counter party, on the ground that it is

                descriptive. As stated earlier, in this case, the tag line controversy has been

                resolved. The questions that arise are : (i) into which category on the

                spectrum of marks should BOLTS be placed in; and (ii) whether protection

                should be extended to BOLTS. The defendant exhibited three distinct

                dictionary meanings of BOLTS as Ex.D10 to substantiate the contention that

                it is a commonly used word in the English language and, therefore, not

                distinctive. The three meanings are: a large metal pin; a short, heavy arrow

                shot from a crossbow; and a jagged white flash of lightning.

                not directly describe the nature, quality, characteristic, purpose or ingredient

                of the product. The plaintiff has adopted the mark BOLTS in relation to

                glucose based chewy tablets. While BOLTS is a dictionary word, in the

                context of glucose based chewy tablets, it cannot be said to be descriptive of

                the product category or even the nature, quality or purpose. The mark was

                probably adopted in view of the &#x27;instant energy&#x27; characteristic of the product,

                but a fair measure of imagination is required to make the connection

                between BOLT (which also means flash of lightning) and the &#x27;instant energy&#x27;

                characteristic of the product. Therefore, the mark is suggestive and not

                descriptive.

<p id="p_48">                                  25. The plaintiff asserted that the mark BOLTS was adopted and

                used from 2012.            In support of this submission, the plaintiff exhibited

                invoices pertaining to the sale of the product. These invoices are exhibited

                as Ex.P8(series). The first invoice is dated 12.05.2012 and the last invoice

                is dated 20.12.2014. These invoices were disputed by the first defendant on

                the ground that they are photocopies.             Secondly, the first defendant

                contended that the invoices were fabricated by pointing out that the plaintiff

                was incorporated only on 19.04.2013 and therefore could not have issued

                invoices prior thereto. In order to establish devolution of title, the plaintiff

                exhibited the order dated 01.03.2013 of the Karnataka High Court in

                Company Petition Nos.8 to 10 of 2013. The said document discloses that a

                scheme of arrangement was approved by the members and other

                stakeholders of Wipro Limited, Azim Premji Custodial Services Private

                Limited           and Wipro Trademarks Holding Limited. On examining the

                scheme, it is evident that all three companies were part of the same group.

                Wipro Limited was carrying on consumer care products business and the

                scheme envisaged that the said business would be de-merged from Wipro

                Limited and vested in Azim Premji Custodial Services Private Limited.

                Azim Premji Custodial Services Private Limited was converted into a public

                limited company later and changed its name as Wipro Enterprises Limited

                on 19.04.2013. The mark GLUCOVITA BOLTS was conceived of, adopted

                and used by the plaintiff&#x27;s predecessor-in-interest, Wipro Limited.        The

                scheme of arrangement specifies the appointed date as 01.04.2012.

                Therefore, upon approval of the scheme on 01.03.2013, the scheme takes

                effect from the appointed date, i.e.       01.04.2012.   As a consequence,

                accounting is done by the parties to the scheme on the basis that the de-

                merger took effect from 01.04.2012. For instance, all sales effected by the

                consumer care products division of Wipro Limited would be accounted in

                the name of Wipro Enterprises Limited from 01.04.2012.                     In these

                circumstances, the generation of invoices bearing the name Wipro

                Enterprises Limited in May 2012 cannot be characterized as fabricated or

                unreliable. Thus, it may be concluded that the plaintiff has placed on record

                invoices relating to the use of the mark GLUCOVITA BOLTS between 2012

                and 2014.
</p>
<p id="p_49">                                  26. The question that follows is whether any other entity used the

                mark BOLTS prior thereto. In order to establish that the mark BOLT/BOLTS

                was used earlier, the defendant placed on record Exs.D9 to D11. Ex.D9 is

                an application by GRV Confectionery and Foods Pvt. Ltd. for registration of

                the device mark BOLT in Class 30 in relation to confectionery, chocolates,

                candy, etc. This application was filed on 19.08.2013 and use is asserted

                therein from 01.04.2012, but evidence of use is not on record. Ex.D10 sets

                out the dictionary meaning of the word BOLT. Ex.D11 contains labels used

                by other entities bearing the mark BOLT. On closely examining the same, it

                appears that the mark BOLT has been used outside India both in relation to

                an energy bar and an energy drink. In India, it has been used for a car

                brand. However, there is no evidence of the use of the mark BOLT/BOLTS

                in relation to similar products in India except for the above mentioned

                application by GRV Confectionery and Foods Pvt. Ltd.                  Based on this

                evidence, I conclude that there is no evidence of prior use of the mark

                BOLT/BOLTS in India in relation to the same                    or similar products.

                Therefore, it is concluded that the plaintiff appears to be the first user of the

                mark BOLTS in relation to glucose based chewy tablets or products similar

                thereto in India. <a href="/doc/149416858/" id="a_20">In S.Syed Moideen v. P.Sulochana Bai</a>, (2016) 2 SCC 683,

                at paragraph 30.4, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court noted that the scheme of the

                Trademarks Act recognizes the rights of a prior user as being superior to that

                of a registered proprietor and that even a registered proprietor cannot

                disturb/interfere with the rights of a prior user. Therefore, as the first user,

                the plaintiff is entitled to claim exclusive right to use the mark BOLTS in

                relation to glucose based chewy tablets or products similar thereto.

                inter-related, they are dealt with and disposed of jointly. On examining

                Exs.P2 and P4, it is clear that the plaintiff&#x27;s mark is a device mark which

                contains the word elements GLUCOVITA BOLTS. The defendant&#x27;s mark is

                also a device mark which contains the word elements GLUCON-D VOLT.

                The plaintiff asserted that the consumer refers to the product as BOLTS and

                not as GLUCOVITA BOLTS, and placed on record invoices relating to the

                sale of the product. All the invoices refer to the product as GLUCOVITA

                BOLTS. In the proof affidavit of P.W.1, P.W.1 stated that BOLTS is a

                trademark conceived and adopted in the year 2012 and used along with the

                house mark GLUCOVITA to market and sell glucose based chewy tablets.

                The details of advertisements pertaining to the mark BOLTS are placed on

                record as Ex.P9(series). Ex.P9 series also refers to the product as

                GLUCOVITA BOLTS.
</p>
<p id="p_52">                                  28. Therefore, the dispute boils down to whether the use of the

                mark GLUCON-D VOLT by the defendant is deceptively similar to

                GLUCOVITA BOLTS and would therefore lead to confusion or deception

                among consumers. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court formulated the tests for

                determining whether there is passing off in Cadila. In paragraph 42 of the

                Manupatra report, the following factors were held to be relevant for such

                                         &#x27;&#x27;7. Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under
                                  our consideration. It is not disputed before us that the two
                                  names “Amritdhara” and “Lakshman-dhara” are in use in
                                  respect of the same description of goods, namely a medicinal
                                  preparation for the alleviation of various ailments. Such
                                  medicinal preparation will be purchased mostly by people who
                                  instead of going to a doctor wish to purchase a medicine for
                                  the quick alleviation of their suffering, both villagers and
                                  townsfolk, literate as well as illiterate. As we said in <a href="/doc/1883538/" id="a_21">Corn
                                  Products Refining Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd</a>.[(1960)
                                  (1) SCR 968] the question has to be approached from the point
                                  of view of a man of average intelligence and imperfect
                                  recollection. To such a man the overall structural and phonetic
                                  similarity-of   the     two     names      “Amritdhara”        and
                                  “Lakshmandhara” is, in our opinion, likely to deceive or cause
                                  confusion. We must consider the overall similarity of the two
                                  composite words “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. We do
                                  not think that the learned Judges of the High Court were right
                                  in saying that no Indian would mistake one for the other. An
                                  unwary purchaser of average intelligence and imperfect
                                  recollection would not, as the High Court supposed, split the
                                  name into its component parts and consider the etymological
                                  meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the composite
                                  words as “current of nectar” or “current of Lakshman”. He
                                  would go more by the overall structural and phonetic similarity
                                  and the nature of the medicine he has previously purchased, or
                                  has been told about, or about which has otherwise learnt and
                                  which he wants to purchase. Where the trade relates to goods
                                  largely sold to illiterate or badly educated persons, it is no
                                  answer to say that a person educated in the Hindi language

                                   would go by the etymological or ideological meaning and see
                                   the difference between “current of nectar” and “current of
                                   Lakshman”. “Current of Lakshman” in a literal sense has no
                                   meaning; to give it meaning one must further make the
                                   inference that the “current or stream” is as pure and strong as
                                   Lakshman of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or
                                   townsman will perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the
                                   Ramayana being familiar to him; but we doubt if he would
                                   etymologise to the extent of seeing the so-called ideological
                                   difference between “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara”. He
                                   would go more by the similarity of the two names in the context
                                   of the widely known medicinal preparation which he wants for
                                   his ailments.&#x27;&#x27;

                In similar fashion, the rival marks &#x27;FEVICOL MARINE&#x27; and &#x27;JIVANJOR

                MARINE PLUS&#x27; were considered similar in <a href="/doc/124137051/" id="a_22">Pidilite Industries Limited v.

                the use of the prefix GLUCOVITA by the plaintiff and GLUCON-D by the

                first defendant distinguishes the products and would avert the likelihood of

                confusion or deception. On the contrary, the plaintiff contended that these

                products are referred to as BOLTS and VOLT, respectively, and therefore,

                there is strong likelihood of confusion or deception. The plaintiff asserted

                both in pleadings and oral evidence that GLUCOVITA is a house mark and

                that several products under different marks are sold under the house mark

                GLUCOVITA. The defendant denied the said assertion and contended that

                the plaintiff did not prove that GLUCOVITA is a house mark. All the

                invoices filed by the plaintiff as Ex.P8(series) bear the description

                GLUCOVITA BOLTS as regards its products. Therefore, there is no doubt

                that the product is referred to as GLUCOVITA BOLTS and not merely as

                BOLTS. Be that as it may, the exercise of determining whether there is

                likelihood of deception or confusion should be carried out from the

                perspective of a consumer of average intelligence and imperfect

                recollection.     The question is whether such consumer is likely to be

                confused or deceived as regards GLUCON-D VOLT and GLUCOVITA

                BOLTS. In contrast to ITC Limited - where the comparison was between

                ITC SUNFEAST YIPPEE INSTANT NOODLES MAGIC MASALA, on the

                one hand, and NESTLE MAGGI XTRA DELICIOUS MAGICAL

                MASALA, on the other - the distinguishing factors are minimal. When

                examined from the perspective of the average consumer, the retail sale

                environment should also be borne in mind. These products are typically

                sold as over-the-counter products by pharmacies. It is reasonable to assume

                that consumers would ask for the product by using the easier-to-use

                expressions BOLTS and VOLT.                   The said expressions are certainly

                phonetically, structurally and visually similar. Consequently, the likelihood

                of confusion or deception cannot be disregarded.

</p><p id="p_65">                                  31. The manner of adoption of the first defendant&#x27;s device mark is

                also relevant while deciding this case.            Both the plaintiff and the first

                defendant are large entities with considerable reputation.            The plaintiff

                introduced the product GLUCOVITA BOLTS before the first defendant

                introduced the product GLUCON-D VOLT. Given the fact that they operate

                in the same segment, the first defendant was certainly aware about the

                plaintiff&#x27;s product. After being aware of the plaintiff&#x27;s product, the first

                defendant introduced a near identical product under the mark GLUCON-D

                VOLT and adopted a similar tag line and colour scheme. Therefore, the

                adoption of the device mark by the first defendant was certainly with the

                intention of coming as close to the plaintiff&#x27;s product as possible. When all

                the facts and circumstances are taken into account, I am of the view that the

                use of VOLT as part of the device mark in relation to a near identical

                product is likely to cause confusion or deception. The plaintiff has placed

                on record evidence of reputation and goodwill in the form of its sales turn

                over and advertisement expenses. Such reputation and goodwill would be

                injured by the use of the deceptively similar mark GLUCON - D VOLT by

                the first defendant. Therefore, Issue Nos.1 and 3 are decided in favour of

                the plaintiff and against the first defendant.

</p><p id="p_66">                                  32. Before drawing the curtain, however, the fact that the

                defendant has sold GLUCON-D VOLT for a considerable period of time

                should be reckoned. Consequently, it is possible that unsold inventory is in

                the pipeline. In order to provide lead time to liquidate inventory in the sales

                channels, subject to accounting for profits, the order of injunction shall

                come into effect two months from the date of receipt thereof. The plaintiff is

                also entitled to delivery of impugned products and the like and for a

                preliminary decree for rendition of account of profits. Since costs follow

                the event, the plaintiff is entitled to costs. By taking into account court fees,

                reasonable lawyer&#x27;s fees and other expenses, the plaintiff is entitled to a sum

                of Rs.3,00,000/- as costs.
