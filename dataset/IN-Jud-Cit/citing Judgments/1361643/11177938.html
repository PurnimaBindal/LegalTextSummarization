No.1053335 in class 9 as of 19th October, 2001 in respect of products,

registered Indian subsidiary with the MCA, i.e. Red Hat India Private
Limited on 5th July, 2000.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.     The plaintiff states that in July 2008, the plaintiff came across
the domain name www.redhatinfotech.com. The plaintiff further
states that defendant No.4‟s trademark bearing No.1859208 in
Class 37 is claimed to be in use since 28th January, 2008. The plaintiff
objected to the same and upon further investigation it was found out
that even defendant No.1 had applied for registration of RED HAT
INFOTECH (label) in Class 42 bearing No.1724581.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.     The plaintiff averred in the plaint that the defendants have
unfairly/dishonestly used their trademark REDHAT words per se and
also the device SHADOWMAN and the same is with an intention to
deceit the consumers and the public at large. The reputation of the
plaintiff is being affected due the action of the consumers.
</p>
<p id="p_8">7.     Plaintiff states that it has obtained trademarks and registration
for variety of services provided by them and the same is renewed
from time to time. The plaintiff has registered trade mark in various
countries including India. The plaintiff states that the goods and
services are exclusively advertised and promoted on its exclusive
website www.redhat.com.

<p id="p_9">I.A. No.10679/2011 in CS(OS) No.1654/2011                          Page No.3 of 27
</p><p id="p_10"> 8.     That     after     it   came         to    the     knowledge      of   the     plaintiff
that     defendant         No.1      is          having     the     domain       name           as
www.redhatinfotech.com              and          the    same      was   registered      under
defendant No.1. The plaintiff issued a notice via email dated
18th July, 2008 stating the plaintiff was interested in an amicable
settlement.       Another email dated 31st July, 2008 stating that the
active content was removed from the website and the matter was
accordingly seemed resolved.
</p>
<p id="p_11">9.     The plaintiff further states that they found defendants had
expanded their arena of the Offending Marks to another website
under domain name www.bulk.smshesms.com. The plaintiff further
states that defendant No.4 had a trade mark application bearing
No.1859208 in class 37 and defendants No.4 claimed to be using the
same since 28th January, 2008. Upon further search, it was revealed
that defendant No.1 had applied for registration of RED HAT
INFOTECH (label) in Class 42 bearing No.1724581 and the mark is at
the pre examination stage, yet to be advertised in the Trade Marks
Journal. The plaintiff through its agent wrote to the defendants vide
letter dated 23rd July, 2010 in this regard. It is also stated in the plaint
that    the    defendants         were       using        the   registered     trade     mark
RED HAT of the plaintiff as a part of another domain name
www.redhatsalesteam.com. The defendants were again sent a „cease
and desist‟ letter dated 11th September, 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_12">10.    The plaintiff along with the suit filed an interim application
which was listed before the Court for the first time on 11 th July, 2011.
While issuing the summons in the main suit, an ex parte ad-interim
order was issued against the defendants, their agents, employees,
franchisees and representatives restraining them from using the trade
mark RED HAT with a device which is deceptively similar to the
plaintiff‟s SHADOWMAN device.
</p>
<p id="p_13">I.A. No.10679/2011 in CS(OS) No.1654/2011                                     Page No.4 of 27
 Case of the Defendants

</p><p id="p_14">11.     The defendants incorporated a company on 25th November,
2003 under the name of defendant No.5, i.e. Red Hat Infotechnologies
Pvt. Ltd. under the Companies Registration Act.      Earlier defendants
No.1 to 3 were carrying on partnership business under the name and
style of defendant No.4, namely, Red Hat Infocom. The defendants
have filed large number of documents by way of invoices, sales tax,
central sales tax certificates, statements of current account of the
company, audit report, application for obtaining the PAN Card, from
the year 2004 onward.
</p>
<p id="p_15">12.     The contention of the learned counsel for the defendants is that
while obtaining the registrations from the year 1999 onward, the
plaintiff has not been claiming the actual user of the mark RED HAT,
and the logo of SHADOWMAN, but in the user column in the
application, it was mentioned as "proposed to be used", that means
that the plaintiff was not using the mark in India at least prior to the
year 2004. Therefore, in India the plaintiff is, apparently, the
subsequent user of the mark RED HAT.
</p>
<p id="p_16">13.     Second argument of the learned counsel for the defendants is
that defendant No.5 is a company, namely, Red Hat Infocom Private
Limited, which is registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a> and it is the
obligation of the defendants to execute its operation of the name of
the company and the defendants are using the logo SHADOWMAN
device totally in a different way which is not similar to the plaintiff‟s
logo.     The device of the cap is different.    It is an honest user.
Therefore, the defendants are entitled to use the same. As far as the
name of the company is concerned, the Registrar of Companies has
registered the said name in Corporation Certificate which clearly
provides that a certificate of incorporation given by the Registrar in
respect of any association shall be conclusive evidence that all the

I.A. No.10679/2011 in CS(OS) No.1654/2011                 Page No.5 of 27
 requirement of this Act, have been complied with in respect of
registration and matter precedent and incidental thereto, and that the
association is a company authorized to be registered and duly
registered under this Act.
</p>
<p id="p_17">14.    The other argument of the learned counsel for the defendants is
that the nature of the business of the defendants is different as that
of the plaintiff.      Therefore, the question of confusion and deception
does not arise.         Lastly, the plea of delay was also raised by the
counsel for the defendants by alleging that there has been a
considerable delay in bringing the action before Court, thus, the
plaintiff is entitled for injunction.       Apart of delay, the suit is also
barred under the <a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_2">Limitation Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_18">15.    In reply to the submissions made by the defendants, the
learned counsel for the plaintiff has referred para-10 of the plaint
wherein the services offered by the plaintiff‟s trade mark are divided
into three prime heads which read as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       a. Red Hat Consulting - Red Hat Consulting offers a broad
          portfolio of services spanning the entire Red Hat or JBoss
          deployment     cycle.     The    plaintiff‟s product-related
          engagements range from technology assessments to
          implementations and migrations, quick-starts, health-checks,
          knowledge-transfer workshops, and more, all tailored to
          specific environments and goals.

          Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE), advanced level Certificates of
          Expertise, and Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA).

          highly-acclaimed production support as part of every Red Hat

             services such as Technical Account Managers (TAMs) and
            Developer Support packages.
</p>

<p id="p_20">16.      The plaintiff has also given the statement of global revenue for
the fiscal years 2002 to 2010 from the extensive sale of its high
quality products and services provided under its world-renowned
brand RED HAT. The same is reproduced here as below:
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">           Fiscal Period                    Total Revenue in US$

                   2002                          $78 Million

</pre><p id="p_21">17.      As regards the plaintiff‟s operation in India, admittedly M/s Red
Hat India (Pvt.) Ltd. formed as a joint venture between the plaintiff
and Clover Technologies, India which was incorporated on 5th July,
2008 and now is a wholly owned subsidiary of Red Hat, Inc.               The
plaintiff opened its first office in the city of Pune in the year 2000.
The plaintiff has a distribution network of over 50 channel partners
spanning 20 cities across India. The key distributors of the plaintiff‟s
software include GT Enterprises, Ingram Micro India and Integra
Microsystems.         The plaintiff‟s Red Hat Learning Services are also
available with over 110 training partners at over 500 locations across
India.

<p id="p_22">18.      The scanned copy of the comparative representation of the
plaintiff and the defendants‟ logo are reproduced here as below:

<p id="p_23">I.A. No.10679/2011 in CS(OS) No.1654/2011                   Page No.7 of 27
</p><p id="p_24"> 19.    The main contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff is
that the defendants‟ adoption and use of the offending marks
constitutes trade mark infringement and passing off which are
virtually identical to the plaintiff‟s well-known registered trade mark.
The defendants‟ activities are in relation to the same services and
their sole intention is to represent the plaintiff‟s trade mark in order to
deceive and cause confusion to mislead the members of the trading
and consuming public.             Therefore, the injunction is sought by the
plaintiff against the defendants.
</p>

<p id="p_25">I.A. No.10679/2011 in CS(OS) No.1654/2011                      Page No.8 of 27
</p><p id="p_26"> 20.    The defendants have not denied the fact that they have been
using the trade mark RED HAT. They have also been using the mark
RED HAT as part of the corporate name of defendant No.5 and the cap
device.      The main contention of the defendants in their written
statement is that since the business activities of the defendants are
different to that of the plaintiff, therefore, the plaintiff cannot be
granted protection to the words RED HAT. Secondly, the cap device
used by the defendants is dissimilar with the SHADOWMAN device
used by the plaintiff, and they are carrying on business for the last
number of years and particularly name of the company which was
incorporated in the year 2004, therefore, the defendants are entitled
to use the same.
</p>
<p id="p_27">21.    Mr. Lall, learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that the
trade mark RED HAT is duly registered in favour of the plaintiff in
respect of various classes of goods. The business of the defendants,
i.e. hardware maintenance &amp; service and software maintenance &amp;
service which are also provided by the plaintiff and at the time they
are also carrying on their business of all kinds of hardware and
software production support including of consulting, training and
subscription &amp; developing support packages which are same and
allied and interrelated as that of the plaintiff‟s business and services.
Secondly, the plaintiff has a residual reputation for the said trade
mark along with the device of SHADOWMAN not only in India but in
the overseas countries. He further submits that the defendants have
not denied the fact that the plaintiff is using the trade mark as well as
the device prior to the defendants. They have also admitted that both
the trademark RED HAT and SHADOWMAN device are duly registered
in many countries of the world including India, thus, the case of
infringement of trademark and passing off is made out.            He has
further argued in view of using the mark RED HAT as dominant part of


I.A. No.10679/2011 in CS(OS) No.1654/2011                 Page No.9 of 27
 corporate name, under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1206371/" id="a_3">Section 29(5)</a> of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999, the action of the defendants is amounting to
infringement of registered trade mark of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_28">22.    As regards the business activities of both the parties, the
learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that those are almost the
same.        He has denied the contention of the defendants that the
business activities of the defendants are different than the plaintiff.
He argued that even otherwise, the trademark of the plaintiff is
protected      with    regard      to   dissimilar    goods   of    business     under
<a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_4">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act in view of the reputed mark RED HAT of the
plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_29">23.    Mr. Lall has also argued that the overseas user of the plaintiff
has also to be taken into consideration in this country in view of the
settled law. He referred the decision of the case of <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_5">N.R. Dongre and
others vs. Whirlpool Corporation and others</a>, reported in AIR
1995 Delhi 300 whereby the findings of the Division Bench were
confirmed by the Apex Court. Thus, he submits that the defendants
have     miserably       failed    to       assign   any   reason   for   using     the
trademark/trade name RED HAT along with the cap device which is
similar to the device of SHADOWMAN of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_30">24.    After having considered the submissions of the learned counsels
for both the parties, I am of the view that the following points are to
be considered while deciding the pending application of the plaintiff
under Order XXXIX, Rules 1 &amp; 2 CPC being I.A. No.10679/2011:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (i)     Whether by use of the mark RED HAT as a trade mark or
               part of corporate name amounts to infringement of the
               plaintiff‟s trade mark?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       (ii)    Whether the defendants are passing                          off    their
               business/services as that of the plaintiff?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       (iii)   Whether the cap device used by the defendants is similar
               to the plaintiff‟s SHADOWMAN device?

trademark is infringed by a person who not being a registered
proprietor, uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical or
deceptively similar in relation to the goods or services which are
identical or similar to that in respect of which the trademark is
registered without the permission of the trademark owner.

trademarks and enjoy either high level of distinctiveness or the marks
which are inherently distinctive in nature or has become distinctive
due to their repute; the use of which will cause detrimental to the
distinctive character and repute of the trademark only when the

of trade mark, the plaintiff has to show that the essential features of
the registered trade mark which has been adopted by the defendant
has been taken out from the plaintiff‟s registration. Only the marks
are to be compared by the Court and in case the registration is
granted in favour of the plaintiff, he acquires valuable right by reason
of the said registration. The following are the judgments which are

defendants as well as part of their corporate name, it is clear that
prima-facie, the plaintiff has been able to make out a strong case for
infringement of the trade mark, as the plaintiff has been able to
satisfy the Court on producing of documents that the trade mark RED
HAT is a well-known trademark and has acquired goodwill and
reputation not only in India but also other parts of the world. Thus, it
is also protected under <a href="/doc/774878/" id="a_22">Section 29(4)</a> of the Act. As the defendants
are using the trade mark RED HAT as part of their corporate name,
they are also guilty of infringement under <a href="/doc/1206371/" id="a_23">Section 29(5)</a> of the Act.

have commenced use of the mark RED HAT since the year 2003 and
when the plaintiff applied for registration of the trade mark in 2000, it
was mentioned as „proposed to be used‟, and the benefit of user
outside India cannot be given to the plaintiff in view of denial of
plaintiff‟s user in India.         The arguments of the defendants in this
regard are also without any cogent reasons and in view of material
and documents available on record. As regards the user in overseas
countries claimed by the plaintiff, the argument of the learned
counsel for the defendants is without any substance in view of law
laid down by the Supreme Court and this Court. Few decisions are

                       goods in a foreign country, provided the foreign
                       mark has not been used at all in Australia at the

                       position is different if at that dale the mark has
                       become identified with the goods of the foreign

                       that trader is a foreign trader and the mark has only
                       been used by him in a foreign country. It therefore

                       identified with and distinctive of the goods of the

                       registrar is entitled to refuse to register the mark for

               Supreme Court of New Zealand, which reversed the
               decision of the Assistant Commissioner. Against the
               decision of the Supreme Court, the Australian company
               appealed to the High Court of New Zealand. The High
               Court while upholding the decision of the Supreme Court
               laid down the test to be applied while deciding whether
               use in New Zealand of the appellant's trade mark was
               likely to deceive or cause confusion when the use of the
               American trade mark in New Zealand was not established,
               but only the awareness through advertisement thereof in
               the concerned New Zealand market of that mark was
               proved. In this connection it was held as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">                       "..........It is the awareness or cognizance of those
                       who are potential buyers in, or otherwise associated
                       with the relevant New Zealand market that is
                       material. If there is a likelihood that they will be
                       deceived or confused as to the origin of goods
                       covered by the applicant's mark, it matters not how
                       they gained the knowledge that gives rise to that
                       deception or confusion."</blockquote>

<p id="p_70">                       ".........But in my view it is-a fair inference from the
                       evidence that many New Zealand poultry men with
                       an interest in improving breeding stocks in New
                       Zealand read overseas magazines to expand their
                       knowledge and that New Zealand poultry men
                       sufficiently interested to subscribe for overseas
                       periodicals had an interest in reading about
                       overseas developments in breeding stock. Not all
                       readers would have read all advertisements in all
                       issues. Having regard to the evidence that the
                       poultry men specifically referred to associated the

I.A. No.10679/2011 in CS(OS) No.1654/2011                       Page No.19 of 27
                        trade mark HY-LINE with HY-LINE Poultry Farms from
                       reading literature on poultry matters, I think it
                       probable, as did Cooke, J., that many of the other
                       New Zealand subscribers to the journals would have
                       read many of the advertisements in those trade
                       magazines."
</p><p id="p_71">               23. Thus a product und its trade name transcends the
               physical boundaries of a geographical region and acquires
               a transborder or overseas or extraterritorial reputation not
               only though import of goods but also by its advertisement.
               The knowledge and the awareness of the goods of a
               foreign trade &amp; its trade mark can be available at a place
               where goods are not being marketed and consequently
               not being used. The manner in which or the source from
               which the knowledge has been acquired is immaterial."
</p>

<p id="p_72">       For the aforesaid reasons, and in view of settled law, prima-
facie, case of infringement of trade mark is made out.

                      The plaintiff must prove that the disputed name,
               mark, sign or get up has become distinctive of his goods
               in the sense that by the use of his name or mark, etc in
               relation to goods they are regarded, by a substantial
               number of members of the public or in the trade, as
               coming from a particular source, known or unknown; it is
               not necessary that the name of the plaintiff's firm should
               be known.....The plaintiff must further prove that the
               defendant's use of name or mark was likely or calculated
               to deceive, and thus cause confusion and injury, actual or
               probable, to the goodwill and the plaintiff's business, as
               for example, by depriving him of the profit that he might
               have had by selling the goods which ex hypothesi, the
               purchaser intended to buy. Thus, the cause of action
               involves a combination of distinctiveness of the plaintiff's
               name or mark and an injurious use by the defendant of
               the name or mark or a similar name or mark, sign, picture

               substance a question of evidence; the question whether
               the matter complained of is likely to deceive is a question
               for the Court."

10 of which reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">               "The law does not permit any one to carry on his business

               someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does
               not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently
               or otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair
               play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of
               business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to
               adopt a name in connection with his business or services
               which already belongs to someone else it results in
               confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers

for a newspaper, held that permitted the appellant to use this mark
would amount to encouraging the appellant to practice fraud on the
consumer. The Court held that honesty and fair play ought to be the
basis of the policies in the world of trade and business.     The Court
further held that in such situations it is the bounden duty and
obligation of the Court not only to protect the goodwill and reputation
of the respondent company but also to protect the interest of the

with the name of Mr. Thomas Bata, a native of Czechoslovakia who
started his business in India making shoes and rubber products. The
Court enjoined the use of the word BATAFOAM on foam products and
held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">               ".....I am of the opinion that the user of name „Bata‟ to

               recollection‟ that it is a product of the plaintiff. It is this
               impression which may ultimately cause damage to the

case of passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_85">Delay

</p><p id="p_86">40.      Lastly, the learned counsel for the defendants has argued that
there is a delay on the part of the plaintiff in bringing the action
before this court.         Let me mention here that no clear and cogent
evidence, i.e. by way of advertisement in the newspaper has been
produced by the defendants regarding user claimed which may
indicate that the plaintiff was aware about user of the defendants as
claimed. No separate sale and advertisement figures have been filed
bearing the mark RED HAT so as advertisement material. Thereofre,
in view of settled law, the benefit of user as claimed by the
defendants cannot be granted even otherwise, in an action for
infringement user, if any, which is deliberate the dishonest, is not
fatal.

                       infringement either of Trade Mark or of Copyright
                       normally an injunction must follow. Mere delay in
                       bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of
                       injunction in such cases. The grant of injunction also
                       becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the
                       adoption of the Mark was itself dishonest."

                       counsel for the respondents had urged that the
                       delay is fatal to the grant of an injunction. We are
                       not so satisfied. A delay in the matter of seeking an
                       injunction may be aground for refusing an injunction
                       in certain circumstances. In the present case, we
                       are dealing with a statutory right based on the

                       We do not think statutory rights can be lost by
                       delay. The effect of a registered mark is so clearly
                       defined in the statute as to be not capable of being
                       misunderstood. Even if there is some delay, the
                       exclusive right cannot be lost. The registered mark

<p id="p_93">43.    It also appears from record that in the present case as and
when the plaintiff came to know about the defendants‟ activities
about the use of the mark RED HAT, the plaintiff has been issuing the
legal notices requesting the defendants not to violate its rights.
Copies of such notices issued by the plaintiff are placed on record for
the period 2008, 2009 and 2010. On the other hand, it appears that
despite of receiving the notices, the defendants expanded its business
under the said name as per the case of the plaintiff. Therefore, this
Court is of the view that any user made by the defendants knowingly
of the trade mark of the plaintiff was not honest, as the same was
within the knowledge of the defendants. The question of delay and
acquiescence has no relevance after issuing of notice to the
defendants by the plaintiff as thereafter the defendants were using
the trade mark at their own cost and risk if it establishes that they
were infringing the rights of the plaintiff.

passed in the matter restraining thereby the defendants from using
the trade mark RED HAT with a device which is similar to the
plaintiff‟s SHADOWMAN device, there is a material on record to show,

 though the plaintiff‟s two applications under Order XXXIX, Rule 2A
CPC is pending. This Court is, therefore, not expressing any opinion in
this regard at this stage as the said applications have to be decided
as per their own merit.

<p id="p_95">45.      In view of the over-all facts and circumstances of the case as
well as the conduct of the defendants, it appears that the plaintiff has
been able to make out a strong prima-facie case for the grant of an
interim injunction.         The plaintiff‟s application is, therefore, allowed
with costs.        Accordingly, till the final disposal of the suit, the
defendants, their agents, employees, franchisees, representatives and
all other persons acting on their behalf are restrained from using the
trade mark RED HAT with the device of cap similar to the plaintiff‟s
SHADOWMAN device as well as the mark RED HAT as their corporate
name or any other trade mark and device which are either identical
with or deceptively similar to the plaintiff‟s trade mark/trade name
RED HAT and the plaintiff‟s SHADOWMAN device. As far as the mark
RED HAT as part of corporate name of defendant No.5 is concerned,
the defendants are granted time up to 31st December, 2012 to change
or amend the name by deleting the mark RED HAT.
