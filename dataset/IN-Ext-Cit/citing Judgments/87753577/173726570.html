<p id="p_1">                                   DATE :- 26th February, 2019


Per Court:
</p>
<p id="p_2">1              The Petitioners are aggrieved by the order dated January,

2018 (the date on which the order is passed is not mentioned) passed by

the Additional Commissioner, Nashik under Section 257 of the

Maharashtra Land Revenue Code.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2              The learned AGP points out that the Honourable Supreme

Court has delivered the judgment in the matter of <a href="/doc/87753577/" id="a_1">Gurudassing

Nawoosing Panjwani vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a>, 2016 (2)

SCC 213 : 2015 (6) Mh.L.J. 915, concluding that a statutory second

revision under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code would

be maintainable before the State.</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_4">      of the said judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court, the Petitioners

      would avail of the statutory remedy and would prefer the revision within

      four weeks from today. However, the time spent by the Petitioners in this

      Court may be condoned as they would prefer the revision within four

      weeks from today.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4              In view of the above, this Writ Petition is disposed off.

      5              Needless to state, the Petitioners are at liberty to avail of a

      statutory remedy by preferring a second revision. If such revision is filed

      within four weeks, the time spent by the Petitioners in this Court from

      13.04.2018 until four weeks from today, would be a good ground for

      condonation of delay. All contentions of the litigating sides are kept open.
