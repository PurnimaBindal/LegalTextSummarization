<p id="p_3">     2. The case of the prosecution as testified by Pws.1 to 19

before the lower court in brief is this:- PW.1 is the husband of

deceased Mary @ Mamy. They were residing in House No.8/461

in Erappanthottil of Koorachundu panchayat.            PW.1 is an

agriculturist and is the president of the local Rubber Board.    On

January 4, 2003, in the evening he went to Erappanthode where

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05        Page numbers

he was constructing a house. At about 7 - 7.30 p.m. he went to

the nearby toddy shop and bought a bottle of toddy.           The

accused is a distant relative of PW.1. He used to visit the house

of PW.1.        In the toddy shop the accused was present. The

accused had previously borrowed Rs.10000/- from PW.1 which he

did not repay. The accused asked for a loan of Rs.500/-. PW.1

replied that he has no money with him.       The accused insisted

for the amount. PW.1 told him that he will consider his request.

Thereafter he did not see the accused.        At about 8.30 p.m.

PW.1 left the toddy shop and reached his house at about 8.45

p.m.    There was electric light in the verandah and in the house.

He did not see his wife.    Therefore he went to the kitchen.  He

found his wife lying naked in a pool of blood.   He was shocked.

He then went outside and informed his younger brother who is

residing nearby.      His younger brother and wife reached the

scene of occurrence. PW.1 informed the neighbours.       According

to PW.1 his wife used to wear a gold chain, two bangles and ear

studs. The chain was found missing.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      3.   At about 11.30 p.m. PW.1 went to the Koorachundu

Police Station and complained. PW.18, the then Sub Inspector

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05        Page numbers

of Police, Koorachundu Police Station, recorded the statement of

PW.1, Ext.P1, and registered the case as Crime No.1/2003 under

sec.302 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a>.      Ext.P1(a) is the FIR. PW.19, the then Circle

Inspector of Police, Perambra, took over the investigation.    He

prepared the inquest report Ext.P3 at 11.30 a.m. on 5.1.2003

and seized Mos.1 to 3, 5 and 6.     Mos. 1 to 3 are the dresses of

the deceased and MO.6 is a piece of wood found at the scene of

incident.     PW.19 sent the dead body for autopsy to the Medical

College, Kozhikode.    PW.15 the then Asst. Professor and Deputy

Police     Surgeon,   Medical   College,  Kozhikode,    conducted

postmortem on the dead body of the deceased and issued Ext.P7

postmortem certificate. There were 20 ante-mortem injuries on

the dead body of which injury No.14 was fatal.     He has opined

that the deceased died due to the cumulative effects of the

injuries on the neck.    PW.19 arrested the accused at 2.10 p.m.

on January 6, 2003.      Ext.P11 is the arrest memo.    Ext.P12 is

the remand report.     On the basis of the statement given by the

accused, PW.19 recovered Mos.7 and 8, the shirt and lungi of the

accused, as per seizure mahazar Ext.P6. He also recovered MO.1

gold chain of the deceased by seizure mahazar Ext.P13(a) on the

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05        Page numbers

basis of the information given by the accused.      Ext.P18 is the

report of the chemical analyst which shows that there were blood

stains on the seized articles i.e. M.Os.1 to 8.      Ext.P8 is the

sketch of the scene of incident prepared by PW.16, the then

Village Assistant of Koorachundu village. Ext.P9 is the ownership

certificate of the house of PW.1 issued by PW.16.            After

completion of investigation PW.19 laid the charge before the

committal      court, Judicial First    Class Magistrate  Court-I,

Perambra.
</p>
<p id="p_5">      4.   On appearance before the committal court, copies of

documents relied on by the prosecution were furnished to the

accused. As the offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a> of IPC is exclusively

triable by the court of Sessions, the case was committed to the

Sessions Court, Kozhikode from where it was made over to the

trial court. On appearance before the trial court, the accused

pleaded not guilty to the charge under secs.449, 302, 392 and

397 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_7">IPC</a>. Pws.1 to 19 were examined and Exts.P1 to P20 were

marked and Mos.1 to 9 were produced by the prosecution before

the lower court. When questioned under sec.313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_8">Cr.P.C</a>. by the

Sessions Judge, he pleaded innocence.       Exts.D1, D1(a) and D2

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05        Page numbers

were marked by the accused. The lower court on an appreciation

of evidence found that the prosecution has succeeded in proving

that it was the accused who committed the murder of the

deceased and found him guilty of the offence punishable under

secs.302, 449, 392 and 397 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a>, convicted him thereunder

and sentenced him as aforesaid.      The accused has now come up

in appeal challenging his conviction and sentence.

</p><p id="p_6">      5. Arguing the appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted

that the circumstances relied on by the prosecution are very

weak and do not in any way connect the accused with the crime

and that the lower court is not justified in convicting the accused.

The Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, would support the

judgment of the lower court.

</p><p id="p_16">      8.    The above position has been reiterated by the Apex

Court in <a href="/doc/883109/" id="a_25">Syed Hakkim and Another v. State</a> represented by

Deputy Superintendent of Police, Karur District, Tamil

Nadu ( 2009(4) Supreme Court Cases 324). In the light of the

principles laid down in the above decisions, we shall discuss the

evidence in this case and consider whether the circumstances

highlighted by the prosecution satisfy the tests mentioned above.

PW.1 is the husband of the accused. He is an agriculturist and

is the president of the local rubber board.      On the date of the

incident    he went to Erappanthode where he was constructing a

house. At about 7 - 7.30 p.m. he went to the nearby toddy shop

and bought a bottle of toddy.       The accused is a distant relative

of PW.1.       The accused had     borrowed Rs.10000/- from PW.1

which he did not repay. The accused           demanded a loan of

Rs.500/-. PW.1 stated that he has no money with him.             The

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05        Page numbers

accused insisted for the amount. PW.1 told him that he will

consider his request.      Thereafter he did not see the accused.

At about 8.30 p.m. PW.1 went to his house and reached there at

about 8.45 p.m.      There was electric light in the house. He did

not see his wife.     Therefore he went to the kitchen and found

his wife lying naked in a pool of blood.     He was shocked.    He

then went outside and informed his younger brother who is

residing nearby.        His younger brother and his wife, PW.2,

rushed to the scene of incident. PW.1 informed the neighbours.

According to PW.1 his wife used to wear a gold chain, two

bangles and       ear studs.  The chain was found missing. PW.1

identified Mos.1 to 3, dresses of his wife.    At about 11.30 p.m.

he went to the police station and complained.       MO.4 gold chain

seized by the police at the instance of the accused was also

identified by him.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      9.     In cross-examination nothing      was brought out to

discredit his evidence. Further, it was not even suggested in the

cross examination that he has any enmity towards the accused.

Therefore the lower court is perfectly justified in believing his

evidence.     The evidence of PW.1 proves that at about 8.30 p.m.

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05         Page numbers

on the date of the incident PW.1 met the accused at the nearby

toddy shop and the accused was in need of money.

</p><p id="p_18">      10.    PW.2 is the wife of the younger brother of PW.1. She

is residing near the house of PW.1.        PW.2 would say that on

hearing the cry of PW.1 she rushed to the scene of incident at

about 8.45 - 9 p.m. and found the deceased lying naked in a pool

of blood.     She further stated that after some time she had seen

the accused, that there were blood stains on his shirt and the

accused was found perplexed and restless.            She has also

identified the dress of the accused, Mos.7 and 8.         She has

absolutely no enmity towards the accused. Further, the defence

counsel was not able to shake her evidence in cross-examination.

Therefore the lower court is right in believing her evidence.  The

counsel for the accused/appellant would argue that PW.2 did not

mention about the blood stains on the shirt of the accused to

police and that therefore the above version of her cannot be

believed.      We are unable to agree.     There is no rule of law,

which says something stated by the witness in court, but not

stated before police should be taken as untrue. Normally, courts

may look for corroboration for the new facts, so introduced.

</p><p id="p_19">Crl.Appeal No.1621/05       Page numbers

Chemical analyst has found blood stains on the shirt of the

accused which probabilises the version of PW.2 about having

seen blood stains on the shirt of the accused. The accused has

no explanation to offer.   Therefore the lower court is justified in

believing the evidence of P.W.2.
</p>
<p id="p_20">      11. PW.3 is a businessman. He knows the accused.          He

would say that the accused had visited his shop at about 7 - 7.30

p.m. on the date of the incident and bought a betel nut from his

shop. PW.4 is also a businessman and he is having a provision

store in the market. According to him, on 4.1.2003 at about 7 -

7.30 p.m. the accused purchased 2 kgs. of maida from his shop.

PW.4 gave the maida in a plastic cover and also an additional

plastic cover to the accused as requested by him.       PW.5 is a

rubber tapper. He would say that he used to walk through the

pathway near the house of PW.1.          At about 8.15 p.m. on

4.1.2003 he had seen a packet of maida kept near the house of

PW.1.      According to him he had seen a person standing in the

verandah of the house of PW.1, but could not identify him. PW.6

is the postman of Erappanthode. He would say that on the date

of the incident at about 8 p.m. when he had gone through the

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05       Page numbers

way in front of the house of PW.1, he had seen a packet of maida

kept near the house of PW.1.       PW.7 is a cleaner working in a

jeep.    On 4.1.2003 at about 4 p.m. he reached Erappanthode

and returned at 9 p.m.    While he was walking along the way in

front of the house of PW.1, he had seen the accused there.

PW.7 was having a candle with him.      Though the accused asked

for a candle, PW.7 did not give it to him.     Though PW.7 was

declared hostile by the Public Prosecutor with the permission of

the court, to a certain extent he supported the prosecution case.

The evidence of the above witnesses are not seriously challenged

in cross-examination. Their evidence shows that on the date of

the incident, in the night the accused was found near the house

of PW.1.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      12. PW.8 is a person residing on the northern side of the

house of PW.1.        He would say that at about 8.45 p.m. the

accused jumped over the gate and asked PW.8 some water to

wash his hands, that the accused washed his hands with water

and asked for a candle which PW.8 gave and that thereafter the

accused left the place. PW.8 has also attested the inquest report

Ext.P3. Nothing was brought out during his cross-examination to

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05      Page numbers

discredit his evidence. He has no enmity towards the accused to

testify against him. According to the prosecution, the accused

came to the house of PW.8 after committing the crime, which is

probabilised by the evidence of PW8. PW.9 has testified that he

had seen the accused in the house of PW.1 at about 10 p.m. and

that PW.2 expressed suspicion about him, and that he went along

with PW.1 to the police station to complain. The evidence of

PW.9, who is a neighbour of PW1, supports the case of PW.2 that

immediately after the incident the accused was found in the

house of PW.1 and PW.2 has expressed suspicion about him to

PW.9. PW.10 is the daughter-in-law of PW.1.     She would say

that when she went to the house of PW.1, MO.4 was missing

from the dead body of the deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      13. Pws.11 and 12 are the attesters to the seizure

mahazar Ext.P5, regarding the seizure of MO4 gold chain, on the

basis of the information given by the accused to PW19 the

Investigating Officer. MO4 gold chain was kept under the soil

near a coconut tree at Kavil Paramba. It was covered by a

newspaper. PW13 is the Goldsmith who weighed MO4 gold chain.

PWs.11 to 13 testified that the accused himself took MO4 and

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05           Page numbers

handed over the same to PW19. Nothing was brought out to

suspect their credibility. They have absolutely no enmity towards

the accused. Further, their evidence is supported by PW19 the

Circle Inspector who conducted the investigation. Therefore, the

trial court is justified in believing their evidence. MO4 is identified

by PW1, as the gold chain worn by the deceased at the time of

her death, which was found missing. Evidence of PWs.11 to 13

and 19 prove beyond doubt the recovery of MO4 gold chain,

worn by the deceased immediately prior to her death. PW14 is an

attester to Ext.P6 seizure of MOs.7 and 8, the dress of the

accused, worn by him at the time of the incident. He stated that

PW19 brought the accused and that the accused took MOs.7 and

8 from the varanda of the house of the accused and handed over

the same to PW19 Investigating Officer. Therefore, the lower

court is right in believing his evidence regarding the recovery of

MOs.7 and 8.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       14. PW15 is the doctor who conducted postmortem on the

dead body and prepared the report Ext.P7. PW16 is the Village

Assistant of Koorachundu Village who prepared Ext.P8 the plan of

scene of incident, the correctness of which is not disputed by the

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05       Page numbers

accused. PW17 is the Secretary of Perambra Grama Panchayat

who issued Ext.P9 ownership certificate, which showed that the

house belongs to PW1. PW18 is the Sub Inspector of Police,

Koorachundu Police Station who recorded Ext.P1 FIS and

registered the case. Ext.P1 (a) is the F.I.R.

</p><p id="p_24">       15. PW19 is the Investigating Officer who conducted the

investigation in this case. He prepared Ext.P3 inquest report in

the presence of the witnesses. He recovered MOs.1 to 3 and 5

series and 6 as per seizure mahazar Ext.P5.          He testified

regarding the recovery of MOs. 4, 7 and 8 on the basis of the

information given by the accused. The relevant portion of the

statement of the accused is marked Exts.P13 and P13(a).

Nothing was brought out in his cross-examination to discredit his

evidence. No serious flaw was pointed out in his investigation. His

evidence shows that MOs.7 and 8 were recovered on the basis of

the information given by the accused. His evidence is supported

by PWs.11 to 14. Therefore, the lower court is justified in

believing his evidence regarding the recovery of MOs.4 to 8 on

the basis of the information given by the accused.

</p><p id="p_25">       16. The evidence discussed above shows that the

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05       Page numbers

prosecution relies on the following circumstances to establish the

guilt of the accused:- MO4 the gold chain of the deceased and

MOs.7 and 8 the dress of the accused were recovered by PW19

on the basis of the information given by the accused, which is

proved by the evidence of Pws.11 to 14 and 19. The blood stains

were found on MOs.4, 7 and 8, which is not explained by the

accused. At the time of the incident the deceased was alone in

the house. The accused was a frequent visitor to the house of the

deceased and he is known to the deceased. He was in need of

money immediately prior to the incident as spoken to by PW1. On

the date of incident at about 7 - 7.30 P.M. the accused purchased

betel nut from the shop of PW3 and purchased "myda" from the

shop of PW4. At about 8.15 P.M. Pws.5 and 6 found a packet of

"Myda" near the house of PW1. PW6 has seen a person standing

at the varandah of the house of PW1 at about 8.15 P.M. on that

day. PW17 has seen the accused in front of the house of PW1 at

about 9 P.M. At about 8.45 P.M. the accused has gone to the

house of PW8 with a request for water to wash his hands.

Immediately after the incident PW2 had seen the accused with

blood stains on the shirt in the house of PW1.He was seen

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05       Page numbers

perplexed and PW2 expressed suspicion about the accused to

PW9. The accused has failed to explain about the possession of

MO4 and blood stains on MOs. 4,7 and 8. Cumulative effect of the

above proved circumstances pointed above, in my view, bring

home the guilt of the accused and negate the innocence of the

accused.
</p>
<p id="p_26">       17. There is also another aspect. The accused in his

defence statement denied the entire facts and contended that

PW1 might have murdered the deceased. There is absolutely no

evidence to show that PW1 has any enmity towards the deceased

or PW1 has special motive to implicate the accused. The Apex

Court has held in <a href="/doc/434509/" id="a_26">Antony D'Scuza and others V. State of

Karnataka</a> (AIR 2003 SC 258) that when the accused has filed

a statement suppressing the established facts and set up a false

story, which could be counted as providing missing link for

completing the chain of circumstance. Therefore, in my view the

above proved circumstances satisfy the tests laid down by the

Supreme Court in the above cited decisions and establish the

guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and the same are

consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05          Page numbers

innocence.
</p>
<p id="p_27">       18. Counsel for the appellant argued that motive in this

case is not proved which is fatal to the case of the prosecution.

There is no substance in the above contention. The evidence of

PW1 shows that prior to the incident the accused was in need of

money. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is absence of

motive in this case. That apart, the Apex Court has in <a href="/doc/1921942/" id="a_27">Krishna

Pillai Sree Kumar and another v. State of Kerala</a> (AIR 1981

Supreme Court 1237) observed thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">                "It is not a sine qua non for the success of

       the prosecution that the motive must be proved.

       So long as the other evidence remains convincing

       and is not open to reasonable doubt, a conviction

       may well be based on it."</blockquote><p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">       19. The above principle has been reiterated by the

Supreme Court in several subsequent decisions which is also

followed by another Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/39981098/" id="a_28">State of

Kerala and another v. Balu</a> ( 2008(3) KHC 915).               In the

present case, there are materials on record which unerringly

point to the guilty of the accused.         Therefore, no inference

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05      Page numbers

adverse to the prosecution can be drawn though there is

weakness in supplying evidence regarding motive.

</p><p id="p_30">      20. It was next submitted by the counsel for the appellant

that FIR in this case is not registered at the time and place

mentioned therein and it was ante-timed.       In support of his

contention, he points out some corrections in the FIR about the

date of occurrence. Only in one place in FIR the date is corrected

from 3 to 4. But in the FI statement and in other places in FIR

date is correctly shown.    Even according to the accused, he

accompanied PW1 to police station on the date of incident itself.

At that time PW1 has not implicated anybody. FIR reached the

court on the next day itself. Therefore, the above contention of

the appellant cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      21. Counsel for the appellant next argued that there were

two burn injuries found on the deceased which were not

explained which cast serious doubt regarding the case of the

prosecution. In Ext.P7 postmortem report, those burn injuries

are shown as injury Nos. 11 and 12. Those are superficial burns.

In my view mere absence of explanation regarding the said injury

does not affect the case of the prosecution.        Injury No.14

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05       Page numbers

mentioned in Ext.P7 is the fatal injury which caused the death.

That apart, the incident occurred in the kitchen. Therefore the

deceased sustaining such injuries from kitchen cannot be ruled

out.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      22. The counsel for the appellant next argued that

prosecution has not proved that the blood stains found on Mos 4,

7 and 8 are that of the deceased which cast serious doubt about

the truth of the case of the prosecution. I am unable to agree.

Mos 4 , 7 and 8 were recovered on the basis of the information

given by the accused. Therefore, he has to explain the blood

stains found therein. He has no case that blood stains found on

Mos 4, 7 and 8 is that of some other person. The Apex court has

held in Sanjay alias <a href="/doc/1027979/" id="a_29">Kaka v. State ( N.C.T. of Delhi</a>) (AIR

2001 SC 979) that failure on the part of the prosecution to prove

the origin of blood stains on the cloths recovered could not

extend any benefit of doubt to the accused. That apart, there is

every reason to suspect that the blood stains found on MO 4, 7

and 8 are that of the deceased. MO4 is the gold chain worn by

the deceased at the time of incident and MO 7 and 8 are the

dress worn by the accused at the time of accident. They were

Crl.Appeal No.1621/05      Page numbers

recovered at the instance of the accused. In the absence of any

explanation on the part of the accused, it has to be held that the

blood stains found on MO 4, 7 and 8 are that of the deceased.

</p><p id="p_33">      23. All these apart, the Apex court has held in several

decisions that the recent and unexplained possession of stolen

property will be taken to be presumptive evidence of charge of

murder as provided under Illustration (a) of <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_30">Sections 114</a> of

Evidence Act. In the present case MO4 was recovered soon after

the murder on the basis of the disclosure statement given by the

accused. It not only proves robbery but also the murder.

</p><p id="p_34">      24. Thus it is seen that the circumstantial evidence in this

case clearly establishes the guilt of the accused beyond

reasonable doubt and that he has committed murder of deceased

as alleged by the prosecution. In addition to that, he has also

committed robbery . For the purpose of committing robbery, he

has trespassed into the house of PW1. Thus he has committed

the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_31">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_32">449</a>, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_33">392</a> read with

397 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_34">IPC</a>. Therefore, we confirm the conviction of the appellant

under the above sections.
</p>

      Point No.2

</pre><p id="p_35">      25. As regards the sentence, he was sentenced to undergo

imprisonment for life under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_35">Section 302</a> of IPC. He was further

sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for eight years under <a href="/doc/1318185/" id="a_36">Section

449</a> of IPC and rigorous imprisonment for seven years under

<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_37">Section 392</a> read with <a href="/doc/1865117/" id="a_38">Section 397</a> of IPC. The sentences were

ordered to run concurrently. In view of the materials placed by

the prosecution and analysed by the trial court and taking into

account the nature of crime committed by the assured, we are

not inclined to reduce the sentence. There is no valid ground for

reducing the sentence as claimed by the appellant.

</p><p id="p_36">      In the result, confirming the conviction and sentence of the

appellant, the appeal is dismissed.</p><pre id="pre_5">
