                            However, the mediation did not bear fruits and accordingly, on 05th
                            December, 2018, the matter was fixed for arguments on the present
                            application. Replies to the application were filed by the defendants on 14 th

<p id="p_5">                            PLAINTIFF &#x27;S SUBMISSIONS
</p><p id="p_6">                            3.        Counsel for the plaintiff made the following submissions:
                            I.        The plaintiff and its group of companies have been manufacturing and
                            marketing, inter alia, energy drinks sold under the trademark &quot;Red Bull&quot;,
                            since the year 1987.
</p><p id="p_7">                            II.       In relation to its product, the plaintiff is using the tagline
                            &quot;VITALIZES BODY AND MIND.&quot; since the year 1987.
                            III.      The aforesaid tagline of the plaintiff has been registered as a
                            trademark in 73 different countries around the world.
                            IV.       In India, the aforesaid tagline was registered by the plaintiff in 2010,
                            with effect from 21st January, 2004 under Class 32.
                            V.        The usage of the aforesaid mark has become a source identifier of the
                            plaintiff&#x27;s products and on account of long and extensive usage, it has
                            acquired distinctiveness in relation to the products of the plaintiff.
                            VI.       Plaintiff enjoys the dominant market share in respect of energy drinks
                            all over the world, including India, as stated in paragraphs 22 and 23 of the
                            plaint.

                             VII. The plaintiff spends enormous amounts on the marketing of its
                            product in relation to the aforesaid tagline of the plaintiff, as stated in
                            paragraphs 27 and 28 of the plaint.
</p><p id="p_9">                            VIII. The defendants launched their energy drink &quot;STING&quot; in India in the
                            year 2017 and adopted the tagline &quot;STIMULATES MIND. ENERGIZES
                            BODY.&quot;, which is deceptively similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s registered tagline.
                            IX.   The words &quot;BODY&quot; and &quot;MIND&quot; have been copied by the
                            defendants, whereas the words &quot;STIMULATES&quot; and &quot;ENERGIZES&quot; are
                            both synonyms of the term &quot;VITALIZES&quot; used by the plaintiff. Therefore,
                            the term is conceptually identical to the plaintiff&#x27;s registered mark.
                            X.    The aforesaid tagline has been used by the defendants with mala fide
                            and dishonest intention since the aforesaid tagline is not used by the
                            defendants anywhere else in the world.
</p><p id="p_10">                            XI.   The defendants have adopted the plaintiff&#x27;s tagline to ride upon the
                            goodwill and popularity of the plaintiff&#x27;s tagline, which amounts to
                            infringement as well as passing off.

                             I.     The get up and layout of the cans in which the products of the
                            plaintiff and the defendants are sold is totally different. In this regard,
                            attention of the Court is drawn to page 7 of the written statement, where a
                            comparison has been drawn out between the two products. Therefore, there
                            can be no question of any deception and consequently, no action of passing
                            off can be made out.
</p><p id="p_15">                            II.    In terms of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_4">Section 28</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_5">(Trade Marks
                            Act</a>), exclusive rights in respect of the registered mark can only be claimed
                            if the registration is valid and the same is subject to other provisions of the
                            <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_6">Trade Marks Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_16">                            III.   In respect of the registration granted to the plaintiff for the tagline, the
                            defendants have filed a rectification petition under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_7">Section 124</a> of the Trade
                            Marks Act on the ground that the registration is in contravention of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_8">Section
                            9</a> of the Act.The tagline used by the plaintiff is completely descriptive and
                            therefore, registration ought not to have been granted by the Trademark
                            Registry in terms of <a href="/doc/382675/" id="a_9">Section 9(1)(b)</a> of the Trade Marks Act. Reliance is
                            placed on paragraph 10 of the plaint to contend that the plaintiff itself
                            acknowledges that it is using the aforesaid tagline only in a descriptive
                            manner.
</p><p id="p_17">                            IV.    The defendants sell their drink under the brand name &quot;STING&quot; in
                            respect of which the defendants have obtained registration. However, the
                            tagline is being used by the defendants only in a descriptive manner and
                            therefore, no registration has been sought in respect thereof, as a
                            trademark.Therefore, no case of injunction is made out under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_10">Section 29</a> of
                            the Trade Marks Act.

                             V.     Whether the aforesaid tagline of the plaintiff has acquired secondary
                            meaning on account of long usage, thereby giving it distinctive character, is
                            a matter of trial.
</p><p id="p_19">                            VI.    The registration granted to the plaintiff was objected to by the
                            Registry on the ground that the aforesaid tagline &quot;designates the quality of
                            goods&quot;. No response was filed by the plaintiff to the aforesaid Examination
                            Report of the Registry and therefore, registration ought not to have been
                            granted to the plaintiff in respect of the aforesaid tagline.
                            VII. In view of the fact that the use by the defendants, of the impugned
                            mark, is in a descriptive manner so as to indicate the kind and quality of its
                            product, the defendants are entitled to the benefit of <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_11">Section 30(2)(a)</a> and
                            <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_12">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act. In this regard, reliance is placed on the
                            Division Bench judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/39264970/" id="a_13">Marico Limited v. Agro Tech
                            Foods Limited</a>, 174 (2010) DLT 279 (<a href="/doc/251357/" id="a_14">DB) and Stokley Van Camp, Inc. v.
                            Heinz India Private Limited</a>, 171 (2010) DLT 16.
                            VIII. Attention of this Court is drawn to a Facebook post dated 6th October,
                            2017 by the defendants on their Facebook page to show that the present suit
                            is barred by delay and laches as the product with the impugned mark of the
                            defendants was launched in October, 2017 in India and the present suit has
                            been filed only in August, 2018, after the defendants had established their
                            presence in the Indian energy drinks market.

                             I.      The registered tagline of the plaintiff is not a descriptive mark as it is
                            not descriptive of the characteristics or quality of the energy drink.On the
                            contrary, the aforesaid trademark uses an imaginative phrase.
                            II.     In terms of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_16">Section 31</a> of the Trade Marks Act, registration of a mark
                            is prima facie evidence of its validity. Unless the defendants are able to
                            demonstrate that the ground of registration was perverse, at a prima facie
                            stage, the registration has to be assumed to be valid.
                            III.    The plaintiff had filed an affidavit dated 18th May, 2004 in response to
                            the Examination Report of the Registry and it was only after considering the
                            same that the registration was granted in favour of the plaintiff.
                            IV.     It is wrong to contend that the defendants are using the impugned
                            mark in a descriptive manner.

                            PASSING OFF
</p><p id="p_26">                            6.      First, I propose to deal with the issue whether a case of passing off
                            has been made out by the plaintiff against the defendants.
</p><p id="p_27">                            7.      The basic premise for passing off is deception caused on account of
                            the defendant attempting to show its goods as that of the plaintiff. The
                            Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_17">Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Siffynet Solutions (P)
                            Ltd</a>., (2004) 6 SCC 145,has held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                   &quot;13. The next question is would the principles of trade mark law
                                   and in particular those relating to passing off apply? An action for
                                   passing off, as the phrase &quot;passing off&quot; itself suggests, is to
                                   restrain the defendant from passing off its goods or services to the
                                   public as that of the plaintiff‟s. It is an action not only to preserve
                                   the reputation of the plaintiff but also to safeguard the public. The

                                  defendant must have sold its goods or offered its services in a
                                 manner which has deceived or would be likely to deceive the
                                 public into thinking that the defendant‟s goods or services are the
                                 plaintiff‟s. The action is normally available to the owner of a
                                 distinctive trademark and the person who, if the word or name is
                                 an invent‟d one, invents and uses it. If two trade rivals claim to
                                 have individually invented the same mark, then the trader who is
                                 able to establish prior user will succeed. The question is, as has
                                 been aptly put, who gets these first? It is not essential for the
                                 plaintiff to prove long user to establish reputation in a passing off
                                 action. It would depend upon the volume of sales and extent of
                                 advertisement.&quot;

<p id="p_28">                            8.    The aforesaid observation of the Supreme Court reflects that the
                            common law remedy of passing off restrains a defendant from riding on the
                            reputation and goodwill earned by a plaintiff, being the prior user/owner of a
                            distinctive mark. The purpose of an action of passing off is to prevent
                            confusion and deception amongst consumers and the public at large.

                            similarity between the two products. The layout of the two cans is totally
                            different. It is to be noted that (i) the brand names of both the aforesaid
                            products, &quot;Red Bull&quot; and &quot;STING&quot; are prominently displayed on the cans;
</p><p id="p_31">                            (ii) the color scheme of the two products is completely different; (iii) the

                            which are subject matter of the present dispute, are used in very small fonts
                            on both the cans in comparison to &quot;Red Bull&quot; and &quot;STING&quot;; and, (v) the
                            colour in which the taglines are written and the backgrounds in which the
                            taglines appear are also completely different.
</p><p id="p_32">                            11.    In light of the above, it is apparent that no confusion or deception

                            products. Therefore, in my prima facie view, no case of passing off is made
                            out.

<p id="p_33">                            INFRINGEMENT

</p><p id="p_34">                            12.    Now, I propose to deal with the plaintiff&#x27;s claim of infringement. The
                            plaintiff&#x27;s case is that it has been using the aforesaid tagline for a long
                            period of time and has spent enormous amounts on its promotion. Therefore,
                            it has acquired a secondary meaning in respect of the plaintiff&#x27;s product.
                            Further, registration has been granted to the plaintiff for the aforesaid tagline
                            not only in India but in various other countries. The defendants have
                            adopted the plaintiff&#x27;s tagline in a malafide manner so as to communicate
                            the same idea. On the other hand, the contention of the defendants is that the
                            tagline used by the plaintiff is descriptive and laudatory in nature. Therefore,
                            no registration could have been granted to the plaintiff in respect of the
                            aforesaid tagline and consequently, the registration granted to the plaintiff

                             has been duly challenged by the defendants. Whether the aforesaid tagline of
                            the plaintiff has acquired secondary meaning on account of long usage can
                            only be established in trial. Furthermore, the defendants are also using their
                            tagline in a descriptive manner and not as a trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                            13.    The law with regard to use of a descriptive word/mark and <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_18">Section
                            30(2)(a)</a> of the Trade Marks Act has been laid down in the case of Marico
                            (supra). The said case relates to a dispute between the plaintiff who was
                            using the trademark &quot;Sundrop&quot; and the defendant who was using the
                            trademark &quot;Saffolla&quot; in respect of identical products i.e., cooking oils. The
                            plaintiff was additionally using the registered trademarks &quot;LOSORB&quot; and
                            &quot;LO-SORB&quot;, whereas the defendant was using the expression &quot;LOW
                            ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot;. The plaintiff objected to the use of the said
                            expression on the ground thatit had registrations in favour of the terms
                            &quot;LOSORB&quot; and &quot;LO-SORB&quot;. After analysing the various provisions of the
                            <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_19">Trade Marks Act</a>, adivision Bench of this Court came to the conclusion that
                            the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; has been used by the
                            defendant in a descriptive manner and therefore, in terms of <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_20">Section 30(2)(a)</a>
                            of the Trade Marks Act, the plaintiff will not be entitled for injunction. The
                            principles of law elucidated by the Division Bench in paragraphs 24 and 25
                            of Marico (supra) are set out below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                  &quot;24. In view of the co-relation between <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_21">Section 28</a> and different
                                  sub-sections of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_22">Section 124</a>, it becomes clear that the entitlement to
                                  claim invalidity of registration on the ground of the expression &quot;if
                                  valid&quot; as found under <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_23">Section 28</a> only arises if the defendant in his
                                  written statement in a suit alleging infringement of a registered
                                  trade mark takes up the plea with respect to registration of trade
                                  mark being &quot;invalid&quot; or has already applied for cancellation of the
                                  registered trade mark before the suit alleging infringement is filed.

                                infringement action in spite of registration of the trade mark where
                                the use of the registered trade mark is in relation to the goods to
                                indicate the kind, quality, intended purpose, etc., or other
                                characteristics of the goods. Therefore there are two stages/tiers of
                                defence in an infringement action. The first is for cancellation of
                                registration in terms of <a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_36">Section 57</a>. If the registration is cancelled
                                obviously nothing will survive in the infringement action. The
                                second tier is that even if the registration is valid there are still
                                valid defences as enunciated in <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_37">Sections 30</a> to <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_38">35</a> of the Act which
                                will disentitle the plaintiff to relief in an action brought for
                                infringement of a registered trade mark.&quot;

                                  of argument only the descriptive word mark in itself) along with
                                  another independent trade mark, yet the use of descriptive words
                                  are to be injuncted against. How can it at all be argued that though
                                  the respondent is in fact shown to be using the disputed word(s)
                                  only with a descriptive intendment, yet, such use should be taken
                                  not in a descriptive manner but as a trade mark. If we permit such
                                  an argument to prevail then what will happen is that what cannot
                                  be directly done will be indirectly done i.e., whereas the appellant
                                  is not entitled to succeed in the infringement action because the
                                  use by the respondent is in furtherance of its statutory rights of
                                  the user of the words which are descriptive of the kind, quality,
                                  intended purpose or characteristic of the goods, yet, merely
                                  because the appellant states that the respondent is using the same
                                  as a trade mark, the same should be taken as infringement of the
                                  trade mark of the appellant. Not only the plaintiff has no
                                  exclusive rights whatsoever to the trade marks because they are
                                  such which fall within the mischief of <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_39">Section 30(2)(a)</a>, the
                                  respondent/defendant is always fully justified and entitled to use
                                  the descriptive words in any and every manner that it so chooses
                                  and pleases to do. If there are no rights of the plaintiff to exclusive
                                  user of the trade mark then where does arise the question of
                                  disentitlement of a defendant to use the trade mark of the appellant
                                  inasmuch as any person who adopts a descriptive word mark does
                                  so at its own peril in that any other person will also be fully entitled
                                  to use the same in view of a specific statutory rights thereto, and
                                  there are various other statutory rights including that under Section

                                30(2)(a)</a> clearly applies in entitling the respondent to use the
                                expression &quot;WITH LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; because
                                that is only a descriptive use by normal English words in the
                                English language indicative of the kind, quality, intended purpose
                                of characteristic of the goods. There is no use of the expression
                                &quot;bona fide&quot; in <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_41">Section 30(2)(a)</a> as is found in <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_42">Section 35</a>, and we do
                                not propose to import in <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_43">Section 30(2)(a)</a> the expression &quot;bona
                                fide&quot; because the subject matters of the two sections i.e. <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_44">Section 32</a>
</p><p id="p_42">                                (a) and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_45">Section 35</a> are though common on certain limited aspects,
                                however the two Sections do in fact operate in separate fields.
                                Also looking at the issue in another way, &quot;bona fide&quot; aspect can
                                in a way be said to be very much included in <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_46">Section 30(2)(a)</a>
                                because the use of words which indicate their relation to the
                                goods for the kind, quality, intended purpose or other
                                characteristics, etc. of the goods, is clearly only a bona fide user
                                of the same and which &quot;bona fideness&quot; does not have to be
                                additionally proved. In fact, there is ordinarily not only no lack of
                                bona fides in using the normal descriptive word, and on the
                                contrary there is in fact mala fides of a plaintiff in adopting
                                otherwise a descriptive word mark and for which adaption there is
                                ordinarily an absolute ground for refusal of registration of the
                                trade mark. There is no mala fides of the respondent as alleged by
                                the appellant because the respondent is using the expression &quot;LOW
                                ABSORB&quot; as part of a sentence in a descriptive manner and the
                                respondent is also prominently using its own trade mark
                                &quot;Sundrop&quot;, an aspect we have repeatedly referred to otherwise in
                                this judgment. Merely because the respondent used &quot;TM&quot; earlier
                                after the expression &quot;LOW ABSORB TECHNOLOGY&quot; is not such
                                as to wipe out statutory rights/defences of the respondent.

                                ought not to be afforded protection as a trade mark.

                                  basis of such user. We find substance in the stand of the respondent
                                  that there is almost no evidence as on record as at this stage
                                  showing user of the mark so as to make the same distinctive as on

                            the present case, registration has been wrongly granted to the plaintiff and
                            the registration application filed on behalf of the plaintiff should have been
                            rejected in terms of <a href="/doc/382675/" id="a_61">Section 9(1)(b)</a> of theTrade Marks Act, as the mark in
                            respect of which registration was sought by the plaintiff was descriptive in
                            nature.
</p><p id="p_62">                            19.   The product of the plaintiff is an energy drink, the purpose of which is
                            to provide energy to the body. The words &quot;VITALIZES&quot; (used in the
                            plaintiff&#x27;s tagline) and &quot;STIMULATES&quot;; &quot;ENERGIZES&quot;(used in the
                            defendant&#x27;s tagline) are synonyms as per the plaintiff&#x27;s own case. In this
                            regard, reference may be made to paragraph 10 of the plaint, which is set out
                            below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                  &quot;10 Prior to 1987, there was no beverage category for „energy
                                  drinks‟. This product category was created by the Plaintiff itself
                                  when it launched its Red Bull Energy Drink in 1987. The launch
                                  of the Red Bull Energy Drink was supported by the mark
                                  VITALIZES BODY AND MIND® which is a mark specifically
                                  coined, created and adopted in order to introduce the concept of
                                  the &#x27;energy drink&#x27; to the consumer with the promise that the Red
                                  Bull Energy Drink will rejuvenate, stimulate and energise the
                                  body as well as the mind.For the last 30 years the Plaintiff has
                                  used the mark extensively to identify its product such that the mark
                                  VITALIZES BODY AND MIND® has acquired a secondary
                                  meaning in order to function as a source identifier of the Plaintiff
                                  and the Plaintiff‟s product alone. The distinctiveness of the mark
                                  VITALIZES BODY AND MIND® is also established by various
                                  facts including but not limited to multiple jurisdictions granting
                                  trade mark registration and protection to the mark VITALIZES
                                  BODY AND MIND® in favour of the Plaintiff.&quot;

</blockquote><p id="p_63">                             20.   The aforesaid paragraph is a clear acknowledgement on behalf of the
                            plaintiff that the aforesaid tagline/mark has been used by the plaintiff in a
                            manner so as to describe the attributes or quality of its drink. A person who
                            consumes the Red Bull energy drink has an assurance that the drink will
                            rejuvenate, stimulate and energize the body as well as the mind. In fact, the
                            aforesaid words &quot;STIMULATES&quot; and &quot;ENERGIZES&quot; have been used by
                            the defendant in its impugned mark. The fact that the plaintiff has used the
                            aforesaid tagline in a descriptive manner is also evidenced by the fact that
                            the tagline appears as a sentence on the can of the plaintiff&#x27;s product,
                            wherein the first word &quot;VITALIZES&quot; has the alphabet &quot;V&quot; in capital letters
                            and the sentence ends with a full stop.
</p><p id="p_64">                            21.   I do not agree with the contention of the plaintiff that the aforesaid
                            tagline of the plaintiff does not have a direct reference to the products of the
                            plaintiff. It may be that the aforesaid tagline could also be used in respect of
                            some of the other products or services, but, in my view, the aforesaid
                            tagline, which is a phrase or an expression, has a direct reference to the
                            quality, intended purpose, values and other characteristics of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                            products.
</p><p id="p_65">                            22.   In this regard, reliance is also placed on the Examination Report dated
                            16th February, 2004 of the Trademark Registry, whereby the Registry had
                            raised objection with regard to the plaintiff&#x27;s mark designating quality of the
                            products. Though it has been contended on behalf of the defendants that the
                            plaintiff did not file any response to the aforesaid objection raised by the
                            Registry, the counsel for the plaintiff has drawn attention of the Court to the
                            affidavit dated 18th May, 2004 filed on behalf of the plaintiff in response to

                            documents filed by the plaintiff).
</p><p id="p_66">                            23.   I have perused the affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff in respect
                            of the examination report of the Registry. Even in the said affidavit, the
                            plaintiff has nowhere claimed that the tagline is not descriptive of the
                            plaintiff&#x27;s products. The entire focus of the aforesaid affidavit is that on
                            account of long usage and extensive amounts spent by the plaintiff towards
                            advertisement, the aforesaid tagline has become distinctive of the goods of
                            the plaintiff. Yet, the Trade Mark Registry proceeded to grant registration to
                            the plaintiff&#x27;s aforesaid tagline.
</p><p id="p_67">                            24.   Objection to the registration has been taken in the written statement
                            by the defendants and a rectification application has also been filed on
                            behalf of the defendants under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_62">Section 124</a> of the Trade Marks Act on the
                            ground that the registration granted in favour of the plaintiff is invalid and
                            the same is pending adjudication.
</p><p id="p_68">                            25.   In view of the above, there is a doubt created over the registration
                            granted in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the aforesaid tagline.While
                            deciding the present application the Court has to take a prima facie view
                            with regard to the validity of the registration of the mark and in my prima
                            facie view, the tagline used by the plaintiff is of descriptive/laudatory
                            character, which ought not to have been granted registration in view of
                            <a href="/doc/382675/" id="a_63">Section 9(1)(b)</a> of the Trade Marks Act.
</p><p id="p_69">                            26.   The use of the impugned tagline by the defendants is also in a
                            descriptive/laudatory manner and not as a trademark. The tagline used by
                            the defendants, &quot;STIMULATES MIND. ENERGIZES BODY.&quot; is a phrase
                            or an expression comprising of four words of the English language that aims

                             to describe the features and quality of its drink. In comparison to the brand
                            name of the defendants&#x27;product, &quot;STING&quot;, which is displayed prominently
                            on the cans, the impugned tagline only appears in a small font. Furthermore,
                            the defendants have not sought any registration in respect of the aforesaid
                            tagline.
</p><p id="p_70">                            27.   Therefore, I do not accept the contention of the plaintiff that the
                            defendants are using the impugned mark in a manner that is likely to be
                            taken as being used as a trademark. Resultantly, no infringement has been
                            committed by the defendants in terms of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_64">Section 29</a> of the Trade Marks Act.
</p><p id="p_71">                            28.   It has been vehemently contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the
                            impugned tagline of the defendants gives the same impression as that of the
                            plaintiff. But, since the products of the plaintiff and defendants are of the
                            same kind, viz. energy drinks, descriptive or laudatory taglines in respect of
                            these products have necessarily to communicate the same idea. Therefore, it
                            cannot be said that the adoption of the impugned mark by the defendants
                            was not bona fide. Resultantly, the defendants would be entitled to the
                            benefit of <a href="/doc/1975560/" id="a_65">Section 30(2)(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_66">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act.
</p><p id="p_72">                            29.   In my prima facie view, the present case is squarely covered by the
                            judgments of the Division Bench in Marico (supra) and Stockely Van
                            Camp, Inc. (supra). The tagline of the plaintiff and the impugned tagline of
                            the defendants are both descriptive in nature and therefore, the plaintiff is
                            not entitled to grant of interim injunction against the defendants.

                            known trademark and has also acquired distinctiveness on account of long
                            and extensive usage and the promotional expenses incurred by the plaintiff.

                            part to the brand name of the plaintiff.This can be determined only at the
                            stage of trial. Therefore, at this prima facie stage, it cannot be said that the
                            tagline of the plaintiff &quot;VITALIZES BODY AND MIND.&quot; has acquired
                            distinctiveness and secondary meaning. This can only be established as a

                                           through sustained use and reputation, that a mere use of
                                           such generic term would immediately signify the plaintiff as
                                           its manufacturer. Therefore, in order to so find, that use of a
                                           descriptive term or a term that is publici juris, amounts to
                                           infringement, the plaintiff must establish that use of the term
                                           has become synonymous with its mark, or that the
                                           reputation of the mark is of such nature that the public is
                                           likely to get confused and would attribute the defendants&#x27;
                                           goods to the plaintiff&#x27;s. The more descriptive the term
                                           employed or alleged to be infringing, higher the standard
                                           of evidence required to establish that term has in fact
                                           acquired secondary meaning and thereby, attained
                                           distinctiveness.</blockquote>

                                        an example: no matter how much use a manufacturer made

                            October/November, 2017 using the impugned mark on their product.
                            Although the present suit was filed in the year 2018, the fact of the matter is
                            that no injunction has been granted in favour of the plaintiff till date, even
                            though the delay may not entirely be attributable to the plaintiff. Even
                            though some of this delay may be attributable to the judicial process and/or
                            the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the undisputed position is that the
                            defendants have been selling their product with the impugned mark for
                            almost five years. One of the factors to be weighed by the Court is whether
                            or not at this stage, an interim injunction should be granted in favour of the
                            plaintiff, restraining the defendants from using the impugned mark. In this
                            regard, it would be apposite to refer to the observations made by the
                            Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_69">Wander Ltd. and Ors. v. Antox India P. Ltd</a>., 1990 Supp

                                  asserted by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both
                                  contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they are
                                  established at the trial on evidence. The court, at this stage, acts
                                  on certain well settled principles of administration of this form
                                  of interlocutory remedy which is both temporary and
                                  discretionary. The object of the interlocutory injunction, it is

                                         uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. The
                                         need for such protection must be weighed against the
                                         corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against
                                         injury resulting from his having been prevented from
                                         exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be

                                  The court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what

                            and   &quot;ALLROUND&quot;         were   not   descriptive   marks.      Further,     the
                            appellants/defendants had themselves obtained registration of the mark
                            &quot;ALL-AROUND PROTECTION&quot; in the United States of America.
</p><p id="p_78">                            34.   In my view, both the aforesaid factors are enough to distinguish the
                            facts of the present case from the aforesaid case. In the present case, I have
                            already arrived at a prima facie view that the taglines used by both the
                            plaintiff and the defendants are descriptive in nature as they describe the
                            qualities/characteristic of their respective products. The Division Bench was
                            of the view that the words            &quot;ALLROUND&quot; and &quot;ALLROUND
                            PROTECTION&quot; are not descriptive of the product toothpaste. The fact that
                            the defendants therein had applied for registration of the expression &quot;ALL-
                            AROUND PROTECTION&quot; in the United States of America was also one of
                            the factors which weighed with the Division Bench in coming to the
                            conclusion that the marks therein were not descriptive.
</p><p id="p_79">                            35.   Though the previous judgments of the Division Bench in Marico
                            (supra) and Stockely Van Camp, Inc. (supra) were noted by the Division
                            Bench in Procter &amp; Gamble Manufacturing (supra), no doubts were
                            expressed on the correctness of the aforesaid judgments. It was only noted
                            that each case depends of its unique facts. I cannot agree more with the
                            findings of the Division Bench that each case turns on its own unique facts
                            and in my view, the facts of the present case are different from the facts of
                            the case before the Division Bench in Procter &amp; Gamble Manufacturing
                            (supra). The facts of the present case are more akin to the case of Stockely
                            Van Camp, Inc. (supra).

                            can be granted. But, the aforesaid judgment was in the context of the
                            synonyms being used as the main trademarks and not in the context of
                            taglines.   Therefore, in my view, the aforesaid judgment would not be
                            applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
</p><p id="p_82">                            37.   Next, the plaintiff has relied upon the judgment in Anil Verma
                            (supra). In the aforesaid judgment, the court held the slogans used by the
                            plaintiff to be imaginative and not descriptive and therefore, granted
                            injunction in favour of the plaintiff. In the present case, I have already held
                            the two competing marks to be descriptive. Therefore, the judgment in Anil
                            Verma (supra) will be of no use to the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_83">                            38.   In light of the aforesaid findings, need is not felt to refer to other
                            judgments filed on behalf of the parties.
</p><p id="p_84">                            39.   In view of the discussion above, the plaintiff has failed to establish a
                            prima facie case in its favour for grant of interim injunction. Both the
                            taglines used by the plaintiff and the defendants are descriptive and
                            laudatory in nature. Whether the aforesaid tagline of the plaintiff has
                            acquired distinctiveness or secondary meaning in respect of the plaintiff&#x27;s
                            products can only be established at the stage of trial.           Balance of
                            convenience is also in favour of the defendants for not granting interim
                            injunction as the products of the defendants have been selling in the market
                            with the impugned tagline for almost five years.          Hence, the present
                            application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the CPC is dismissed.
