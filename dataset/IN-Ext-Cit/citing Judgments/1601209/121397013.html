ORAL JUDGMENT</pre>
 


 


 


	
 


<p id="p_1">	The accused in Sessions
Case No. 197/2001 are applicants herein. The present revision
application is filed challenging the order  dated 13/02/2006 passed
by learned Additional City Sessions Judge, FTC No. 2,  Ahmedabad,
whereby the learned Judge was pleased to allow the application Exh.
97 which was submitted/moved by  the learned Additional Public
Prosecutor to add charge under <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_1">section 34</a>  IPC. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_2">2.	It appears from the
record that the incident had occurred on 7.8.2001. In substance, it
is the say of the injured lady that she was assaulted by three
persons, viz. Mohmedyusuf Adambhai, Abdul Huk and Firoz Basirbhai. It
is also the say of the injured lady that former two accused had iron
pipes with them and the third one had a sword with him.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_3">3.	In said Sessions Case
No. 197/2001, the accused were charged for the offences punishable
under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_2">sections 307</a>, <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_3">324</a>, <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_4">325</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/112749/" id="a_5">114</a> of the Indian Penal Code read
with section 135(1) of the Bombay Police Act. 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_4">4.	The learned Additional
Sessions Judge in the impugned order has observed that reliance
placed by the learned advocate for A/1 on the case of Bhil
Mohanji Ranchhodji v. State of Gujarat, 1991(2) GLR 786 is
misplaced. The trial Court has observed that in the said case it is
laid down that in absence of positive proof as to overact, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_6">section 34</a>
would not be applicable. The trial Court distinguishing the said case
law has observed that defence has set up the defence/case in evidence
on the same line on which  application in question is given  and,
therefore, there is positive evidence as to the applicability of
<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_7">section 34</a> IPC and holding so, the Court was pleased to allow the
application . 
</p>
 


 


 


<p id="p_5">5.	Heard learned advocate
Ms. Aruna Shah for the applicants and learned A.P.P. Mr. K.L.Pandya
for the State.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_6">6.	Learned advocate Ms.
Aruna Shah for the applicants submitted that the learned trial Court
has committed serious error inasmuch as <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_8">section 34</a> was sought to be
added after completion of recording of evidence and after recording
of further statements of the accused. The learned advocate also drew
attention of the Court to the depositions of the injured lady and of
the complainant. It was also submitted that by addition of charge at
this stage of the case, prejudice is likely to be caused to the
accused and, therefore, the learned trial Court ought to have
rejected the application. The learned advocate has placed reliance on
<a href="/doc/1905985/" id="a_9">section 216(3)(4)</a> of Cr.P.C.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_7">7.	Learned A.P.P Mr.
Pandya has supported the order under challenge. 
</p>
 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_8">	At the first instance,
	plea appears as too simple to deserve any serious attention. It is
	in the nature of formal and technical one. But then in many
	instances, cases that have reached upto Apex Court, a plea has been
	raised for acquittal on account of defective charge or omission to
	frame charge. In fact, in <a href="/doc/1347962/" id="a_10">Willie (William) Slaney v. State of
	M.P</a>., AIR 1956 SC 116, this issue came up for consideration
	before five Judges Bench. The constitution Bench was necessitated,
	as it was pointed out that there were inconsistencies, to some
	extent, in Nanakchand v. State of Punjab, AIR 1954 SC 204 and
	<a href="/doc/1140491/" id="a_11">Suraj Pal v. State of U.P</a>., AIR 1955 SC 419. In these two
	last referred cases, charges were framed under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">sections 302</a> &amp;
	<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_13">149</a> of IPC. In Willie (William) Slaney s case
	(supra), charge was framed under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_14">section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_15">section 34</a> IPC.
	There were two accused in that case. Appeal of one of the accused
	came to be heard and disposed of and the said accused was acquitted.
	It was urged on behalf of the other accused that the case against
	him also be held in his favour because the case for offence under
	<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_16">section 34</a> IPC fails, as now he is the sole accused in the case,  
	and there being no charge for <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_17">section 302</a> IPC, simpliciter he may be
	acquitted. While considering this plea of the accused, the Court has
	made material observation as to the importance of the charge. It has
	held as under:-
</p>	 


	
	 


<p id="p_9">	  Is the charge to be
	regarded as a ritualistic formula so sacred and fundamental that a
	total absence on one, or any departure in it from the strict and
	technical requirements<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_18"> of the Code</a>, is so vital as to cut at the
	root of the trial and vitiate if from the start, or is it one of
	many regulations designed to ensure a fair and proper trial so that
	 substantial , as opposed to purely technical, compliance with
	the spirit and requirements<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_19"> of the Code</a> in this behalf is enough to
	cure departures from the strict letter of the law? 
</p>	 


	

 
	 
		  


<p id="p_10">		The Court in that case
		has concluded that the accused can be said to have committed an
		offence punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_20">Section 304</a> Part-II of the Indian Penal
		Code.
</p>		 


		
	

 


<p id="p_11">9.		The learned advocate
for the applicants has objected and has opposed the order under
challenge with all seriousness. It is not possible to agree with the
submission of the learned advocate for the applicants herein. Unlike
charge under <a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_21">section 149</a> of IPC, <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_22">section 34</a> of IPC does not create
any separate offence. In trial for criminal offence, when  more than
one persons are involved in the incident, then normally <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_23">section 34</a>
would stand attracted. In the present case, it is the say of the
prosecution that three persons had assaulted the lady. All the three
persons are identified by names and weapons they had alleged to be
with them at the time of commission of the offence. All these three
persons are referred by name by the injured lady in her evidence.
This material, in my opinion, is sufficient to attract <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_24">section 34</a> of
IPC   for the purpose of framing of charge. The submission of the
learned advocate for the applicants that there is no allegation or
evidence as to the conspiracy between the accused and further
submission that the injured lady had no occasion to see at least one
of the accused, as the said assailant had given blow from behind, 
has hardly any importance or relevance. In order to attract <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_25">section
34</a>, prior conspiracy between the assailants is not necessary to
allege or establish [<a href="/doc/691691/" id="a_26">Hari Om v. State of U.P</a>. 1993(1) Crimes
294(SC)]. It may be stated that criminal conspiracy itself is
distinct offence under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27">IPC</a>. <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_28">Section 34</a> of IPC may be attracted even
in absence of any conspiracy. Conspiracy has no relation with <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_29">section
34</a>   much less dependence on it. In short, the undisputed fact that
charge is framed against three accused persons and allegation of
committing assault is against three accused persons, prima facie
attracts <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_30">section 34</a>. The submission of the learned advocate Ms.Shah
that there is no evidence against all or any of the accused, may help
the accused in regular trial; in other words, in contesting the case
on merits. 
</p>
 


 


 
	  


<p id="p_12">	The submission that
	prejudice is likely to cause to the accused has also no substance,
	for the simple reason that <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_31">section 34</a> itself does not create any
	offence. Further, width of section 464 (Effect of omission, error
	or absence of charge) is such that, if  prosecution successfully
	brings home case against the accused during the course of evidence,
	then absence, mistake or charge being unspecific, would hardly be of
	any consequence in holding the accused to be guilty,-except in very
	exceptional circumstances of the case. Reliance placed on <a href="/doc/1905985/" id="a_32">section
	216(3)(4)</a> Cr.P.C is misplaced. On the contrary, <a href="/doc/1865807/" id="a_33">section 216(3)</a>
	enables the Court to add and alter charge. <a href="/doc/1865807/" id="a_34">Section 216(4)</a> takes care
	of prejudice that may likely to cause to either side. In the present
	case, there is no question of prejudice likely to cause to any one,
	particularly to the applicants/accused. It may be stated that the
	learned trial Judge has observed that defence has set up the case
	bearing in mind the reasons given  in the application in question
	(Exh.97) which was moved by the State. It was not pointed out at the
	time of hearing that how this finding is erroneous, nor it was
	pointed out that how the accused are going to be prejudiced merely
	by adding charge for an offence under <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_35">section 34</a> IPC. General
	submission that framing of charge would cause prejudice to the
	accused is not sufficient.
</p>	 


	
	  


<p id="p_13">	How prejudice is to be
	shown ? Much depends on facts of the case, however, following
	principles laid down in <a href="/doc/1601209/" id="a_36">Main Pal vs. State of Haryana</a>, AIR
	2010 SC 3292 for framing and appreciating charge, does
	provide enough material and clue for the defence to develop his case
	qua charge and it also provides clear answer to GP/APP for defending
	such a plea. The principles enunciated are:
</p>
 
	 


	    
	

 
	 


<p id="p_14">	(i)		The object of
	framing a charge is to enable an accused to have a clear idea of
	what he is being tried for and of the essential facts that he had to
	meet. The charge must also contain the particulars of date, time,
	place and person against whom the offence was committed, as are
	reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with
	which he is charged.
</p>	 


	

 


<p id="p_15">(ii)	The accused is
entitled to know with certainty and accuracy, the exact nature of the
charge against him, and unless he has such knowledge, his defence
will be prejudiced. Where an accused is charged with having committed
offence against one person but on the evidence led, he is convicted
for committing offence against another person, without a charge being
framed in respect of it, the accused will be prejudiced, resulting in
a failure of justice. But there will be no prejudice or failure of
justice where there was an error in the charge and the accused was
aware of the error.
</p> 
	 


	
	 
		 
			 
				 
					 
						 
							 
								 
									 
										 


<p id="p_16">										Such knowledge
										can be inferred from the defence, that is, if the defence
										of the accused showed that he was defending himself against
										the real and actual charge and not the erroneous charge. 
</p>										
									
								
							
							 


							
						
					
				
			
		
	

 


<p id="p_17">(iii)	In judging a
question of prejudice, as of guilt, the courts must act with a board
vision and look to the substance and not to the technicalities, and
their main concern should be to see whether the accused had a fair
trial, whether he knew what he was being tried for, whether the main
facts sought to be established against him were explained to him
fairly and clearly, and whether he was given a full and fair chance
to defend himself; <a href="/doc/1601209/" id="a_37">Main Pal v. State of Haryana</a> ,(2010)10 SCC 130:
AIR 2010 SC 3292: 2010 AIR SCW5293 .
</p> 


 


 


 


 


<p id="p_18">12.	In the end, reference
may be made to Gurpreet Singh s case, (2005)12 SCC 615.
Interestingly, in that case,- as in the present case   there were
three accused. In fact, there were four accused in that case, one had
died during the pendency of  appeal. In that case, charge was framed
only under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_38">section 302</a> IPC and not under <a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_39">section 34</a>. A submission was
advanced that omission to frame specific charge vitiates the case of
prosecution. Relying on Ramji Singh s case (2001)9 SCC 528,
the Court had rejected the plea and the appeal of the accused was
dismissed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_19">13.	In view of the above
discussion, there is no substance in the revision. The same fails and
stands dismissed. Rule is discharged.
</p> 
	 


	 
	

 


<p id="p_20">	Interim relief granted
earlier stands vacated. The trial Court is directed to dispose of
Sessions Case No. 197/2001 as expeditiously as possible.
