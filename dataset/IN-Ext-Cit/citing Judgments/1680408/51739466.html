: Judgement 



        (Delivered on this 26th day of March, 2012)

   (Writ Petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
                         of India)



     Heard learned counsel for the parties.

</p><p id="p_2">1.   WP (S) Nos.6393, 6646 &amp; 7025 of 2009 involve common  

     facts as well as common question of law, thus, they are

     being considered and disposed of by this common order.

</p><p id="p_3">2.   By  these  petitions,  the petitioners  impugn  the

     cancellation order dated 23-10-2009 {Annexure - P/15 to WP

     (S) No.6393 of 2009} on the ground that without affording

     proper opportunity of hearing, the appointment of the

     petitioners on the post of Pharmacist Grade-II have been

     cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   The petitioners have relied on several decisions of

     the Supreme Court as well as other High Courts, which are

     not relevant to the lis involved in the present cases.

</p><p id="p_5">4.   Shri Sao, learned Govt. Advocate appearing on behalf

     of the State, on the basis of the return filed by the

     State, would submit that there were several irregularities

     in appointments, as in some cases the candidates including

     some of the petitioners have not at all applied for

     recruitment and appointment on the post of Pharmacist

     Grade - II, pursuant to the advertisement.  Thus, the

     impugned order has rightly been passed.  In view of that,

     it was not necessary to afford an opportunity of hearing

     to  the  petitioners before cancellation  of  their

     appointment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   Indisputably, the petitioners were duly appointed on

     the post of Pharmacist Grade - II by orders dated 4th &amp;

     5th July, 2008.  The petition is shorn of all relevant

     facts, except the facts of appointment and cancellation of

     the appointment orders. Thus, it is difficult to go into

     the method of appointment or decisions taken thereon.

     Further on perusal of the appointment orders of the

     petitioners,  it appears that the petitioners  were

     appointed temporarily wherein it was clearly stated that

     the services of the petitioners may be terminated at any

     time with one month notice or in lieu, one month salary.

</p><p id="p_7">6.   The authority has not disclosed anything except that

     there were serious irregularities in appointment of

     Pharmacist Grade - II on contract basis.  It is worth

     mentioning that the impugned decision to cancel the

     appointment was taken after the petitioners were allowed

     to work for a period of about 15 months, on the ground of

     alleged irregularities without pointing out the nature of

     irregularities.   Thus, it was necessary  that  the

     petitioners should have been noticed about the alleged

     irregularities providing opportunity to them to put

     forward their respective cases before passing the impugned

     order.   It is not the case of cancellation of appointment

     on the terms of the appointment order, but cancellation

     was stigmatic.

     Chhattisgarh and Others1</a> observed as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "13.   It is well settled principle  of
            law  that  if  any  order  visits  with
            civil   consequences,   the   same   is
            vitiated,  if passed without  affording

<p id="p_9">  8.    This  Court, in Ku. Punam &amp; Others v. State  of

     Chhattisgarh &amp; Others14, wherein an identical issue came up

     for consideration, observed as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">           "20.     It  is  well settled that  the
               purpose of rules of natural justice
               is  not to administer justice alone
               but   to  prevent  miscarriage   of
               justice   and  the  principles   of
               natural  justice are applicable  to
               the  administrative order, if  such
               order affects right of a citizen.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">           21.Applying  well settled principle  of
               law  to  the  facts of  the  cases,
               there  is a common thread that  the
               principle of natural justice is not
               unruly  horse.  The  principles  of
               natural justice are required to  be
               complied with, having regard to the
               facts  situation obtained  therein.
               Thus,  the  principles  of  natural
               justice may not be required  to  be
               followed  in the cases,  where  the
               facts are admitted. Secondly,  that
               it  is  practically  impossible  or
               highly  improbable  to  afford   an
               opportunity  of  hearing,  in   the
               event, of quashing of selection  on
               account  of irregularity  committed
               on    mass   scale,   or   en-masse
               cancellation.  Thirdly,  no  useful
               purpose   would   be   served    by
           affording     an     opportunity     of
               hearing."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">  9.   Subsequently, the ratio laid down by this Court in

     Ku. Punam (supra) has been referred approvingly in

     Mrityunjay Shukla &amp; Others v. Municipal Corporation Raipur

     &amp; Others15.
</p>
<p id="p_11">10.  In view of the above, the impugned cancellation order

     dated                            23-10-2009 is quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_12">     However, liberty is reserved to the respondent authorities

     to issue a show cause notice to the petitioners to put

     forward their respective cases and thereafter, they may

     pass an appropriate order in accordance with law and on

     its own merits, if so advised.
</p>
<p id="p_13">11.  Applying the well settled principles of law to  the

     facts of the present case and for the reasons mentioned

     hereinabove, the writ petitions are allowed to the extent

     indicated above.  No order asto costs.
