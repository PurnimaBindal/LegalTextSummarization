allegations are that in Dharampuri village, in the year

2015-16 and 2016-17, about 120 toilets were to be

constructed by the government, and 13 beneficiaries

were already paid the money under the scheme; in spite

of that, again aid was provided. Accused nos.1 to 10 by

misusing           their   status,     in    case     where     toilets          of    7

beneficiaries were already constructed, again provided

the benefit. False documents were prepared for showing,

as new toilets for six beneficiaries already having old

toilets and thereby misappropriated the amount of

Rs.1,56,000/-, and used the same for their own personal

purpose,           and,    thus      District        Development           Officer,

Vadodara had passed an order for filing a police

complaint. In the said FIR, the further allegations are also

made with regard to misappropriation in the same village

Dharampuri. The details regarding misappropriation of

money has been given in the FIR for the individual seven

beneficiaries, and it has been alleged that a total amount

of      Rs.72,000/-        has       been       misappropriated             of        six

6.6           The FIR further alleges that, in Kayawarohan

Gram Panchayat, though the aid was provided, again the

money had been given to about 24 beneficiaries and

thereby has caused misappropriation of Rs.2,88,000/-,

and for about 13 beneficiaries, the old toilets were shown

as new, and false certificates were given on which

misappropriation and cheating of Rs.1,56,000/- has been

caused. It is alleged that in baseline survey for the year

2012, though the persons were not entitled for the

benefit, 23 beneficiaries were given the aid, and thereby

has caused loss to the government by misappropriation of

Rs.2,76,000/-. Further it is alleged that, by Voucher

No.362, on 13.10.2016, without any physical verification

or any certification, 79 beneficiaries were shown to have

received the amount of Rs.9,48,000/-, which were in fact

misappropriated by the accused.

committed at different villages with different accused.

The money has been misappropriated under one scheme

different, and in C.R. No.I-30/2017, over and above the

case of cheating and criminal breach of trust, the

allegation is also of issuance of false certificate. The case

of Brijiwan Das Vs. Emperor, reported in 1932 Criminal

Law Journal 1931, was of the embezzlement with respect

to a sum of Rs.446-8-3 received by the accused in his

capacity as a servant and had misappropriated between

the dates 01.02.1928 and 26.09.1928. He was sentenced

to a day&#x27;s imprisonment and a fine of Rs.600. In the

master       through   another   servant    instituted         a     fresh

complaint for the prosecution on three charges of

embezzling three sums of money on 21 st June, 2nd August

and 21st August, 1928. It was noticed that these dates fell

within the dates of the previous charge of 1 st February

and 26th September, but these items were not included in

the gross sum for which the accused was prosecuted,

charged and convicted at the former trial.



7.3           It was observed that there were divergence in

judicial opinion to the issue whether after a trial in

respect of a gross sum for which a breach of trust was

alleged to have been committed between two specified

dates, second trial in respect of an offence alleged to have

been committed on intermediate days but not included in

the gross sum is permissible or not. By referring to the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1419576/" id="a_17">sections 233</a> and <a href="/doc/384218/" id="a_18">222</a> of the earlier<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_19"> Criminal

Court to have a joint trial of what may apparently be

several offences of breach of trust. It was laid down that

the charge of a gross sum embezzled between two dates

is only one charge and there may be separate trial under

the provisions of <a href="/doc/1419576/" id="a_23">section 233</a> of embezzlement of another

item not included in the gross sum for which an earlier

charge was framed under <a href="/doc/384218/" id="a_24">section 222(2)</a>. It was observed

that two of the offences could have been tried jointly with

the former offence for embezzling a gross sum, and there

was no reason why there could not be a separate trial

because <a href="/doc/1986933/" id="a_25">section 235</a> is only permissive and permits the

trial of three offences of the same kind within a year by

one trial, but does not bar three separate trials for those

offences.

7.4           The Gwalior Bench in the case of Ramkrishna

that     <a href="/doc/384218/" id="a_26">section      222(2)</a>    directs        that    all      items          or

misappropriation included in the gross sum need not be

specified but they can be grouped together into one lump

sum and that can be shown as the sum misappropriated.

It was laid down that there is nothing in the sub-section

to show that all items misappropriated within the space of

one year must be included in the gross sum. Further

observing that sub-section indicates clearly that the

intention of the Legislature was to allow three lump sums

to be combined at one trial under <a href="/doc/1572307/" id="a_27">section 234</a> of the Code

and if that be the intention of the Legislature, it would

not be correct to say that the gross sum must include all

the items of misappropriation made during the course of

one year, and, thus it was held that where, therefore, an

accused         person      was       tried       and         convicted              for

misappropriating a gross sum during a certain period, his

conviction is no bar to another trial in respect of other

sums of money alleged to have been misappropriated by

him during the said period.

1959 Andhra Pradesh 520, the scope of <a href="/doc/384218/" id="a_28">section 222</a>

was explained by observing that it is only an enabling

section      and      not   a   disabling         one.      It    enables           the

prosecution, when it considers taking such a course as

appropriate, or convenient, or necessary, to put in a gross

sum representing the total amount misappropriated by

the accused, instead of framing a large number of

separate charges in respect of small sums of money

which go to make up the gross amount. To spell out from

such an enabling section, a disability on the part of the

prosecution to follow the procedure, which is enjoined by

the sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29"> of the Code</a>, such as 233, is wrong.



7.6           It was held that when the accused is alleged to

have committed distinct and different offences of criminal

misappropriation in respect of different individuals and in

relation to different sums of money and committed at

different places and times there is no law which can stand

in the way of the prosecution in respect of the subsequent

charges, going on simply because the earlier charges

happened to end in an acquittal.

that the trial held in a manner not warranted by the

proviso is wholly bad, irrespective of the question

whether or not there was any actual prejudice to the

accused        and    consequent    failure   of   justice.              The

of the charge should be. It is only when it may not be

possible to specify exactly particular items with respect to

which criminal breach of trust took place or the exact

date on which the individual items were misappropriated

or in some similar contingency, the Court is authorised to

lump up the various items, with respect to which criminal

breach of trust was committed and to mention the total

amount misappropriated within a year in the charge.

When so done, the charge is deemed to be the charge of

one offence. If several distinct items with respect to

which criminal breach of trust has been committed are

not so lumped together, no illegality is committed in the

trial with respect to each distinct offence of criminal

breach of trust with respect to an individual item, is the

correct mode of proceeding with the trial of an offence of

7.10          The decision of the Delhi High Court in the case

of The State Vs. Ram Kanwar, reported in 1984 Cr.

L.J. 958, was with the charge of Criminal breach of trust

or dishonest misappropriation. The accused was already

convicted for the breach of trust of four items. The

terminal dates of theses items were 06.03.1978 and

03.05.1978, and there were fresh charge for 8 items,

where       the       terminal   dates           were     23.05.1978              and

19.07.1978. It was held that by continuation of the

subsequent trial no injustice has been caused. Reference

was also made of <a href="/doc/741791/" id="a_40">section 300</a> of Cr.P.C., which initiates

the English rule of &#x27;autrefois acquit&#x27; and &#x27;autrerfois

the prosecution against the accused person in respect of

various items of misappropriation, defalcation, trial held,

resulting in conviction or acquittal, and subsequent

charge-sheet/challan was filed in respect of other items of

misappropriation occurring during the same period of two

terminal dates, or bringing the same year to which the

items of previous charge-sheet pertained. It was observed

that the charge framed in respect of items shall be

deemed to be the charge of one offence within the

meaning of <a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_42">section 219</a> Cr.P.C., provided that the time

intervening to the two terminal dates does not exceed one

year, and this provisions of law is enabling one for the

prosecution and cannot be converted into disabling one.



7.11          It was also observed by the Delhi High Court

that there would be no warrant for the prosecution that

merely because <a href="/doc/708611/" id="a_43">section 212(2)</a> Cr.P.C. enables the

prosecution in cases of criminal breach of trust or

dishonest misappropriation of money, to satisfy only the

particular items or exact dates thereof, that only one

offence has arisen out of the different offence of

misappropriation, criminal breach of trust or defalcation,

and that must be regarded in one time. This provision of

law, as was observed, simply incorporates the deeming

provision whereby the charge framed thereunder shall be

deemed to be charge of one offence within the meaning of

<a href="/doc/1402105/" id="a_44">section 219</a> Cr.P.C., and not that it is one offence.

<a href="/doc/1737687/" id="a_94">section 223</a> of the Code. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_95">Section 223</a> is with regard to

what persons may be charged jointly. It has been stated

in the said section, that the persons may be charged and

tried together namely as in clause (a) &quot;persons accused of

same      offence     committed     in      the   course          of      same

transaction&quot;, and clause (d) &quot;persons accused of different

that a person is accused of more offence than one, of the

same kind. <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_99">Section 219</a> governs the case, where there is

only one accused, as the word &quot;a person&quot; therein cannot

be read as including several persons. The case of several

persons, being accused of more offences than one of the

same kind committed within the space of 12 months is

dealt with in clause (c) of <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_100">section 223</a>, that the word

&#x27;jointly&quot; in <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_101">section 223(c)</a> is important and unless various

persons committed the offence jointly, there would be no

logic behind trying them jointly.

defined anywhere in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_111"> the Code</a> and would be difficult to

depend upon the particular facts of each case, but

generally when there is proximity in time or place or

immediate         purpose or design or continuity of action in

respect of series of acts, it may be possible to infer that

they form part of the same transaction. Several acts

committed by a person, so unity of purpose or design that

would be on a strong circumstances to indicate that those

acts form part of same transaction. The connection

between &#x27;a series of acts&#x27; is to be an essential ingredient

for those acts to constitute the same transaction. A

transaction may be an isolated act or may be consisting of

one series of acts. A series of acts which constitute a

transaction must of necessarily be connected with one

other and if some of them spell out independently they

would not form part of the same transaction, but would

16.1          The thing to be noticed is that <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_126">section 223</a> does

not read as if, various clauses can be applied only

alternatively. The very opening words of the section

shows that it is enabling provision for all the persons

falling in <a href="/doc/1737687/" id="a_127">section 223</a> Cr.P.C., who could be charged and

only common aspect is that, the present petitioner is a

common accused in all the three FIRs. The offence has

been committed with the office bearers of different Gram

Panchayats under one same scheme, which was in force

in all the Gram Panchayats. If such offences with different

versions are put up for a joint trial, then there would not

be any scope for fair trial. Further, the other co-accused&#x27;s

right of a separate independent trial, cannot be burdened

with joint trial, since that would create prejudice to their

interest. The discretion is always with the Magistrate

concern.

constitute a different transaction or transactions.

conclusions           would   lead     to       serious        consequences,

inasmuch as, the real accused                      can take the first
