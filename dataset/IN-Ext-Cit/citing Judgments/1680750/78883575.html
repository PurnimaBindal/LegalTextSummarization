<p id="p_1">       The amendment brought about to the Kerala Education Rules, 1958

('KER' for short) by way of the Kerala Education (Amendment Rules), 2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases           2</span>

issued in G.O(P)No.199/2016/G.Edn. dated 3.12.2016 is under challenge in

these writ petitions filed by Managers of various educational agencies. The

amended rules came into force w.e.f 29.1.2016. Amendment has been made

to the provisions contained in Chapter XXI of K.E.R, substituting Rule 7

and to Chapter XXIII K.E.R substituting some of the entries in Rule 1,

inserting an entry in Rule 5 and inserting Rule 14 A. The explanatory note

to the amendment states that it became necessary to impose a condition on

the Managers of all aided schools, to appoint fully qualified teachers from

among the list of protected teachers; it became necessary to extend the

staff fixation for a particular year to the subsequent year. In order to meet

those situations, necessary provisions are incorporated in the statute while

insisting that the educational officers have to verify the strength of people

based on UID verification. As the issue arising in all these cases is one and

the same, all these cases were heard together and are being disposed of by

this common judgment. The parties and documents referred to in this

judgment are as described in W.P.(C).No.1356 of 2017, unless otherwise

expressly specified.
</p>
<p id="p_2">       2.      The aided schools in the State of Kerala, are run with the aid of

Government and are governed by the provisions contained in Kerala

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        3</span>

Education Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and the Kerala

Education Rules, 1959 ('the Rules'), framed under <a href="/doc/106809565/" id="a_1">Section 36</a> of the Act.

They are also governed by the provisions contained in the Right of

Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 ('RTE Act') and the

Kerala Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011

(RTE Rules'). Under <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_2">Section 9</a> of the Act, Government has to pay the salary

of all the teaching and non-teaching staff of aided Schools. <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_3">Section 11</a> of

the Act, as it stood prior to amendment carried out in the year 1960, had

provided that appointments of teachers should be made by district wise

selection through Public Service Commission. <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_4">Section 11</a>, as amended in

1960, empowers the Managers to appoint teachers subject to the rules and

conditions laid down by Government, from among persons who possess the

qualifications prescribed under <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_5">Section 10</a>. <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_6">Section 12</a> of the Act empowers

Government to prescribe the conditions of service of teachers in aided

Schools, including conditions relating to pay, pension, provident fund, age

of retirement and restricts the power of Manager to impose penalties of

dismissal, removal and reduction in rank on teachers by insisting prior

approval of educational officers and insists approval for placing any

teachers under suspension beyond 15 days. <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_7">Section 13</a> provides that where

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         4</span>

any retrenchment of teachers in any aided School is rendered necessary

consequent on orders of Government relating to the course of studies or

scheme of teaching or of such other matters, it shall be competent for

Government or the Manager of an aided School to appoint such teachers in

any Government or aided School, as the case may be. Chapter III deals with

the management of private schools. As per Rule 3 thereof the management

of every aided School, whether it be of an individual educational agency or

of a corporate educational agency, shall be vested in a Manager, who shall

be responsible to the department for the management of the institution. Rule

9 provides for the duties and powers of Managers of aided Schools. Sub rule

1 provides that Managers shall be responsible for the conduct of the School

strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Rules made

thereunder and shall also abide by the orders being issued by Government

and the Department from time to time. Sub rule 3 provides among other

things that the Manager shall provide staff as per rules issued under the Act

and as per orders issued from time to time by the Government and the

Department in conformity with the provisions in the Act and Rules issued

thereunder. Sub rule 5 thereof provides that Managers shall verify the staff

position of the school in conformity with the number of class divisions

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          5</span>

sanctioned by the department. The conditions of service of teachers are

governed by the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_8">Section 12</a> of the Act and in the

rules in Chapter XIVA of KER. Rule 1, provides that whenever vacancy

occurs in a school, the Managers have to follow the directions issued by

Government from time to time, for ascertaining the availability of qualified

hand and for filling up the vacancies. It also provides that Managers are to

appoint only those who are having the prescribed qualification. The power

to determine the requirement of subjects and curricula of studies in High

School classes is on the Director of Public Instructions. The Managers shall

follow the directions issued by the Government relating to subject

requirement and curricula of studies, while making appointment to High

School classes. Rule 5A provides that qualified teachers who are retrenched

by the opening of new Schools or consequent on orders of Government

relating to the course of studies or scheme of teaching or due to withdrawal

of recognition of schools for any of the reasons specified in Rules 22, 22A

or 23 of Chapter V and consequent closure of the school shall be given

preference for appointment to future vacancies in schools under the same or

any educational agency. Under Rule 6(viii) of Chapter V of KER, the

Managers of schools which were upgraded or newly opened subsequent to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         6</span>

the year 1979, have to execute an agreement with Government in which

they have to agree that they shall fill up the vacancies in their schools by

appointing protected teachers who were retrenched due to division fall after

enjoying two vacation salary. However most of the Managers consistently

disobeyed this and they appointed fresh hands in their schools. The

educational officers did not approve such illegal appointments made in

disobedience of rules. It resulted in production of large number of teachers

continuing in such schools for several years without salary. Seeing the

heartburn of such teachers, the Government issued orders relaxing the

provisions in the rules directing the Managers to appoint at least one

protected teacher in such schools. The violation continued in several

schools even after such relaxation, enhancing the number of unapproved

teachers. G.O(P).No.317/2005/G.Edn dated 17.8.2005 was issued banning

creation of additional divisions and filling up the vacancies in additional

divisions from 2006-07 onwards. However, that ban was lifted issuing G.O

(P).No.10/2010/G.Edn dt.12.1.2010, imposing a condition that the

Managers shall execute a bond agreeing to appoint protected teachers equal

in number of appointments already made in violation of the ban. It was also

ordered that future vacancies shall be filled up in the ratio of 1:1 i.e,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         7</span>

appointing a protected teacher in every alternate vacancy arising in future.

Several of the Managers did not comply with the conditions and did not

execute the bond. That Government order was upheld by this Court in the

judgment dated 16.03.2011 in <a href="/doc/74667830/" id="a_9">Manager, Eravannoor AUP School &amp;

others v. State of Kerala &amp; others</a> : ILR 2011(2) Ker 301 and in the

Division Bench judgment in <a href="/doc/110820313/" id="a_10">Nair Service Society v. Government of

Kerala</a>: 2015 (2) KHC 725 (hereinafter referred to as 'NSS case'). As at

present the matter is pending before the Supreme Court and Ext.P13 interim

order is passed staying the operation of the judgment of this Court in so far

as it deals with clause v and vi of the impugned Government order dated

12.1.2010.
</p>
<p id="p_3">       3.      Even before the pronouncement of the judgment upholding the

Government order dated 12.1.2010, Government issued another order G.O

(P)199/2011/G.Edn dated 1.10.2011, introducing teachers' package in order

to approve the appointments of teachers already made against the additional

division vacancies for the period from August, 2005 onwards and

accordingly a large number of teachers got their appointments approved

w.e.f 1.6.2011. As per the teachers' package, the staff fixation for the year

2010-11 was to be followed for the        year 2011-12 also. Appointments

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         8</span>

against additional division vacancies were permitted only on daily wages

and its approval was to be considered in 2013-14. It provided for

appointment of teachers from Teachers' bank. Orders relating to the staff

fixation, filling up of vacancies by appointing protected teachers, covered

by the teachers' package, etc. were issued in G.O(P) 313/2013/G.Edn. dated

29/11/2013 also. All those orders including the teachers' package were

under challenge in a batch of writ petitions and this Court in a common

judgment dated 15.01.2015 in W.P.(C).No.30107 of 2013 and connected

cases allowed those writ petitions setting aside those orders including the

teachers' package. This Court found that the orders extending the staff

fixation to subsequent years were contrary to the statutory provisions

contained in Rule 12 of Chapter XXIII of KER. The directions to appoint

protected teachers were also found illegal, observing that it takes away the

right of Managers to keep a teacher appointed on probation, the right of

Managers to make their own choices in appointments conferred under the

rules, apart from being violative of the right of Managers under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_11">Article 19

(1)(g)</a> and <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_12">30(1)</a> of the Act.     Writ appeals filed against that was also

withdrawn/dismissed.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         9</span>

judgment in NSS case, upholding the judgment of another learned Single

Judge in which the order issued on 12.01.2010, directing appointment of

protected teachers, was upheld. In that judgment the contention regarding

the interference on the right of Manager to appoint, in violation of their

constitutional rights under Articles 19(1)(g) and <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_13">Article 30</a> was repelled.

</p><p id="p_5">       5.     In the meanwhile, the Government had issued several orders

relating to appointment of protected teachers, staff fixation pursuant to the

implementation of RTE Act, 2009, etc. as per G.O.(Ms)No.154/2013/G.Edn.

dated 03/05/2013; by G.O(P)No. 124/2014/G.Edn. dated 04/07/2014,

Government sought to extend the staff fixation for the year 2010-11 to the

year 2013-14. The Rules were also amended as per G.O.(P) No.

154/14/G.Edn dated 11.08.2014 (hereinafter referred to as '2014 amendment

Rules'), published on 16.08.2014. These rules as well as certain circulars

and orders issued thereafter were challenged in a batch of writ petitions

which resulted in judgment dt.17.12.2015 in <a href="/doc/194672111/" id="a_14">Kerala Aided L.P. And U.P

School , Kollam v. State of Kerala &amp; others</a> : ILR 2016 (1) Ker.590; 2016

KHC 118. G.O(P) No.124/2014 and the order issued on 29.11.2013 in

continuation and implementation of the teachers' package, staff fixation, etc.

again by way of executive orders, were held to have the very same defects

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        10</span>

as found in the common judgment dated 15.01.2015 in W.P.(C).No.30107 of

2013 and hence it was set aside. Sub rule 6 was inserted in Chapter III

KER, providing that Managers shall make appointment against vacancies as

notified by Government. Rule 1 of Chapter XIVA was amended insisting

for reporting of vacancies to Government for ascertaining availability of

qualified hand and for filling up the vacancies only after the vacancies are

notified by Government. Chapter XXI which, dealt with recruitment of

teachers in aided Schools, was introduced with effect from 01.07.1961; but

it was omitted in the year 1972. That Chapter was re-introduced with 7

rules. It provided for procedure for reporting the vacancies to the

Government, for notification by Government. Rule 7 provided for filling up

of vacancies arising out of exemption from class charges to head teachers

and to short term vacancies from Teachers' bank, in which teachers would

be included on the basis of the guidelines issued by Government from time

to time. This Court found that the notification of vacancies did not serve

any purpose, as the student strength was the basis for staff strength. It was

found that prescription of notification of regular and anticipated vacancies

provided for in Chapter XXI and amendment effected in Chapter III to

Rule 9 and to Chapter XIVA in Rule 1 were unreasonable and arbitrary. All

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         11</span>

the rules in Chapter XXI except Rule 7 were held unsustainable. Chapter

XXIII was also amended providing for sanctioning of posts of Headmaster;

Rule 12 was amended providing for fixing the staff strength based on pupils

strength of 2010-11 and to retain it till Government deemed fit to revise it

based on UID of students; it also provided for the procedure for determining

the number of pupils on the basis of UID. While upholding the procedure

for staff fixation, the retention of staff fixation was held unreasonable. It

was found that fixation of staff had to be done as on 15th July on the basis of

PTR in accordance with the provisions in RTE Act and as RTE Act provides

that not more 10% of the vacancies shall remain unfilled, retention of staff

strength from 2010-11 onwards would run contrary to the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_15">Central Act</a>.

Rule 12 B which provided that appointments would take effect from the

date of appointment was deleted. That deletion was upheld. It further

provided that the teachers included in the teachers' package would stand

approved from 01.06.2011 on condition that their prior service shall not be

reckoned for any service benefits.     3rd proviso was inserted to Rule 51A

providing for preference to teachers from Teachers' bank. It was found that

the benefit of 51A was given to a category which is not included in the Rule

51A and such a preference is not envisaged under rules. It further provided

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         12</span>

for a teacher appraisal committee with the Deputy Director of Education,

educational experts, etc. for assessing the performance of teachers. Though

the power of Government to introduce such mechanism was upheld, it was

found that it was vague as there were no guidelines for its implementation.

Hence it was found unsustainable. The retrospectivity given to the rules

from 01.10.2011 was also set aside. Circular issued by Government on

26/08/2014 regarding the higher level verification for staff fixation,

deployment of teachers, approval of appointments, was set aside, as a new

procedure was already prescribed for staff fixation based on UID in Rule 12

and a further higher level verification by way of executive order, cannot be

sustained. G.O(P) No.213/2015/G.Edn. dated 06/08/2015, was issued for

implementing the teachers' package, providing for the eligibility conditions

for inclusion of teachers in it. It also provided for the procedure for

sanctioning posts on the basis of UID on 6th working day, ratio between

pupils and teachers (PTR), approval of appointments against additional

posts, prior approval for appointment, etc. It was found that a package is

envisaged in terms of Rule 7 for filling up of short term vacancies,

observing the PTR in tune with RTE Act. However the provision regarding

approval only after notification by Government was held unsustainable and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          13</span>

it was sustained on condition that the PTR should be as per the RTE Act.

Even for other vacancies it was permissible going by the NSS judgment.

Those writ petitions were disposed of with the aforesaid declarations and

directing the respondents to issue staff fixation orders for the period from

2011-12 onwards in accordance with the unamended Rule 12.                  The

educational authorities were directed to determine the additional posts

which arose in each year and to consider the question of approval on the

appointments already intimated and sent for approval. It was also directed to

consider approval on the basis of staff fixation orders to be issued for the

period upto 2014-15 and issue the staff fixation as per the amended

procedure from 2015-16 onwards. W.A.No.372/2015 filed against that

judgment was also dismissed on 30.08.2016.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       6.      Even before the disposal of the Writ Appeal, Government had

issued Ext.P3-G.O(P)No.29/2016/G.Edn. dt.29.1.2016, in implementation

of the judgment dated 17.12.2015, providing for various parameters to be

followed in approving appointments, filling up of vacancies, the nature of

vacancies in which protected teachers were to be appointed, etc. Even

though the DPI had issued instructions thereafter as per circular dt.4.6.2016

to the educational officers to fix the staff strength for the year 2016-17, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         14</span>

Government issued another order G.O.(P).No.134/2016/G.Edn dt.5.8.2016

providing that the staff fixation for the year 2015-16 can be applied in the

year 2016-17 also. The Managers challenged both the orders. In W.P(c)

No.3150/2016, the order to the extent it directs the staff fixation for the year

2015-16 to 2016-17 has already been stayed. The order issued on

29.01.2016, to the extent it directs appointment of protected teachers is

stayed to the extent it affects the minority managements. Amendment has

been effected thereafter on 03.12.2016, with retrospective effective from

29.01.2016, date of the order G.O(P).No.29/2016 w.e.f 29.1.2016.

</p><p id="p_7">       7.      Government has thereafter issued Ext.P8 amendment Rules,

2016, substituting Rule 7 of Chapter XXI of KER, introducing 10 sub rules

to it and 3 notes below that. Amendments are effected substituting item (iii)

to rule 1, inserting item (iv) in Rule 5; and Rule 14A and note below it in

Chapter XXIII KER.
</p>
<p id="p_8">       8.      I shall deal with the provisions introduced by way of the

amendment in detail later. By way of the amendment, the Managers are to

fill up the vacancies in additional divisions arising out of exemption to

Headmasters in LP and UP Schools, additional divisions arising in schools

newly opened/upgraded after 1979, short term vacancies, etc. only by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          15</span>

protected teachers from Teacher's bank. Moreover, protected teachers have

to be appointed in every alternate vacancy arising otherwise. Rule 14A is

inserted to enable extension of staff fixation for a particular year to

subsequent year.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       9.    The petitioners are challenging Ext.P8 amendment rules, alleging

that the respondents have unlawfully interfered with their right to appoint

by insisting to fill up the vacancies by appointment of protected teachers.

They seek a declaration that it is inconsistent with the Act and RTE Act,

2009, violative of their fundamental rights under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_16">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the

Constitution of India. The Managers of educational agencies run by

religious and linguistic minorities allege that the rules run contrary to the

provisions under Articles 30(1) of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_10">       10.      In the counter affidavit, Government, while refuting the

averments in the writ petitions, explained the circumstances under which the

rules were amended. With the support of the statutory provisions contained

in <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_17">Sections 9</a> and <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_18">10</a> to <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_19">13</a> of the Act and the provisions contained in the

rules in Chapter III, V and XIVA, the agreement executed by them under

Rule 6(viii) of Chapter V, the form 27 to be furnished by Managers along

with proposal for appointment, it is stated that the power of Managers to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases           16</span>

appoint is subject to the orders and conditions issued and imposed by

Government. Apart from that, Rules 43, 51A, 51B, etc. also restrict the

right of Managers to appoint; going by <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_20">Section 13</a>, Rule 5A of the Chapter

XIVA KER, the Managers are bound to appoint protected teachers even in

the absence of Ext.P8 rules; the liability to execute agreement under Rule 6

</p><p id="p_11">(viii) of Chapter V for those who newly opened/upgraded Schools after

25.02.1979, and to appoint protected teachers are already upheld by this

Court, without any distinction between minority and non-minority

institutions; the G.O.(P)No.10/10/G.Edn dated 12.01.2010 insisting

appointment of protected teachers in all schools also was upheld in NSS

case. It is stated that the writ petitions are bad for non-joinder of necessary

parties as the protected teachers, who are the beneficiaries of the

amendment, are not made parties to the writ petitions. It is stated that the

consistent violation of the directions issued by Government, including the

orders of ban on appointment issued on 17.08.2005, and the conditions

stipulated in the order issued on 12.01.2010, for lifting the ban, while

making appointments by Managers in disregard of their statutory obligation

to appoint retrenched teachers, under <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_21">Section 13</a> of the Act and Rule 5A of

Chapter XIVA of KER, enlarged the number of teachers working without

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        17</span>

approval and salary. The Teachers' package introduced for protecting such

teachers as per G.O.(P)No.199/11/G.Edn dated 01.10.2011, which provided

for approval of such teachers has also insisted appointment of protected

teachers in the vacancies arising in the schools and extended staff fixation

for 2010-11 to subsequent years, was set aside in the judgment dated

15.01.2015 in a batch of cases, observing that such modifications cannot be

issued by executive orders. The legality of the orders issued thereafter and

the amendment rules 2014 were considered            in  the judgment dated

15.12.2015 in Kerala Aided L. P. and U. P. School, Kollam with respect to

the 2014 amendment Rules. In implementation of the direction in that

judgment, to issue orders of staff fixation for the years 2011-12 onwards,

Government issued Ext.P3 order, explaining the nature of vacancies, mode

of filling up the vacancies, approval, staff fixation as per PTR, etc; as per

para.III(2) of Ext.P3 order it was directed to appoint protected teachers for

filling up (a) the vacancies generated by way of exempting Headmasters

from class charge; b) all vacancies existing under the respective

managements and (c) the first of every two vacancies arising in future.

Despite this direction, the Managers filled up all the vacancies in violation

of those orders. Ext.P3 order was followed by Ext.P6 order issued on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          18</span>

05.08.2016, which is kept in abeyance to the extent it related to the

extension of staff fixation orders of 2015-16 to 2016-17, in W.P.(C) No.

31570/2016 and connected matters, which is pending. That order lays down

eligibility conditions for the deployment of surplus teachers and non

teaching staff for protection. The issuance of the staff fixation orders for

the years 2011-12 to 2015-16, issued in 2016, generated large number of

protected teachers, which compelled Government to amend the rules. It is

stated that the total number of protected teachers after retaining excess

hands against possible additional posts is 3523 teachers and 85 non-

teaching     staff.         It is further stated  that  as    per   circular

no.951951/J2/2016/G.Edn dated 09.11.2016, Government directed that all

appointments made in newly opened/upgraded schools from 2011-12 to

2015-16 would be approved without insisting for appointment of protected

teachers on condition that vacancies arising from 2016-17 onwards shall be

filled up by appointing protected teachers. Ext.P8 rules were issued with

retrospective effect from 29/01/2016, the date on which Ext.P3 order was

issued. The amendment rules Ext.P8 are issued in tune with the order dated

29.01.2016. According to respondents the provisions for appointment or

absorption of protected teachers are available in <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_22">Section 13</a> of the Act and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          19</span>

Rule 5A in Chapter XIVA. Retrenchment is a condition of service which

comes under <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_23">Section 12</a> of the Act; Government is committed to the social

obligation of protecting teachers who are thrown out due to reasons beyond

their control. The orders for protection of such teachers are being issued

right from 1969. By G.O(P)No. 178/2002/Gen.Edn dated 28-06-2002,

Government directed the Managers of newly opened/upgraded schools to

fill up all the existing/arising vacancies in their schools by appointing

protected teachers only. In G.O(P)No.46/2006/Gen.Edn dated 01-02-2006,

that condition was diluted directing to appoint at least one protected hand in

the vacancies existing in such schools. By G.O(P)No. 259/2006/Gen.Edn

dated 12-10-2006, the Managers of all "uneconomic schools" were directed

to fill up all the existing/arising vacancies by appointing protected teachers

only. Thereafter G.O (P) No. 10/10/Gen.Edn dated 12.01-2010, was issued

for granting approval to all appointments made against additional posts for

the period from 2006-07 to 2009-10, by obtaining an undertaking from the

Managers agreeing to absorb equal number of protected teachers/non

teaching staff in the vacancies arising in future and to appoint a

protected teacher against the first of every two additional posts

thereafter. These directions/relaxations were made as against the liability of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          20</span>

the newly opened/upgraded schools to act in terms of the agreement and to

obey the "conditions" laid down as per the Government orders, regarding

appointment of protected teachers. It is stated that all these orders were in

force upto 30-09-2011, till introduction of Teachers' package, from

01.10.2011. However the Managers did not act in tune with the statutory

mandate to accommodate the retrenched teachers from other educational

agencies also resulting in huge number of retrenched teachers.            But

Government out of its social commitment, have only recognised the rights

of the retrenched teachers of aided Schools who are distributed in various

Government and aided schools and those who are awaiting deployment in

the absence of posts. It is also stated that almost all the protected teachers

in the Teachers' bank have already completed probation. The reason for such

a huge number of protected teachers which increased to 3523 thereafter was

stated to be the result of blatant violation of the orders issued by

Government, by the Managers. It is stated that the number of protected

hands deployed in aided schools consequent to staff fixation for 2015-16 is

755; whereas 2855 are deployed in Government Schools and Government

offices on temporary arrangement, as per Ext.P6 order. All of them are

likely to return to the Teachers' bank as and when regular hands report in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases           21</span>

respective posts where they are accommodated, when those teachers would

not be able to get salary until their next deployment. It is further stated that

the number of additional posts found admissible for 2016-17 was 3815,

number of posts found excess was 910. 333 teachers rendered surplus in

2015-16 were already adjusted against the additional vacancies of 2016-17.

It is also stated that there is no distinction between a teacher from minority

institution or non-minority institution for inclusion in the Teachers' bank

and for deployment or salary. Therefore, there cannot be any exemption for

institutions run by minority communities. The number of protected teachers

to the bank would go on increasing, on account of the reduction in pupils'

strength in the 7145 aided Schools in the State.

</p><p id="p_13">       12. The Managers allege that the rules are unconstitutional infringing

their right to appoint, while running an aided School, which is their

fundamental right under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_24">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India; there

is no legislative competence to issue such rules, as the Act does not

under <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_25">Article 13</a> of the Constitution of India, which is capable of restricting

their fundamental rights; it runs contrary to the provisions in <a href="/doc/17002337/" id="a_26">Section 25</a> of

statutory preference enjoyed by claimants under Rule 51A, Rule 43, 51B is

taken away in order to protect the protected teachers. The retrospectivity

given to the rules from 29.01.2016 is also challenged pointing out that they

had already filled up the vacancies in June-July 2016. The extension of staff

fixation is also illegal, according to them. It is alleged that the Act or Rules

do not provide for any protection for protected teachers and therefore they

cannot be made liable to appoint such teachers. It is argued that each and

every provision in Ext.P8 amounts to interference to the right of the

Managers; their right to keep the teachers on probation is taken away; the

rules are contrary to the judgments of this Court in <a href="/doc/887223/" id="a_34">Assistant Educational

</p><p id="p_15">       14.     The main contentions of the petitioners are that (1) the

provisions in the impugned rules are those which are already set aside in the

common judgment dated 15.01.2015 in W.P(c).No.30107 of 2013 and

connected cases and in the judgment dated 17.12.2015 in Kerala Aided LP

&amp; UP Schools case; (2) it deprives the power of Managers to appoint and

to keep them under probation; (3) there is no legislative competence for

issuing the rules as the provisions in the Act do not provide for appointment

of protected teachers; (4) the rules affect the fundamental right of petitioners

under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_60">Article 19(g); (5)</a> it is violative of fundamental right of minorities

for implementing the rules; (8) Apex Court has stayed the operation of

clause (v) and (vi) of Government Order dated 12.1.2010 upheld in the

judgment in NSS case (9) the judgment in NSS case cannot be relied on as

it is rendered without noticing another judgment of the Division Bench on

orders on the same issue are in force when the rules are issued; (10)

impugned rules cannot be applied to the educational agencies which have

acted in obedience to the directions of Government and from which no

teacher is included in Teachers' bank and they cannot be penalised for the

disobedience of others.
</p>
<p id="p_16">       15.     In order to consider these contentions, I shall examine the

provisions contained in Ext.P8 amendment rules. Rule 7, which is the sole

provision in Chapter XXI, sustained in the judgment in Kerala Aided LP &amp;

UP schools case, is substituted with 10 sub rules. In Chapter XXIII, item

</p><p id="p_17">(iii) to clause (b) of Rule 1 and item (iv) in Rule 5 are inserted by which

additional posts of LPSA and UPSA can be sanctioned when Headmasters

are given exemption from class charges, in the Lower Primary School and

Upper Primary School respectively, when the strength of pupils in the L.P

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases              29</span>

School with standard I to IV or I to V exceeds 150 and when the strength of

pupils in an Upper Primary School having standards V to VII exceeds 100

or in a school having standard I to VII if the strength exceeds 150 from

standard I to V or 100 from standard V to VII. Sub Rule 1 of Rule 7

provides that such additional posts of LPSA and UPSAs shall be filled up

from the list of protected teachers maintained under the Teachers' bank, with

permission of Deputy Director of Education. Rule 7 of Chapter XXI of

KER introduced as per the 2014 Amendment Rule, provided for filling up of

such vacancies also, along with leave vacancies and short term vacancies

arising on deputation, by appointment of protected teachers from Teachers'

bank. Prior to amendment by Ext.P8, Rule 7 read as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "7. Appointments to vacancies occur due to exemption of Head Teacher
       from class charges as per R.1b(iii) &amp; (iv) Chap.XXIII, leave vacancies and
       short term vacancies including vacancies of teachers deputed for training
       shall be filled up from among the list of fully qualified hands supplied
       from Teachers Bank. The Teachers Bank is a temporary arrangement for
       retaining excess teachers for suitable deployment to schools. The
       eligibility criteria of teachers for inclusion in Teachers Bank and the
       guidelines for their deployment shall be decided as per the orders issued by
       Government from time to time. Appointment from Teachers Bank shall
       have no claim for future appointment in schools other than their schools."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_18">The vacancy arising out of the exemption from class charges to

Headmasters is one such vacancy mentioned in Rule 7 of Chapter XXI of

KER, introduced in 2014 amendment. When sub rule 1 is read with sub rule

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         30</span>

5, it is seen that the appointment against the first among the two posts of

LPSA/UPSA sanctioned in a School shall invariably be filled up by a

protected teacher from the teachers' bank even if there are claimants under

Rule 43, 51A and 51B of Chaper XIVA of KER. In the light of the findings

in paragraphs 63 and 64 of the judgment in Kerala Aided LP &amp; UP School

case, which sustained Rule 7 of the rules, the contentions raised by the

petitioners as against sub rule 1 cannot be accepted.    I shall deal with the

contention regarding the curtailment of the right of Managers to appoint and

regarding the reliance placed on the judgment dated 15.1.2015 in W.P.(C).

No.30107/2013 separately.
</p>
<p id="p_19">       16.     Sub rule 2 of Rule 7 provides for filling up of additional posts

arising out of staff fixation by appointing protected teachers from the

Teachers' bank and by appointing teachers otherwise than from Teachers'

bank in the ratio of 1:1. Main contention raised against sub rules 1 and 2

was that protected teachers from the Teachers' bank i.e, those who were

appointed by other managements, are given priority over the statutory claim

holders under Rules 43, 51A and 51B of the same educational agency. The

provision for appointment of protected teachers against vacancies arising

from 2010-11 onwards was upheld by this Court in the judgment in NSS

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         31</span>

case, where no preference was given to the statutory claimants. The

provision contained in sub rule 2 is the same as the one contained in


paragraph (vi) of the G.O.(P) No.10/10/G.Edn dated 12.01.2010. Such a

provision introduced by an executive order was upheld in the judgment of

the Division Bench in NSS case. In the present case such a provision is

provided by statutory rules.
</p>
<p id="p_20">       17.     Sub Rule 3 of Rule 7 provided that appointments in all the

vacancies arising in the Schools upgraded/newly opened after 22.05.1979,

should be made from the list of protected teachers in the Teachers' bank,

subject to Rules 43, 51A and 51B of Chapter XIVA. In order to examine

this provision it is necessary to examine the liability of the upgraded/newly

opened Schools in Chapter V of KER which deals with opening and

recognition of Schools. Rule 6 of Chapter V provides for the documents

which      should      be    enclosed along    with     an   application  for

upgradation/opening of a school. Clause viii was inserted to that rule

insisting execution of an agreement by the applicants as a condition

precedent for permission for upgradation/opening of the new school.

Accordingly, all such applicants have executed agreements to the effect

that : "an agreement duly executed by the applicant to the effect that he is

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                     32</span>

prepared to absorb qualified teachers/non-teaching staff who, after putting

in service of 2 years and drawing 2 vacation salaries, have been retrenched

from any of the aided high schools in the Education district or aided primary

schools in the Education Sub-district in which the applicant proposes to

open/upgrade the school". A Division Bench of this Court in

<a href="/doc/1680750/" id="a_62">Rev.Fr.Kuriakose v. State of Kerala</a>: 1981 KHC 294: 1980KLN 443,

held that the liability of minority educational institutions as well as non-

minority educational institutions which got its schools newly opened/

upgraded after executing agreement is one and the same and they are

equally bound to abide by the terms of the agreement which includes

absorption of protected teachers. In that case, the managements challenged

paragraph 22 of that judgment, the Division Bench held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">       "xxxxIt is sufficient to say that having obtained advantage by reason of consenting to
       absorb the protected teachers and non - teaching staff it may not now be fair to seek
       relief from this Court to avoid the consequences of the agreement entered into by the
       petitioners on the plea of violation of the minority rights under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_63">Art.30(1)</a> of the
       Constitution of India."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">It is pertinent to note the issue which arose for consideration in Rev.Fr.

Kuriakose' case, as seen from paragraph 3 of the judgment, which reads:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">         "3.xxxBut they claim that the agreements are hit by <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_64">Art.30(1)</a> of the
         Constitution since the effect of requiring the petitioners to execute such
         agreements was to compel them to give up the fundamental right guaranteed to
         them under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_65">Art.30(1)</a> of the Constitution to establish and administer their
         educational institutions. They claim that they are free to challenge the
         amendment brought about to Chapter V R.6 of the Kerala Education Rules by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                        33</span>

        Ext. P1 notification. They also claim that the insistence by the Educational
        authorities to appoint protected teachers from the list maintained by the
        respective educational officers of the Districts were clearly violative of the
        fundamental right of the petitioners as minorities under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_66">Art.30(1)</a> of the
        Constitution. It is said that the right to appoint teachers of their choice in the
        schools established by them is one which cannot be trespassed upon and
        inasmuch as by the amendment of the Rule impugned and insistence upon
        execution of the agreement the petitioners have been prejudiced, they should
        not be asked to face the consequence of non approval of appointments made
        by them despite the agreements entered into by them in exercise of their
        minority rights."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">The contention of the Managers of minority school, on the transgression

over their right and on the compulsion to appoint teachers from the list of

protected teachers whose character and antecedents are not known to them,

were also repelled. <a href="/doc/96547712/" id="a_67">In Rajan Pillai v. State of Kerala</a>: 1990(1) KLT 544,

this Court upheld the power of the Government to compel the Managers to

appoint retrenched teachers against vacancies arising in their schools,

pointing out that the liability is not confined only to one vacancy. The

contentions raised by the managements in those cases when they challenged

sub rule (viii) of Rule 6 of Chapter V, is evident from paragraph 9 of the

judgment. The relevant portion of the judgment read as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                    "Counsel for the petitioner urged, that after passing Ext. P1 order, the
        only manner in which recognition could be withheld is by withdrawal under R.22,
        R.22A or 23 of the Rules, after due compliance with the requirements of those
        rules. But R.17 provides for conditions to be satisfied for grant of recognition. Sub-
        rule (iii) thereof requires, that teachers must have been appointed in accordance with the
        relevant provisions in the Kerala Education Act and the Rules thereunder. S.13 of the
        Kerala Education Act provides, that: -
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        "Where any retrenchment of teachers in any aided school is rendered necessary
        consequent on orders of the Government relating to the course of studies or scheme
        of teaching or of such other matters, it shall be competent for the Government or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                       34</span>

        the manager of an aided school to appoint such teachers in any Government school
        or aided school, as the case may be."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">        The Manager is obliged by reason of R.17(iii), which I have referred to above, to
        comply with the direction to appoint retrenched teachers of any aided school or
        Government School in his School. As long as the petitioner does not comply with
        that condition, he cannot insist upon grant of recognition.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        10. xxxx I am inclined to hold that the respondents had necessary power to
        substitute one protected teacher with another and the Manager was bound by the
        terms of the agreement, which he executed under R.6(viii) of Chapter V of the rules
        to appoint that substitute, in view of the fact that the first appointment was not
        effective. I am also inclined to accept the alternative submission urged by
        Government, that the agreement which the petitioner executed, obliged him to
        absorb qualified retrenched teachers of aided schools in the educational district. The
        obligation was not confined to one teacher. The power which the petitioner gave by
        reason of executing the agreement to the respondents would not be exhausted by its
        first exercise. It is available for exercise as and when necessary. It was available on
        subsequent occasions as well. One of the conditions which the Manager had to
        satisfy to obtain recognition is that teachers must have been appointed in
        accordance with the relevant provisions under the Kerala Education Act and the
        Rules thereunder. Even without the assistance of the agreement, it was open to the
        respondents to require the Manager to appoint a teacher retrenched from an aided
        school consequent on orders of the Government relating to course of studies or
        scheme of teaching or such other matters."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_23">The judgment in Rajan Pillai's case (supra) was affirmed by the Division

Bench in its judgment dated 31.05.1999 in W.A.No.202 of 1990 upholding

the power of Government to direct the Managers to appoint protected

teachers, in the light of <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_68">Section 13</a> of the Act and in the light of the

agreement executed by the Managers. Contentions were advanced on behalf

of some of the petitioners pointing out that the agreement executed by them

was to appoint the protected teachers who had drawn 2 vacation salary; they

are not bound by the changes brought about in the eligibility to be termed as

a protected teacher and that they are not bound by unilateral agreements.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         35</span>

It is pertinent to note that Sub rule (viiii) was further amended in 2010,

extending the liability to absorb any retrenched teaching or non-teaching

staff who are eligible for protection as per orders issued by the Government

from time to time. It further provides that such orders shall form part and

parcel of such agreement as if they were incorporated in the agreement.

Thus the schools upgraded/newly opened subsequent to 22.05.1979 have

executed agreements with Government and they are bound by the deemed

terms of such agreements as provided in the sub rule viii. The petitioners

did not have any complaint against the amendment effected in the year

2010. In the above circumstances, the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1787277/" id="a_69">Zile

Singh v. State of Haryana</a> : (2004) 8 SCC 1, or the judgment of the

Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/76232/" id="a_70">Fr. Mathew Maleparambil v. State of

Kerala</a>:(4) KLT643 cannot be applied in this case. Contention is that there

was no amendment to Rule 6 (viii) of Chapter V of KER subsequent to

1.6.2011. The judgment in Fr. Mathew Maleparambil was rendered with

reference to the provisions in the agreement entered into between the aided

colleges and Government, where it was held that Government cannot

impose unilateral conditions. But that agreement was not covered by a

statutory provision like Rule 6(viii), which by way of amendment effected

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         36</span>

in 2010, deems the orders issued by Government from time to time

regarding retrenched/protected teachers, part of the agreement.          The

contention that minority educational institutions cannot be compelled to

appoint protected teachers was also repelled by the Division Bench of this

Court in Fr. Kuriakose' case as well as NSS case. Contention now raised by

the petitioners that the protection available at the time when they executed

agreement was only to those teachers having two years' service and that they

are not liable to absorb the teachers who got protection merely by one year

service, cannot also be accepted, because they have to abide by the orders

issued by Government. It is also relevant to note that in Rajan Pillai's case,

which was affirmed by the Division Bench, this Court had found that

<a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_71">Section 13</a> of the Act fastens a liability on the Managers to appoint the

retrenched teachers. Rule 5A of Chapter XIVA provides that preference

shall be given to teachers who were retrenched by the opening of new

schools, etc., for appointment in future vacancies in the same or other

educational agencies. Under Rule 7 of Chapter XIVAof KER, the Managers

have to issue an appointment order to the teacher in Form 27. The

declaration to be furnished in Form 27 is: "This appointment is subject to

the provisions in the Kerala Education Act and the rules thereunder and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                 37</span>

such other rules and orders issued from time to time by the Government or

other competent authority. xxx". Before approving such appointments, the

educational officer has to certify that the said appointment has been made

after satisfying that there is no qualified person retrenched from any of the

aided High Schools in the education district or aided primary schools in the

education sub districts after putting in two years of service and drawing 2

vacation salaries is available for absorption to the post in the School. Rule

5A and conditions in form 27 are to be observed by the Managers of all

schools, as held in Manager, Eravannoor AUP School, Kozhikode &amp;

others v. State of Kerala &amp; others: ILR 2011 (2) Ker 301, by a learned

Single Judge of this Court while considering the validity of G.O.(P)

10/10/G.Edn dated 12.01.2010. These findings are upheld in the judgment

in NSS case. In paragraph 44 of the judgment, the Division Bench held as

follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                 "Even otherwise, the mere absence of an agreement in terms of Clause

        teaching staff from any of the aided high schools in the Education District or
        aided primary school in the Education Sub District, will not in any manner
        absolve the Managers of the aided schools from the statutory obligation to absorb
        such protected hands, in view of the mandate of S.13 of the Act, read with sub-
        rule (1) of R.1 and R.5A of Chapter XIVA of KER. On this ground as well, the
        challenge made against Clauses (v) and (vi) of GO dated 12/01/2010 cannot be

<p id="p_24">In the light of the aforesaid judgments, the provision in sub rule 3 insisting

filling up of vacancies in the Schools which are newly opened or upgraded

after 22.5.1979 i.e, after the introduction of the provisions contained in sub

rule (viii) of Rule 6, by appointing protected teachers from the teachers'

<p id="p_25">       18.     Sub rule 4 of Rule 7, provides for filling up of short term

vacancies arising out of leave, deputation for training having duration of

one academic year and above,          by appointing protected teachers from

Teachers' bank, with the permission of Deputy Director of Education. It also

provides for appointing teachers from the Teachers' bank of other revenue

districts in the event of non-availability of a teacher in the same category in

the same revenue district. The provision to fill up short term vacancies by

protected teachers was part of Rule 7 inserted by 2014 Amendment Rules

and it was upheld in paragraphs 63 and 64 of the judgment in Kerala

Aided LP &amp; UP School's case. The only addition is the liability to appoint

protected teachers of other districts also in the case of their non-availability

in the district, for which also there cannot be any valid objection.

</p><p id="p_26">       19.     Sub rule 5 starts with a non obstante clause, providing that the

posts on the basis of exemption of class charges to head teacher (i.e the

appointments covered by sub rule 1 of Rule 7) shall be filled up only by a

protected teacher, notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 43, 51A and

51B of Chapter XIVA. Going by this provision it would appear that as far as

the 2nd post covered by sub rule 1 is concerned, appointment shall be made

subject to Rules 43, 51A and 51B. As already found this is a provision

which was already upheld in paras.63 and 64 of the judgment in Kerala LP

&amp; UP school case, relying on NSS case which had upheld the appointment

of protected teachers.
</p>
<p id="p_27">       20.     Sub rules 6 and 7 only provide that the vacancy caused by the

relief of a protected teacher has to be filled up by another protected teacher

from the Teachers' bank and that the protected teachers appointed from the

Teachers' bank would not have any claim for appointment in any school in

any future vacancies other than their parent school. Such a provision is

already upheld in Rajan Pillai's case (supra) as upheld by the Division

Bench. Once the provision for appointing protected teachers is sustained,

the liability to fill up the vacancies on the relieving of protected teachers

cannot be said to be illegal.
</p>
<p id="p_28">       21.     Sub Rule 8 provides that in the absence of protected teachers in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         40</span>

the Teachers' bank of a particular revenue district, the Managers shall

appoint protected teachers of other districts and in the absence of such

teachers even in other districts, Managers shall fill up the vacancies

otherwise, with the permission of the Director. However vacancies covered

by sub rules 1 and 2 shall not be filled up like that and those vacancies shall

be filled up only in accordance with the orders issued by Government from

time to time. When the Managers are liable to appoint protected teachers,

the provision to appoint them even from the list of other districts cannot

also be found to have any illegality. The liability to appoint protected

teachers from other district is already there on the Managers of the schools,

newly opened/upgraded subsequent to 25.02.1979. The liability of others

come under <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_72">Section 13</a> and rule 5A of Chapter XIVA of KER. However,

even when there is no protected teacher in any of the lists, it will be

arbitrary to ask the Managers not to make appointment against the vacancies

and to wait for orders of Government. Counter Affidavit does not explain

the intention of such a provision. Nothing is mentioned about the orders if

any issued by Government in this behalf and no such orders are also made

available. In the above circumstances, sub rule 8, to the extent it directs not

to fill up the vacancies covered by rule (1) and (2) even if there is no

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases           41</span>

protected teacher available in the teachers' bank maintained in any of the

districts, can only be said to be arbitrary.
</p>
<p id="p_29">       22. Sub rule 9 provides that the educational agencies having more

than one school shall not transfer the protected teacher appointed in one

school to another and the services of the protected teacher shall not be

terminated except with the prior permission of Deputy Director of

Education concerned. When the appointment of protected teachers in post

1979 schools is already governed by sub rule viii of Rule 6 of Chapter V of

KER and the appointment of the protected teachers from Teachers' bank is

confined to a particular school, the restrictions on their transfer to other

schools, can only be seen as a regulatory measure. Termination of service of

any teacher, requires prior permission from the educational officers.

Therefore, the conditions in sub rule 9 can only be termed as part of

regulatory measures.
</p>
<p id="p_30">       23.     Sub rule 10 makes the provisions relating to teaching staff

applicable to the non-teaching staff also. There cannot be any objection on

that provision, in view of Rule 7 of Chapter XXIVB of KER which makes

the provisions in Rule XIVAof KER applicable to non-teaching staff.

retrenched due to division fall from schools of various aided educational

agencies and eligible for protection as per orders issued by Government

from time to time. It further provides that it is a temporary arrangement for

retaining the protected teachers for suitable appointment or deployment.

Under Note 2, the Deputy Director of Education of the concerned revenue

district is to enlist the teachers eligible for protection and the Managers are

to make appointments from such lists with the permission of the Deputy

Director. Note 3 enables Managers of minority educational institutions to

choose teachers from the Teachers' bank of any revenue district with the

permission of DPI. The provision for Teachers' bank is already upheld in

Kerala Aided LP &amp; UP schools case. The Managers of the minority

schools complain that their right to appoint is taken away arbitrarily, by

limiting the zone of selection to the Teachers' bank, pointing out that mere

right of choice will in no way dilute the rigor of that transgression. But it is

to be noted that the provisions contained in the agreement executed/to be

executed for upgradation/opening of new school by all the applicants are

one and the same irrespective of the status as to minority or majority. The

very same ground of attack was already repelled by this Court in Fr.

Kuriakose's case, as well as in the judgment in NSS case. By Note 3 they

are getting an opportunity to select any teacher in the State included in the

Teachers' bank, which is not available for others and which was not

available in G.O.(P) No.10/10.
</p>
<p id="p_32">       25.     The learned counsel for the petitioners pointed out that the

procedure for implementation or the consequences of non-implementation

are not provided and therefore these are vague in the absence of any

guidelines. It is also pointed out that there is no provision to gather the

service particulars or qualification of the teachers in the Teachers' bank. But

in the counter affidavit it is stated that the service particulars of the teachers

in the Teachers' bank are available in the offices of the Deputy Directors of

Education and that the procedure for filling up the vacancies by protected

teachers from the Teachers' bank would be issued from time to time by the

Government/Director of Public Instructions. The learned Advocate General

pointed out that these details are available in the website also. It is also

stated that all these teachers are those who got approval and therefore there

cannot be any dispute regarding the qualification. It is also stated that all of

them are teachers who got their probation declared. Therefore, the

contentions of the petitioners are untenable. However, Government has to

see that the educational officers are implementing Note 2 below Rule 7

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          44</span>

making available the subject wise list of teachers with their service

particulars, either in the website or otherwise, without giving room for

further complaints, well before the commencement of each academic year or

at least before 15th July of every year.
</p>
<p id="p_33">       26.     The amendments brought about in Chapter XXIII are in Rules

1, 5 and introduction of Rule 14A.       Item (iii) in clause (b) of Rule 1,

provides for sanctioning of one additional post of LPSA, when the

Headmaster is exempted from class charge, where the strength of pupils in

LP schools with standard I to IV or I to V exceeds 150. This provision is

incorporated in tune with the provisions contained in RTEAct, 2009. There

cannot be any objection over this. Item (iv) is added in Rule 5 of Chapter

XXIII, providing that subject to items (i) and (ii), one post of UPSA shall be

sanctioned additionally, where the strength of the pupils in a UP School

with classes V to VII exceeds 100 or in a UP school having classes I to VII

if the strength exceeds 150 from class I to V and 100 from V to VII, by

exempting the Headmaster from class charges. This provision is

incorporated in tune with the provisions contained in RTE Act, 2009, and in

tune with the directions in the Kerala Aided LP &amp; UP Schools case.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         45</span>

</p><p id="p_34">       27.     The last provision relates to staff fixation. As per Rule 14

Government could extend the ban on creation of posts, retrenchment of staff

etc., effected in Government Schools to aided Schools. By Ext.P8-the 2016

Amendment Rules, Rule 14A is inserted in Chapter XXIII, which provides

that notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 12 of Chapter XXIII and

Rule 3A of Chapter XXIVB, Government may, by notification in official

gazette extend the strength of teaching and non-teaching staff already

sanctioned in the Schools for the last year to subsequent year or years. At

the same time, the Note to the Rule provides that when such extension is

ordered, the educational officers have to see that there are sufficient

numbers of teachers in tune with the PTR in classes I to VIII and the

deficiencies shall be made good by appointing protected teachers from the

Teachers' bank. One objection raised was that though such extensions were

allowed under rules only after issuing notification in gazette, no such

gazette notification is published so far. It is also pointed out that similar

provisions were introduced by way of executive orders and thereafter in

2014 amendment rules were already held unsustainable in the judgments

dated 15.01.2015 and 15.12.2015. In the judgment dated 15.01.2015, the

extension of staff fixation was by executive orders and those executive

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                  46</span>

orders were set aside seeing that the field is governed by statutory rules. In

the 2014 amendment rules considered in Kerala Aided LP &amp; UP School

case, there was no provision like Rule 14 A with a non-obstante clause.

Moreover, it was found that such extension would violate the provisions in

the RTE Act. In Ext.P8 rules, even while permitting extension of the staff

fixation to subsequent years sufficient safeguard is provided as per the Note

in order to see that the PTR is maintained in tune with the provisions in RTE

Act, which was the main reason for interfering with the previous

amendment to Rule 12 in 2014 Rules in the judgment in Kerala Aided LP

&amp; UP schools case. In the counter affidavit it is stated that the extension of

staff fixation would not be a permanent arrangement and once the present

crisis which occurred to accommodate the teachers is met, the normal staff

fixation would be carried out from year to year. The learned Single Judge,

while dealing with the 2014 Amendment Rules, in the judgment in Kerala

aided LP &amp; UP School case supra, found as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">           51. xxxxx      The staff fixation under the newly introduced R.12 and the
           procedure delineated is proper, though the earlier Rule provided for more
           comprehensive checks and balances in so far as providing for cross
           verification, by way of re-visit and re-fixation, which is taken away in the
           new Rule. However, that is the prerogative of the Government which need
           not be looked into by this Court, which is not acting as a watch-dog, of
           how the Government functions and arranges its affairs. Prejudice,
           arbitrariness and unreasonableness being absent; this Court would not

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                 47</span>

           instruct the Government as to how the administration could be made more
           efficient; which would only infringe upon the executive powers. Suffice it
           to notice that even now scrutiny of staff fixation by higher officers is
           permitted by R.12C, re-fixation on ground of bogus admission by R.15 and
           under R.12E(3) based on an enquiry report, super check under R.16, all
           coming under Chap.XXIII.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">           52.     Despite the prescription with respect to staff fixation being found
           to be proper, this Court is unable to uphold the permanent fixation of
           strength of teaching staff as reckoned for the academic year 2010-2011.
           The same would run contrary to the prescription of the PTR, as per the
           KER and more so as per the RTEAct. The KER earlier provided for a PTR
           of 1:45, on which basis the staff fixation was to be made under the
           unamended R.12. When such PTR, or a divisional strength is prescribed
           by the rules with reference to which the probable divisions are to be
           determined and on which rests the fixation of staff strength; there cannot
           be a rule incorporated making the strength of teaching staff, permanent as
           on 2010-2011. The newly introduced Rule also contains a procedure by
           which the fixation of staff of each school has to be finalised by the
           Educational Officer, not later than 15th July of every year. This has to be
           done on the PTR, as contained in the KER and now, as contained in the
           RTE Act also. The fixation of a permanent staff strength as on 2010-11
           would also run against the provisions of the RTE Act. The adoption of
           2010-11 staff strength would run foul of S. 26 of the RTE Act which
           prohibits the vacancies of teachers in aided schools, remaining
           unfilled in excess of 10%. The vacancies are to be taken on the basis
           of the staff strength determined as per the PTR provided by the RTE
           Act. Hence, such prescription of permanent staff strength as
           reckoned, of the year 2010-2011, as per the unamended R.12, has to be
           struck down."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                                     (emphasis supplied)


It is therefore clear that the main reason for interference in that case was

non-compliance of the provisions in <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_73">Central Act</a>, 2009. At any rate, the

present amendment has brought in R.14A with non-obstante clause, coupled

with the note based on which the vacancies as per PTR has to be filled up by

appointing protected teachers.</blockquote><p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">       28.     In this context, it is pertinent to note that executive order issued

by     Government-G.O.(P).No.10/10/G.Edn            dated     12.01.2010,    which

provided, inter alia, for filling up the future vacancies in the ratio of 1:1

between protected teachers and other teachers was upheld by this Court in

the Eramanallur Schools' case and later by the Division Bench in NSS

case. The main contention raised in those cases was that such conditions

cannot be laid down by issuing executive orders.                 Repelling those

contentions, this Court held that the executive orders issued for regulating

the right of Managers of aided schools in making appointments do not

override statutory provisions in Act or Rules and that those orders are

perfectly within the competence even without any amendment to the rules.

The Division Bench after a discussion on the orders of ban issued by

Government from time to time since the year 1999, against creation of posts

in Government and aided Schools and about the conditional orders lifting

the ban, upheld those orders in the light of Rule 14 of Chapter XXIII of

KER. The Division Bench also noticed that the orders imposing the ban or

lifting the ban, issued during the period from 1999 to 2005 were never

under challenge. It was also noticed that the restriction imposed in the G.O.

(P)No.317/05/G.Edn. dated 17.08.2005 that the ban on creation of posts

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          49</span>

would continue in 2006-07 also, was upheld in the judgment dated

25.09.2009 in W.P(C).No.273/2007 and connected cases. The Division

Bench has considered the impact of the non-obstante clause contained in

Rule 14 of Chapter XXIII of KER, based on which the ban orders were

issued against creation of posts, retrenchment of staff etc. In the judgment in

the NSS case, the Division Bench analysed a catena of judgments on

interpretation of non-obstante clause starting from <a href="/doc/350457/" id="a_74">Aswini Kumar v.

Arbinda Bose</a> : AIR 1952 SC 369 to <a href="/doc/76417350/" id="a_75">State (NCT Delhi) v. Sanjay</a>, 2014

KHC 4558 : 2014 (9) SCC 772, in which it is held that a non-obstante

clause provides for overriding effect to certain provisions over the other

provisions either in the same enactment but in other enactment also. Going

by the very same interpretation, Rule 14A inserted by 2016 Rules by way of

its over-riding power makes the provisions contained in Rule 12, in

effective, permitting extension of Staff strength to subsequent year. It is

also pertinent to note that in paragraphs 22 to 27 of the judgment in NSS

case, it was held that Rule 14 of the Chapter XXIII, which begins with a

non-obstante clause empowered the Government to extend any ban on the

creation of posts, retrenchment of staff, etc., effected by them in

Government schools to aided schools and it has overriding effect over the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                  50</span>

other provisions contained in the KER, contrary to it. It was held that when

the liability to pay salary to the teaching and non-teaching staff appointed

by the Managers of aided Schools as enjoined in sub-section (1) of S.9 of

the Act was on Government, R.14, which was introduced by way of Kerala

Education (Amendment) Rules, 1969, empowers Government to extend the

ban on creation of posts. In paragraph 29 it was held as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">        "29. In the case on hand, going by R.23 of Chapter VI read with R.12 of Chapter
        XXIII of KER fixation of the strength of teaching staff in an aided school is
        based on the effective strength of class as on the sixth working day from the re
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">        -opening day in June. However, going by R.14 of Chapter XXIII of KER,
        notwithstanding anything contained in the KER, the Government is empowered
        to extend any ban on the creation of posts, retrenchment of staff, etc. effected by
        them in Government schools to aided schools. Since any reconciliation between
        these provisions would render the provisions of R.14 of Chapter XXIII of KER
        redundant and otiose. For all these reasons, the contention of the learned counsel
        for the appellants in WA Nos. 1027/2011 and connected cases that, R.14 of
        Chapter XXIII of KER is unconstitutional and opposed to R.23 of Chapter VI of
        KER and R.12 of Chapter XXIII of KER can only be rejected and we do so.,Any
        interpretation to the contra shall make R.14 redundant and otiose.</blockquote><p id="p_38">


</p><p id="p_39">       The aforesaid findings are applicable in this case also, when it comes

to Rule 14A.
</p>
<p id="p_40">       29.     Rule 14A introduced by 2016 amendment also starts with a

non-obstante clause, conferring power on Government to extend the staff

fixation orders for last year to the subsequent year or years notwithstanding

anything contained in Rule 12 of Chapter XXIII of KER. However such

extension has to be made by publication in gazette.                            Admittedly no

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          51</span>

publication is made in the gazette. The amendment rules were issued on

03.12.2016 and were brought into force on 29.01.2016. Even as per the

procedure prescribed as per Rule 14 Government could extend the ban on

creation of posts, retrenchment of staff etc., effected in Government Schools

to aided Schools. By Ext.P8-the 2016 Amendment Rules, Rule 14A

provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 12 of Chapter

XXIII and Rule 3A of Chapter XXIVB, Government may, by notification in

official gazette extend the strength of teaching and non-teaching staff

already sanctioned in the Schools for the last year to subsequent year or

years. Even as per the new procedure based on UID provided in Rule12(1)

</p><p id="p_41">(ii) (6), the fixation of staff in each school shall be finalised by the

educational officer not later than 15th of July every year and orders of staff

fixation shall take effect on the 15th July every year. The procedure

prescribed under this provision is not interfered with in the Kerala Aided

LP &amp; UP School case. Therefore, as on 15th July 2016 there was no rule

which permitted extension of staff strength. Even Ext.P8 rules provide for

extension only by notification in the gazette. It is settled law that when rules

require that a particular thing is to be done in a particular manner, it shall be

done only in accordance with that manner (See para 17 of <a href="/doc/92025453/" id="a_76">State of Kerala

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          52</span>

v. Kerala Rare Earth &amp; Minerals Ltd</a>., (2016) 6 SCC 323). The learned

Advocate General argued that Rule 12B is already deleted and therefore

there is no provision which provides for staff fixation from July 2015. Even

though Rule 12B is deleted, the requirement of finalisation of staff strength

before July 2015 continues. Rule 12B only provided that orders of staff

fixation take effect from 15th July of each year and for deemed creation of

additional posts with effect from the date of appointment in anticipation of

sanction of posts. Moreover, any gazette notification has to be done well

before the commencement of the subsequent academic year or 15th July of

subsequent year.
</p>
<p id="p_42">       30.     Arguments were raised by the petitioners pointing out the stay

order passed by this Court in a batch of cases where executive orders issued

by the Government on 29.01.2016 and thereafter on 05.08.2016 are under

challenge. Paragraph (iii)(2)(c) of G.O.(P)No.29/2016/G.Edn dated

29.01.2016 (Ext.P3) provided that vacancies arising in future in aided

Schools, shall be made in the ratio of 1:1 between protected teachers and

fresh hands in terms of the judgment in the NSS case. This provision to the

extent it relates to minority schools is kept in abeyance in a batch of writ

petitions.      Later        Government  issued      Ext.P6     order-G.O.(P)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                        53</span>

No.134/2016/G.Edn dated 05.08.2016 laying down the guidelines in respect

of staff fixation, deployment of protected teachers, etc. Clause 4 of Ext.P6

order provides that the staff fixation for the academic year 2015-16 shall

apply to the Academic Year 2016-17 also. This provision is also stayed in a

batch of cases, as per Ext.P7 order and similar other orders. As per order

dated 28.09.2016, the interim orders passed in these cases were modified,

taking note of the undertaking not to deploy persons who can be otherwise

retained in the schools, based on UID verification for the Academic Year

2016-17. It was observed that the apprehension of the petitioners regarding

deployment of those who are found surplus in the staff fixation 2015-16

need not subsist. The following order was issued :

        No.29/2016 dated 29.01.2016, and Clause (4) of GO(P) No.134/2016 dated 05.08.2016.

        authorities to comply with the statutory provisions with regard to the conduct of staff
        fixation in the various schools in the State, as contemplated under the KER.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                  When these matters came up for orders on 26.09.2016, the learned Advocate
        General, appearing on behalf of the official respondents, indicated that even the
        procedures for 2015-16 staff fixation have not been completed, and there are lot of
        teachers included in the deployment list whose deployments have not been completed. It
        was also pointed out that the Government has decided to amend the KER. Taking note of
        the submission of the learned Advocate General, it was pointed out by this court that,
        inasmuch as the operation of Clause (4) of GO dated 05.08.2016 has already been stayed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                       54</span>

        by this Court, the Government would necessarily have to issue instructions with regard
        to the completion of the staff fixation for the ensuing academic year namely; 2016-17,
        and further ensure that deployments of teachers are not carried out, based solely on the
        staff fixation orders in the various schools for the academic year 2015-16. It was then
        submitted by the learned Advocate General that instructions would begiven to the
        Government to ensure that verificationof the UID strength of students in the various
        schools for the academic year 2016-17is conducted within a specified period andfurther,
        that if on the basis of the said report, posts were found to be availableduring the
        academic year 2016-17, in the various schools, to accommodate teachers who were
        included in the deploymentlist pursuant to the staff fixation for the academic year 2015-
        16, they should be retained/sent back to the parent school, and salary should be paid to
        those teachers. It was also submittedthat, instructions would also be given that no
        deployment should be made without getting further instructions from the Office of the
        AdvocateGeneral.           It is now pointed out by the learned Government Pleader that,
        pursuant to the instructions sent from the Office of the Advocate General, the State
        Government has issued a communication dated 27.09.2016 to the Director of Public
        Instructions, Thiruvananthapuram to issue necessary directions to all educational
        officers to comply with the following instructions, namely:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">        (i)       Verify the UID strength of 2016-17 in all schools within two weeks and to
        submit a report.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">        (ii)      On the basis of the above report if there are posts in 2016-17 to accommodate
        those teachers, who are included in the deployment list of 2015-16, they shall be
        retained/sent back to their school and salary be paid to those teachers.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">        (iii)     Process of deployment shall be kept in abeyance until further orders.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">                  Taking note of the said instructions that have been issued by the Government to
        the Director of Public Instructions, Thiruvananthapuram, I am of the view that since the
        State Government has already undertaken not to deploy persons, who can otherwise be
        retained in the school, based on the UID strength verification for the academic year
        2016-17, the apprehension of the petitioners in these writ petitions, with regard to the
        deployment of teachers who are found surplus in the staff fixation of 2015-16, need not
        subsist. It is made clear that the arrangement indicated in the Government
        communication to the Director of Public Instructions, shall hold the field during the
        pendency of the writ petitions.

<p id="p_44"> Clause 4 of Ext.P6 order to extend the staff fixation of the previous year to

the subsequent year is given statutory force by inserting the same as Rule

14A with a non-obstante clause. The impact of such a non-obstante clause,

as already discussed by this Court in the NSS judgment with respect to Rule

14 applies with more vigour on Rule 14A also. When the judgment in NSS

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         55</span>

case was rendered while upholding the executive order, even in the absence

of a provision like Rule 14A, a non-obstante clause is inserted in the rules

which provides for extending the staff fixation for one year to one or more

subsequent years. In 2014 amendment rules such a non-obstante clause was

not available. The stay order passed by this Court against the executive

order will not stand in the way of amendment of the rules incorporating the

same provision as held in <a href="/doc/696885/" id="a_77">R.C. Tobacco (P) Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, (2005)

7 SCC 725. Therefore, Rule 14A is liable to be upheld. However, extension

can be done only on the basis of a notification in the gazette. It is pertinent

to note that Ext.P8 amendment rules were issued when Ext.P6 order was

already issued extending the staff fixation of 2015-16 to 2016-17. Despite

that the rules provide for gazette notification. Though the purpose of such a

notification would have been only for public notice and information and

when an executive order was already in force, since the rules are issued a

provision for publication in gazette, I am of the view that any such

extension can have effect from the date of notification in the gazette only in

tune with the procedure prescribed in the rules. Therefore, the statutory rule

could have been legally enforced notwithstanding the stay order, in case

there was a gazette notification.

provision in the Act relating to appointment of protected teachers.

Therefore, the rules cannot be framed for such matters. Therefore, it is

necessary to examine whether Government is not competent to make such

rules and whether such rules cannot be made with retrospective effect. Both

       make the law could not have been exercised in the circumstances which
       were prevailing at the time when it was made, or that a condition precedent
       to the making of the legislation did not exist, or that the authority which

       Court, the impugned provisions will not help to serve the object and
       purpose of the Act. So long as the body entrusted with the task of framing
       the rules or regulations acts within the scope of the authority conferred on
       it, in the sense that the rules or regulations made by it have a rational nexus
       with the object and purpose of the statute, the court should not concern

       would have to be Incorporated in the rules or regulations for the efficacious
       achievement of the objects and purposes of the Act. It is not for the Court

       be questioned on the ground that it does not conform to the statute under
       which it is made. It may further be questioned on the ground that it is
       contrary to some other statute. That is because subordinate legislation must
       yield to plenary legislation. It may also be questioned on the ground that it
       is unreasonable, unreasonable not in the sense of not being reasonable, but
       in the sense that it is manifestly arbitrary. In England, the Judges would say
       "Parliament never intended authority to make such rules. They are
       unreasonable and ultra vires."

<blockquote id="blockquote_29">               "A distinction must be made between delegation of a legislative
       function in the case of which the question of reasonableness cannot be
       enquired into and the investment by statute to exercise particular
       discretionary powers. In the latter case the question may be considered on
       all grounds on which administrative action may be questioned, such as,
       non-application of mind taking irrelevant matters into consideration, failure
       to take relevant matters into consideration, etc. etc. On the facts and
       circumstances of a case, a subordinate legislation may be struck down as
       arbitrary or contrary to statute if it fails to take into account very vital facts
       which either expressly or by necessary implication are required to be taken
       into consideration by the statute or, say, the Constitution. This can only be
       done on the ground that it does not conform to the statutory or
       constitutional requirements or that it offends <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_81">Art.14</a> or <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_82">Art.19(1)(a)</a> of the

       the Act; (2) it is opposed to the Fundamental rights; (3) it is opposed to
       other plenary laws. To ascertain whether a rule is ultra vires of the Act, the
       Court can go into the question (a) whether it contravenes expressly or
       impliedly any of the provisions of the statute; (b) whether it achieves the
       intent and object of the Act; and (c) whether it is "unreasonable" to be
       manifestly arbitrary, unjust or partial implying thereby want of authority to
       make such rules."

</p><p id="p_48">        32. The Preamble of the Kerala Education Act, 1958, would show

that the Act is enacted for the better organisation and development of

educational institutions in the State, by providing a varied and

comprehensive service throughout the State. Subsection 1 of Section 2 of

the Act defines aided School to mean a private school recognised by and is

receiving aid from Government. Educational agency is defined under

<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_83">Section 2(2)</a> as any person or body of persons permitted to establish and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        59</span>

maintain any private school under the Act. <a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_84">Section 2(8)</a> defines recognised

school as a private school recognised by Government under the Act.

Subsection 1 of Section 3 provides that Government may regulate the

primary and other stages of education and courses of instructions in

Government and Private Schools. Sub-section (2) provides that the

Government shall take, from time to time, such steps as they may consider

necessary or expedient, for the purpose of providing facilities for general

education, special education and for the training of teachers. Sub-section (3)

provides that the Government may, for the purpose of providing such

facilities (a) establish and maintain schools; or (b) permit any person or

body of persons to establish and maintain aided schools; or (c) recognise

any school established and maintained by any person or body of persons.

Sub-section (4) provides that all existing schools shall be deemed to have

been established in accordance with the Act.        Proviso to sub<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_85">section 4</a>

stipulates that the educational agency of an aided school existing at the

commencement of the section may, within one month of such

commencement, after giving notice to Government, opt to run the school as

a recognised school, subject to the condition that the services of teachers or

other members of the staff shall not be dispensed with or their conditions of

Sub-section (5) provides that after the commencement of the Act, the

establishment of a new school or the opening of a higher class in any private

school shall be subject to the provisions of the Act and the Rules made

thereunder and the school or higher class established or opened otherwise

than in accordance with such provisions, shall not be entitled to be

recognised by Government. Under subsection 2 of Section 7, the Managers

are responsible for the conduct of the school in accordance with the

provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder. Subsection 1 of Section 9

provides that Government shall pay the salary of all teachers in aided

Schools. Sub<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_86">section 2</a> provides for payment of salary of non-teaching staff

appointed in accordance with rules prescribed. Sub<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_87">section 3</a> provides for

payment of maintenance grant to the Managers at rates prescribed.

Sub<a href="/doc/30102403/" id="a_88">section 4</a> provides that Government may make grants in aid for the

purchase, improvement and repairs of any land, building or equipment of an

aided School. Under <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_89">Section 10</a>, Government shall prescribe the

qualifications for appointment of teachers in Government and private

<p id="p_49"><a href="/doc/106809565/" id="a_96">Section 36</a> of the Act empowers Government to make rules for the purpose

of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act either prospectively or

retrospectively. Sub<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_97">section 2</a> provides for the matters for which rules can be

made in particular, without prejudice to the generality of the power under

sub<a href="/doc/75854329/" id="a_98">section 1</a>.        Under sub<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_99">section 2</a>, rules can be made providing for

establishment and maintenance of schools, grant of aid, grant of recognition,

collection of fees, admission to schools, maintenance of records, submission

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        62</span>

allowed by the Act to be prescribed. <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_100">Section 11</a> of the Act itself provides

that appointment of teachers in aided Schools shall be made from among

persons having qualification provided under <a href="/doc/58320868/" id="a_101">Section 10</a>, subject to the rules

and conditions laid down by Government. Under <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_102">Section 12</a>, it is for the

Government to prescribe the rules. Therefore, Government is having every

authority to lay down conditions for appointment and also conditions of

service. Retrenchment as well as protection of the retrenched teachers is

coming under the purview of the conditions of service. Such conditions for

appointment can be laid down not only by rules but also by executive

orders. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is no power vested in

Government to make rules providing for appointment of protected teachers,

or for their appointment from a teachers' bank when there is no dispute over

the power of Government to prescribe the conditions of service. Therefore,

the contentions raised by the petitioners that Government has no power to

frame rules insisting appointment of protected teachers, cannot be accepted.

Apart from <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_103">Sections 11</a> and <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_104">12</a>, <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_105">Section 13</a> provides for absorption of

Chapter XIVAof KER to give preference to the teachers who are retrenched

by the opening of new schools or consequent to orders relating to course of

elaborately and in para.19 it was held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">        19. The provisions of the Kerala Education Act and the KER confer no
        absolute or unbridled right on the Manager of an aided school to make
        appointment of teachers and such power is regulated not only by the
        provisions the said Act and the Rules, but also by the executive orders issued
        from time to time by the Government and the competent authority. As we
        have already noticed, going by S.11 of the Act, any appointment of teachers
        in aided schools from among persons who possess the qualifications
        prescribed under S.10, can only be made subject to the rules and conditions
        laid down by the Government. Sub-rule (1) of R.1 of Chapter XIVA of KER
        provides that, whenever vacancy of teacher occurs, for ascertaining the
        availability of qualified hand and also for filling up vacancy the Manager
        shall follow the directions issued by the Government from time to time. Sub-
        rule (4) of R.1 provides further that, in determining the requirement of
        subjects, the Director of Public Instruction shall also issue such instructions
        as he may deem necessary for giving protection to those teachers enumerated
        in Clause 1 and 2 of the said sub-rule. Going by R.43 of Chapter XIVA of
        KER, promotion according to seniority to any higher grade of pay is made
        subject to consideration of efficiency and any general order that may be
        issued by the Government. Similarly, the retrenchment of junior hands under
        R.51 of Chapter XIVAof KER is made subject to the requirement of subjects
        determined by the Director of Public Instruction and also the instructions
        issued by him under sub-rule (4) of that Rule. Further, R.14 of Chapter XXIII
        of KER, which begins with a non obstante clause, empowers the
        Government, by orders, to extend any ban on the creation of posts,
        retrenchment of staff, etc., effected by them in Government schools to aided
        schools. Therefore, any executive orders issued by the Government laying
        down the conditions in the matter of appointment of teachers in aided
        schools; the method for ascertaining the availability of qualified hand and
        also for filling up vacancy; general orders on promotion to any higher grade
        of pay; extending any ban on the creation of posts, retrenchment of staff, etc.,
        effected in Government schools to aided schools; etc., in order to regulate the
        right on the Manager of an aided school to make appointment of teachers,

        cannot be termed as executive orders which override the statutory provisions
        under the Kerala Education Act and the KER. Similarly, the instructions
        issued by the Director of Public Instruction to determine the subject
        requirement, etc. cannot be termed as instructions contrary to the statutory
        provisions under the said Act and the Rules. Therefore, the contentions raised
        on behalf of the appellants that, the Government have no authority to issue
        executive orders regulating the right of the Manager of an aided school to
        make appointment of teachers, without making appropriate amendments to
        S.11 of the Kerala Education Act and also to the relevant provisions under the
        KER can only be rejected and we do so."</blockquote><p id="p_52">

of an executive order. Now rules are amended. The amendment rules 2016

have only imposed some more conditions for filling up the vacancies,

insisting appointment of protected teachers from teachers' bank against

certain vacancies, on given circumstances. It also provides for the extension

of staff fixation. The Government have explained the circumstances under

which the amendment became necessary. In paragraph 32, the Division

Bench has referred to the judgment dated 15.09.2009 in W.P(C).

No.273/2007 and connected cases dismissing the writ petitions filed by

Managers challenging clause (vi) of G.O dated 17/8/2005, by which the ban

imposed on appointment in additional division vacancies was extended to

2006-07, repelling their contention that the Managers were entitled to make

appointment against additional division vacancies in accordance with sub

rules 2 and 3 of Rule 12 of Chapter XXIII of KER, upholding the ban in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          66</span>

light of Rule 14 of that Chapter which contained a non-obstante clause. The

Division Bench approved that judgment and repelled the contention on

behalf of the Managers who pointed out that Rule 14 was not under

challenge, observing that the Rule 14 was already sustained in the judgment

in W.A.No.1027/2011 and connected cases. Therefore, it can be seen that

the protection of teachers was envisaged even at the time when the Act and

Rules were framed in 1958 and 1959 itself, as can be seen from <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_109">Section 13</a>

of the Act and Rule 5A of the Rules. Government have been issuing orders

regarding protection of teachers right from 1969. Apart from the statutory

requirement to appoint protected teachers in tune with the agreement under

rule 6(viii) of Chapter V of KER, Government had in                 G.O.(P)

No.178/2002/G.Edn dated 28.06.2002, directed the Managers of newly

opened Schools to fill up all the vacancies in their schools by appointing

protected teachers. Seeing the consistent disobedience towards that order,

another order - G.O.(P) No.46/2006/G.Edn dated 01.02.2006 was issued

directing    to     appoint   at least  one  protected  hand.  In   G.O.(P)

No.259/2006/G.Edn dated 12.10.2006 the Managers of all uneconomic

schools were directed to appoint protected hands only in the vacancies in

their schools. It is stated that by G.O.(P)No.317/05/G.Edn dated 17.08.2005

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        67</span>

appointments against additional division vacancies were banned in schools

from 2006-07 onwards. The consistent violation of that ban order led to

G.O.(P) No.10/10/G.Edn dated 12.01.2010 permitting approval on a bond

agreeing to appoint equal number of protected teachers. Future

appointments were to be made in the ratio of 1:1 between protected teachers

and others. Restriction on filling up of vacancies of teaching and non-

teaching posts was being issued directing the Managers to appoint protected

hands by way of statutory rule itself ever since the insertion of clause (viii)

of Chapter V of KER in respect of newly opened/upgraded schools on and

after 22.05.1979. Those provisions were already upheld in Fr. Kuriakose's

case and Rajan Pillai's case (supra), which justified the action of

Government in the light of <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_110">Section 13</a> of the Act and Rule 5A of Chapter

XIVA. The Division Bench has in the judgment in NSS case, scanned each

of the orders issued by Government right from 17.11.1999 to 2005,

imposing ban on creation of new posts in the schools, orders issued lifting

the ban, insisting prior approval of Government for appointments against

new division vacancies; Government order dated 17.08.2005 directing

sanctioning of additional divisions in accordance with the provisions in the

KER, for the year 2005-06 and approval of appointments against those

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          68</span>

vacancies, while directing that the orders of ban on appointment against

additional division vacancies shall continue from the academic year 2006-

07 onwards while upholding the G.O.(P)No.10/10 issued thereafter. When

<a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_111">Section 13</a> of the Act, Rule 1 and 5A of Chapter XIVA and Rule 6(viii) of

Chapter V of KER, which provide for appointment of protected teachers are

already available in the statute, the attack made against Ext.P8 amendment

rules either on the ground that it interferes with the right of Managers, it is

unconstitutional or vitiated by lack of legislative competence or on the

ground that it is not a law by which the fundamental right to <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_112">Article 19(1)(g)</a>

of the Constitution could be restricted, cannot be sustained. It is also

pertinent to note that none of the petitioners have any complaint against the

2nd proviso to Rule 43 of Chapter XIVA, which was inserted by G.O.(P)

No.187/05/G.Edn dated 17.06.2005 notified in gazette dated 25.06.2005

which provides that if the Headmaster or a teacher, who is promoted, faces

retrenchment he shall be reverted to the post from which he was promoted,

only if he is not eligible for protection in the retrenched post as per orders

issued by Government from time to time. The contention of the petitioners

the teaching and non-teaching staff and to ensure that the teachers working

in those institutions are governed by proper service conditions. The State

has ample power to regulate the method of selection and appointment of

teachers after prescribing requisite qualifications for the same. It was held

that rules and regulations that promote good administration and prevent

maladministration can be formulated so as to promote the efficiency of

teachers, discipline and fairness in administration and to preserve harmony

among affiliated institutions, without any interference to the constitution of

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">                  "129. <a href="/doc/337969/" id="a_128">In Papnasam Labour Union v. Madura Coats Ltd</a>. the Court on the base
         of earlier authorities summed up that when the constitutionality of a statutory provision
         is challenged on the ground of reasonableness of the restriction, the Court should
         evaluate whether the restriction is excessive in nature, existence of the reasonable nexus
         between restriction imposed and the object sought to be achieved, quality of
         reasonableness, felt need of the society and the complex issues facing the people which
         the legislature intends to solve, protection of social welfare prevailing within the social
         values, its consistency and accord with <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_129">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Additionally, the
         Court also observed that in judging the reasonableness of the restriction imposed by
         clause (6) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_130">Article 19</a>, the Court has to bear in mind the directive principles of State
         policy and any restriction so imposed which has the effect of promoting or effectuating
         a directive principle can be presumed to be a reasonable restriction in public interest.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">                  130. The principles as regards reasonable restriction as has been stated by this
         Court from time to time are that the restriction should not be excessive and in public
         interest. The legislation should not invade the rights and should not smack of
         arbitrariness. The test of reasonableness cannot be determined by laying down any
         abstract standard or general pattern. It would depend upon the nature of the right which
         has been infringed or sought to be infringed. The ultimate "impact", that is, effect on the
         right has to be determined. The "impact doctrine" or the principle of "inevitable effect"
         or "inevitable consequence" stands in contradistinction to abuse or misuse of a
         legislation or a statutory provision depending upon the circumstances of the case. The
         prevailing conditions of the time and the principles of proportionality of restraint are to
         be kept in mind by the court while adjudging the constitutionality of a provision regard
         being had to the nature of the right. The nature of social control which includes public
         interest has a role. The conception of social interest has to be borne in mind while
         considering reasonableness of the restriction imposed on a right. The social interest
         principle would include the felt needs of the society."</blockquote><p id="p_55">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">       "65. We may unhesitatingly remark that this doctrine of proportionality,
       explained hereinabove in brief, is enshrined in <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_132">Article 19</a> itself when we read
       clause (1) along with clause (6) thereof. While defining as to what constitutes a

       reasonable restriction, this Court in a plethora of judgments has held that the
       expression "reasonable restriction" seeks to strike a balance between the
       freedom guaranteed by any of the sub-clauses of clause (1) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_133">Article 19</a> and
       the social control permitted by any of the clauses (2) to (6). It is held that the
       expression "reasonable" connotes that the limitation imposed on a person in
       the enjoyment of the right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature
       beyond what is required in the interests of public. Further, in order to be
       reasonable, the restriction must have a reasonable relation to the object which
       the legislation seeks to achieve, and must not go in excess of that object (see
       <a href="/doc/61571/" id="a_134">P.P. Enterprises v. Union of India</a>). At the same time, reasonableness of a
       restriction has to be determined in an objective manner and from the standpoint
       of the interests of the general public and not from the point of view of the
       persons upon whom the restrictions are imposed or upon abstract
       considerations (see <a href="/doc/93885/" id="a_135">Mohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar</a>). <a href="/doc/34024737/" id="a_136">In M.R.F. Ltd. v.
       State of Kerala</a>, this Court held that in examining the reasonableness of a
       statutory provision one has to keep in mind the following factors:
       (1) The directive principles of State policy.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">       (2) Restrictions must not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature so as to go
       beyond the requirement of the interest of the general public.
       (3) In order to judge the reasonableness of the restrictions, no abstract or
       general pattern or a fixed principle can be laid down so as to be of universal
       application and the same will vary from case to case as also with regard to
       changing conditions, values of human life, social philosophy of the
       Constitution, prevailing conditions and the surrounding circumstances.
       (4) A just balance has to be struck between the restrictions imposed and the
       social control envisaged by <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_137">Article 19(6).</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">       (5) Prevailing social values as also social needs which are intended to be
       satisfied by the restrictions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">       There must be a direct and proximate nexus or reasonable connection between
       the restrictions imposed and the object sought to be achieved. If there is a direct
       nexus between the restrictions, and the object of the Act, then a strong
       presumption in favour of the constitutionality of the Act will naturally arise."

interest or social commitment behind the issuance of the impugned rules.

The reliance made on the judgment in           <a href="/doc/1120277/" id="a_138">Kerala Samsthana Chethu

Thozhilali Union v. State of Kerala</a> : (2006) 4 SCC 327, is misplaced, as

para.17 of that judgment only says that a rule should not only be in

conformity with the provisions of the Act under which it is made, but also

with the provisions of any other Act, as a subordinate legislation cannot be

violative of any plenary legislation made by Parliament or the State

Legislature. There the Apex Court was considering the validity of Rules 4

(2) and 9(10)(b) of the Kerala Abkari Shops Disposal Rules, 2002. As per

Rule 9(10)(b) the licensees were to absorb one arrack worker who remained

unemployed due to abolition of arrack shops, in their shops as decided by

the Government observing the district-level seniority of such arrack

workers. Such a provision was made in order to ensure that the employment

of workers of abolished toddy and arrack shops is protected. It was held that

there was no enabling provision in the Abkari Act to make such a rule. It

was found that rehabilitation of the workers in arrack shop was not within

the statutory scheme and, thus, the Rules are ultra vires the provisions of the

Act and the power under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/34630331/" id="a_139">Section 29</a> of the Act could be

resorted to only for the purpose of giving effect to the Act. But Ext.P8

amendment is a continuation of the provisions already in force, which were

either challenged and repelled or not challenged. It cannot be said that the

rules are issued not for the purposes of the Act,

</p><p id="p_59">       37.       Government have in their counter affidavit explained the

circumstances under which Government had to resort to the amendment of

the rules. The consistent disobedience towards the orders issued by

Government contrary to the provisions in the agreements executed by the

Managers, who filled up vacancies otherwise, resulted in a situation that a

number of teachers had to work in various schools without approval and

hence without salary. The Managers who were to fill up all the vacancies by

protected teachers were thereafter asked to appoint at least one protected

teacher as a condition for approving the appointments. Even then the

violation continued consistently resulting in production of a large number of

protected teachers.          Simultaneously, the reduction in pupil strength

consequent to the commencement of CBSE Schools, unaided Schools etc.

resulted in retrenchment of teachers. According to Government, the orders

of protection of teachers and the orders directing their appointments are

issued as a measure of social commitment. Teachers are inevitable part of

education. Their protection is also a necessity in organising education in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          75</span>

State. Except for R.14A and the retrospectivity, all these are provisions

closely connected or similar to the provisions which were upheld by this

Court in NSS case and Kerala Aided LP &amp; UP school case or which do not

have the objectionable parts found in the 2014 amendment and provisions

inserted with non-obstante clause.
</p>
<p id="p_60">       38.     It was contended that the amendment in Ext.P8 rules interferes

with or transgresses into the field of central legislation RTE Act 2009 and is

hence illegal, pointing out the provisions contained in subsection 2 of

Section 25 of the RTE Act. Sub<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_140">section 2</a> only provides that for the purpose

of maintaining the Pupil-Teacher Ratio, no teacher posted in a school shall

be made to serve in any other school or office or deployed for any non-

educational purpose. By Ext.P8 amendment sufficient safeguards are

already given to strictly adhere to the PTR. Ext.P8 rules do not in any

manner direct or provide for deployment of any teacher for any non-

educational purposes. It also does not provide for retention of any teacher in

the same school, even when the strength of pupil does not justify the

sanctioning of the same. Therefore, Ext.P8 rules cannot be said to be a

transgression to the field occupied by <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_141">Central Act</a>.

<p id="p_61">       39.     Next questions which arise for consideration are with respect to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        76</span>

retrospectivity given to the amendment rules from 29.01.2016 and the right

of minority educational institutions if any for exemption from the

provisions/right of Government to impose conditions on them. In order to

implement the directions contained in the judgment in Kerala Aided LP &amp;

UP School's case, Government issued Ext.P3 order on 29.01.2016, laying

down the guidelines on various aspects including protection of teaching and

non-teaching staff, fixation of staff for the years 2011-12 onwards upto

2015-16, approval of appointments, deployment of excess hands, method of

appointment, conditions of service of protected teachers, general guidelines,

appointments of specialist teachers/in uneconomic schools/in leave

vacancies, etc., in tune with the directions contained in the judgment in

Kerala Aided LP &amp; UP School case. By Ext.P6 order issued on

07.08.2016, Government issued guidelines for deploying the staff who were

rendered excess consequent to the staff fixation proceedings issued on the

basis of Ext.P3 order. Specific directions were given that the vacancies

arising on account of sanctioning of posts on exemption of class charge to

Headmasters and all existing vacancies shall be filled up by protected

teachers. It was directed that the 1st of every two additional division

vacancies should be filled up by protected teacher. It was also ordered that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        77</span>

the staff fixation for the year 2015-16 will continue for 2016-17 also. That

part of the order was stayed by this Court in a batch of cases. Amendment

rules were issued on 03.12.2016, incorporating these provisions regarding

the filling up of vacancies contained in Ext.P3 order with effect from the

date of that order. The provision for extension of staff fixation for a

particular year for subsequent year is also incorporated as Rule 14A of

Chapter XXIII of KER. Despite these, the Managers filled up the vacancies

in total disregard of Ext.P3 order, by the time Ext.P8 rules were issued.

According to them, under subrules 3 and 5 of Rule 9, the Managers are duty

bound to provide sufficient number of staff after verifying the staff position

of the School in conformity with the number of class divisions. But what is

provided in Sub rule 1 of Rule 9 of Chapter III is that the Manager shall be

responsible for the conduct of the school strictly in accordance with the

provisions of the Kerala Education Act and Rules issued thereunder and that

he shall abide by the orders that may be issued from time to time by the

Government and the Department in conformity with the provisions in the

Act and Rules. Sub rule 3 also provides that Manager shall provide staff as

per the rules and orders issued from time to time. The power of the

Manager to fill up the vacancies is subject to the provisions in the Act, the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases        78</span>

Rules as well as the executive orders issued from time to time. Managers'

duty under sub Rule 5 is to verify the staff position in conformity with the

divisions are sanctioned, they filled up the vacancies. As per Rule 12B

which was deleted by 2014 Amendment, the orders of staff fixation were to

take effect from 15th July of every year and appointments made against

anticipated vacancies were to be effective from the date of appointments.

The deletion of Rule 12 B was sustained by this Court. As at present there

is no provision which provides for approval of appointment from the date of

appointment. Therefore, the illegal appointments made by the Managers

cannot be a factor for determining the validity of Ext.P8 Rules. The right of

Government to frame rules retrospectively was upheld by this Court and the

Apex Court time and again. As argued by the learned Advocate General,

this Court has in the judgment in <a href="/doc/1656190/" id="a_142">Bindu Thomas v. State of Kerala</a> : 2003

(3) KLT 217, upheld the amendment effected to the qualification for

appointment as H.S.A with retrospective effect, as it was permissible under

<a href="/doc/106809565/" id="a_143">Section 36</a> of the Act and it was held that the fact that it adversely affected

          policy formulated by the Central and the State Government of Assam for the
          development of that State. The obvious intention behind the grant of the package of
          incentives including an exemption from payment of excise duties was to stimulate
          further industrial growth in the area with enduring benefits not only to the local
          populace by way of employment opportunities but also to the economic welfare of
          the State. The State Government's insistence from the very outset on the need to
          regulate the industries which were claiming the benefit of the exemption was to
          ensure that these objects were attained. According to the Union of India the
          exemption notification, at least as interpreted by the High Court, did not effectuate
          that intent. As it transpired, none of the industrial units manufacturing cigarettes
          were prepared to contribute to this object and their investment in the manufacture
          of cigarettes was co-extensive with the period of the exemption. The loss of
          revenue suffered by the Union and the State by the various subsidies and
          exemptions granted was the quid in return for which the petitioners were not
          prepared to suffer any quo. With the withdrawal of the exemption, all of them
          without exception immediately closed down their cigarette manufacturing units and
          a large majority have shifted out of the State. Clearly, if the grant of the exemption
          had operated as it was intended to, it would have been unnecessary to enact Section

          it   stood. Yet the respondent can contend that the words should have been used in
          the exemption so as to provide for sufficient safeguards to ensure that the benefit of
          exemption was granted only to those industries which would in turn permanently
          invest in the State. By the retrospective enactment this defective expression of the
          object of the policy, was rectified.

          Act, 1944 as a delegate of Parliament. In a cabinet form of Government, the
          executive is expected to reflect the views of the legislature. It would be impossible
          for the legislatures to deal in detail and cater to the innumerable problems which
          may arise in implementing a statute. When the power of subordinate legislation is
          conferred by Parliament in certain matters it can only lay down the policy and
          guidelines and expect that what is done by the executive is in keeping with such
          policy. It does of course retain control over its delegate and can exercise that control
          by repealing the action of the delegate. Consequently, if the executive has failed to
          carry out the object of Parliament, such control may be exercised by retrospectively
          enacting what the executive ought to have achieved.

Apex Court in <a href="/doc/512761/" id="a_148">T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka</a> : (2002) 8

SCC 481 held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">                 117. While considering this right to administer, it was held that the
        same was not an absolute right and that the right was not free from regulation.
        While referring to the observations of Das, C.J., in Kerala Education Bill, 1957
        case it was reiterated in St. Xaviers' College case that the right to administer
        was not a right to maladminister. Elaborating the minority's right to administer
        at SCR p. 196, it was observed as follows: (SCC p. 748, para 30)
                 "The minority institutions have the right to administer institutions. This
        right implies the obligation and duty of the minority institutions to render the
        very best to the students. In the right of administration, checks and balances in
        the shape of regulatory measures are required to ensure the appointment of
        good teachers and their conditions of service. The right to administer is to be
        tempered with regulatory measures to facilitate smooth administration. The
        best administration will reveal no trace or colour of minority. A minority
        institution should shine in exemplary eclecticism in the administration of the
        institution. The best compliment that can be paid to a minority institution is
        that it does not rest on or proclaim its minority character."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_48">                 118. Ray, C.J., concluded by observing at SCR p. 200, as follows:
        (SCC p. 752, paras 46-47)
        "46. The ultimate goal of a minority institution too imparting general secular
        education is advancement of learning. This Court has consistently held that it is
        not only permissible but also desirable to regulate everything in educational
        and academic matters for achieving excellence and uniformity in standards of
        education.

        read subject to the power of the State to regulate education, educational
        standards and allied matters. In this connection, at SCC pp. 598-99, para 59, it
        was observed as follows:

        right to minorities whether religious or linguistic, to administer educational
        institutions and the power of the State to regulate academic matters and
        management is now fairly well settled. The right to administer does not include
        the right to maladminister. The State being the controlling authority has right
        and duty to regulate all academic matters. Regulations which will serve the
        interests of students and teachers, and to preserve the uniformity in standards of
        education among the affiliated institutions could be made. The minority
        institutions cannot claim immunity against such general pattern and standard or
        against general laws such as laws relating to law and order, health, hygiene,
        labour relations, social welfare legislations, contracts, torts etc. which are
        applicable to all communities. So long as the basic right of minorities to manage
        educational institution is not taken away, the State is competent to make
        regulatory legislation. Regulations, however, shall not have the effect of

judgment, the Apex Court in para.103 of the TMA Pai's case held that the

right under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_153">Article 30(1)</a> cannot be such as to override the national interest

or to prevent the Government from framing regulations in that behalf,

though Government regulations cannot destroy the minority character of the

institution and that the right under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_154">Article 30</a> is not so absolute as to be

above the law. In paragraph 107, the Apex Court held as follows:

          regulation whatsoever. As already noted hereinabove, in Sidhajbhai Sabhai
          case it was laid down that regulations made in the true interests of efficiency
          of instruction, discipline, health, sanitation, morality and public order could
          be imposed. If this is so, it is difficult to appreciate how the Government can
          be prevented from framing regulations that are in the national interest, as it
          seems to be indicated in the passage quoted hereinabove. Any regulation
          framed in the national interest must necessarily apply to all educational
          institutions, whether run by the majority or the minority. Such a limitation
          must necessarily be read into <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_156">Article 30.</a> The right under <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_157">Article 30(1)</a> cannot

          <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_158">Article 30</a> is not so absolute as to be above the law. It will further be seen that

          equality with the majority and not intended to place the minorities in a more
          advantageous position vis-`-vis the majority. There is no reverse
          discrimination in favour of minorities. The general laws of the land relating to
          national interest, national security, social welfare, public order, morality, health,

          There can be checks on administration as are necessary to ensure that the
          administration is efficient and sound, so as to serve the academic needs of the

          teaching and non-teaching), regulations to prevent exploitation or oppression
          of employees, and regulations prescribing syllabus and curriculum of study

          teachers. None of these provisions are under challenge in any of the Writ
          Petitions from which the present Writ Appeals arise. The Managers of the
          aided schools have also not chosen to challenge the orders issued by the
          Government during the period 1999-2005, by which the Government lifted the
          ban on creation of posts, after imposing various conditions, including
          absorption of protected hands.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_71">The provisions for appointment of protected teachers have been inserted in

the rules, as a measure of social obligation in the interest of innumerable

teachers, who are facing retrenchment due to division fall from the aided

educational institutions whether it is run by minority or non-minority

communities. Any exemption to minority educational institutions from

appointing protected teachers will result in undue advantage to them and an

unreasonable burden on the non-minority institutions. It will also amount to

invidious discrimination, which is never intended by the makers of the

Constitution. Minority institutions are given the opportunity to opt from the

list of protected teachers, which is not available to others. The Teachers'

bank would be having teachers from all communities and from all types of

institutions. As the provisions in the Act, Rules and orders including

<a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_164">Section 13</a> of the Act and Rule 5A and the impugned amendment rules apply

to all schools including minority institutions equally, there cannot be any

exemption to the minority institutions from the application of the

amendment rules 2016. The Teachers' bank envisages inclusion of all

teachers coming under its parameters, irrespective of the Schools from

which they were retrenched. In the counter affidavit it is stated that there

are 2236 aided schools having minority status. The number of protected

teachers from 146 of such schools is 386 after the 2015-16 staff fixation.

The number of teachers being included in Teachers' bank is always on the

ascending order, as long as the management does not take any action to

protect the teachers, who happen to be retrenched from their schools, and

the rules governing staff fixation, method of appointment under them are the

same, they cannot have any special privilege and they cannot evade from

their responsibility in appointing the teachers from Teachers' bank. No

privileges can be granted to them by fastening liabilities on non-minority

institutions. There is no difference in financial burden of Government on

minority as well as non-minority schools. The eligibility for protection to

the teachers, who are retrenched from minority as well as non-minority

schools, is the same. Therefore, liability to accommodate them has to be

thrust upon minority as well as non-minority schools, without causing

undue advantages or disadvantages to any of such institutions. None of the

Managers of minority schools have a case that their teachers need not be

included in the teachers' bank, on retrenchment or that such teachers need

not be deployed. At any rate, there cannot be any unequal treatment on the

basis of the status of the institution.       The freedom of the minority

institutions to appoint the head of the schools who are administering their

schools is not in any way interfered with.

KLT 1021:1967KHC 316, that failure to place the rules before legislative

<a href="/doc/1524072/" id="a_167">K.T. Plantations (P) Ltd. v. State of Karnataka</a>: (2011)9 SCC 1, held that

it is a curable defect. Therefore, the contention that the rules are invalid for

non compliance of the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/102791117/" id="a_168">Section 37</a> of the Act cannot

be accepted.

protected teachers in the ratio of 1:1 is already upheld by a Division Bench

of this Court. The liability of the Minorities to appoint protected teachers

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases              87</span>

was upheld in it. The findings in the judgment of the learned Single Judge

in W.P.(C).No.30107 of 2013, while setting aside executive orders by which

staff fixation was extended and on the directions to fill up the vacancies by

protected teachers, etc. cannot be reasons for invalidating statutory rules.

The power to impose restriction on the right of Managers, though was

interfered with in that judgment, it was upheld in the judgment in NSS case.

In the light of the dictum laid down in <a href="/doc/1732943/" id="a_169">Abdu Rahiman v. District Collector,

Malappuram</a>: 2009(4) KLT 485, I am bound to follow the judgment of the

          lack of power on the Judicial Magistrates to entertain applications for
          interim custody. The said declaration of law should prevail until it is
          unsettled by a Full Bench of this Court or by the Apex Court or by

for the reason that an unqualified teacher who worked in the school was not

given preference as provided in Rule 5 of Chapter XIVA, which came into

force on 02.02.1965.         Manager of the School filed the writ petition

challenging the same. The 3rd respondent therein, who objected to the

appointment, had rendered temporary service in the school in 1962-63 as an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         89</span>

unqualified teacher. The contentions of the respondents were to the effect

that by virtue of Rule 5, all the unqualified hands who worked as teacher,

were entitled to preference for re-appointment, irrespective of their dates of

initial appointments i.e whether before or after 02.2.1965. Rule 5 was

enforced only with prospective effect. The temporary appointment of

unqualified teachers was exclusively governed by Rule 2 of Chapter XXI of

KER, which provided that such teachers would not be entitled to any

preferential claim for future appointments/re-appointment by virtue of their

temporary unqualified service. Even after the introduction of Rule 5 in

Chapter XIVA, provision contained in Rule 2 of Chapter XXI continued to

be in force. Moreover, Rule 5 itself provided the benefit to those appointed

under Rule 2 of Chapter XIVA, which had also underwent amendment on

02.02.1965. The learned Single Judge had upheld the validity of the rule by

virtue of the rule making power under Rules 10, 11 and 12. The Division

Bench upheld the rule under <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_172">Section 12</a> only, while observing that orders

referred to in <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_173">Section 11</a> of the Act can only be in respect of procedural and

incidental matters like approval, fixation of staff strength, PTR,

circumstances under which appointments are to be made temporarily or

regularly, on probation, etc. It was held that the benefit of the rule would be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                    90</span>

applicable only to those appointed on or after 02.02.1965, the date of

introduction of Rule 5. It was held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_66">                  "13.     That takes us to the question whether the benefit conferred
          by R.5 of Chapter XIV (A) of the Rules can be claimed by persons who had
          put in temporary service as unqualified teachers during some period prior to
          the date of the introduction of the rule and were not in service in the schools
          concerned on such date.       In this context it becomes very material to
          remember that until R.5 came into force on 2.2.1965 temporary
          appointments of unqualified teachers were governed exclusively by the
          express stipulation contained in R.2 of Chapter XXI of the Rules that such
          person shall have no preferential claim for future appointment by reason of
          such temporary service. In making temporary appointments of unqualified
          teachers during the period prior to the introduction of R.5 both the Manager
          as well as the teacher concerned must be deemed to have entered into the
          arrangement on the basis of the specific condition contained in R.1 of
          Chapter XXI, namely that such teacher would have no right to preference in
          the matter of future appointment in the school. In respect of cases where the
          temporary appointments which were so made had already terminated and the
          teachers concerned had left the service of the respective schools prior to the
          introduction of R.5, the terms and conditions of their past service cannot be
          subsequently laid down by any rule framed under S.12 because that would
          clearly amount to giving retrospective effect to such rule so as to disrupt and
          rip open transactions which are past and closed."</blockquote><p id="p_76">

</p><p id="p_77">       47.      The judgment in NSS case, was rendered not on the basis of

<a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_174">Section 11</a> only. The Division Bench, upheld the rules after undertaking a

thorough analysis of relevant provisions in the Act, Rules and various

Government orders, relating to the issue. The executive order G.O(P).

No.10/2010/G.Edn. dt.12.1.2010, by which Government lifted the ban on

appointments on condition that Managers have to execute an agreement for

filling up equal number of vacancies by appointing protected teachers

and thereafter to apply the ratio of 1:1 between protected teachers and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases          91</span>

others against the vacancies arising thereafter. That order does not deal with

qualification of the teachers, as was considered in Rev.Fr.Xavier's case.

The factual circumstances arising in those cases are entirely different. On

that ground the contention of the petitioners, who themselves lost before the

Division Bench in that case, cannot be heard to contend that the said

judgment is per incurium. The contention that these cases are covered by

the Rev.Fr.Xavier's case cannot also be accepted. The arguments advanced

with respect to the inapplicability of the judgment in NSS case are therefore

unsustainable. The arguments relying on the judgment in <a href="/doc/73995974/" id="a_175">Fibre Boards Pvt

Ltd, Bangalore v. Commissioner of Income Tax</a>: 2015 (10) SCC 333,

asserting the requirement of consistency in the judgment in the light of Rev.

Fr. Xavier's case, pointing out that the judgment in NSS case is rendered on

inadvertence or oversight relying on paragraph 7 of the judgment of the

Apex Court in <a href="/doc/538289/" id="a_176">Mamleswar Prasad &amp; another v. Kanahaiya Lal (Dead</a>)

through Lrs: AIR 1975 SC 907 (1975 KHC 568), cannot also be accepted.

In Fibre Board's case, the issue was relating to decisions rendered

without considering a statutory provision - Rule A of the General Clauses

Act. In Mamleswar Prasad's case the Apex Court was dealing with an

identical issue which was already decided by that Court, on the request

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases         92</span>

for a consolidated hearing on all the cases. Facts of the present case do not

have any identity or similarity with Fr. Xavier's case. But it has got some

similarity with the NSS case. The judgment in NSS case was rendered on

the validity of an executive order, not only referring to <a href="/doc/15859491/" id="a_177">Section 11</a>, but also

the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/121712332/" id="a_178">Sections 12</a>, <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_179">13</a>, Rule 1 of Chapter XIVA, the

powers of the Managers in <a href="/doc/136667771/" id="a_180">Section 9</a> and various provisions contained in

Chapter III, the obligations of the Managers under various rules including in

clause (viii) of Rule 6 of Chapter V, <a href="/doc/45931968/" id="a_181">Section 13</a>, Rule 5 of Chapter XIVA

and also considering the executive orders relating to ban on appointments

and protection issued from time to time. These rules are either not

challenged or were sustained when challenged by rulings of Division Bench

and Full Bench. Moreover, going by the judgment of the Full Bench of this

Court in <a href="/doc/111747316/" id="a_182">Raman Gopi v. Kunhu Raman Uthaman</a>: 2011(4) KLT 458, I am


bound to follow the later judgment in NSS case.
</p>
<p id="p_78">       48.     Relying on para.11 of the judgment of the Apex Court in

<a href="/doc/327169/" id="a_183">Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Gurnam Kaur</a>: (1989) 1

SCC 101, it was argued by one of the learned Counsel for the petitioners

appearing for minority institutions, that the judgment in NSS case cannot be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">W.P(c).No.1356/2017 &amp; C/cases                  93</span>

relied on since it does not have the force of a judgment as no reason is

stated for distinguishing the judgments of the Supreme Court which

considered the right of minority educational institutions, though discussion

is made. I am unable to accept such a contention. In this context it is

relevant to note the following observations of the Division Bench while

repelling the contentions for the minority institutions.

</p><p id="p_79">          64. In the case on hand, as we have already noticed, the provisions of the Kerala
          Education Act and the KER referred to herein before, which empower the
          Government to insist absorption of protected teachers in aided schools, are neither
          under challenge nor a declaration sought for to the effect that, the aforesaid
          provisions of the Act and the KER are violative of <a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_184">Art.30(1)</a> of the Constitution of
          India and therefore, they can have no application to aided schools established and
          administered by religious or linguistic minorities. In such circumstances, the
          challenge made against Clauses (v) and (vi) of GO dated 12/01/2010, which form
          part of an executive order issued in exercise of the powers under aforesaid
          provisions of the Act and the KER, can only be rejected."
</p>
<p id="p_80">

The provisions which were already there prior to Ext.P8 rules are not under

challenge in these writ petitions also.
</p>
<p id="p_81">       49. The contention raised by the learned Advocate General that the

writ petitions are liable to be dismissed, for non-joinder of necessary parties,

without impleading the protected teachers party to the writ petition, cannot

be accepted, in the light of the                 judgment of the Apex Court in A.

</p><p id="p_83">       50.     The learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners in W.P.(c)

Nos.1432 of 2017 and 1489 of 2017 argued that the case of the petitioners

therein has to be considered separately, since there is no teacher retrenched

from that school so far and there had never been any violation of rules or

orders so far. There are other writ petitions also in which the petitioners

have claimed that they have been respecting the rules and orders of the

educational authorities on the question of appointment. At present all the

Managers, i.e those who did not fill up the additional division vacancies

contrary to the ban orders and those who did not contribute anybody to the

Teachers' bank, are treated equally. Though the Rules are issued by way of a

social security measure, I find force in the contention of the law abiding

Managers when the field is occupied by the invaders of law. Government

shall therefore make effective provisions to encourage such law abiding

Managers and make appropriate modifications in such cases by granting

them incentives/relaxation, along with the procedure to find out such

institutions.

is no protected teacher available in the Teachers' bank maintained in any of

provisions/appropriate modifications, to grant them incentives/relaxation on

the conditions for appointing protected teachers, within a period of three
