<p id="p_1">                             Arguments heard.
</p><p id="p_2">                             This Criminal Revision under Section 397 read with <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_1">Section 401</a> of
                      Cr.P.C has been filed against the order dated 15/12/2020 passed by 8th

                      Additional Sessions Judge, Chhatarpur in Sessions Trial No. 126/2016 by
                      which the trial Court by impugned order has framed the additional charge u/s
                      307/149 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a> with regard to Crime No. 13/2015 registered at Police Station
                      Orchha Road, District Chhatarpur.
</p><p id="p_3">                             The prosecution story, in brief, is that on 12/02/2015 between 4:30 PM
                      to 5 PM when the complainant Pratap was talking to Sukka Basore who
                      happens to be Panchayat Member at village Katra then present applicants
                      came there in Scorpio Jeep and started abusing, assaulting the complainant.
                      The complainant ran and reached to village Dhamchi where the applicants

                      started assaulting complainant&#x27;s brother Raja Bhaiya, father Dashrath, uncle
                      Dharmjeet by rod and lathi.      The matter was reported to concerning police
                      station.    The police investigated the matter and after conclusion of the
                      investigation, the challan of the criminal case has been filed before the Court
                      of learned trial Magistrate from whereby, the case was committed for its trial
                      to the Court of Sessions. The learned trial Court on the basis of material
                      available on record has framed the charges under <a href="/doc/763672/" id="a_3">Sections 148</a>, <a href="/doc/1011035/" id="a_4">323</a>/<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_5">149</a>,
                      <a href="/doc/1133601/" id="a_6">325</a>/<a href="/doc/999134/" id="a_7">149</a> of IPC and during trial has framed the additional charge u/s 307/149
                      of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_8">IPC</a> against the applicants.
</p><p id="p_4">                             Learned counsel for the applicants submits that the applicants have
                      been falsely implicated in the case. They have not committed any offence.
                      The applicants have not caused any injury on the vital part of the body and no

further submitted that there was previous enmity between the applicants and
complainant as before lodging the present FIR, applicant no.5 Laxman Yadav
had lodged the FIR against the 14 persons including complainant Pratap
Singh Yadav for committing the murder of his brother Shatrughan Yadav
therefore, due to vengeance, a false and frivolous report has been lodged

against all the male members/applicants of the same family. Only lathi has
been seized from the possession of applicants. Police made query from the
medical officer and as per query report doctor Abhay Kumar (PW-4) has
opined that injury is self sustained. No bullet has been seized at the place of
occurence but even then trial court has framed the additional charges u/s
307/149 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_9">IPC</a> against the applicants only because in FIR the offence u/s
307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_10">IPC</a> is mentioned. On the aforesaid grounds prayer is made to set
aside the aforesaid charges levelled against the applicants.
</p><p id="p_5">      Learned counsel for the State submits that there are sufficient material
available in the case diary against the applicants and prays for dismissal of the
revision petition. Trial Court has jurisdiction to modify, alter a charge or
frame a new charge at any stage of the trial before passing of the judgment It
is also submitted that no interference with the order framing charges is called
for as a significant progress in the trial has already been made.
</p><p id="p_6">      I have heard rival contention of learned counsel for both the parties and
perused the record.
</p><p id="p_7">      At the stage of charge, credibility and reliability of the evidence is not
required to be considered. The only thing that is required to be seen is the
statements of the witnesses and the documents which disclose the facts so as
to constitute the offence or not. In this case, the applicant has failed to show
that the impugned order is illegal, improper or having jurisdictional error. The
court can presume the charges on the basis of available evidence, statement
of witnesses and other documents.
</p><p id="p_8">      <a href="/doc/702724/" id="a_11">In State of Maharashtra v. Som Nath Thapa</a>, AIR 1996 SC 1744,
a three-Judge Bench of the Apex Court explained the meaning of the word
                                   3                                CRR-98-2021
&quot;presume&quot;. It was further observed -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 &quot;...if on the basis of materials on record, a court could come
           to the conclusion that commission of the offence is a probable
           consequence, a case for framing of charge exists. To put it
           differently, if the Court were to think that the accused might have
           committed the offence it can frame the charge, though for
           conviction the conclusion is required to be that the accused has
           committed the offence. It is apparent that at the stage of framing of
           charge, probative value of the materials on record cannot be gone
           into; the material brought on record by the prosecution has to be
           accepted as true at that stage&quot;.</blockquote>

<p id="p_9">       The Apex Court in the case of Union of India Vs. Prafulla Kumar
Samal and another reported in (1979) 3 SCC 4 has held that the test to
determine a prima facie case would naturally depend upon the facts of each
case and it is difficult to lay down a rule of universal applications. Where the
materials placed before the court disclose grave suspicion against the accused
which has not been properly explained, the court will be fully justified in
framing a charge and proceeding with the trial.
</p><p id="p_10">      As far as the contention of learned counsel for the applicant that trial
court has wrongly added the charge u/s 307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a> as there was no grievous
hurt caused by the applicant, it is required to go with the provisions of
<a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_13">Section 307</a> of IPC, which reads as under-
</p><p id="p_11">      &quot;307. Attempt to murder. - Whoever does any act with such
intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act
caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years,
and shall also be liable to fine; and, if hurt is caused to any person by such
act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or to such
punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned.&quot;
</p><p id="p_12">       The essential ingredients required to be proved in the case of an
                                   4                                 CRR-98-2021
offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_14">Section 307</a> of IPC are as under:-
</p><p id="p_13">      (i) that the death of a human being was attempted;
</p><p id="p_14">      (ii) that such death was attempted to be caused by, or in consequence
of the act of the accused; and
</p><p id="p_15">      (iii) that such act was done with the intention of causing death or that it
was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as;
</p><p id="p_16">      (a) the accused knew to be likely to cause death; or
</p><p id="p_17">      (b) was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or
that the accused attempted to cause death by doing an act known to him to
be so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause (a) death, or
</p><p id="p_18">(b) such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the accused having no
excuse for incurring the risk of causing such death or injury.&quot;
</p><p id="p_19">      I n <a href="/doc/1590884/" id="a_15">R. Prakash vs. State of Karnataka</a> (2004) 9 SCC 27, it has
been held as under :
</p><p id="p_20">      9. It is sufficient to justify a conviction under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_16">Section 307</a> if there is
present an intent coupled with some overt act in execution thereof. It is not
essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been
inflicted. Although the nature of injury actually caused may often give
considerable assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the
accused, such intention may also be
deduced from other circumstances, and may even, in some cases, be
ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds. The Section makes
a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any. The Court
has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the
intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the Section.
Therefore, it is not correct to acquit an accused of the charge under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_17">Section
307</a> IPC merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature
of a simple hurt.
</p><p id="p_21">       <a href="/doc/115651329/" id="a_18">In Jage Ram vs. State of Haryana</a> (2015) 11 SCC 366, it has been
observed :
</p><p id="p_22">                                       5                                 CRR-98-2021
</p><p id="p_23">          12. To justify a conviction under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_19">Section 307</a> IPC, it is not essential
that fatal injury capable of causing death should have been caused. Although
the nature of injury actually caused may be of assistance in coming to a
finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be adduced
from other circumstances. The intention of the accused is to be gathered
from the circumstances like the nature of the weapon used, words used by
the accused at the time of the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the
body where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and severity of the
blows given etc.
</p><p id="p_24">          13. Whether there was intention to kill or knowledge that death will be
caused is a question of fact and would depend on the facts of a given case.
The circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or
minor will not by itself rule out application of <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_20">Section 307</a> IPC. The
determinative question is the intention or knowledge, as the case may be, and
not the nature of the
injury.
</p><p id="p_25">          Looking to the aforesaid facts and settled case laws it cannot be said
that only grievous hurt or injury dangerous to life is required for framing the
charge u/s 307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a> hence, trial court has not committed any mistake while
adding the additional charge u/s 307 of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22">IPC</a>.
</p><p id="p_26">          It is well settled that while considering the question of charge, the trial
Judge is not required to make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the

matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial. This apart, even
a strong suspicion leading to presumption as to possibility as against certainty
makes out a case for framing of charge.
</p><p id="p_27">          Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case and
in the light of the well-settled position of law on the subject as highlighted
above, this Court is of the view that the order framing charge does not call for
any interference under the revisional jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_28">          The revision, therefore, stands dismissed. However, nothing contained
                                   6                                 CRR-98-2021
herein shall be construed as expression of opinion on the merits of the case.
It shall still be open to the applicants to raise all such pleas as are available
under law.
