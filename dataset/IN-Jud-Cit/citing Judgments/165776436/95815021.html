                                 HON&#x27;BLE MR. JUSTICE C. HARI SHANKAR

                          %                     JUDGMENT


                          1.     This order disposes of IA 5801/2021 in CS (Comm) 69/2021
                          and IA 5816/2021 in CS (Comm) 611/2019.


                          2.     Both these suits, instituted by M/s FMC Corporation, allege
                          infringement, by the defendants, of Indian patents IN 201307 (&quot;IN
                          307&quot;) and IN 213332 (&quot;IN 332&quot;), held by the plaintiff. Of these, IN
                          307 is a product patent and IN 332 is a process patent. The plaints
                          allege that the defendants are intending to launch Chlorantraniliprole
                          (&quot;CTPR&quot;), which is specifically covered and disclosed in IN 307 and
                          IN 332, held by the plaintiff. The proposed action of commercially
                          manufacturing and launching CTPR would, therefore, according to the
                          plaint, infringe IN 307 and IN 332. The plaint, therefore, prays for a
                          permanent injunction against the defendants from dealing in any
                          product which could infringe IN 307 or using any of the processes
                          claimed under IN 332.


                          3.     The defendants&#x27; case, in opposition to the case set up by the
                          plaintiff, is that CTPR stands covered by IN 204978 (&quot;IN 978&quot;),
                          which is a genus/Markush patent held by the plaintiff. The plaintiff

                           has, in response, contended that, even if CTPR is covered by IN 978,
                          it is not disclosed therein. As against this, the defendants contend,
                          relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_1">Novartis AG v.
                          U.O.I</a>. 1, that coverage in the genus patent is sufficient and that the
                          Supreme Court has specifically disapproved dichotomizing coverage
                          and disclosure.


                          4.         Detailed arguments have already been advanced before me over
                          the course of several hearings, by both parties, on this nuanced issue,
                          regarding the distinction between coverage and disclosure in the
                          genus/Markush patent and whether coverage sans disclosure would be
                          sufficient to invalidate the subsequent specie patent(s), i.e. in the
                          present case, the suit patents IN 307 and IN 332. The defendants
                          question the very validity of the suit patents, IN 307 and IN 332,
                          contending that, once CTPR stood covered by IN 978, no separate
                          patents could be issued specifically claiming CTPR. They contend that
                          a person ordinarily skilled in the art could easily derive CTPR from
                          the moeities disclosed in IN 978, without having to resort to any
                          inventive step in that regard. In view thereof, the very validity of IN
                          307 and IN 332, according to the defendants, is highly questionable
                          and, by seeking to base their claim on the said patents, the plaintiff is
                          attempting to &quot;evergreen&quot; the Markush patent IN 978, even beyond its
                          tenure.


                          5.         IN 978 expired on 20th March, 2021, and the suit patents IN 307
                          and IN 332 are due to expire in August, 2022.

                           6.     The basic premise, on which these applications are based, is
                          that, as IN 307 and IN 332 are ab initio invalid patents and as IN 978
                          has expired, the defendants are now entitled to launch their CTPR
                          product in the market.


                          7.     At the time of issuance of notice in CS(Comm) 611/2019 on
                          14th November, 2019, the statement of Mr. Sai Deepak, learned
                          counsel for the defendant, was thus recorded:

                                 &quot;2.     Mr. J. Sai. Deepak, learned counsel for the defendant
                                 states upon instructions that the defendant has applied for
                                 regulatory approval for manufacturing and marketing the
                                 product, which the plaintiff alleges infringes the suit patent, in
                                 September 2019. He states that approval usually takes 6 to 18
                                 months to be processed. Consequently, it is further stated that
                                 there is no likelihood of commercial launch of the product
                                 prior to March, 2020. Recording the aforesaid statement, it is
                                 unnecessary to pass an ad-interim order at this stage. Mr. J.
                                 Sai Deepak also states for the record that the defendant has
                                 applied to the Intellectual Property Board for revocation of
                                 the suit patent IN 201307.&quot;


                          8.     Effectively, therefore, the defendant seeks to resile from its
                          statement as recorded on 14th November, 2019, citing changed
                          circumstances as the justification thereof. Similar relief is sought in
                          IA 5816/2021 in CS (Comm) 611/2019.


                          9.     I have heard, at length, learned senior counsel, Mr. Gopal
                          Subramanium, for the applicant in I.A. 5801/2021 and Mr. J. Sai
                          Deepak, learned counsel for the applicant in I.A.5816/2021.

                           10.    Mr. Subramanium initially invited my attention to paras 25 and
                          26 of CS (Comm) 69/2021, which read thus:

                                 &quot;25. In fact during the prosecution of the application
                                 corresponding to the suit patent IN 201307 in the US, a
                                 Declaration was filed at the United States Patent and
                                 Trademarks Office (USPTO) comparing compounds
                                 disclosed in the suit patent with the closest, specifically
                                 disclosed compounds in IN&#x27;978. A copy of the said
                                 declaration is annexed with the list of documents filed with
                                 the present plaint.

                                 26.    The said Declaration mentions tests conducted with the
                                 compounds of the selection invention (i.e. suit patent IN&#x27;307)
                                 and a comparison with the closest compounds disclosed in
                                 IN&#x27;978. In the tests, all the new compounds of the suit patent
                                 (IN&#x27;307) showed unexpected and unpredictable superior
                                 insecticidal activity compared with the closest compounds
                                 disclosed in IN&#x27;978. CTPR is not specifically disclosed in
                                 IN&#x27;978. A person skilled in the art would not arrive at CTPR
                                 from Formula 1 of IN&#x27;978 without human intervention and
                                 ingenuity on account of extensive, thorough and undue
                                 experimentation or hindsight knowledge. Nonetheless, CTPR
                                 is in the class of anthranilamides within the scope of the
                                 numerous compounds included in the Markush Formula
                                 disclosed and claimed in the IN&#x27;978 patent.&quot;

                          11.    Mr. Subramanium, emphasises the concluding sentence in para
                          26 of the plaint in CS (COMM) 69/2021, which admits that CTPR &quot;is
                          in the class of anthranilamides within the scope of the numerous
                          compounds included in the Markush formula disclosed and claimed in
                          the IN&#x27;978 patent&quot;. Once this has been admitted by the plaintiff, and,
                          IN 978 has expired, Mr. Subramanium would seek to contend that
                          there can be no justification to further restrain his client from
                          manufacturing and selling its CTPR product. Over the course of past
                          year and a half, Mr. Subramanium submits that his client has acquired

                           all statutory clearances for the manufacture and launch of its CTPR
                          product.


                          12.    CTPR, points out Mr. Subramanium, is an agricultural
                          insecticide, which is specifically used during the kharif season, which
                          is due to come to an end in July, 2021. If, therefore, the defendant is
                          not permitted to manufacture or sell its CTPR product, it would lose
                          its entire business for this year and would be denied the right to
                          exploit the IN 978 patent even after it has expired.

                          13.    Mr. Subramanium also emphasises the aspect of public interest,
                          by stating that the product of his client is priced 25% lower than the
                          product of the plaintiff.

                          14.    In these circumstances, submits Mr. Subramanium, the interests
                          of justice would justify permitting the defendant to manufacture and
                          sell its CTPR product, against which the defendant is prepared to

                          rates, would, in Mr. Subramanium&#x27;s submission additionally justify

                           admitted that &quot;the suit patents have been licensed and/or sub-licensed
                          by the Plaintiffs to Syngenta Ltd., Syngenta Crop Protection AG; E.I.
                          Du Pont de Nemours and Company, and the Scotts Company LLC&quot;.
                          As such, submits Mr. Sai Deepak, the plaintiff has already licensed the
                          suit patents, for exploitation by others. What, essentially, the plaintiff
                          is interested in, therefore, according to Mr. Sai Deepak, is money in
                          the form of the license fee, which the plaintiff would earn. In such
                          circumstances, submits Mr. Sai Deepak, the considerations of public
                          interest and balance of convenience would justify allowing the
                          defendants to release their product in the market, for which purpose
                          Mr. Sai Deepak places reliance on paras 35.5, 35.6, 36 and 36.2 of a
                          recent judgment dated 2nd November, 2020, of this Court in <a href="/doc/8192726/" id="a_2">Astra
                          Zeneca AB v. Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>.2 which are reproduced
                          thus:


                                    &quot;35.5 What persuades me to decline injunction, in addition to
                                    what I have stated above, is also the fact that in this case
                                    damages if proved at trial, appear to be compensable. The
                                    defendants have averred that the plaintiffs have, possibly,
                                    licensed their rights under the suit patents to two entities i.e.
                                    Sun and Abbott. The packaging of the products of the drug
                                    sold through these entities is indicative of this aspect. The
                                    plaintiffs, however, for reasons best known to them have not
                                    placed on record the agreements arrived at with these entities
                                    in support of their plea. Therefore, it has to be inferred that
                                    the said entities are licensees.

                                    35.6 Besides this, the plaintiffs also aver that they are
                                    importing their drug into the country. Therefore, the plaintiffs
                                    seek to monetize their invention. Thus, at the end of the trial,
                                    if they were to succeed, they could be granted damages, if
                                    proved, under the law. Thus, as long as a mechanism can be

                                 plaintiffs, it would, at this stage, balance the interest of the
                                 parties. [See: Dynamic Manufacturing, Inc. vs. David A.
                                 Craze, and Miller Industries, Inc., 1998 WL 241201].

                                 36.     The parties have also advanced submissions on the
                                 aspect concerning public interest. The plaintiffs have
                                 submitted that the quality of the drug could be an issue. The
                                 plaintiffs have also contended that the drug sold by them is
                                 priced reasonably.

</pre><p id="p_1">                                 36.2 Clearly the difference in prices of drugs ranges
                                 between 250% to 350%. Therefore, as is apparent, if
                                 defendants were allowed to manufacture and market their
                                 drugs, it would be far cheaper. Concerns as to quality, at this
                                 juncture, appear to be a self-serving argument. The concerned
                                 statutory authority can, in my view, adequately deal with this
                                 issue if and when such a situation arises.&quot;

<p id="p_2">                          16.    Mr. Sai Deepak has further adverted, at length, to the course of
                          hearings in the present proceedings, in an effort in submitting that the
                          plaintiffs have been guilty of unduly protracting the proceedings by
                          filing misconceived applications. He submits that, even at the stage of
                          rejoinder, the plaintiffs have delayed the matter, thereby subjecting the
                          defendants to needless prejudice. Mr. Sai Deepak professes to exhibit
                          greater generosity than Mr. Subramanium, by undertaking, on
                          instructions, to furnish a bank guarantee for ₹ 5 crores, even though
                          the damages computed in the plaint are only to the tune of ₹ 2 crores.
                          Mr. Sai Deepak has also placed reliance on Section 144 of the CPC,
                          whereunder the plaintiffs could always seek restitution at a later stage.
                          He submits that no further justification exists, to restrain the
                          defendants from exercising their legitimate rights by exploiting the

<p id="p_3">                          17.       Arguing for the plaintiff/non-applicant, Mr. Sandeep Sethi,
                          learned Senior Counsel submits that, were the present applications to
                          be allowed, IA 2084/2021 in CS (Comm) 69/2021 and IA 15352/2019
                          in CS (Comm) 611/2019, preferred by the plaintiff under Order
                          XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC would be rendered infructuous.
                          Apropos the equities of the case, Mr. Sethi submits that the defendants
                          never filed any pre or post grant opposition to the suit patents or
                          sought to challenge the suit patents by any other means known to law,
                          except a belated revocation petition before the IPAB. He submits that
                          damages can never constitute adequate recompense for infringement
                          or violation of validly held patents, especially pharmaceutical patents
                          and relies, for this purpose, on the following passages from <a href="/doc/91986422/" id="a_3">Merck
                          Sharp and Dohme Corpn. v. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals</a> 3:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                    &quot;82. Addressing these principles in the circumstances of the
                                    present case, the Court notes six equitable principles that
                                    come into play in this case and must be considered. First, and
                                    this principle is now well established in Indian jurisprudence,
                                    the Court must look at the public interest in granting an
                                    injunction, as access to drugs, especially one for a condition
                                    as prevalent as diabetes, is an important facet of the patent
                                    regime. Here, the price difference between the commercial
                                    products sold by Glenmark and MSD is not so startling as to
                                    compel the court to infer that allowing Glenmark to sell the
                                    drug, at depressed prices would result in increased access.</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">                                    Permitting Glenmark to operate would not necessarily result
                                    in lowering of market prices. Importantly, whilst lower prices
                                    may result from competition amongst two competitors, no
                                    allegation has been made that MSD today sells its drugs at a
                                    relatively high price that hinders access to the drug. MSD has
                                    reduced its price by 1/5th from the United States, which shows

</p>
<p id="p_5">                                 85.     This leads us to the second principle, which is whether
                                 the Court can overlook the public interest in maintaining the
                                 integrity of the patent system itself, so that a legitimate
                                 monopoly is not distorted. As this Court noted in <a href="/doc/193850263/" id="a_4">Bayer
                                 Corporation v. Cipla, Union of India (UOI</a>), 162 (2009)
                                 DLT 371

                                         &quot;[i]f, after a patentee, rewarded for his toil - in the
                                         form of protection against infringement - were to be
                                         informed that someone, not holding a patent, would be
                                         reaping the fruits of his efforts and investment, such a
                                         result would be destructive of the objectives underlying
                                         the <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_5">Patents Act</a>.&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                                 The Court must be mindful - especially in a case where a
                                 strong case of infringement is established, as here - there is an
                                 interest in enforcing the Act. It may be argued that despite
                                 this no injunction should be granted since all damages from
                                 loss of sales can be compensated monetarily ultimately if the
                                 patentee prevails. This argument though appealing, is to be
                                 rejected because a closer look at the market forces reveal that
                                 the damage can in some cases be irreparable. This in turn
                                 leads to the third principle, which is where an infringer is
                                 allowed to operate in the interim during the trial, it may result
                                 in a reduction in price by that infringer since it has no
                                 research and development expenses to recoup - most revenue
                                 becomes profit. The patentee however can only do so at its
                                 peril. Importantly, prices may not recover after the patentee
                                 ultimately prevails, even if it is able to survive the financial
                                 setback (or &quot;hit&quot;) during the interim, which may take some
                                 time. The victory for the patentee therefore should not be
                                 pyrrhic but real. This irreparable market effect in cases of a
                                 sole supplier of a product has also triggered the decisions in
                                 Smith Kline Beecham v. Generics, (2002) 25(1) IPD 25005
                                 and Smithkline Beecham Plc (2) Glaxosmithkline UK Ltd. v.
                                 Apotex, [2003] EWCA Civ L37, where in granting an interim
                                 injunction, it was held that damages would not be an adequate
                                 remedy for the plaintiff since it was the sole supplier of the
                                 product. New entrants to the market would be likely to cause
                                 its prices to go into a downward spiral, and Smith Kline&#x27;s

                                    granting the injunction would not prejudice Glenmark to an
                                    equal extent since - if the suit is dismissed - it may return to a
                                    market that is largely variable.&quot;

<p id="p_9">                          19.       Having heard learned Senior Counsel Mr. Subramanium and
                          learned Counsel Mr. Sai Deepak at length, I am unable to convince
                          myself that any case, for grant of the prayers in these applications,
                          exists.
</p>

<p id="p_10">                          20.       To my mind, the entire issue is something of a no-brainer. The
                          extensive reliance, by learned Counsel, on the fact that IN 978 has
                          expired on 20th March, 2021 is neither here nor there. The plaintiff
                          does not allege infringement, by the defendants, of IN 978. The
                          plaintiff alleges infringement of IN 307 and IN 332. It is not in
                          dispute that IN 307 and IN 332 are still alive, and would expire only
                          in August, 2022.

<p id="p_11">                          21.       Equally,    the   reliance,    by    Mr.    Subramanium,        on    the
                          acknowledgement, in para 26 of the plaint in CS(COMM) 69/2021,
                          that CTPR is in the class of anthranilamides within the scope of the

                          claimed in IN 978 cannot advance the case of the defendants in these
                          applications. This acknowledgement does not, in any manner,
                          discountenance the case of the plaintiff. Even as per Mr. Sai Deepak,
                          the plaintiff has specifically pleaded that CTPR is not disclosed in IN
</p><p id="p_12">                          978. According to the plaintiff, even if CTPR were to be regarded as
                          covered by IN 978, in the absence of disclosure, mere coverage would
                          not invalidate the specific suit patents issued for CTPR i.e. IN 307 and
                          IN 332. Whether mere coverage of CTPR in IN 978 - assuming such
                          coverage exists - would, in the absence of disclosure of CTPR in IN
                          978, be sufficient to invalidate the suit patents IN 307 and IN 332, is a
                          matter for consideration and decision in the applications filed by the
                          plaintiff under Order XXXIX of the CPC, which are presently at the
                          stage of rejoinder. This Court cannot, obviously, in these applications,
                          prejudge that issue and, indeed, Mr. Subramanium very fairly stated
                          that the defendants were not requiring the Court to do so.
</p>

<p id="p_13">                          22.    It is not - and, indeed, it cannot be - disputed that, were these
                          applications to be allowed, nothing substantial would survive for
                          consideration in IA 2084/2021 and IA 15352/2019, filed in these suits
                          under Order XXXIX of the CPC. Once allegedly infringing products
                          are in the market, there can obviously be no stay against the
                          infringement and even if any stay were to be granted, the exercise
                          would be fundamentally chimerical in nature. It is also a well settled
                          position in law that damages are entirely insufficient as panacea for
                          the holder of a valid patent, which is infringed by another. Intellectual
                          property has its own sanctity. The prejudice caused even by a single

                           day&#x27;s infringement of intellectual property is, in principle,
                          incalculable. It is fundamentally incongruous, therefore, to suggest
                          that, even while the applications for injunction, preferred by the
                          plaintiff in the suits under Order XXXIX of the CPC, are being heard
                          by this Court and are, in fact, at the stage of rejoinder, the defendants
                          should be allowed to launch the allegedly infringing CTPR products.
</p>

<p id="p_14">                          23.    The decision in AstraZeneca2 can hardly help the defendants.
                          Paras 35.5, 35.6, 36 and 36.2 of the said decision are only in the
                          nature of residual findings, after a detailed examination of the merits
                          of the case, in the preceding paragraphs. This Court has not, in the
                          said decision, permitted release of allegedly infringing pharmaceutical
                          products in the market even while the prima facie merits of the
                          application under Order XXXIX of the CPC was under consideration
                          before it, as is the prayer in the present case. I also find substance in
                          the reliance, by Mr. Sethi, on paras 82 and 85 of the judgment of the
                          Division Bench of this Court in Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme
                          Corporation3, which emphasized the fact that in cases of alleged
                          infringement of pharmaceutical patents, damages are poor solace.
</p>
<p id="p_15">                          24.    I posed a specific query to Mr. Sai Deepak as to how, if this
                          Court were to find that there was, prima facie, infringement of the
                          plaintiff&#x27;s suit patent by the defendants and that, therefore, a prima
                          facie case for grant of the relief in IA 2084/2021 and IA 15352/2019,
                          filed by the plaintiff under Order XXXIX of the CPC existed, any
                          meaningful order could be passed, if the defendants were to be
                          allowed to release the allegedly infringing CTPR products in the

                          with the considerable legal acumen at his command, I am constrained
                          to observe that no satisfactory response was forthcoming. Rather, Mr.
                          Sai Deepak, with characteristic candour, acknowledged that it was not
                          his case that damages were adequate recompense for a plaintiff who
                          had suffered infringement of its intellectual property.         Once this
                          position is admitted, there can be no reasonable justification for
                          permitting the defendants, even while the arguments in the plaintiff&#x27;s
                          applications under Order XXXIX of the CPC are at the stage of
                          rejoinder, to allow the defendants to release the allegedly infringing
                          CTPR products in the market, thereby effectively rendering the
                          applications under Order XXXIX of the CPC infructuous.
</p>

<p id="p_16">                          25.      In view thereof, I am of the opinion that no case for grant of the
                          prayer for permitting the defendants to release their allegedly
                          infringing CTPR products in the market, can be said to exist at this
