<p id="p_1">     Dated this the 18th day of September,                    2020


      Relief, as sought for by the petitioner, is against the

objections raised by the Town Planner, Palakkad, in a matter

related to the construction in paddy land. This construction

was undertaken based on the order of permission granted by

the District Level Authorised Committee (DLAC) constituted

under Section 9 of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and

Wet Land Act, 2008 [Act 28 of 2008]. The objection pointed

out by the Town Planner, essentially, is referring to non-

compliance      of   coverage    under    the   Kerala     Municipality

Building Rules, 1999 for constructing the residential house

in a land of 5 cents based on permission granted by DLAC.

</p><p id="p_2">      2. During the course of hearing this Court entertained

doubt in regard to the legality of the order passed by DLAC

by   granting    permission     to   a   landowner   who   consciously

purchased a land being a paddy land in the year 2015. Taking

note of nature of order and its impact, if such order is
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           -:2:-</span>


allowed to muster the backing of the law, this Court sought

views of the Government. Accordingly, the learned Additional

Advocate     General,       Shri     Renjith       Thampan    addressed    this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_3">     3.     The     learned     Additional         Advocate   General     after

referring to the very statement of objects and reasons of

Act 28 of 2008 submitted the Act itself was brought in to

preserve     and     conserve        the    paddy     land.    However,     the

Legislature taking note of the rigour of the statutory

provision which would prevent the owner from converting or

reclaiming the land, allowed the owner of such paddy land to

reclaim     paddy    land      for    construction       of    a   residential

building.    According        to     the   learned     Additional    Advocate

General, 'owner', referred to under the statutory provision

in Section 9 of Act 28 of 2008 is the owner who would be

affected at the time of introduction of Act 28 of 2008 as on

12/8/2008.        Therefore,       the     learned    Additional     Advocate

General argued that the title 'owner', who becomes successor

by virtue of alienation or transfer could not claim the
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          -:3:-</span>


benefit of reclamation as provided under Section 9 of Act 28

of 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. The learned Additional Advocate General referred to

the judgment of the learned Single Judge of this Court

in Thankachan     K.S.    V.   District           Collector,    Alappuzha   and

Others [2017 (3) KHC 402]. This Court in the above judgment

accepted the argument that the 'owner' referred to under

Section 9 is the 'owner as on the date of enactment'. The

learned Additional Advocate General also placed reliance on

another judgment of this Court in Yousuf Chalil v. State of

Kerala and Others [2019 KHC 699] wherein the learned Single

Judge declined to issue a writ of mandamus to the Local

Level Monitoring Committee to consider an application for

reclamation of paddy land for construction of a residential

building. In Yousuf Chalil's case, the applicant purchased

the property only in the year 2019. Therefore, the learned

Single Judge was of the view that no direction can be issued

contrary to law, nor can the Court direct an authority to

act   in   contravention       of   the     statutory     provisions.       This

judgment    was   set    aside      by   the      Division     Bench   reported
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               -:4:-</span>


in 2019 KHC 5618 [Yousuf Chalil v. State of Kerala and

Others]. The Division Bench did not answer the question

related to reclamation by an owner of a paddy land who

became the owner by subsequent purchase after the enactment

came into force. The Division Bench set aside the judgment

solely for the reason that the learned Single Judge could

not have refused a writ of mandamus as it is for the

statutory authority to consider whether the application is

maintainable or not. It is in that background this Court has

to examine the scope of power exercised by DLAC to grant

permission to reclaim a paddy land purchased after the Act

28 of 2008 came into force on 12/8/2008.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     5. As already observed, the issue as above is not

directly involved in this case. Nevertheless, this Court

cannot remain oblivious to such a blatant violation of the

statutory provisions by DLAC while granting permission. If

this Court ignores such an illegal order, it would assume

that such illegal orders have also got the stamp of approval

from this Court.
</p><p id="p_6"> W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                       -:5:-</span>


</p><p id="p_7">     6. Section 9 of Act 28 of 2008 confers power on DLAC to

allow   reclamation     of   paddy    land     for    construction      of   a

residential building by the owner of paddy land. Such a

permission can be given for reclamation of 4.04 Ares in

Panchayats      and     an     extent          of      2.02    Ares          in

Municipality/Corporation. The point arises for consideration

is whether the benefit should confine to the owner of paddy

land at the time of Act 28 of 2008 came into force, i.e., as

on 12/8/2008; or should it be extended to all types of the

owner, who became the owner after Act 28 of 2008 came into

force, by way of purchase or any other mode of transfer by

the original owner of paddy land in whose name the land

stood as on 12/8/2008?
</p>
<p id="p_8">     7. If this Court construes literal meaning of the

'owner of the paddy land' overlooking the object and goals

and aims intended to be achieved by the Act 28 of 2008, it

may result into a situation which was never contemplated by

the Legislature. The literal rule is not to be decisive

criteria     interpreting    the     statutory       provisions.   If    the

literal meaning of the 'owner' of the paddy land as referred
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                        -:6:-</span>


under Section 9 is adopted and accepted, it may lead to a

situation   as   pointed    out    by      the        learned    Single      Judge

in Thankachan's case       (supra). Therein,              the learned Single

Judge noted at para.7 as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_9">7. Such an exercise could lead to gross misuse, since, then,
large extents of paddy land could be cut up into small properties
and sold to different individuals, who could then separately seek
exemption. Different members of a family could also claim the
exemption for small tracts of land, out of a commonly held paddy
land; citing a desire to have an independent existence. That
would be defeating the very object of the enactment, which has
the preservation of paddy lands at its core. This Court is not
inclined to permit such exemption, especially since both the LLMC
and DLAC has declined the claim and a contrary direction would go
against the clear statutory interdict.
</p>
<p id="p_10">The application of purposive textualism is a well-accepted

canon of interpretation in our jurisprudence. The Apex Court

in <a href="/doc/1022888/" id="a_1">Mc   Dowell   &amp;   Company      Limited        vs     The     Commercial     Tax

Officer</a> [(1985) 3 SCC 230] and in <a href="/doc/165776436/" id="a_2">Novartis AG v. Union of

India</a> [(2013) 6 SCC 1] used purposive textualism as a matter

of interpretation to ascribe the meaning of the Statute. If

the Court is of the opinion that any statutory provision is

construed literally it would lead to a situation defeating
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                   -:7:-</span>


the object and purpose of the Statute, it must endeavour to

construe by applying 'purposive textualism'.

</p><p id="p_11">     8. The Court is expected to interpret the word 'owner

of paddy land' as referred under Section 9 of Act 28 of 2008

in   the   context   of   regulatory       nature   of   the   Act.   The

regulatory Statute demands strict interpretation consistent

with the objects and aims of the Act. If the Statute is

construed to permit a transaction as a device to defeat the

objects and aim of the Act, it is the duty of the Court to

interpret the statutory provision to further the objects and

purpose of the Act. The whole text of Act 28 of 2008 is to

preserve and conserve paddy land. Any exception, therefore,

has to be construed narrowly consistent with the scope and

object of such exception. The Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1483657/" id="a_3">U.P.Bhoodan

Yagna Samiti, U.P v. Braj Kishore &amp; Ors</a> [(1988) 4 SCC

274] interpreting the word 'landless persons' under the U.P.

Bhoodan Yagna Act, 1952 narrowly construed to mean that it

refers 'landless persons' whose main source of livelihood

was agriculture and who had no land in their name at that

time and held that the Statute never contemplate to include
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 -:8:-</span>


landless   businessmen.   At   para.15,    after   quoting   Lord

Dennings observations in The Discipline of Law, it was held

at para.16 as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_12"> And it is clear that when one has to look to the intention of
the Legislature, one has to look to the circumstances under which
the law was enacted. The Preamble of the law, the mischief which
was intended to be remedied by the enactment of the Statute and
in this context, Lord Denning, in the same book at Page No. 10,
observed as under:
</p><p id="p_13"> At one time the Judges used to limit themselves to the bare
reading of the Statute itself--to go simply by the words, giving
them their grammatical meaning, and that was all. That view was
prevalent in the l9th century and still has some supporters
today. But it is wrong in principle.     The meaning for which we
should seek is the meaning of the Statute as it appears to those
who have to obey it--and to those who have to advise them what to
do about it; in short, to lawyers like yourselves. Now the
Statute does not come to such folk as if they were eccentrics cut
off from all that is happening around them. The Statute comes to
them as men of affairs--who have their own feeling for the
meaning of the words and know the reason why the Act was passed--
just as if it had been fully set out in a preamble. So it has
been held very rightly that you can inquire into the mischief
which gave rise to the Statute--to see what was the evil which it
was sought to remedy."
</p><p id="p_14"> It is now well settled that in order to interpret a law, one
must understand the background and the purpose for which the law
was enacted. And in this context as indicated earlier if one has
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                         -:9:-</span>


bothered to understand the common phrase used in the Bhoodan
Movement as 'Bhoomihin Kissan' which has been translated into
English to mean 'landless persons' there would have been no
difficulty but apart from it even as contended by learned counsel
that it was clearly indicated by Sec. 15 that the allotments
could only be made in accordance with the scheme of Bhoodan
Yagna. In order to understand the scheme of Bhoodan and the
movement of Shri Vinoba Bhave, it would be worthwhile to quote
from 'Vinoba, And His Mission' by Suresh Ram printed with an
introduction by Shri Jaya Prakash Narain and foreword by Dr. S.
RadhaKrishnan.       In   this   work,   statement       of    annual     Sarvodya
Conference at Sevapuri has been quoted as under:
The fundamental principle of the Bhoodan Yagna movement is that
all children of the soil have an equal right over the Mother
Earth, in the same way as those born of a mother have over her.
It is, therefore, essential that the entire land of the country
should be equitably redistributed anew, providing roughly at
least five acres of dry land or one acre of wetland to every
family. The Sarvodaya Samaj, by appealing to the good sense of
the   people,    should      prepare   their     minds   for    this     equitable
distribution and acquire within the next two years at least 25
lakhs of acres of land from about five lakhs of our villages on
the rough basis of five acres per village. This land will be
distributed     to   those    landless   labourers       who    are     versed   in
agriculture, want to take to it, and have no other means of
subsistence. " (emphasis added)
This would clearly indicate the purpose of the scheme of Bhoodan
Yagna and it is clear that Sec. 15 provided that all allotments
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                    -:10:-</span>


in accordance with Sec. 14 could only be done under the scheme of
the Bhoodan Yagna.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">     9. Similarly, the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1353651/" id="a_4">Hindustan Lever Ltd v.

Ashok Vishnu Kate &amp; Ors</a>        [(1995) 6 SCC 326], in the context

of social welfare legislation observed that such legislation

should be construed as to effectuate the purpose of the Act.

Therefore,    in     the   light    of    the    regulatory       Statute,

provisions of such Statute should be construed to advance

and further the purpose of the object of such enactment.

</p><p id="p_17">     10. As observed in Thankachan's case (supra), if the

owner of paddy land, who became the owner after 12/8/2008 by

virtue   of   the   transfer   of   the      individual   right    of   the

original owner, will be able to defeat the purpose of the

Act by fragmenting and cutting the property into small

pieces and sell it to different individuals to put up a

residential building. Necessarily, it means to say that the

only owner of paddy land who at the time of enactment has

been affected on account of the rigour of restriction of the

enactment, alone will be eligible to apply for reclamation.
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                   -:11:-</span>


</p><p id="p_18">     11. The object of Act 28 of 2008 is to preserve and

conserve paddy land. It prohibits the conversion of paddy

land (Sec.3). The intention of the legislation is very

clear; to retain paddy land as such to maintain it as paddy

land forever. Taking note of the hardships, that is likely

to arise, the beneficial provision is made to the owner of

the paddy land to reclaim the land for the purpose of a

residential building. DLAC is the final authority to take a

decision on such reclamation. The decision to be taken by

DLAC is based on different parameters under Section 9(8).

These parameters also ensure that reclamation shall not

affect the remaining paddy land. The owner can be denied

reclamation if he or his family members owns suitable land

for the purpose of constructing a residential building.

</p><p id="p_19">     12. In the backdrop of objects and reasons of the

enactment,   it   is    clear   that    reclamation   by   the    paddy

landowner is the conferment of personal benefit to the owner

of paddy land who stood as the owner as on 12/8/2008. This

personal     benefit     will     not       be   available       to   a

successor-in-interest by way of transfer. This benefit is
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                       -:12:-</span>


only conferred to the owner and his family members as on

12/8/2008. As seen from Section 3, the owner of paddy land

as on the date of commencement of the Act is prevented from

undertaking any activity for conversion or reclamation of

paddy land. This rigour would apply to the owner as on the

date of commencement of the Act. Therefore, the reference of

'owner of paddy land' under Section 9 has to be understood

with reference to the 'owner' as referred under Section 3.

</p><p id="p_20">     13. The personal benefit conferred to the owner of the

paddy land as on 12/8/2008 is not running with the land. The

subsequent   owner      will    not   get       any   right   to   apply   for

reclamation under Section 9. The law only intended to confer

it as a personal benefit to the owner of the paddy land as

on 12/8/2008. If any other owner is allowed to reclaim the

land, the purpose of the Act would be defeated by allowing

such claim. The Legislature never intended to confer any

benefits to the owner of any paddy land, who becomes the

owner   by   virtue     of     transfer     after      12/8/2008.    If    the

Legislature had not intended to confer such benefits, DLAC
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                  -:13:-</span>


lacks   the    power    to   entertain     such   application   for

reclamation.
</p>
<p id="p_21">     14. Thus, it is obvious, in this case, the decision of

DLAC is without any power. It is made clear that this Court

is not interfering with the decision of DLAC for the simple

reason that the building has been allowed to come up. There

is no challenge to the decision of DLAC. Therefore, without

unsettling the decision, the remaining question has to be

answered.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     15. DLAC permitted to put up construction in 5 cents of

land. Nobody has a case that the petitioner has constructed

beyond 5 cents. Admittedly, the total extent of the land is

9.909 cents. The coverage has to be taken into account based

on the total extent of the land belonged to the petitioner.

The permission granted to undertake construction within 5

cents cannot be construed to hold that the remaining land

cannot be taken into account for the purpose of permission.

Purpose of permission for reclamation is something different

from the issue of the coverage under the Building Rules. For

the purpose of coverage, the total extent of land available
 W.P.(C).No.41282/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 -:14:-</span>


has to be taken into account. However, the authority will

have to ensure that construction should not exceed 5 cents

as authorised by DLAC. In such circumstances, the impugned

proceedings are set aside. The Town Planner shall consider

the application forwarded as though the petitioner's land is

9.909 cents in extent.       The petitioner also is liable to

cure any other defects pointed out. The coverage has to be

taken into account based on the total extent. Needful shall

be done within one month.
