</p><p id="p_4">                           2.    The impugned award was rendered in the context of disputes that
                          had arisen between the parties in connection with the Service
                          Agreement dated 09.08.2011, whereby the petitioner had agreed to
                          manage and operate a warehouse for the respondent company (hereafter
                          &#x27;Mitisui&#x27;) in Neemrana, Rajasthan.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                          3.    Shine claims that Mitisui had set up a factory at Neemrana,
                          Rajasthan in the year 2008 for manufacturing plastic components used
                          in automobiles. It had approached Shine for managing and operating a
                          warehouse for its factory. According to Shine, the controlling unit for
                          managing the warehouse required specialized workers and domain
                          knowledge.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                          4.    The parties entered into a Service Agreement dated 01.09.2008
                          for the aforesaid purpose, which was extended by the parties on
                          16.09.2010. Shine claims that, thereafter, the parties extended their
                          agreement by entering into a fresh Service Agreement dated 09.08.2011
                          (hereafter the &#x27;Agreement&#x27;). In terms of the Agreement, Shine agreed
                          to render the services for a period of three years with effect from
                          01.09.2011.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                          5.    The term of the Agreement expired on 31.08.2014. However,
                          Shine claims that on the strength of the Agreement, Mitisui continued
                          to avail the services even after 31.08.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_8">                          6.     Shine claims that it repeatedly requested Mitisui to enter into a
                          fresh agreement with increased charges. However, the parties did not
                          execute any further agreement. Notwithstanding the same, Shine

                           continued to render the services and Mitisui continued to avail of the
                          same till 15.01.2015. Shine claims that it was understood between the
                          parties that the services rendered after 31.08.2014 would be at a
                          consideration increased by 30%.
</p>
<p id="p_9">                          7.     Shine claimed that it raised twenty-seven invoices for an
                          aggregate amount of ₹1,25,03,633.58/-, against which Mitisui paid an
                          amount of ₹98,23,706.36/- but failed and neglected to pay the balance
                          amount of ₹26,79,927.22/-. In addition, Shine claimed that Mitisui
                          breached the &#x27;Confidentiality Clause&#x27; under the Agreement and
                          recruited Shine&#x27;s trained employees and human resources, who were
                          involved in providing the services, on the payrolls of their newly
                          appointed contractor This adversely affected Shine&#x27;s business and
                          resulted in it incurring losses.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                          8.    In addition, Shine claimed that it had, on the strength of its
                          employees, hired warehouses in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and
                          Calcutta and paid huge rentals from the year 2009 to 2015. However,
                          eighteen of its employees, who were engaged in providing the
                          specialised services, left their employment with Shine and joined
                          Mitisui resulting in Shine suffering a loss of ₹3,24,46,422/-.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                          9.     Shine invoked the arbitration agreement as embodied in Clause
                          14 of the Agreement by its notice dated 29.09.2015. It, thereafter,
                          approached this Court by filing an application under Section 11(6) of
                          the A&amp;C Act. Mitisui opposed the said application. However, this Court
                          passed an order dated 27.07.2016 appointing an Arbitrator. Mitisui

                          Arbitral Tribunal had rejected Shine&#x27;s claims (Claim A, Claim B and

                          ₹3,24,46,422/- (Claim C).

</p><p id="p_18">                           13.    Mr Jha submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had rejected Shine&#x27;s
                          claim for payments due after 31.08.2014 on the ground that the same
                          were not arbitrable as they were beyond the term of the Agreement. He
                          submitted that the Arbitration Agreement would survive the termination
                          of the principal Agreement and therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal was
                          required to adjudicate the disputes even though the same related to the
                          period after the expiry of the term of the Agreement. He referred to the
                          decisions of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/397996/" id="a_3">N. Srinivasa v. Kuttukaran Machine
                          Tools Limited</a>: (2009) 5 SCC 182 and <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_4">Bharat Petroleum Corporation
                          Ltd. v. Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>.: (2008) 1 SCC 503, in support
                          of his contention. He submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal also failed to
                          consider the material on record including the testimony of Shine&#x27;s
                          witness (CW-1). The said witness had affirmed that the outstanding
                          arrears of ₹26,79,927.22/- (claimed as Claim A) also included arrears
                          for the period prior to 01.09.2014 but the same were not mentioned in
                          the legal notice issued on behalf of Shine. He contended that the Arbitral
                          Tribunal had rejected Shine&#x27;s claim on the basis of forged bills
                          produced by Mitisui. He stated that Shine&#x27;s second witness (CW-2) had
                          clearly stated that he had not signed the bills produced by Mitisui. CW-
                          2 was not cross-examined on the said aspect and there was no
                          adjudication as to whether the invoices produced by Mitisui were
                          genuine or forged.

<p id="p_19">                          14.   Insofar as Shine&#x27;s Claim D - being a claim for loss on account of
                          breach of the Confidentiality Clause by Mitisui, is concerned - Mr Jha

                           evidence on record and Mitisui&#x27;s reply dated 29.09.2015 to Shine&#x27;s
                          legal notice. He submitted that a plain reading of the said response
                          would indicate that Mitisui had not disputed that the employees of Shine
                          had joined the new contractor engaged by Mitisui. This, accrdong to
                          him, established that Mitsui had breached the Confidentiality Clause in
                          the Agreement.

<p id="p_20">                          Reasons and Conclusion

</p><p id="p_21">                          15.    The controversy in the present petition, essentially, relates to the
                          claim made by Shine for recovery of an amount of ₹26,79,927.22/-
                          (Claim A) and its claim for a sum of ₹18,53,00,000/- as loss and
                          damages for breach of the Confidentiality Clause (Claim D). Claim B
                          is for interest on the amount as claimed under Claim A. Since the
                          Arbitral Tribunal had rejected Shine&#x27;s claim for recovery of an amount
                          of ₹26,79,927.22/- (Claim A), the question of awarding any interest did
                          not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                          16.    The first question to be examined is whether the decision of the
                          Arbitral Tribunal to reject Claim A is patently illegal. It is important to
                          examine the averments made by Shine, in support of its claim for an
                          outstanding amount of ₹26,79,927.22/-. Shine had stated that Mitisui
                          had availed the services after 31.08.2014 on the strength of the
                          Agreement, even though the same had come to an end. Shine
                          acknowledged in unambiguous terms that the term of the Agreement
                          had come to an end. However, it claimed that it had requested Mitisui
                          to execute a fresh agreement with an increase in prices but the same was

                           not done. Shine pleaded that &quot;admittedly no fresh agreement came into
                          existence but it is a matter of record that the Respondent [Mitisui]
                          availed the services of the Claimant (Shine) till 15.01.2015&quot;.

<p id="p_23">                          17.   Shine claimed that Mitisui had conveniently availed the services
                          &quot;without finalising any new Agreement&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_24">                          18.    A plain reading of the Statement of Claims indicates that Shine
                          had asserted that it was entitled to be paid for the services rendered after
                          31.08.2014 at an increased price of 30% above the rates, as agreed under
                          the Agreement.     Shine claimed that it had issued as many as twenty
                          seven invoices for a total consideration of ₹1,25,03,633.58/- and against
                          the same, Mitisui had paid an amount of ₹98,23,706.36/- leaving a

                          ₹98,23,706.36/- leaving a balance of ₹26,79,927.22/-.

                          Claims it provided a break-up of the amount of ₹26,79,927.22/-. The
                          tabular statement indicated that twelve invoices out of the twenty seven
                          invoices as raised by Shine pertained to a period prior to 31.08.2014.
                          According to Shine, the said invoices had not been paid in full.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                          22.   Mitisui had contested the said claim. It had pointed out that
                          Shine&#x27;s contention that an amount of ₹26,79,927.22/- was outstanding,
                          in respect of the services rendered during the period 01.09.2014 to
                          15.01.2015, was erroneous and inconsistent with the statement annexed
                          by Shine along with the Statement of Claims. Mitisui pointed out that
                          out of the sum of ₹26,79,927.22/-, an amount of ₹11,49,547/- pertained
                          to the period June, 2013 to August, 2014 and the balance amount of
                          ₹15,30,382/- was in respect of the period 01.09.2014 to 15.01.2015.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                          23.   Thus, undisputedly, Shine&#x27;s claim for a sum of ₹11,49,547/- was
                          arbitrable.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                          24.    Mitisui had produced invoices, which it claimed that it had
                          received from Shine. It had also produced the statements of its bank
                          accounts to show that it had paid the said invoices. The Arbitral
                          Tribunal had accepted Mitisui&#x27;s contention.

<p id="p_32">                          25.    It is also apparent that there was a dispute as to whether the

                          31.08.2014 were genuine. Sh OM Dutt (CW-2) who is stated to have

                          There is no finding to the effect that the invoices relied upon by Shine
                          were not genuine and the invoices produced by Mitisui were the genuine
                          invoices and not forged. A decision in this regard would be dispositive
                          of whether any amounts of arrears would be due to Shine in respect of
                          the services rendered prior to 31.08.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                          27.   In its rejoinder filed before the Arbitral Tribunal, Shine had
                          asserted that Mitisui had forged the signatures of Sh. Om Dutt on
                          various invoices and had committed the offence of perjury. It also
                          asserted that Shine had carried forward the outstanding dues of the
                          Financial Year 2013-14 to the Financial Year 2014-15.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                          28.   It is, thus, clear that the Arbitral Tribunal has not addressed the
                          principal dispute in respect of short payment of invoices for the services
                          rendered prior to 31.08.2014.

<p id="p_36">                          29.   Mr R. Jawaharlal, learned counsel appearing for Mitisui,

                          dispute whether the invoices raised by Mitisui were genuine or forged.
                          However, it is apparent from the impugned award that the Arbitral

                          contention that the same were forged. He referred to Paragraph 28 of
                          the impugned award where the Arbitral Tribunal had referred to the
                          copies of the invoices filed by Mitisui and noted that the same had been

                           cleared from Mitisui&#x27;s bank accounts. The Arbitral Tribunal had
                          concluded that the same established that Shine had received the
                          payment for the period prior to 31.08.2014. He had also referred to the
                          decision of the Supreme Court in Dyna Technologies (P.) <a href="/doc/73225941/" id="a_5">Ltd. v.

                          said decision, submitted that even though the reasoning of the Arbitral
                          Tribunal is not explicit, it is intelligible and therefore, no interference
                          with the arbitral award would be warranted.
</p>
<p id="p_37">                          30.   This Court is unable to accept the aforesaid contention. As
                          noticed above, Shine had expressly pleaded that it had raised twenty
                          seven invoices for an aggregate amount of ₹1,25,03,633.58/- and had
                          received a payment of ₹98,23,706/- from Mitisui against the said
                          invoices. Thus, an amount of ₹26,79,927.22/- was outstanding and
                          payable. It had also provided the details of the invoices. Mitisui had
                          produced a separate set of invoices for the services rendered prior to
                          31.08.2014, which were in variance with the invoices as relied upon by
                          Shine. Shine had contested the said invoices and claimed that they were
                          forged. Shine&#x27;s witness (CW-2), who had purportedly signed the
                          invoices as produced by Mitisui, had denied that he had signed the same
                          and affirmed an affidavit that his signatures appearing on the invoices
                          were forged.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                          31.   In the given facts, it was necessary for the Arbitral Tribunal to
                          address the said dispute.     However, the Arbitral Tribunal neither
                          adverted to the controversy regarding variance in the invoices nor
                          returned a clear finding rejecting Shine&#x27;s claim that the invoices

                          rejecting the same.
</p>
<p id="p_39">                          32.   In view of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s decision to reject
                          Shine&#x27;s claim for payment of amounts outstanding for the services
                          rendered prior to 31.08.2014 (a sum of ₹11,49,547/-), cannot be
                          sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_40">                          33.   Insofar as Shine&#x27;s claim for services rendered for the period
                          01.09.2014 to 15.01.2015 is concerned, the Arbitral Tribunal had found
                          that the said disputes were not arbitrable. This Court concurs with the
                          aforesaid view. Admittedly, the term of the Agreement had ended.
                          Thus, the claim for payment for the services rendered after 31.08.2014
                          was clearly outside the scope of the Agreement. In terms of Clause 14
                          of the Agreement, the Arbitration Clause is confined to matters arising
                          out of or under the Agreement. Thus, clearly the Arbitral Tribunal had
                          no jurisdiction to decide any claim for services rendered after the term
                          of the Agreement had elapsed on 31.08.2014.
</p>
<p id="p_41">                          34.   There is no cavil to the proposition that the Arbitration
                          Agreement would survive termination of the Agreement. Thus,
                          notwithstanding that the term of the Agreement had expired by efflux
                          of time, the disputes between the parties arising out of or in connection
                          with the Agreement, would fall within the scope of the Arbitration
                          Agreement. However, that does not mean that the scope of the
                          Arbitration Agreement would also include disputes that had not arisen

<p id="p_46">                          38.   Shine had claimed that its skilled employees, who were employed
                          in providing specialised services of operating and managing the
                          warehouse, had joined the employment of Mitisui or the new contractor
                          engaged by it. This, according to Shine, violated the Confidentiality
                          Clause as set out above.
</p>
<p id="p_47">                          39.   Shine had also asserted that it had incurred a loss amounting to
                          ₹18,53,00,000/- as a result of breach of the Confidentiality Clause.
</p>
<p id="p_48">                          40.   The Arbitral Tribunal had rejected the aforesaid claim on,
                          essentially, three grounds. First, the Arbitral Tribunal found that the
                          allegation that its employees had joined Mitisui and/or a new contractor
                          did not violate any of the obligations undertaken by Mitisui, in terms of
                          Clause 6 of the Agreement (Confidentiality Clause). Second, it found
                          that there was no material to prove that any of the erstwhile employees
                          of Shine had joined the employment of Mitisui and were on its payrolls.
                          And third, that Shine had failed to establish that it had suffered any loss
                          as claimed by it.

                           employees of Shine &quot;might have joined the new vendor&quot;. However, it
                          had also asserted that any such act of the employees or workers seeking
                          alternate employment was a voluntary act on their part and may have
                          been triggered by the decision of Shine to terminate their employment.
                          The said letter does not in any manner establish that Mitisui had
                          breached the Confidentiality Clause as claimed by Shine.

<p id="p_51">                          43.   In view of the above, the impugned award to the extent that it
                          denies Shine&#x27;s claim for short payment of its invoices to the extent of
                          ₹11,49,547/- for the services rendered prior to 31.08.2014, is set aside.
                          The findings of the Arbitral Tribunal on the merits of Shine&#x27;s claim for
                          services rendered after 31.08.2014 is also set aside in view of the
                          Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s decision that it had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the
                          said disputes. Clearly, if the claims in respect of the services rendered
                          after 31.08.2014 fell outside the scope of the arbitration agreement any
                          observation by the Arbitral Tribunal on the merits of the said claim is
                          wholly without jurisdiction.
