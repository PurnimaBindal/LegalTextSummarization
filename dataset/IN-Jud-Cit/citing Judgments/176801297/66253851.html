<p id="p_4">                      3.    The present suit has been filed against the defendant No.1 alleging
                      infringement by it of trademark &quot;CINZAN&quot;, registered in the name of the
                      plaintiff in respect of its product launched in 1989. The product sold

                       figure have been mentioned in para No.10 of the plaint to show the
                      performance of the product &quot;CINZAN&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_5">                      4.    It is stated by the plaintiff that the defendant No.1, which is a
                      private limited company, had dishonestly adopted the trademark
                      &quot;CINZINE&quot;, which was deceptively, phonetically and structurally similar
                      to the plaintiff&#x27;s prior adopted and registered trademark &quot;CINZAN&quot;. Ms.
                      Shwetasree Majumder, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
                      plaintiff, submitted that initially when the plaintiff had noticed the use of
                      &quot;CINZINE&quot; by the defendants, legal notices had been issued in 2006 and
                      2007, after which the defendants had abandoned its application for
                      registration of trademark &quot;CINZINE&quot; and the impugned products were
                      also not seen in the market. However, in November, 2020, the
                      representative of the plaintiff came across a fresh sample of the impugned
                      products &quot;CINZINE&quot; in the market, but this time, not manufactured by
                      the defendant No.1, but by defendant No.2. However, the defendants are
                      apparently connected as both the defendants have two common Directors,
                      namely, Harjinder Singh and Kuljeet Kaur and the registered offices of
                      both the entities are also the same. Learned counsel for the plaintiff
                      submitted that a Legal Notice was sent on 9th November, 2020, which
                      was replied to by the defendant No.1 indicating that they were changing
                      their mark to &quot;CINZITAS&quot;. However, the plaintiff had objection to the
                      defendants using the mark as &quot;CINZITAS&quot;, as that too is deceptively
                      similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark &quot;CINZAN&quot;.

                      that the defendants had repeatedly infringed the trademark of the plaintiff.

                       Their act was a deliberate attempt to dilute the distinctive character of the
                      plaintiff&#x27;s trademark. It was submitted by learned counsel for the plaintiff
                      that the mark sought to be used by the defendants was phonetically

<p id="p_8">                      6.    It was also contended by learned counsel for the plaintiff that the
                      word &quot;CINZAN&quot; had to be considered as a whole and could not be split
                      into two, nor could be the mark of the defendants &quot;CINZITAS&quot; split into
                      &quot;CINZI&quot; and &quot;TAS&quot;, to assess whether the two trademarks were similar
                      or not. It was also submitted that the defendants have not been able to
                      establish that since December, 2020, they had any sale of &quot;CINZITAS&quot;
                      nor have they disclosed when they had launched their product. Thus, they
                      had no right in equity to continue such use of the name &quot;CINZITAS&quot;. It
                      was thus submitted that the plaintiff had disclosed a prima facie case in
                      its favour, as having a registered trademark, being the prior user since
                      1989 and having built a solid market reputation, they would suffer
                      irreparable loss and injury, if no injunction was granted. The balance of
                      convenience was also in favour of the plaintiff, inasmuch as the
                      defendants have not yet built any market for their product &quot;CINZITAS&quot;.

<p id="p_9">                      7.    Mr. Ajay Sahni, learned counsel for the defendants, submitted that
                      as regards the trademark &quot;CINZINE&quot;, they had already stopped its use
                      since December, 2020.        It has been submitted that as regards
                      &quot;CINZITAS&quot;, the mark had been coined by the defendant No.1 by
                      combining the salt/compound from which the drug had been derived with

                       &quot;CINNARIZINE&quot; and &quot;TAS&quot; has been derived from the name of the
                      defendant No.1 &quot;TAS MED INDIA PVT. LTD.&quot;. Learned counsel
                      submitted that various products had been similarly named by the
                      defendant No.1, which had been duly registered. 30 such products have
                      been listed in para No.9 of the written statement. It is further submitted
                      that in fact, the name of the plaintiff&#x27;s product &quot;CINZINE&quot; has also been
                      derived from the salt &quot;CINNARIZINE&quot;. It was submitted by the learned
                      counsel that the practice of joining the company name and the disease for
                      which the product was to be used or the salt/compound from which the
                      product was manufactured, was a standard industry practice, as is clearly
                      evident from the name of the plaintiff&#x27;s own product. No one could seek
                      to register the name of the compound which was &#x27;publici juris&#x27;.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                      8.    It has been further argued by learned counsel for the defendants
                      that the two names had no phonetic similarity. The drugs were
                      &#x27;Scheduled-H&#x27; drugs to be sold only on prescription and so, no chemist
                      would get confused. Therefore, the cited cases relied upon by the learned
                      counsel for the plaintiff were inapplicable as, in those cases, the drugs
                      could be bought over the counter. Thus, there was no infringement of the
                      trademark of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                      9.    As regards passing off, it was contended by learned counsel for the
                      defendants that the packaging had no similarity as the product of the
                      defendants was yet to be produced. Reliance has been placed on the

                      Del 3886. Thus, the learned counsel for the defendants has prayed that the
                      application be dismissed and no injunction as prayed for be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                      10.   Learned counsel for the plaintiff, in rejoinder submitted that if the
                      contention of the learned counsel for the defendants was right, then there
                      was no explanation for the defendant No.1 to have withdrawn/abandoned
                      its application for registration of mark &quot;CINZINE&quot; in 2006 when the
                      plaintiff had opposed the registration. Therefore, the defendant No.1 was
                      estopped from now claiming any right to use even a derivative from the
                      salt from which the product was to be manufactured. It was further
                      submitted that the trademark of the plaintiff had been registered with
                      effect from 1987. The name of the product of the plaintiff was coined by
                      taking different alphabets from the compound and the defendants had
                      taken the same set of letters to coin the name of its product. Thus, this
                      was a clear case of infringement.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                      11.   In response to the claim that there were 30 products of the
                      defendant No.1 with suffix &quot;TAS&quot;, learned counsel for the plaintiff has
                      submitted that there were 140 other products which had no such suffix of
                      &quot;TAS&quot;. Thus, when the defendant No.1 had once sought to fraudulently
                      adopt a trademark deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff and the
                      plaintiff had successfully opposed the same way back in the year 2006,
                      the defendant No.1 had again sought to re-use the same deceptively
                      similar mark of &quot;CINZINE&quot; in 2020 and would have succeeded, but for
                      the vigil of the plaintiff. Therefore, the defendants were compelled to use
                      a slightly modified version by adding the letters &quot;TAS&quot; as a suffix. It was

                      specifically highlighted the fact that there could be confusion due to
                      handwriting. The observations of the court in Himalaya Drug Company
                      (supra) were reiterated to submit that the use of the mark &quot;CINZITAS&quot;
                      would also create confusion, as there was a possibility of people
                      mistaking the defendants&#x27; product to be that of the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_15">                      12.   Before proceeding further, it may be noted that on 18th August,
                      2021, in view of the contents of para No.3 of the written statement, the
                      defendants,    its   directors,   principal officers,   partners,   servants,
                      representatives and agents or any of them, were restrained from
                      manufacturing, marketing or selling pharmaceutical and medicinal
                      preparations under the mark &quot;CINZINE&quot;. Thus, the issue now before this
                      Court is whether a similar injunction is to be issued against the
                      defendants restraining them from using the proposed mark &quot;CINZITAS&quot;.

<p id="p_16">                      13.   The courts have, in several cases, recognized the trade practice of
                      combining either the name of the disease for which the medicine has been
                      prepared or the compound/salt from which the medicine has been made,
                      with the name of the company producing it. At the same time, the courts
                      have discouraged the use of the words that are &#x27;publici juris&#x27;. Whether a

                       of an ailment or compound/salt, is a fact to be determined at trial.
                      Adopting the name of the basic drug has thus been discouraged. Words
                      that are commonly used in the trade or are descriptive in nature or
                      laudatory of the quality of the good, cannot also be used as a trademark
                      by one entity to exclude such use by others. But this does not appear to be
                      the rule of the thumb. In other words, it is not as if the courts have not
                      protected the trademarks, which entail a certain level of creativity and
                      uniqueness even if drawn from the compound/salt, or those which have,
                      through long use, gained a reputation of representing the compound/salt
                      itself. When such names are coined, then if somebody else subsequently,
                      imitates these names, the courts have compared the two marks to
                      determine whether there was a deceptive similarity or not. Ordinarily, the
                      complete word is taken for comparison and not the parts of the words.

<p id="p_17">                      14.   In Cadila Health Care Ltd. (supra), the Supreme Court went on to
                      observe that the real question to be decided in cases involving medicinal
                      preparations is to see how a purchaser, being an average man of ordinary
                      intelligence, would connect the trademark with the goods. A nuanced
                      understanding of phonetics will not determine whether there is confusion
                      or not when similar sounding words are used by competitors. To say that
                      the medicinal preparations in the present case being &#x27;Scheduled-H&#x27; drugs
                      requiring a prescription, no confusion would arise, would be limiting the
                      test. As observed in several other cases, such as <a href="/doc/1748123/" id="a_20">USV Limited v. <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a>A
                      Laboratories Limited</a>, 2002 SCC OnLine Mad 870, a mistake can occur
                      while reading the prescription on account of the similarity of the names.

                       the proprietor of the trademark from those of other persons and therefore,
                      it is right and just that a trademark is necessarily the monopoly of the
                      proprietor. Using deceptively similar trademarks is an attempt by one
                      doing so, to gain from the reputation built by the proprietor of the
                      trademark sought to be copied and this very act would be causing damage
                      to the proprietor inasmuch as the intention is to divert the sales from the
                      proprietor to the one who is infringing the trademark.

<p id="p_19">                      16.   It has been also held in several cases, including Cadila Health
                      Care Ltd. (supra), that a high standard is to be applied to medicinal
                      products as substitution of the medication could be dangerous or harmful
                      to a patient as side-effects/allergies may differ between the two
                      medicines. Thus, confusion being created on account of the similar
                      sounding names has to be prevented as a policy measure.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                      17.   Turning to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff has been
                      manufacturing and selling its product &quot;CINZAN&quot; since 1989 i.e., for the
                      last more than 33 years. The product &quot;CINZAN&quot; is used for motion
                      sickness, nausea due to motion sickness, vertigo or Meniere&#x27;s disease.
                      The defendants do not dispute that their product is also for the same
                      ailment. There is further no dispute that the composition of the medicine
                      is from the salt &quot;CINNARIZINE&quot;. The contention of the learned counsel
                      for the defendants that the phrase &quot;CINZ&quot; is &#x27;publici juris&#x27; is prima facie
                      not made out. The compound is &quot;CINNARIZINE&quot; and the plaintiff has
                      taken four alphabets from the name of the salt. The defendants have not
                      explained how they have also come to use the same four letters i.e.,
                      &quot;CINZ&quot;, to name their product. If they had wanted to combine the name

                       of the salt with their company name, as claimed, they could have, quite
                      randomly, chosen any other alphabets and joined with their company
                      name &quot;TAS&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_21">                      18.    The backdrop of the action of the defendant No.1, way back in
                      2006-07, of introducing its product in the name of &quot;CINZINE&quot;, which
                      was deceptively similar in structure and in phonetics, with the plaintiff&#x27;s
                      trademark &quot;CINZAN&quot;, and the fact that it had desisted from continuing
                      with the production in that name and had abandoned its attempt to
                      register the mark &quot;CINZINE&quot;, is an extremely relevant fact. The
                      defendants are fully aware of the presence of &quot;CINZAN&quot; in the market
                      since long. They failed in getting a phonetically similar trademark
                      registered. &quot;CINZ&quot; in their proposed name of &quot;CINZITAS&quot; is clearly
                      derived from the name of the plaintiff&#x27;s product &quot;CINZAN&quot; and not from
                      the salt &quot;CINNARIZINE&quot;. It is a clear attempt at infringing the trademark
                      of the plaintiff and also of passing off their own goods as those of the
                      plaintiff. This Court is of the view that the plaintiff has, thus, disclosed a
                      prima facie case in its favour.
</p>
<p id="p_22">                      19.    In the light of the fact that this seems to be a second attempt by the
                      defendants to infringe the trademark of the plaintiff, mere accounting for
                      the sales of the product of the defendants will not suffice, as &#x27;irreparable
                      loss and injury&#x27; would be caused to the plaintiff due to dilution. The
                      products are for the same illness. The deceptive similarity will lead to
                      confusion. It may also appear, as argued, to be a variation of the
                      plaintiff&#x27;s own product, with consequences that could be adverse to the
                      plaintiff.
