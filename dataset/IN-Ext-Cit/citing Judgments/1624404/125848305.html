      This Criminal Appeal filed under <a href="/doc/1903086/" id="a_10">Section 374</a> Criminal
Procedure Code, 1973, by the advocate for the appellant praying that
this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to set aside the judgment and order
of sentence dated 8.4.2008 passed by the XXI Additional City Civil

Special Criminal Case No.165/1995.


      These Criminal Appeals having been heard and reserved on
27.06.2012 and coming on for 'Pronouncement of judgment' this day
the court delivered the following


                             JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      These appeals are heard and disposed of together as they are all

filed by the accused in the same case. The appeal in Crl.A.539/2008

is filed by accused no.2, Crl.A.No.506/2008 is filed by accused no.3

and Crl.A 542/2008 is filed by accused no.4.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The facts are as follows :-
</p>
<p id="p_3">      It was the case of the prosecution that accused no.1, who is no

more, as he had died during the pendency of the proceedings, before
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                   6</span>

the trial court, was working as an Executive Engineer in the Southern

Railway, Bangalore Cantonment. Accused no.2 was a Senior Clerk

working in the office of the Chief Engineer - Construction - Southern

Railway. Accused no.3 was an Assistant Engineer, Accused no.4 was

an Executive Engineer and Accused no.5 was an Assistant Bridge

Engineer, in the same office.    In the year 1990-91, the prosecution

claimed that there was a criminal conspiracy between the above

accused to defraud the Railways in the matter pertaining to payment

of motor vehicle tax and repair charges and purchase of spare parts

relating to the motor vehicles of the department. It was alleged that

accused no.2 had initiated 32 Pay Orders       totalling to a sum of

Rs.5,19,450/- and the amount was withdrawn. The Pay Orders raised

were in respect of non-existent vehicles and the amount was never

committed to the Regional Transport Office in respect of the

purported tax liability and therefore it was alleged that the money was

misappropriated. It was further alleged that the accused had prepared

22 supplementary bills totalling to a sum of Rs.7,99,694/-, indicating
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                  7</span>

that the amount related to repair charges and purchase of spare parts

relating to certain vehicles, which also did not belong to either the

Government of India or the Railways and it was credited to the

account held in the name of three non-existent firms, in the Canara

Bank, V V Puram Branch. It is alleged that the accounts were opened

in the name of three non-existent firms by the accused and

accordingly they had misappropriated the amount. More particularly,

it was alleged that accused no.3, in furtherance of       a criminal

conspiracy received an amount of Rs.14,625./- drawn towards one Pay

Order relating to payment of road tax in respect of vehicle no.APA

8941 and another sum of Rs.14,625/- for the very purpose of payment

of tax in respect of vehicle bearing No.MYH 9395 and yet another

sum of Rs.14,625/- in respect of vehicle bearing No.CAH 5498 and

had misappropriated the amount.      The total amount thus illegally

received by accused no.3 was Rs.43,875/-.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       Insofar as accused no.4 was concerned, he had initiated three

Pay Orders for Rs.16,922/-, Rs.20,100/- and Rs.17,078/- purportedly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                    8</span>

towards the payment of motor vehicle tax in respect of three non-

existent vehicles, namely, AAA 3964, CAY 6285 and MYH 3191 and

he had further initiated supplementary bills for payment of repair

charges and purchase of spare parts totalling to Rs.2,17,575/- in

respect of five non-existent motor vehicles. It was alleged that he had

also received the proceeds of Pay Orders amounting to Rs.15,600/-

and another Pay Order of Rs.15,600/- in the name of road tax in

respect of non-existent vehicles. He had thus misappropriated the said

sums of money. He had also received a total sum of Rs.2,04,922/-

towards repair and purchase of spare parts in respect of non-existent

vehicles and this amount was credited to the account of accused no.2,

in Canara Bank, V V Puram Branch and thereby facilitated accused

no.2 to withdraw the said amount.         It was further    alleged that

accused no.4 certified as true copies, certain forged documents in

respect of the supplementary bills relating to the non-existent vehicles.

It was on this basis that a charge sheet was filed and the accused

having pleaded not guilty and having claimed to be tried, the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                    9</span>

prosecution had examined 27 witnesses and produced and marked

Exhibits P.1 to P.336(a) and Mos.1 to 9 and the defence had examined

one witness and exhibited Exhibit D.1.

<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">      5. The learned Counsel for the appellant - accused no.3 in

Criminal Appeal No.506/2008 would contend that there was no basis
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                  15</span>

for the court below to have held that the charges against the said

accused no.3 has been established beyond all reasonable doubt. The

learned counsel would point out that mere identification of the

signatures of accused no.3 on the Pay Orders in question, by itself,

would not be evidence of receipt of payment by him, having due

regard to the procedure that was adopted insofar as such Pay Orders

were concerned.    Normally, it is the dealing clerk      himself who

receives money and makes such payment. Insofar as the details of the

amount said to have been received by the present appellant - accused

no.3 are indicated at Annexure-III to the judgment which is as

follows: -

</pre><p id="p_29">      The learned counsel would point out that in the entire body of

the judgment, the only finding    that is arrived at insofar as these

payments having been received by the appellant, is on the basis of

the signature of the appellant - accused no.3 having been identified

by a witness PW.1, as recorded at Page-48 of the judgment. The

learned counsel would point out that the allegation of accused no.3,

the appellant herein, having received payments under Exhibits P.1, P.2

and P.3 towards the tax in respect of vehicles bearing Nos.APH

9495 and CAH 5438. But, as seen from the procedure for payment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                   17</span>

of road tax, as stated by PW.7 and PW.1, the Pay Orders are not

initiated by the appellant, but it is the Stores Section which initiates

the proposals through a dealing clerk.      This is evident from the

evidence of PWs 1 and 2        as well as PW.7.     PW.19 has further

endorsed that the Pay Orders were in order and correct when he

passed them for payment. Insofar as the signatures of the appellant

appearing on Exhibits P.1, P.2 and P.3 are concerned, PW.2, PW.17

and PW.25 have endorsed that        as per the procedure      that was

generally followed in the department, the signatures of the officers

holding similar posts as the accused were affixed symbolically,

though no amount was physically received by them and it is the

dealing clerk who actually receives the amounts in respect of such

Pay Orders and this is evident from the fact that the several other

officers   namely,     Venkataraman,      Deputy      Chief     Officer,

Venkatasubramanyam, Executive Engineer have also signed the Pay

orders adopting a similar procedure, in respect of which monies have

been drawn and it is plain that the same has been misappropriated.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                   18</span>

This is evident from the evidence of PWs.1 and 2. PW.2 himself has

followed the same procedure, as is evident from the signatures

appearing on Exhibits P.31(a), P.30(a), and Ex.D1(a). PW.17 has

followed the same procedure as he has found to have signed on

Exhibit.P.51 and 53. It is further pointed out that the payment of road

tax made by the dealing clerk is endorsed by PWs 1 and 2. It is

further pointed out by the learned counsel that the Pay Orders were in

order since it was subjected to internal and external audit and there

are documents furnished by the dealing clerk for having made the

payment of road tax.
</p>
<p id="p_30">      Further, the learned Counsel would also point out that the

history book of the vehicle which contains the payment of tax was not

produced before the court. There is no evidence forthcoming as to

the receipt of payment of money by accused no.3 and therefore in the

absence of which, the said accused in his statement made under

<a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_47">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C. has explained that the very signature

appearing on the Pay Orders by itself could not have established
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                   19</span>

charges against him and therefore in the absence of any eye-witness

for accused no.3 having physically received the amounts and in the

absence of any evidence to indicate that           he had ultimately

misappropriated the amounts and in the absence of any clear evidence

against him of any complicity with any other accused, who may have

been convicted for misappropriation of amount and who, in fact, is

found to have opened fictitious accounts and misappropriated the

amounts, it cannot be said that the prosecution had made out any case

against accused no.3 and therefore, the allegation of conspiracy

having been mechanically made against all the accused and on the

basis of the evidence, which does not categorically establish the

criminal intention and the complicity of accused no.3 in the alleged

misappropriation of the amounts, the conviction of the accused results

in a miscarriage of justice. Further it is pointed out that accused no.3

is now aged more than 80 and therefore there is a need for a closer

consideration of the evidence, which is wholly inadequate to accept

that the prosecution has made out a case beyond all reasonable doubt.

   The learned Counsel for the appellant in Crl.A.No.539/2008,

which is an appeal by accused no.2, would contend that the entire

proceedings against the said appellant are vitiated for want of a valid

sanction order. The sanction order, which is at Exhibit P.329 was not

issued by a competent authority, for it is found as a fact that the said

authority was not competent to remove the appellant from his service

nor was he the disciplinary authority. This is a finding of the court

below.     The court below by an order dated 18.11.2006, while

disposing of an application seeking discharge, that notwithstanding

the invalidity of the sanction order insofar as the above appellant is

concerned, the court had opined that it would proceed to pass a

judgment on merits pertaining to other accused persons, in respect of

whom, the sanction order was found to be valid, but however, has

pronounced    the judgment on merits even as against the present

appellant and therefore, this is a miscarriage of justice.          The

competent authority to issue a sanction order was the Chief Engineer
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                   21</span>

and not the General Manager. This having been found as a fact by the

court below, the order suffers from an infirmity which goes to the root

of the matter. Without prejudice to the above preliminary objection,

on which ground alone, the appeal requires to be allowed, it is

contended by the Counsel for the appellant that even on merits, the

prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all

reasonable doubt. Having regard to the allegations made against the

above appellant, which is enumerated hereinabove, the learned

counsel would take this court through the record to demonstrate that

there is no evidence to establish that the firms, in whose accounts

various cheques are said to have been deposited have not been

established to have been withdrawn. It is also pointed out that it was

essential to place before the court irrefutable material to demonstrate

that the accounts had, in fact, been opened by the above appellant.

Ultimately, the requirement of examining, as a witness before the

court, the person who is said to have introduced the appellant as

representing his firm, has not been examined. The recipients of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                    22</span>

proceeds of the cheques, who have issued receipts have not been

examined nor the acknowledgements produced before the court. The

transactions having been spread over a substantial period of time, it

was necessary for the prosecution to have produced before the court

the relevant Log books and audit reports to disclose the actual

number of vehicles belonging to the Railways and whether there was

any audit objection as regards irregular payments made. It is also

pointed out that a significant statement made by PW.1, to the effect

that one Rajeshwari was incharge of about six vehicles concerned, no

further details are forthcoming and except stating that there were only

three vehicles belonging to the Railways. The learned Counsel relies

on the following authorities in support of his case:

</p><p id="p_38">      6. The learned Counsel for the appellant in Crl.A.542/2008,

which is filed on behalf of accused nos.4 and 5, would seek to

demonstrate that the evidence appearing against the appellants was

inadequate and therefore, it cannot be said that the guilt had been

proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">      7. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent-

State represented by the Central Bureau of Investigation, would

contend that the prosecution has totally examined 27 witnesses. The

court below has analysed in great detail the evidence of each of the

witnesses and the corresponding documents referred to by them, in

holding that the charges against the accused have been proved beyond

all reasonable doubt. The accused are all public servants employed in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                   24</span>

different capacities in the office of the Chief Engineer. They have by

32 Pay Orders totally valued at about Rs.5,19,490/- and by misuse of

22 suppliers' bills valued at Rs.7,99,694/- have withdrawn the money

from the Railway Department Fund, on the ground that the said

amount was required for payment of motor vehicle tax and towards

repair charges and purchase of spare parts in respect of non-existent

vehicles. Accused no.2, in the name of three fictitious firms, has

deposited the amount relating to repair charges and purchase of spare

parts   and   has   misappropriated    those   amounts,    apart   from

misappropriating the amounts directly received by him. While the

other accused persons have directly received certain portion of the

said amounts and misappropriated the same.        Insofar as the non-

existence of the vehicles and the manner in which the Pay Orders and

Suppliers Bills were produced, it is evident that the particulars of the

suppliers and non-payment of tax and the non-existence of such

suppliers, has been cogently established by the evidence of the

officers of the Regional Transport Office, who have placed evidence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                   25</span>

before the court, as to how many vehicles actually existed and how

many were fictitious. Insofar as the spare parts and suppliers bills

were concerned, the evidence of the Mechanic employed by the

department has disclosed the actual number of vehicles that were

available. Further, insofar the Pay Orders and the bills are concerned,

it has been established that they are all in the handwriting of Accused

no.2 and are duly signed by the other accused. These are extensively

referred to and marked in evidence. The handwriting of each of the

accused has been identified and there is no dispute about the said

documents having been executed by them.          Therefore, when the

accused have indeed executed the documents and received payments

thereof, since they have also acknowledged receipt of payment,

wherever it is directly paid, the complicity, between the accused in

effecting   these fictitious transactions, is established beyond all

reasonable doubt. The defence sought to be raised before this court by

accused no.2 is basically with reference to the invalidity of the

sanction order. Insofar as the contention on merits by the said accused
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                    26</span>

is concerned, there is hardly any scope for addressing the so-called

infirmities in the face of the overwhelming evidence which is not

possible to be ignored or found fault with, as the act of accused no.2 is

writ large in all the transactions as all the documents have emanated

from him and insofar as the validity of the order of sanction is

concerned, the law is well settled and the following authorities are

cited in support of the case of the respondent:
</p>
<p id="p_41">1. <a href="/doc/1413102/" id="a_54">Paul Varghese vs. State of Kerala and another</a>, (2009) 1
   SCC (Cri) 953,

   (2012) SCC (Cri) 1041,


      Insofar as accused nos.3,4 and 5 seeking to contend that they

were no doubt the signatories to the relevant documents, but have

routinely affixed their signature and in actual practice, they would not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                   27</span>

have received the money directly and it is the dealing clerk who

would have received the money and in the absence of any material to

demonstrate that they are the ultimate beneficiaries, it could not be

said that the charges have been brought home beyond all reasonable

doubt, is not a contention that is available, as the positions held by

them, required them to supervise the transactions to ensure that there

are no irregularities. The very purpose of endorsing the documents is

this. For the accused to contend that it was the established practice

for them to routinely affix their signatures, as is done by others, who

are witnesses for the prosecution, is hardly a ground of defence that

can be accepted. It is also contended that the plea of the accused that

they are in the evening of their life and having regard to the long

drawn out criminal proceedings, which they have suffered, the

quantum of punishment be addressed        and that the same may be

reconsidered in their favour, is also not acceptable in the light of the

law as laid down by the apex court time and again. The learned

counsel seeks to place reliance on a decision of the apex court in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                    28</span>

case of      <a href="/doc/1624404/" id="a_58">A.B.Bhaskara Rao vs. Inspector of Police, CBI

Vishakapatnam</a>, (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 265,


      The learned counsel for the respondent would submit that the

appeals be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">      8. On a perusal of the record and in the light of the rival

contentions, the glaring circumstance that appears against all the

appellant-accused is that there is no denial of their respective

signatures   on   the   relevant   documents,   whereby    they   have

acknowledged receipt of payment of amounts, which are alleged to

have been misappropriated. Insofar as accused no.2 is concerned, his

role however, is aggravated, in that, he has opened fictitious accounts

and has deposited cheques in those fictitious accounts, the illegal

benefit of which may or may not have extended to the other accused.

It is apparently for this reason that accused no.2 has been visited far

greater punishment than the other accused.       Though the defence

sought to be set up that the signatures of the accused found on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                    29</span>

relevant documents have been routinely affixed and would             not

necessarily evidence the actual receipt of the personal benefit or that

the same would establish misappropriation is not a defence that can

be entertained. Though much effort is made to demonstrate that there

were other officers against whom no action has been taken, even

though they were also found to have carried on the same practice and

even though loss must have occasioned to the department on account

of such conduct of those officers, are not circumstances which would

absolve the accused of their liability. Therefore, on merits, and on

facts, there is little scope for the accused to challenge the findings of

fact.
</p>
<p id="p_47">        The plea for reduction of the quantum of punishment that is

alternatively put-forth by the several accused also does not merit

consideration having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case.

That would leave the only other point for consideration namely,

whether the finding of the trial court that the order of sanction for

prosecution of accused no.2 was not granted by a competent authority
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                   30</span>

and therefore, would vitiate the entire proceedings. No doubt it is true

that accused no.2 had raised a preliminary objection as to the validity

of the sanction and it has been found as a fact by the court below that

the sanctioning authority was not the competent authority, but it had

opined that the trial as against the other accused would have to

proceed. However, in its final judgment, it has taken a view that

notwithstanding the invalidity of the sanction order, the trial having

run its course, there was no failure of justice that has occasioned on

account of such invalid sanction insofar as accused no.2 is concerned

and therefore, has held that the proceedings against accused no.2 are

also not vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_48">      In this regard, the learned counsel for the appellant -accused

no.2 has cited several authorities to contend otherwise and draws

attention to the judgment in Mohd.Iqbal Ahmed, supra, wherein the

apex Court has observed that the grant of sanction       is not an idle

formality or an acrimonious exercise, but a solemn and sacrosanct act

which affords protection to Government servants against frivolous
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    31</span>

prosecutions and must therefore be strictly complied with before any

prosecution can be launched against the public servant concerned.



</p><p id="p_49">      The learned Counsel also drew attention to a judgment of this

court in Basappa, supra, wherein this Court has observed that the plea

of validity or absence of sanction is required to be taken at the earliest

stage, which accused no.2 had done and in the light of the trial court

having found that the competent authority had not granted sanction, it

has resulted in a grave miscarriage of justice. He has also placed

reliance on other judgments cited, to contend that the illegality as

regards want of sanction being evident, the entire proceedings against

accused no.2 would have to be set at naught.
</p>
<p id="p_50">

</p><p id="p_51">      On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the respondent has

pointed out from the authorities cited that want of valid sanction for

prosecution is not a circumstance for reversal of conviction and

sentence by the appellate court. Even though any such objection had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                    32</span>

been raised by the accused at the earliest point of time, the trial court

itself having found that there was no failure of justice occasioned,

thereby would certainly limit the scope of interference in appeal,

especially since the accused has suffered a conviction and the role of

the accused     in the commission of the offences alleged has been

established beyond all reasonable doubt. It is also contended that the

absence or invalidity of sanction becomes immaterial once the trial

has ended in conviction. The object of providing for sanction for

prosecution is to save a public servant from frivolous, vindictive or

mala fide prosecution and such sanction becomes meaningless, if on

trial, he is, in fact, found guilty. The learned Counsel would submit

that the phrase 'failure of justice' employed in <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_59">Section 19</a> of the PC

Act is too pliable an expression and the courts would necessarily have

to examine whether indeed failure of justice has occasioned. It is also

urged that the reduction or lenience in sentence cannot be considered

where an offence under <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_60">Section 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_61">13</a> of the PC Act are proved,

unlike under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_62">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, 1947, whereby there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                   33</span>

was a provision for relaxation of sentence. <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_63">With the PC Act</a> coming

into force, such relaxation is not lawfully permissible as it is not

contemplated in law. It is further contended that an error, omission or

irregularity in the grant of sanction would not be fatal to the case of

the prosecution unless it has resulted in failure of justice in the

opinion of this court.   The compliance with <a href="/doc/126927/" id="a_64">Section 19(1)</a> of the PC

Act is a matter of procedure and does not go to the root of the

jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_52">

</p><p id="p_53">      In the light of the law as laid down by the apex court, it cannot

be said that even though the sanction for prosecution insofar       as

accused no.2 is concerned, is said to have been granted by an

incompetent authority, but who was competent insofar as the other

accused were concerned, and that was not under serious challenge by

the other accused. In that view of the matter and having regard to the

conviction of accused no.2, on the allegations against him having

been established beyond all reasonable doubt, the validity of sanction
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                   34</span>

becomes immaterial, as it does not result in any failure of justice. In

that view of the matter, these appeals are dismissed.
