<pre id="pre_1">IN THE COURT OF SH. MANOJ JAIN: ADDL. DISTRICT JUDGE:
                       DELHI

Suit No. 7/05

IN RE:

Sh. Navnit Kumar Ashtana &amp; Anr.                   .................Plaintiffs

                                   Versus

Smt. Sunita Ashtana &amp; Anr.                        ................Defendants


ORDER
</pre>

<p id="p_1">1           Sh. Virender Kumar Ashtana (since deceased) owned and

possessed property no. 153, Pushpanjali, Vikas Marg Extension, Delhi-92

(hereinafter referred to as 'suit property'). He had two sons, namely, Sh.

Vinit Kumar Ashtana and Sh. Navnit Kumar Ashtana and one daughter Smt.

Rashmi Umesh Kapadia. Sh. Virender Kumar Ashtana died on 26.07.2000.

His wife and his eldest son Sh. Vinit Kumar Ashtana had predeceased him.

Defendant no. 1 is widow of such predeceased son and defendant no. 2 is

daughter of such predeceased son. It has been claimed in the suit filed by

Sh. Navnit Kumar Ashtana and his sister Smt. Rashmi Umesh Kapadia that

after the death of their father, suit property has devolved upon three

branches in equal proportion and plaintiff no. 1, plaintiff no. 2 and

defendants are entitled to 1/3 share each and they have accordingly prayed

for partition. Various other reliefs have also been claimed.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                              1 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
 2           Defendants have resisted the suit and have claimed that suit is

without any cause of action as Sh. Virender Kumar Ashtana had left behind

a registered Will dated 22.01.1999 and as per aforesaid Will, suit property

has devolved upon the defendants as true and absolute owners to the

exclusion of all others and plaintiffs have no rights whatsoever to seek

partition. Various other pleas have also been taken in the written statement.



3           Issues were framed on 09.05.2007 and relevant part of said

order reads as under:

               no requirement of leading any evidence and
              such issue is required to be decided on the
              basis of registered will coupled with the legal
              provisions. Aforesaid issue is accordingly
              treated as preliminary issue.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_2">4             I have heard arguments on aforesaid preliminary issue. Entire

fate of the case hinges upon the interpretation of Will.



5             Counsel for defendants has contended that as per registered Will

left behind by the testator, suit property has devolved upon the defendants

and, therefore, suit is totally misconceived and plaintiffs are not justified in

seeking partition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

6             Learned counsel for the plaintiffs has, on the other hand, refuted

aforesaid contention and has contended that since eldest son of the testator

i.e. Vinit Kumar Ashtana had predeceased the testator, legacy has lapsed

under <a href="/doc/1535476/" id="a_1">Section 105</a> of Indian Succession Act and, therefore, Will has no role

to play and all the three branches are entitled to inherit the suit property on

equal basis i.e. on 1/3 basis each.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

7             It is also not in dispute that late Sh. Vinit Kumar Ashtana had

also one son, namely, Virat Ashtana who also unfortunately expired on

21.09.2003.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

9             At the very outset, I would like to mention that plaintiffs are

guilty of suppressing of a very material &amp; crucial fact. In the entire plaint,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                3 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
 there is no reference whatsoever with respect to registered Will. Factum of

execution of registered Will was brought to the notice by the defendants in

their written statement and such fact was not disputed by the plaintiffs when

the replication was filed. Even during course of the arguments, Ms. Anju

Lal, learned counsel for the plaintiffs has not disputed the execution of the

registered Will. She has, however, contended that there was no requirement

of mentioning the factum of Will as legacy had lapsed. Even if if had

allegedly lapsed, I feel that plaintiffs should have transparent enough in

their approach and should have mentioned the factum of Will in the plaint

itself. I do not know whether suppression is deliberate or otherwise but

certainly it is not in good taste. More so, when plaintiff no. 1 himself had

appointed plaintiff no. 2 as his attorney to apply for probate or letter of

administration as per the same Will only.           Once such Will was duly

acknowledged by the plaintiffs themselves and they had obtained benefits in

terms of the same, it was least expected that they would not reveal such Will

in their plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

10           Now let me straightway come to the relevant part of the Will

which reads as under:

            conceived by me when my wife was alive and
            she was very happy to hear my desire and with
            a smile she had said ''My dear'', you have said
            what I had desired, but always kept silent so
            that you may not take it otherwise. You may
            give your wealth to anybody desired by you if I
            leave you for heaven earlier to you, but give
            this house to our eldest son. ''Although I am
            bequeathing this house to my son Shri Vinit
            Kumar Ashtana, yet this does not mean that I
            am doing this under emotional pressure. I feel
            great pleasure to think that I have respected my
            late wife's wishes.

<p id="p_7">11          <a href="/doc/1535476/" id="a_2">Section 105</a> of Indian Succession Act reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">             ''105 In what case legacy lapses- (1) If the

             unless it appears by the will that the testator
             intended that it should go to some other person.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_8">12          Ld counsel for the plaintiff has contended that if the will      is

read in the right earnest, it become apparent that the testator had only

desired to seek a life interest in favour of his eldest son and did not want to

bequeath the suit property in favour of wife of his such eldest son. It has

been argued that since the legatee i.e. Shri Vinit Kumar Ashtana has

predeceased the testator the legacy stood lapsed and, therefore, the suit

property had come to the joint family pool and was to devolve as if there

were no will. She has also placed her reliance upon one judgment of

Lahore High Court cited as Smt. Shiv Devi and others Versus Nauharia

Ram AIR 1940 Lahore 318. I have seen the aforesaid judgment and in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               5 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
 aforesaid judgment, it has been observed that in order to prevent legacy

from lapsing, the testator must clearly exclude lapse and must indicate as to

who was to take in case of legatee dying in his life time.



13           I need not remind myself that it is the duty of the court to carry

out the intention of the testator in the true spirit and testator's intention is to

be effectuated as far as possible.      In the case of AIR 2004 SUPREME

COURT 2060 "COMMR., JALANDHAR DIVN. V. M.K. ABROL" it

has been observed that as per <a href="/doc/914722/" id="a_3">Section 87</a> of the Succession Act, 1925 the

intention of the testator shall be effectuated as far as possible. It was also

observed that in the matter of interpretation of wills, the Court has to look at

the wishes of the testator indicated therein.

would be justified in exercising its curial draughtsmanship for the testator

Court had undoubted jurisdiction to do so. It also approved the following

passage from Jarman on Wills, 8th Edn. at page 592 :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">             "Where it is clear on the face of a Will that the

             used, and it is also clear what are the words,
             which he has omitted, those words may be
             supplied in order to effectuate the intention, as
             collected from the context."

"<a href="/doc/1622258/" id="a_5">LAKSHMANA NADAR V. B. RAMIER</a>" it has been held that the

court's primary duty in such cases is to ascertain from the language

employed by the testator "what were his intentions", keeping in view the

surrounding circumstances, his ordinary notions as a Hindu in respect to

devolution of his property, his family relationships, etc.; in other words, to

ascertain his wishes by putting itself so to say, in his armchair.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_10">16          On a careful perusal of the will, it becomes apparent that the

testator had excluded his other son i.e. Shri Navnit Kumar Ashtana and did

not want to bequeath suit property in favour of Shri Navnit Kumar Ashtana

i.e. plaintiff. His sole desire was to bequeath the property to his eldest son.

Branch emanating from plaintiff Sh Navnit Kumar Ashtana was excluded

and this is the only logical inference which one can draw from the will in

question. The testator wanted his eldest son to inherit the property and also

desired that after the death of his eldest son and also of his wife, the

property would be inherited by their son i.e. Master Virat Kumar Ashtana.

He also mentioned that it was the desire of his late wife as well. On the

perusal of the will, it also becomes apparent that he had no grudge against

his another son or against his daughter and rather it was claimed in the will

that he had already spent a substantial amount of money on Sh. Navnit

Kumar Ashtana (plaintiff no. 1 herein) in order to establish his business

and he also bequeathed his movable property excepting those goods lying in

the suit house in favour of the plaintiff no. 1. Thus all the articles lying in

the locker, fixed deposits, units and cash balance in his saving account and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                               7 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
 pension account were given to none other than plaintiff No.1. Arrangement

was also made for plaintiff No.2. It is really unfortunate that plaintiffs are

not able to decipher the intention of their father. In Hindu      System, it is

rather pious duty of the son to carry out the last desire of his father in the

right earnest but in the case in hand, the situation is different and plaintiffs

are trying to twist the will in such a way so as to clearly defeat the desire of

the testator as per their own whims &amp; fancies and interest. It is not

permissible at all. The intention of the testator is loud and clear and he

wanted the suit property to go to his eldest son and after the death of his son

and his wife to their son Virat Kumar Ashtana.
</p>
<p id="p_11">

17          I have seen the judgment of Shiv Devi (supra). However, in

one later judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court, it has been held that the

intention to exclude lapse can also be gathered. I also deem it fit and

proper to extract following observations and case law discussed by Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1243036/" id="a_6">S. Jhansi Lakshmi Bai v. Pothana Appa

Rao</a> AIR 1969 SUPREME COURT 1355

</p><p id="p_12">            11. We are concerned to construe the
            provisions of <a href="/doc/1535476/" id="a_7">Section 105</a> of the Indian
            Succession Act. That section enacts that a
            legacy shall lapse and form part of the residue
            of the testator's property if the legatee does not
            survive the testator except where it appears by
            the will that the testator intended that the
            legacy shall on the legatee not surviving him go
            to some other person. We are unable to agree
            that the intention of the testator that a legacy
            shall not lapse may be given effect to only if the
            testator expressly directs that if the legatee dies
            during his lifetime the legacy shall go to some
            other person, and that intention to exclude
            lapse cannot be inferred. <a href="/doc/1535476/" id="a_8">Section 105</a> (1) does
            not say, nor does it imply that the testator must

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               8 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
 have expressly envisaged the possibility of
lapse in consequence of the legatee dying
during his lifetime and must have made a
provision for that contingency.
</p>
<p id="p_13">12. In In re, Lowman; Devenish v. Pester,
(1895) 2 Ch 348 a testator, who under a
settlement was absolutely entitled to a moiety of
the proceeds of a certain real estate under a
trust for sale, by his will devised that the real
estate by its proper description, together with
certain real estate of his own, to trustees, to the
use of H, for life, with remainder to trustees to
preserve the contingent remainders, with
remainder to the use of the first and other sons
of H successively in tail male, with remainder
to the use of the first and other sons of his niece
E successively in tail male, with remainder to
the use of the first and other sons of his niece M
successively in tail male, with remainder to the
use of the first and other sons of his niece F
successively in tail male, with remainder over.
H survived the testator and died a bachelor. M
also survived the testator and died unmarried.
E was still alive but unmarried and Seventy
years of age. F had two sons, the eldest of
whom died before the testator. It was held that
when there are in a will successive limitations
of personal estate in favour of several persons
absolutely, the first of those persons who
survives the testator takes absolutely, although
he would have taken nothing if any previous
legatee had survived and had taken: the effect
of the failure of an earlier gift is to accelerate,
not to destroy, the later gift.
</p>
<p id="p_14">13. This rule was applied in In re, Dunstan;
</p><p id="p_15">Dunstan v. Dunstan, (1918) 2 Ch 304. A
testatrix by her will gave freeholds absolutely
to A, subject to the bequest that whatever out of
the freeholds should remain alter A's death
shall be given to a named charity. It was held
that if A had survived the testatrix the gift to the
charity would have been repugnant and void,
and A would have taken the freeholds
absolutely. But since A died in the lifetime of
the testatrix, the doctrine of repugnancy did not
apply, and the gift to charity was accelerated
and took effect.

made to any child or lineal descendant of the testator, even if the legatee

dies in the lifetime of the testator, provided any of his lineal descendant

survives the testator. In other words, if the legatee dies leaving behind a son

or daughter or any other lineal descendant who is alive at the time of the

death of the testator, the bequest shall not lapse.

the opinion that <a href="/doc/480616/" id="a_12">Section 109</a> of the Act was enacted to protect the legacy for

the benefit of the legal heirs of the predeceased child. It was observed as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                               10 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
 follows at pages 315-316:-
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">           "10. . . . . . . . . . . .When the testator specifically
           excludes some of his children and wants his
           estate to go to the remaining children, then what
           he really means is that it should go to them and
           in case of any one of them predeceases him then
           it should go to the heirs of the predeceased child
           and precisely for that matter provision was
           made in <a href="/doc/480616/" id="a_13">Section 109</a> of the Act that such
           predeceased child by fiction of law shall be

           death of the testator so that the heirs of the pre-
           deceased child get the benefit of the testament
           and qua his share it should not lapse. The
           exclusion of some of the children from
           inheritance goes to show that the testator never
           intended that any part of his estate should go to
           them and if <a href="/doc/480616/" id="a_14">Section 109</a> of the Act is not

           children will share the same. The result would
           be that the children whom he never wanted to
           succeed would succeed to some share. To avoid
           this result to flow <a href="/doc/480616/" id="a_15">Section 109</a> of the Act clearly
           provided that whenever testament is made in

</p>
<p id="p_22">KRISHNAN NAMBIAR AIR 1987 KERALA 88 , it has been observed as

under:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">            Three conditions have to be fulfilled under this
            Section, namely (i) the bequest must be to a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                               11 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12"> (ii) the child or lineal descendant dies in the
lifetime of the testator leaving a lineal
descendant who survives the testator; and (iii)
there is no contrary intention in the will. The
policy of the Section is to prevent a portion
given by a testator to a child going, from the
estate of such child, or his family being left
portion less by reason only of the death of the
child before the testator. The effect of the
Section is to prolong the life of the original
devisee or legatee beyond the life of the testator
and to give effect to the will, by avoiding a
lapse. On the very terms of the Section, it
operates to confer the bequest on the heirs of
the child or lineal descendant unless a contrary
intention appears by the will. The contrary
intention that the legacy should lapse on the
death of the legatee before the testator, has to
be found in the will itself. The words "unless a
contrary intention appears by the will" mean
that there must be a clear, unambiguous and
unequivocal intention by the testator in the will
itself before a bequest in favour of a child or
lineal descendant can be defeated. (Vide the
decision of the High Court of Bombay in Amy
Rusi v. Framroj, (1954) 56 Bom LR 910). The
intention of the testator should be clear that he
intended the bequest to lapse in the event of the
legatee predeceasing him. <a href="/doc/1535476/" id="a_16">Section 105</a> of the
Indian Succession Act lays down that if the
legatee does not survive the testator, the legacy
cannot take effect, but shall lapse and form
part of the residue of the testator's property
unless it appears by the will that the testator
intended that it should go to some other person.
</blockquote><p id="p_23"><a href="/doc/1077470/" id="a_17">Section 107</a> deals with the case of a legacy to
legatees, in words which show that the testator
intended to give them distinct shares of the
legacy, then if any legatee dies before the
testator, so much of the legacy as was intended
for him shall fall into the residue of the
testator's property. These two Sections lay
down the general rule of lapse in the case of a
legatee pre-deceasing the testator. <a href="/doc/480616/" id="a_18">Section 109</a>
is an exception to this general rule of lapse, in
the case of a bequest to a child or other lineal
descendant. The intent of the Section appears
to be to prevent a lapse unless the testator has
evinced a clear intention that the legacy should
lapse on the death of the legatee before the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                 12 (Suit No. 7/05)</span>
             succession opened.
</p>
<p id="p_24">

23          Thus, it becomes clear that the intention of testator was to

bequeath the property to the branch of his eldest son and to no one else.

Moreover, in view of <a href="/doc/480616/" id="a_19">Section 109</a> of Indian Succession Act, legacy does

not lapse at all because at the time of death of Shri Vinit Kumar Ashtana,

his son Virat Kumar Ashtana was alive. Let me give some relevant dates:-



</p><pre id="pre_4">            (1)Date of execution of will                    22.01.1999

            (2)Date of death of death of testator           26.07.2000

</pre><p id="p_25">            (3)Death of death of Vinit Kumar Kr. Ashtana 21.07.2000

            (4)Date of death of Virat Kumar Ashtana         21.09.2003



24          Though Shri Vinit Kumar Ashtana had predeceased the testator

by few days yet as per the tone and clearcut intention of the testator, the

property could not be reverted back to the joint family pool. <a href="/doc/480616/" id="a_20">Section 109</a>

which is in fact an exception to <a href="/doc/1535476/" id="a_21">Section 105</a> of Indian Succession Act

clearly stipulates that in such a situation, the legacy would not lapse and

would take effect as if the death of the legatee had happened immediately

after the death of the testator. Since Master Virat Kumar Ashtana was

alive at that time and since there is no contrary intention appearing in the

will and in view of the aforesaid judgments, the property could not have

been reverted to the joint family pool. Rather if this is allowed to happen,

it would defeat the intention of testator and would disturb the departed

soul.

 25          In view of my aforesaid discussion, it becomes apparent that the

present suit is totally misconceived and plaintiffs can not stake any claim of

any nature whatsoever in the suit property and are not justified in seeking

partition of the suit property.      Suit property had devolved upon the

defendants as per the explicit intention of testator.



26          Accordingly, preliminary issue No.2 is decided in favour of the

defendants and against the plaintiff and, resultantly, the suit is ordered to

be dismissed. No order as to costs.
