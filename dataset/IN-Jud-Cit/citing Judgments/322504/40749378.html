                                    JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">      Mainly, the petitioner challenges the cancellation of the tender as well

as the retender notification issued as per Ext.P11. It is contended that the

petitioner's financial bid was the lowest one pursuant to Ext.P1 notification

and the attempt to have a retender is clearly malafide and is to deny the

grant of contract to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_2">      2. The petitioner company is engaged in the manufacture and supply

of medicinal items under the Drugs and <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_1">Cosmetics Act</a>. The tender herein is

one concerning      the supply of          Rabies Vaccine.           It is stated that the

petitioner is one of the largest manufacturing companies having turn over of

more than Rs. 100 crores for the last financial year and they have been

supplying their products to more than 70 countries worldwide. They have

world-class manufacturing facilities and have won various national awards,

the details of which are given in para 4 of the writ petition.

</p><p id="p_3">      3.    The tender notification Ext.P1 is for the supply of various

medicines and provides for two bid systems, viz. technical bid and price

bid. The second respondent, viz. the Kerala Medical Services Corporation

Ltd. (for short the Corporation) invited the tender. The substance of the

contentions of the petitioner is the following: The last date for submission

of tender was 6.2.2012. Rabies Vaccine is included as serial No.9 in in

Section IV of the tender notification. The tender notification provides for

various procedures in the matter. When a pre tender meeting was held, the

petitioner had raised an objection and made a representation as per Ext.P2

with regard to the discrepancy       of the item in the tender notification

concerning the standard, quality and the route of administration.        The

petitioner requested to change the said description of the vaccine. In Ext.P1

the route of administration was notified as Intra Muscular/Intra Dermal

("IM/ID" for short). It is pointed out that an amendment was brought out

as per Ext.P3 thereafter, wherein the unit quantity has been shown as "1 ml

Vial" without referring to any route of administration as "IM/ID.        The

petitioner submitted a tender for the supply of Rabies Vaccine 1 ml Vial

ID Administration at the rate of Rs.133.43 per Vial. The petitioner was

successful both in the technical bid and the price bid.        Ext.P4 is the

provisional list of selected suppliers published on 26.3.2012 by the second

respondent in their official website. The rate quoted by M/s. Chiron

Behring, Mumbai was Rs.183.75 per Vial and M/s. Indian Immunologicals

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                       -3-</span>


Ltd., Hyderabad was Rs.134.21 per Vial.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       4. It is submitted that thereafter violating the procedures provided in

the tender notification, the decision on selection of the supplier for Rabies

Vaccine was referred to the Board of Directors by Ext.P5. Ext.P6 is the true

copy of the Bid Ranking Status wherein with regard to Rabies Vaccine,

referring to the complaints by all the bidders, the matter is left to the

decision of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Thereafter a notice

was issued to the petitioner as per Ext.P7 to attend a hearing on the

complaints which were submitted by the petitioner and the other tenderers,

on    16.4.2012 in the Chamber of the Principal Secretary (Health),

Government Secretariat, Thiruvananthapuram by the sub committee of the

Board of Directors.      The petitioner's representative also attended the

meeting. The discussion was on the route of administration, viz. "IM/ID".

The petitioner's representative submitted that in the light of Ext.P3

amendment such a question does not arise. Later, Ext.P8 letter was issued

to the petitioner to submit documentary proof (a letter or certificate) issued

by the Drugs Controller General of India (for short DCGI) to the effect that

the Rabies Vaccine offered by the petitioner can be used for both IM and ID

route of administration valid as on the date of the tender. The petitioner

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                        -4-</span>


submitted a reply as per Ext.P9 stating various aspects including that the

clarification as per Ext.P8 is not required. It was pointed out that the same

product cannot be administered for both purposes, Intra Muscular and Intra

Dermal. It is the case of the petitioner that no vaccine is capable of both

applications and therefore the clarification sought was unnecessary and it

was done deliberately to disturb the tendering procedure and as a ground to

cancel the tender.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       5. After Ext.P10 cancellation order was published, Ext.P11 retender

notification has been issued.        In Ext.P11 the route of administration is

shown as "ID" and the unit is "1 ml Vial" with a strength of "2.5 IU".

</p><p id="p_6">       6.   The vehement contention raised is that the entire process is

vitiated by arbitrariness. It is pointed out that the respondents are bound to

guarantee a level playing field. The petitioner mainly contends that by

Ext.P3 amendment, the Corporation had dispensed with the specification of

Rabies Vaccine based on the route of administration as "IM" and "ID".

This was done after the clarification in the pre tender discussion as provided

under para 6.17 of the tender conditions. Now the reason stated in Ext.P10

is that the route of administration has not been mentioned in Ext.P3 which is

unjustified. It is also stated that the alleged complaints of the tenderers have

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                     -5-</span>


no real relevance in the matter, as already the issue was settled. Ext.P8

was issued only as a prelude to the cancellation. No vaccine is capable of

application in both ways. It is thus explained that it is after the price bid

was opened a change was attempted only to deny the acceptance of the

tender of the petitioner. When all the parties understood that the quantity

required and the unit specified can only be by way of "ID" method, merely

because of the absence of the word "ID" in Ext.P3, the tender cannot be

cancelled.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      7. Further, it is pointed out that as far as the tender procedure is

concerned, it is entirely a matter for a decision of the Tender Inviting

Authority as well as the Bid Evaluation Committee therein and the Board of

Directors have no role. Therefore, it is submitted that the cancellation is at

the dictation of an authority who is not empowered in the matter. No other

authority can interfere with the tendering process. The Bid Evaluation

Committee had practically taken the decision in respect of the complaints

before opening of the price bid which led to Ext.P3. Therefore, a reference

of the matter to the Board of Directors itself is with the malafide motive to

deny the benefit to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      8. The second respondent has filed a detailed counter affidavit. The

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                      -6-</span>


allegation of arbitrariness and malafides have been denied. It is stated that

the Corporation is an agency of the Government which is procuring drugs

and other    supplies required for the Government hospitals of the State

through open tender processes.          As far as anti Rabies Vaccines are

concerned, they are developed using different media and methods as

approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).             It was

originally being injected through IM route and now it is administered

mostly by ID route.           Rabies Vaccines find widespread use         in

Government hospitals. In para 3 of the counter affidavit, the chronology of

events have been detailed. It is averred that suggestions/objections raised

by tenderers in the pre bid meeting on 19.1.2012 as well as Ext.P2

submitted by the petitioner were thoroughly examined and inputs were

sought from the consultant of the Corporation who is a retired State Drugs

Controller.  It is based on his opinion the tender notification was amended

by which anti rabies vaccine made from Duck Embryo was included. When

the technical bid was opened on 8.2.2012 there were four bidders. Then, a

complaint was received that rabies vaccine with cell culture through Duck

Embryo is not suitable for ID route of administration. Ext.R2(a) is the copy

of the complaint.   In the light of the complaint the Corporation decided to

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                     -7-</span>


require all bidders to submit necessary proof that their vaccine can be

administered through both IM/ID route. For vaccines administered through

the IM route the dosage prescribed is only 1ML/0.5ml vaccine per injection

and for ID route the dosage prescribed is only 0.1 ML per injection. Now

the system is being shifted towards ID route of administration and the

requirement for anti rabies vaccine to be administered through the IM route

is comparatively minuscule.      It is further contended that only after the

technical bid was opened and complaints were raised by each other that it

was brought to the notice of the Corporation that the DCGI requires

separate licences to be taken by manufacturers for anti rabies vaccines

administered through the IM route and to be administered through the ID

route. Therefore, every one of the tenderers were required to certify and to

submit documents as noted above. Ext.R2(b) notice was issued to M/s.

Cadila Healthcare Ltd., one of the tenderers. They could not produce the

documents required and therefore their bid was not considered. The three

bids remaining were considered and the price bid was also opened.

</p><p id="p_9">      9. After the price bids were opened there were further objections by

the bidders which are produced as Exts.R2(c) to R2(e). These required in

depth examination and the tenders for anti rabies vaccine was deferred and

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    -8-</span>


a notice was issued as per Ext.P5. To this process the petitioner did not

make any objection at any point of time. Upto the issuance of Ext.P11, the

petitioner did not raise any objection. Therefore, the petitioner should be

considered to have been acquiesced with the proceedings issued by the

Managing Director, who is the tender inviting authority.

</p><p id="p_10">      10. The petitioner as well as two other bidders were called for a

personal hearing on 16.4.2012 as per Ext.P7 by the Sub Committee in the

Chambers of the Principal Secretary to the Government, Health Department,

the Chairman of the Corporation. The sub committee was authorised to hear

them. The sub committee meeting was held on 16.4.2012 which was chaired

by the Principal Secretary    to    Government, Health Department, the

Managing Director of KMSCL, the State Drugs Controller and the Head of

the Department, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences. All of them         are

members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The petitioner's

representative was also there.   The petitioner as well as M/s. Indian

Immunological Ltd. did not have any specific objections. M/s. Chiron

Behring complained that the rival manufacturers do not have product

approval for    1ML   anti rabies vaccine for both IM and ID route of

administration issued by the DCGI. Therefore, it was decided to require

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                      -9-</span>


all the bidders who had not produced documents, to show authorisation, as

the Corporation requires both IM and ID route usage. All the bidders

agreed to do so, within     two weeks time. Ext.R2(f) is the copy of the

minutes. To Ext.P8 notice, the petitioner gave Ext.P9 reply stating the

stand that requiring licence for both IM and ID route of administration is

not called for. The reply will show that the use of their vaccine of 1ML for

IM route is under active consideration by DCGI and that the

recommendations of the committee were placed before the Board of

Directors in its 20th meeting held on 13.8.2012. The recommendation of the

committee was approved by the Board of Directors and accordingly Ext.P10

cancellation notice was issued and a fresh tender notice was thereafter

issued.
</p>
<p id="p_11">       11. It is also averred in para 6 of the counter affidavit that a

committee chaired by the Managing Director of the Corporation evaluated

all the tender documents supplied by the bidders. It was of the view that if

the specification in the amended notification Ext.P3 was insisted, there will

be only one eligible bidder, viz. Chiron Behring who have produced

approval for both IM and ID routes. Therefore, the sub committee observed

that the appropriate course of action is 1 ML rabies vaccine for ID route of

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                      -10-</span>


administration which will enable all manufacturers to submit qualified

tenders. The committee was of the view that there was certain ambiguities

in the specification of product described in the tender which resulted in the

confusion. It was also found that there is sufficient stock of rabies vaccine

0.5ML suitable for the IM route of administration and accordingly a revised

notification was issued.     Ext.R2(g) is the copy of the minutes of the

committee. It is pointed out that the retendering process is for the best

interest of the participants and if the petitioner's bid is the lowest, they will

also qualify for supplies and on the contrary, if purchases are pursued based

on the original specifications and prices quoted, only the L3 bidder will

qualify and there will be a huge difference in the cost. Various other factors

are also pointed out in the counter affidavit. It is mainly pointed out that

the fact that      vaccine cannot       be used through another route of

administration in the light of the different licencing process by the DCGI,

was brought to the notice of the Corporation later and it is in that context a

fresh tender was invited.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      12. It is explained in para 9 that the Board of Directors is exclusively

comprised of various Government functionaries and there was no other

member in the Board who have got any other interest. The Chairman is the

Principal Secretary to the Government, Health and Family Welfare

Department.     The other Directors are     State Mission Director, NRHM,

Director of Health Services, Director of Medical Education, Drugs

Controller, Additional Secretary, Finance Department and Head of the

Department and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences. It is therefore pointed

out that there are no malafides in the matter. The Board of Directors of the

Company is a supreme body which is competent to take a decision when

such questions are raised. Therefore, there is no merit in the contention of

the petitioner that an external agency has taken over the decision making

process with regard to the tendering. It is pointed out that there had been

deliberations with the Board of Directors which is perfectly justified as the

interest of the Corporation and that of the general public are involved.

Committee in terms of clause 6.16.14 of the tender conditions. The Board

of Directors of the Corporation or any technical committee have no role to

play in the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_15">       15. It is submitted that the alleged ploy now adopted by issuing the

retender notification and by specifying the route of administration as "Intra

Dermal" was not at all required in the light of Ext.P3 amendment to the

first notification Ext.P1. It is submitted that in Ext.P1 in Section IV the

route of administration is shown as "IM/ID" and the unit is shown as "1ml"

Vial   apart from the strength of dosage. The petitioner had raised an

objection in the pre tender meeting which was held on 19.1.2012 with

regard to the description of the item. The suggestion of the petitioner is

evident from Ext.P2. It was pointed out that 1ml quantity cannot be used

for Intra Muscular route whereas it can be used only for Intra Dermal route

of administration.    Ext.P3 was issued after the said suggestion of the

petitioner was accepted and both the routes of administration have been

deleted therein.   What is added therein is the words "Duck Embryo".

Everybody understood that the route of administration is "ID" only and

further tendering process was undertaken accordingly. While inviting this

Court's attention to para 3 of the counter affidavit, it is pointed out that as

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                     -13-</span>


on 23.3.2012 with the exclusion of M/s. Cadila Healthcare, there were only

three tenderers left. Thereafter on 26.3.2012 the price bid was opened. Para

6.16.7 and 6.16.8 of Ext.P1 notification have thus been complied with.

Thereafter, the provisional drug-wise rate list of all the accepted products of

the eligible bidders and list of rejected bidders will be published in the

notice board in terms of para 6.16.9 as well as 6.16.10. Going by the said

publication which is evident from Ext.P4 herein, the petitioner is the L1

tenderer. Therefore, the respondents had to proceed with the next stage

under para 6.16.11 and the remaining steps will have to be completed

accordingly. It is submitted that there is no justification for issuing Ext.P5

on the plea that there were complaints in the matter. An attempt to refer to

the decision of the Board of Directors is therefore illegal and malafide. The

petitioner's price bid reflected in Ext.P4 will show that the quoted rate is

Rs.133.43 whereas the rate quoted by the L2 tenderer is 134.21 and that of

L3 is 183.75. It is submitted that the deferring of the decision to accept L1

tender and referring the matter to the Board of Directors is clearly to deny

grant of tender to the petitioner. The complaints had to be decided at the

time of examination of the technical bid and thereafter what remains is only

opening of the price bid. No further enquiry is required after the Bid

Evaluation Committee accepted the technical bid. Therefore, it is pointed

out that the entire attempt is a clandestine one to scuttle the tendering

process. Ext.P5 is therefore actuated by malafides and Ext.P11 retender

notice was not at all required in the light of the amended notification Ext.P3

itself. Learned Senior Counsel further explained that as far as the route of

administration is concerned, a vaccine for which the route of administration

is IM, cannot be used for the other route, viz. ID. Therefore, it was not

necessary in Ext.P11 now to notify it as ID especially, 1 ml indicates ID

route itself. It is also submitted that the notice issued to the petitioner

Ext.P8 asking to explain the details regarding the licences, if any, for IM/ID

routes is with a preconceived attempt to deny the award of contract to the

petitioner. Nobody had any such complaint before and the petitioner has

suitably replied it in Ext.P9. It is submitted that a licence for use of a

vaccine for IM route by the petitioner is not at all required since the

contract notified covered only ID route. It is therefore submitted that the

well settled principles laid down by this Court and the Apex Court with

regard to providing a level playing field has been clearly violated. Learned

Senior Counsel relied upon the following decisions of the Apex Court and

this Court: <a href="/doc/55804/" id="a_2">W.B. State Electricity Board v. Patel Enginering Co. Ltd</a>.

<p id="p_16">      16. Shri M. Ajay, learned Standing Counsel for the Corporation

submitted that the procedure has been followed in a transparent manner. It

is submitted that the medicine can be used for the different routes of

administration.    In the first notification, Ext.P1, the specification was

"Im/Id" indicating both the routes.      When Ext.P3 was issued after an

application was received from one company to include Duck Embryo, the

same was done. But the required specification was unfortunately left out in

Ext.P3.    Initially there were four bidders and by referring to the

chronological events, learned Standing Counsel explained that one of the

bidders, viz. M/s. Cadila Healthcare was directed to inform whether their

product can be administered by IM/ID route. It is submitted that in tune

with the transparent procedure, the key documents submitted by the bidders

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                      -16-</span>


were published on 15.3.2012 and thereafter on 23.3.2012 the notice of

eligible bidders was published after excluding M/s. Cadila Healthcare as

their product could not be used by ID route. It is submitted that after the

price bids were opened also, complaints were received from the tenderers

including the petitioner, raising objections with regard to the tenders of

other participating tenderers.     The objections have been produced as

Exts.R2(c) to R2(e). Since a detailed examination of the objections was

required, the matter was deferred and referred to the Board of Directors as

per Ext.P5 wherein it was mentioned that further proceedings will be subject

to the decision of the Board of Directors. There was no objection on the

part of the petitioner to the said process at any time before the filing of the

writ petition. Learned counsel therefore submitted that the respondents

have not acted hastily in the matter. It is also submitted by reference to the

proceedings Ext.R2(g) that if the tender is proceeded with as per Exts.P1

and P3, then there will be only one tenderer left out       and for enabling

competent tenders to be submitted, a retender notification was published.

My attention was invited to the various clauses in Ext.P1 relating to the

entire procedure. It is submitted that the Bid Evaluation Committee was

involved in the initial stages and as far as the Corporation is concerned,

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                      -17-</span>


being a Company and a legal entity, there is no harm in taking a decision by

the Board of Directors themselves who is the final authority, because

various aspects are there and the interest of the public is also involved in the

matter.   It is therefore submitted that there is no invalidity         in the

proceedings at all. At every stages the parties were called for meetings and

their objections were discussed and decisions were taken. It is submitted

that the decision had to be taken on a purely technical matter and therefore

discussions under various forums were required. It is submitted that as far

as the Board of Directors of the Corporation is concerned, only Government

officers alone constitute the forum and therefore it is not a case where any

private interest is involved to help any of the tenderers.

</p><p id="p_17">      17. It is further submitted that the answer given by the petitioner to

Ext.P8 notice by way of Ext.P9 will show that the petitioner is not having

the required permit for administration of the vaccine through IM route.

While publishing Ext.P3 it was never intended that the tender is confined to

ID route alone, and both the routes were inadvertently omitted in Ext.P3

notification. Apart from the same, it can be seen that the petitioner had

participated in all the deliberations throughout without any objections also.

Therefore, it is submitted that to avoid any delay in the matter and to have

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                      -18-</span>


the participation of the qualified tenderers, the notification was issued.

</p><p id="p_18">       18. Learned Standing Counsel appearing for the second respondent,

by referring to the averments in the counter affidavit also, submitted that if

the plea of the petitioner is accepted as stated in Ext.P9, there could have

been allegation of bias as IM route has not been excluded.

</p><p id="p_19">       19.  Before considering      the respective contentions,     the various

aspects will have to be considered in terms of the details reflected in the

documents as well as the pleadings. In Ext.P1 tender notification in Section

IV under item 9, the specification given is "Rabies Vaccine". The method

of administration is given as Im/Id ( Intra muscular/Intra dermal). The unit

given is 1 ml Vial. Ext.P3 was issued when along with other items "Duck

Embryo" was also included. In Ext.P3, the route of administration, viz.

Im/Id has been omitted and the unit alone is given as "1 ml Vial".

</p><p id="p_20">       20. A reading of Ext.P2 will show that the petitioner had requested

for modification of the tender specification. Therein, the change sought for

is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_21">W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                        -19-</span>


         ".............In view of this the description need to be changed as

         follows for more clarity:
</p>
<p id="p_22">         1) 0.5ml/IM/ID 2.5 1.U with 0.5ml diluent and syringe. (Both for

         IM/ID use)

</p><p id="p_23">         2) 1ml ID 2.5 1.D with 1ml diluent and multiple syringes (For ID

         use) (Normally 10 syringes)

         We therefore request you to kindly make the amendment and

         oblige."
</p>
<p id="p_24">Going by the same, the petitioner requested for change for showing IM/ID

use as well as for ID use with the unit 0.5 ml and 1 ml respectively. In

fact, the petitioner has pleaded in the writ petition that it is as per his

objection Ext.P2 as well as raising of similar issues by other bidders, Ext.P3

was issued by way of an amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_25">       21. Ext.P4 is the proceedings dated 26.3.2012 after the opening of

the price bid which is captioned as "Provisional Supplier-wise          Rates

Quoted Details for the Tender for Supply of Drugs Requiring Cold Storage

for the year 2012-2013". Apart from the tender in question is concerned,

there are tenders for supply of other drugs also. When we come to Rabies

Vaccine, the first bidder shown is Chiron Behring, Mumbai. Therein, in the

third column the item is described with the route of administration as

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                      -20-</span>


IM/ID and the approved rate is Rs.183.75. In the column wherein the

petitioner's details are furnished also, the route of administration is shown

as IM/ID along with the description of the vaccine and the approved rate is

Rs.133.43. Under the name of the third bidder, viz. Indian Immunologicals

Ltd., Hyderabad, along with the description of the vaccine, the route of

administration is given as IM/ID.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      22. Ext.P5 is the provisional notice by which the finalisation of the

bid was deferred and referred to the Board of Directors. In para 1 it is stated

that "the price bids of all the categories of tenderers referred above were

opened and evaluated on 23.6.2012 and the price quoted by the offerers

was published on the same day for verification vide notice 9th cited"

which is Ext.P4 herein. It is stated further that "the discrepancies noted

were rectified and complaints/representations received in response to the

notices were examined and the decision taken is published herewith as

Tables I and II respectively." Among the Drugs, Serial No.1 is Rabies

Vaccine. With regard to the nature of complaint/representation, it is stated

that "for the product Rabies Vaccine Human 1ml (Drug code D21021)

complaints have been received from all the bidders pointing out the defects

of others." The decision, noted in the right hand side column is that the

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                    -21-</span>


finalisation is deferred and referred to the decision of the Board of

Directors. There are decisions with respect to different items in Ext.P5

itself.
</p>
<p id="p_27">       23. Ext.P6 is the next document which is published on 10.4.2012.

The same is the Bid Ranking Status after negotiation with the tenderers and

as far as Rabbis vaccine is concerned, it is given as a foot note that "since

all the bidders have raised complaints against one another, further

processing and finalisation of the product Rabies Vaccine Human (Drug

Code-D21021) will be subject to the decision of the Board of Directors".

Again, the tenderers were called for a hearing on 16.4.2012 at 4 p.m. as per

Ext.P7 notice, to appear before the Sub Committee. Ext.P8 is the notice

dated 25.4.2012 whereby the petitioner was directed, based on the decision

of the Sub Committee meeting, to produce documentary proof (a letter or

certificate) issued by the DCGI that the Rabbis Vaccine offered by the

petitioner can be used for both IM and ID route of administration valid as

on the date of the tender. It was stated that any failure will result in

rejection of the tender also. The reply furnished by the petitioner as per

Ext.P9 will show that as far as IM use is concerned, the matter is under

active consideration by DCGI and hope to get it at the earliest.         The

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                      -22-</span>


petitioner has also taken the stand in Ext.P9 that in the light of the

amendment, removing of IM/ID, there cannot be any objection for the

tender submitted by the petitioner being accepted.       In Ext.P11 retender

notification now it is specified that the tender is invited for ID route of

administration.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      24. The main contention raised by the learned Senior Counsel for the

petitioner, Shri M.K. Damodaran is that Ext.P3 amendment clinches the

issue with regard to the route of administration, that it can only be the ID

route and therefore the whole process undertaken is illegal and arbitrary. It

is also contended that the decision making process is so tainted, to dub it

arbitrary. Therefore, the approach required is to find out whether the reason

now stated is an erroneous one and the petitioner is entitled to succeed on

the basis of Ext.P3 amended notification, in that it should be considered

only as suggested by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      25. First I will, therefore, consider whether the amendment is brought

only in terms of the suggestion made by the petitioner as contended already.

</p><p id="p_30">      26. While analysing the issue, the chronology of events as stated in

para 3 of the counter affidavit also requires consideration.       After the

invitation of tender on 10.1.2012, a pre tender meeting was held on

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                      -23-</span>


19.1.2012. Therein, M/s. Cadila Healthcare, another bidder requested for

inclusion of Duck Embryo derived vaccine also. It is explained in para 4 of

the counter affidavit that the suggestion/objections raised by the tenderers in

the pre bid meeting on 19.1.2012 as well as the suggestion/objection

received as per Ext.P2 submitted by the petitioner were thoroughly

examined and inputs were sought from the consultant of the Corporation

who is a retired State Drugs Controller.         It is pointed out that the

amendment was brought in as per his advise and the specified rabies vaccine

made from duck embryo was included in the notification, while the

specification of IM/ID was dispensed with.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      27. Therefore, there is no unanimity on the main argument raised by

the petitioner that it was based on the request of the petitioner alone the

amendment was brought out with a purpose to provide the ID route of

administration only.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      28. We will come to the next stage, i.e. after the technical bids were

opened on 8.2.2012. At that stage four bidders were there, viz.        Cadila

Healthcare Ltd., Chiron Behring, Indian Immunological Ltd.            and the

petitioner. As per the averments in para 4 of the counter affidavit, the

respondents received a complaint as per Ext.R2(a) submitted by Chiron

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                    -24-</span>


Behring wherein they objected to the vaccine made from duck embryo.

The contention therein is that the said vaccine is not suitable for ID route

of administration. It is averred in para 4 of the counter affidavit that the

Corporation therefore decided to require all the bidders to submit necessary

proof that their vaccine can be administered through both IM and ID

route. The unit for dosage by IM route is 1 ml/0.5 ml of vaccine per

injection and by ID route the dosage prescribed is only 0.1 ml per injection.

Ext.R2(b) is the notice issued to M/s. Cadila Healthcare Ltd. directing

production of documents to show that approval of their product for both IM

and ID route is there. They did not produce documents and thus was

excluded. Therefore, only three eligible bidders were there.

</p><p id="p_33">       29. The next stage is the opening of price bid on 26.3.2012. The

petitioner has produced as Ext.P4, the Provisional Supplier-wise Rates

Quoted Details after the opening of the price bid. One thing to be noticed

from Ext.P4 that against each of the tenderers, under drug code 'D21021'

the the drug name is shown as the following: "Rabies Vaccine Human (Cell

Culture) (Chick Embryo), Vero Human Deploid Cells) IM/ID with Diluent

2MLSyringe with needle (24G) and a file for opening the diluent." Both

IM/ID route have been specified therein. There is nothing to show that the

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                      -25-</span>


petitioner had objected to the incorporation of the drug name as above with

both routes of administration at that point of time.
</p>
<p id="p_34">       30. The second respondent has stated that after the price bid was

opened, all the three bidders raised objections which have been produced as

Exts.R2(c) to R2(e). Ext.R2(c) is the objection received from M/s. Chiron

Behring Ltd. which is dated 22.3.2012 and is seen received on 28.3.2012,

going by the endorsement. The objection raised is against the petitioner and

the operative portion shows that their contention is that the data submitted

by the petitioner should not qualify for manufacturing and marketing

criteria and therefore they should be disqualified. In Ext.R2(d) submitted

by M/s. Indian Immunologicals Ltd.          the objection raised is that the

petitioner does not qualify for     requirement of the Corporation, as the

requirement is Rabies Vaccine 1ml         for both IM and ID usage.        The

petitioner's objection is Ext.R2(e) which is with respect to M/s. Human

Biologicals Institute, a division of M/s. Indian Immunologicals Ltd. and it

was regarding the technical acceptability of the tender quoted by them.

</p><p id="p_35">       31. In fact, the receipt of objections are clearly referred to in Ext.P5

notice and a decision is taken that the finalisation is deferred and the

matter is referred to the Board of Directors. Para 1 of Ext.P5 notice shows

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                      -26-</span>


that the complaints/representations received were examined.          It is also

worthwhile to be noticed that Reference No. 9 in Ext.P5 is a notice dated

26.3.2012, which is the date of opening of the tender and it is stated in para

1 that "the price quoted by the offerers were published on the same day for

verification", by that notice.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      32.     Thus, all the parties         obtained opportunity to raise

objections/complaints against each other and their products. This aspect is

to be noticed in the light of the contention raised by the petitioner in ground

'C' of the writ petition that "the reason assigned for cancellation of the

tender that the tenderers have raised complaints against one another is only

an imaginary ground."     Since the respondents have produced Exts.R2(c) to

R2(e) which are the objections received, it cannot be said that an imaginary

ground has been found out, as a prelude to cancellation.

</p><p id="p_37">      33. Then we come to the next stage, i.e. consideration of the matter

by the Sub Committee in the meeting held on 16.4.2012. The procedure

adopted is by issuance of notice to all the three bidders to appear before the

Sub Committee with documents and Ext.P7 is the copy of the notice issued

to the petitioner. The notice clearly directed the petitioner to attend the

meeting or send a representative duly authorised, along with all supporting

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                    -27-</span>


documents and present its complaint before the Sub Committee. Similar

notices have been issued to others also as evident from para 5 of the

counter   affidavit.  The Sub Committee was chaired by the Principal

Secretary to the Government, Health and Family Welfare Department, the

Managing Director of the Corporation, State Drugs Controller and the Head

of the Department, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, all of whom are

members of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. It is averred in para

5 of the counter affidavit that the representatives of all the three eligible

bidders including the petitioner attended the hearing. It is clear from the

said para that the petitioner and M/s. Indian Immunologicals Ltd. did not

have any specific objection.     A specific objection was raised by M/s.

Chiron Behring that the rival manufacturers do not have product approval

for 1 ml for both IM/ID route of administration issued by the DCGI. It is

averred that a decision was taken to require all eligible bidders who had not

produced evidence to show authorisation given by DCGI for both IM/ID

route, to submit such documents. Significantly, it is averred that "all the

bidders agreed to do within two weeks time." A copy of the minutes has

been produced as Ext.R2(f).
</p>
<p id="p_38">      34. A reference to Ext.R2(f) will show that deliberations of the

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                                    -28-</span>


Committee have been recorded therein. In the last paragraph of Ext.R2(f) it

is recorded that "After hearing the views of the Board members, it was

decided that the vaccine should have authorisation issued by DCG(I) for

both IM and ID route of administration. Those who have not produced such

documents should produce authorisation issued by DCG(I) that the Rabies

Vaccine Human Iml with diluent is approved for both IM and ID route of

administration as on the date of the tender. All the firms have agreed to

furnish the same within 2 weeks," (Emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_39">      35.    The petitioner is also therefore a party to the said decision.

Ext.R2(f) is not under challenge in this writ petition. Therefore, the same

also will go to show that the requirement was for both IM and ID route of

administration for which supporting documents were sought from all the

tenderers, which were agreed to be furnished within two weeks.

</p><p id="p_40">      36. Ext.P8 is the notice issued to the petitioner thereafter. Reference

No.2 therein is the decision taken in the Sub Committee meeting held

on16.4.2012 ( minutes of which is Ext.R2(f). The notice opens with the

following sentence:
</p>
<p id="p_41">         "As decided in the meeting referred 2nd above, you are directed to

         submit documentary proof (a letter or certificate) issued by the

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                        -29-</span>


          DCG(I) (in original) that the Rabies Vaccine Human-Iml (Drug

          code D21021) offered by you vide ref. 1st cited can be used for

          both Intra Muscular (IM) and Intra Dermal (ID) route of

          administration valid as on the date of the tender."
</p>
<p id="p_42">It is further stated that if there is any failure to produce the same, the offer

will be rejected. Therefore, the said notice is clearly issued in the light of

Ext.R2(f) decision. True that the petitioner later on contended by Ext.P9

that the tender specification is not IM/ID, but Ext.P9 also makes it clear that

the petitioner has not obtained the certificate for use of the vaccine for IM

route. It is stated that the specific use of the vaccine for Iml IM use is

under active consideration by DCGI and they hope to get the same at the

earliest. From the files made available to the Court, it is seen that identical

notices have been issued to the other two bidders also.

</p><p id="p_43">       37. From the resume of the above facts, it can be seen that even at the

initial stage when the vaccine with specification "duck embryo" was

included by Ext.P3 , one of the tenderers, viz. M/s. Cadila Healthcare Ltd.

was asked to produce the documents to show both routes of administration.

When the specific question was raised after the price bid was opened also,

by Ext.R2(f), a decision was taken to demand the said documents from all

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                      -30-</span>


the tenderers. It is clear from the counter affidavit that all the tenderers

were issued similar notices like Exts.P7 and P8. Therefore, it is not a case

where the petitioner alone was asked to produce the documents issued by

DCGI. As far as the second respondent is concerned, they had a uniform

stand with regard to this aspect, viz. the required route of administration as

both IM and ID before and after the price bid was opened which is clear

from the pleadings in the counter affidavit and the documents discussed

above. The respondents have explained in the counter affidavit in para 6

that on    6.6.2012 the Committee chaired by the Managing Director,

examined the documents submitted by different bidders. The committee

included the Drugs Controller, the Additional Director of Health Services,

the   Head of the Department, College of Pharmaceutical Science, the

Additional Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Medical

College, Thiruvananthapuram and Store Officer of the Government Medical

Store, Directorate of Health Services, Thiruvananthapuram. It is stated that

they had specifically considered the entire aspects relating to the notice

inviting tenders, the specifications prescribed, the offers received and the

objections raised by the different bidders and they found that if the

specification in Ext.P3 was insisted upon, there will be only one eligible

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                      -31-</span>


tenderer who has produced approval for both IM and ID route of

administration. It is further averred that against them there is a specific

complaint by the petitioner quoting the literature that 1 ml cannot be used

for ID route. Therefore, the Sub Committee was of the view that the

appropriate course of action is to have Iml Rabies Vaccine for ID route of

administration    so that the manufacturers will submit qualified tenders.

They were of the view that there were certain ambiguities in the

specification of the product described in the tender which has led to the

confusion. They have approved a revised specification also and Ext.R2(g)

is the copy of the minutes of the Tender Committee. It is submitted that in

the light of the above, the petitioner can also submit tender, as the ID route

is specified in the fresh tender notification. It is pointed out that if the

specification in Ext.P3 is adopted, only the L3 bidder will qualify, which

will lead to procurement of the drug at a huge difference of cost as the

quoted rate of M/s. Chiron Behring is very high.
</p>
<p id="p_44">       38. A reference to Ext.R2(g) will show that various aspects have

been considered by the Committee in detail. It is explained in para 2 that

the route of administration was not mentioned and it was specified to

conform     with Indian Pharmacopoeia and accordingly           the amended

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                      -32-</span>


notification was issued. After narrating all the other details, reference has

been made to Ext.R2(f) decision of the Sub Committee and it is mentioned

that if the condition to produce authorisation from DCGI for both routes of

administration are insisted, then as per the available documents M/s. Chiron

Behring is the only qualified bidder. In para 5 mention is made about the

objection raised by the petitioner against M/s. Chiron Behring and it is

stated that it will require further verification and will be time consuming.

Accordingly, a decision was taken to call for a fresh tender.

</p><p id="p_45">       39. It is therefore evident that Ext.P10 cancellation is based on the

decision of the Sub Committee which was accepted by the Board of

Directors. Both will have to be read together.
</p>
<p id="p_46">       40. The petitioner's contention therefore that the description of the

product in Ext.P3 can only lead to one specification, i.e. ID route cannot

hold good. True that both IM and ID routes are not specified in Ext.P3. But

can it be conclusively said that the same is only one providing for ID route?

Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the unit prescribed

in Ext.P3 can only lead to one conclusion that it is for ID use alone. In fact,

even in Ext.P2 submitted by the petitioner also, the petitioner has not

sought for a description as ID route alone. Therein, both the routes were

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                     -33-</span>


specified by the petitioner. Item one description therein is for both IM and

ID route and item 2 is for ID route. As already noticed, in Ext.P4 which is

an uncontroverted document which was published after the price bid was

opened, the description given is for both IM and ID route. The respondents

have explained in the counter affidavit that the omission of IM and ID

specification was not because of any pre tender negotiation and the change

was introduced as per the advice of the Consultant.     The amendment in

Ext.P3 was only to introduce the words 'Duck Embryo'. The company

which quoted for the vaccine derived from 'duck embryo', was asked to

produce the documents to show that it can be administered both by IM and

ID route. The said notice which has already been referred to earlier, is prior

to the arising of the present controversy by the petitioner and that was

based on a decision taken after a complaint was received by Ext.R2(a).

Therefore, even after the price bid was opened, the very same method was

adopted in the light of the complaint Ext.R2(c) to R2(e).      All the three

tenders therefore were considered for the specification    IM and ID route.

Otherwise, the petitioner also would not have agreed, as evident from

Ext.R2(f), to furnish the documents with regard to authorisation by DCGI,

to show approval for both IM and ID route as on the date of the tender.

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                      -34-</span>


Therefore, it is not a case where the route of administration was shown

only as ID route as pleaded by the petitioner. At any rate, the same cannot

be safely concluded.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      41. The further question is whether the argument of the learned

Senior Counsel for the petitioner that the decision is tainted by arbitrariness

and malafides is correct. In fact, the procedure adopted by the respondents

have been explained in the counter affidavit.            At every stages, the

documents submitted by all the parties were         put to the notice of the

respective parties for raising their objections. This is clear from the starting

of the tender procedures itself. The question is whether the decision making

process is tainted or not.   Yet another objection raised by the petitioner is

reference of the matter to the Board of Directors for a decision. In fact, the

procedure to be adopted is well announced, going by the           conditions in

Ext.P1 from para 6.16 under the heading "Evaluation of Tender". Under

para 6.16.6, the list of eligible bidders and their accepted products/rejected

bidders as per the findings of the decisions of the Bid Evaluation

Committee/Inspection team will be published in the notice board and

website of the Tender Inviting Authority, inviting complaints/suggestions

from the bidders/public. These will have to be scrutinised as per para

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                       -35-</span>


6.16.7 by the Bid Evaluation Committee. Again, their findings along with

the provisional list of qualified bidders for price bid opening along with the

date of opening will have to be published in the notice board and website.

Para 6.16.8 provides for scrutiny of the price bids by the Bid Evaluation

Committee. After the completion of the said procedure, the next stage is

under 6.16.9 which requires publication of the provisional drug-wise rate

list of all the accepted products of the eligible bidders and the list of rejected

bidders in the notice board and website and complaints and suggestions

from the bidders/public will have to be invited. Under para 6.16.10 the

complaints/suggestions received will have to be scrutinised by the Bid

Evaluation Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_48">       42. The next question is whether the absence of any role by the

Board of Directors in Ext.P1 is crucial to invalidate the proceedings

Ext.P10. In Ext.P1, the specific processes to be adopted are by the Bid

Evaluation Committee and Tender Inviting Authority.            A provision for

appeal to the Government is also there.
</p>
<p id="p_49">       43. Herein, the explanation for reference of the matter to the Sub

Committee and the Board of Directors is that the matter required technical

evaluation and to study the materials produced by the bidders and the Board

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                       -36-</span>


of Directors is the final authority as far as the Corporation is concerned. All

the members of the Board of Directors are officials alone and their details

have been furnished in para 9 of the counter affidavit.            The second

respondent is a company registered under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_7">Companies Act</a> and there

cannot be any dispute that the Board of Directors is the final decision

making authority. It is also explained that the Managing Director's decision

will have to be placed before the Board of Directors for ratification and any

agreement executed by the Managing Director has to be legally enforceable

as against the Corporation.      Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner

submitted that the Bid Evaluation Committee           and the Tender Inviting

Committee cannot act as dictated by the Board of Directors. But herein, it

cannot be said that they were acting at the dictation of the Board of

Directors. The Sub Committee of the Board of Directors as per Ext.R2(f)

heard all the three bidders including the petitioner and thereafter only a

decision was taken therein that the bidders should be asked to produce

authorisation to show that they have approval from DCGI for both IM and

ID route of administration.       It cannot be said that the decision is so

arbitrary. The said aspect is a crucial one, which is clear even       from the

earliest point. Even before the price bid was opened, a notice was issued to

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                      -37-</span>


one of the bidders to show that their product is suitable for both routes of

administration. After the Sub Committee examined the matter, again all the

documents were scrutinised in a meeting of the Committee headed by the

Tender Inviting Authority as evident from Ext.R2(g). It is not a case where

a final decision reflected in Ext.P10 has been taken in isolation. The bid

documents of all the bidders were examined thoroughly by the Committee

which was placed before the Board of Directors and they approved the

matter. It cannot be said that the decisions are tainted by arbitrariness and

amounts to dictation by a superior authority.         As far as the second

respondent is concerned, acceptance of tender will be a so crucial decision,

as it involves huge public money and public interest is the criteria which has

to be considered in such cases.       Therefore, it cannot be said that the

decisions are tainted by arbitrariness or unreasonableness.

</p><p id="p_50">       44.  The petitioner points out that     interference of the Board of

Directors is deliberately with the malafide motive to help the existing

suppliers to continue their supply. They are not a party respondent in the

writ petition. All the three bidders have participated in the deliberations at

two stages. Therefore, it is not a case where a decision has been taken

without inviting objections from any of the parties including the petitioner

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                      -38-</span>


and behind their back. The petitioner had also utilised the opportunity at

different stages   by raising its objections against the       other tenderers.

Therefore, the question of violation of the principles of natural justice does

not arise here. It has come out from the pleadings of the respondents that

after the price bid was opened three objections were received which are

produced as Exts.R2(c) to R2(e). Subsequent proceedings were taken after

these objections were received and        at different stages the Committee

considered the matter and a hearing was also offered to the three bidders on

16.4.2012. All the three bidders were issued simultaneous notices like

Exts.P7 and P8 and only one bidder remained in the field who had

authorisation for both routes of administration, viz. M/s.Chiron Behring.

But their quoted price being Rs.183. 75, it was thought that fresh tender can

be invited. It cannot be said to be an arbitrary decision as otherwise it would

have caused huge expenditure for the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_51">      45. The petitioner's tender could not be accepted since they had not

obtained approval from DCGI for IM route and the matter was pending even

going by Ext.P9 reply. In fact, the second respondent has explained in para

10 of the counter affidavit that Ext.P3 amendment does not actually specify

IM or ID, but it does not specify IM route alone or ID route alone and

therefore the situation will be only for both. In the light of the discussion

made above, it can be seen that the stand of the respondents in this regard

is acceptable. It cannot solely depend upon the unit mentioned in Ext.P3, as

contended by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_52">      46. The next aspect to be considered is whether the principles stated

in various decisions relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the

petitioner, have been followed in the decision making process.

          by other articles like <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_11">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The said

          <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_12">Article 21</a> refers to "right to life". It includes "opportunity". In

          our view, as held in the latest judgment of the Constitution Bench

          of nine Judges in <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_13">Coelho v. State of        T.N</a>. (2007) 2 SCC 1),

          Articles 21/14 are the heart of the chapter on fundamental rights.

          They cover various aspects of life. "Level playing field" is an

          important concept while construing <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_14">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the

          Constitution. It is this doctrine which is invoked by REL/HDEC

          in the present case. When <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_15">Article 19(1)(g)</a> confers fundamental

          right to carry on business to a company, it is entitled to invoke the

          said doctrine of "level playing field". We may clarify that this

          doctrine is, however, subject to public interest. In the world of

          globalisation, competition is an important factor to be kept in

          kind.   The doctrine of "level playing field" is an important

          doctrine which is embodied in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_16">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the

          Constitution. This is because the said doctrine provides space

          within which equally placed competitors are allowed to bid so as

          to subserve the larger public interest. "Globalisation", in essence,

          is liberalisation of trade. Today India has dismantled licence raj.</blockquote><p id="p_60">

</p><p id="p_61">          The economic reforms introduced after 1992 have brought in the

          of "level playing field" embodied in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_17">Article 19(1)(g).</a> Time has

          principle of "equality" should not be read as a stand alone item

          but it should be read in conjunction with <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_19">Article 21</a> which

          embodies several aspects of life. There is one more aspect which

          needs to be mentioned in the matter of implementation of the

          aforestated doctrine of "level playing field". According to Lord

          Goldsmith, commitment to the "rule of law" is the heart of

          parliamentary democracy. One of the important element of the

          "rule of law" is legal certainty. <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_20">Article 14</a> applies to government

          policies and if the policy or act of the Government, even in

          contractual matters, fails to satisfy the test of "reasonableness',

          then such an act or decision would be unconstitutional."

Hence, a decision or act which results in unequal or discriminatory

treatment will violate the doctrine of 'level playing field'.

         an obligation to record reasons. But every administrative authority

         is not under any legal obligation to record reasons for its decision,

         although, it is always desirable to record reasons to avoid any

         suspicion. Where a statute requires an authority though acting

         administratively to record reasons, it is mandatory for the authority

         to pass speaking orders and in the absence of reasons the order

         would be rendered illegal. But in the absence of any statutory or

         administrative requirement to record reasons, the order of the

         administrative authority is not rendered illegal for absence of

<p id="p_66">       52. Shri M.K.Damodaran, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner

contended that on the factual position pleaded by the petitioner and in the

light of the principles stated by this Court and the Apex Court in the

decisions referred to earlier, the only one conclusion that is possible is that

the petitioner should be awarded the contract, being the L1 tenderer. It is

pointed out that a direction should be issued to the respondents to proceed

from the stage after the opening of the price bid from the stage of para

6.16.10 in Ext.P1 and finally accept the L1 tender.

<p id="p_67">       53.    Going by the principles stated by the Apex Court in

State action must be informed of reason and that an act uninformed by

reason is per se arbitrary, it cannot be said that the cancellation of the tender

by Ext.P10 and the fresh notification Ext.P11 is bad in law.                 The

respondents have explained as to why the retender notification was issued,

in that only the L3 tenderer has got the authorisation for both IM and ID

route of administration and they felt that if a fresh tender is invited all the

bidders can participate and a tender which conforms to the specifications of

ID route of administration can be accepted based on them. The said reason,

which is supported by the document produced, viz. Ext.R2(g), by no stretch

of imagination, can be said to be arbitrary or illegal. The decision therefore,

to cancel the tenders already invited, even though it is alleged by the

petitioner as unsupportable by reason, in the light of Exts.R2(f) and R2(g),

it can be seen that the said decision is well supported by reasons and has

been arrived at after following various procedures and after evaluating the

documents in the light of the objections raised by various parties. The files

have been produced for perusal by the learned Standing Counsel for the

second respondent. On a perusal of the records also, it can be seen that the

procedures have been completed in a proper and transparent manner and the

decision is not actuated by malafides as alleged by the petitioner. Going by

the judgment of the Division Bench in M/s. Zoom Developers Pvt. Ltd.'s

case (2008 (4) KHC 934), a decision like the one herein, supported by

reasons should be evident from the records also (para 101). The copies of

the documents produced by the respondents will show that cogent reasons

have been stated in support of the decision. It is not a case where by a

single line order the respondents have cancelled the tender notification to

characterise the same as one uninformed by any reason. Therefore, even

going by the application of the principles stated in para 101 of the above

decision, it can be seen that the decision herein is supported by cogent

reasons. The doctrine of level playing field is also not violated, as no

discriminatory treatment was meted out to the petitioner.

</p><p id="p_68">       54. At every stage, viz. at the stage prior to the opening of price bid

and thereafter also, discussions have been made and the parties have been

offered an opportunity to raise the objections and suggestions and the Sub

Committee heard the views of all the parties as evident from Ext.R2(f) and

as already mentioned. The Board of Directors is the final authority as far as

the Corporation is concerned and there is no harm in leaving the matter for

a proper decision to be taken to the wisdom of the Board of Directors also,

since the purchase of drugs as per the specifications required, is of great

importance to them and the drug herein is an important one as far as the

members of the public are also concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_69">       55. The petitioner can succeed if one conclusion alone is possible

on the facts pleaded. The said conclusion, going by the arguments of the

petitioner, is that Ext.P3 amendment requires the vaccine to be administered

only through ID route. Such a conclusion is not possible on the assessment

of facts and on a reference to the documents already discussed above. If

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                      -48-</span>


such was the case, then it was not necessary to issue notice to one of the

bidders, viz. M/s. Cadila Healthcare Ltd., to produce authorisation for both

routes of administration in respect of their vaccine with duck embryo.

</p><p id="p_70">        56. When the respondents have shown a proper reason in support of

their final decision, this Court will not be justified in upsetting the same for

issuing a direction to the respondents to accept the tender of the petitioner.

When the respondents required a vaccine to be administered through both

the routes and since the petitioner is not having authorisation in respect of

IM route, it cannot be said that the decision taken is tainted by arbitrariness

and malafides, only with the oblique motive of avoiding the acceptance of

the tender of the petitioner. The thorough verification of the documents of

all the bidders which was done by the respondents will only reveal that the

respondents have been acting bonafide and in a transparent manner.

</p><p id="p_71">        57. Even though it is vehemently contended by the learned Senior

Counsel for the petitioner that the doctrine under <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_25">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the

Constitution as regards level playing field will squarely apply to the facts

of this case, I cannot agree. The petitioner has been given all opportunities

to attend the hearing and to raise objections in respect of the other bidders

W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                      -49-</span>


and all the objections received from the respective bidders were considered

also. Therefore, the final decision is also supported by reasons. In the light

of the above, the said doctrine will not apply to the facts of this case.

</p><p id="p_72">       58. In a recent judgment of the Apex Court in <a href="/doc/187501619/" id="a_26">M/s. Michigan

Rubber (India) Ltd. v. State of Karnataka &amp; Others</a> (AIR 2012 SC

2915) with regard to the power of judicial review, the following principles

have been laid down in para 19:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                  "(a) The basic requirement of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Article 14</a> is fairness in

          action by the State; and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance

          is the heartbeat of fair play. These actions are amenable to the

          judicial review only to the extent that the State must act validly

          for a discernible reason and not whimsically for any ulterior

          purpose. If the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness, it

          would be legitimate to take into consideration the national

          priorities;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                  (b) fixation of a value of the tender is entirely within the

          purview of the executive and courts hardly have any role to play

          in this process except for striking down such action of the

          executive as is proved to be arbitrary or unreasonable. If the

          Government acts in conformity with certain healthy standards and

          norms such as awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in those

          circumstances, the interference by Courts is very limited;

</blockquote><p id="p_73">W.P.(C).No.21192/2012
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                      -50-</span>


</p><p id="p_74">                 (c) In the matter of formulating conditions of a tender

          document and awarding a contract, greater latitude is required to

          be conceded to the State authorities unless the action of tendering

          authority is found to be malicious and a misuse of its statutory

          powers, interference by Courts is not warranted;
</p>
<p id="p_75">                 (d) Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders

          have to be laid down to ensure that the contractor has the capacity

          and the resources to successfully execute the work; and

</p><p id="p_76">                 (e) If the State or its instrumentalities act reasonably, fairly

          and in public interest in awarding contract here again, interference

          by Courts is very restrictive since           no person can claim

          fundamental right to carry on business with the Government."

Thus, the well settled principle is that the power of judicial review can be

only on the ground of reasonableness and a decision is not amenable to

judicial review when it is supported by reasons and is not tainted by

arbitrariness. The said principles have been evolved in respect of actions

leading to award of contracts. The same will squarely apply herein.

</p><p id="p_77">        For all these reasons, the writ petition fails and the same is

dismissed. No costs.
