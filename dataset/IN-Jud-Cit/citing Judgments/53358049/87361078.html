                    defendant are not identical or deceptively similar.
                    6.2      It is asserted that while the plaintiff&#x27;s mark is &#x27;SONA&#x27;, the
                    defendant&#x27;s mark is &#x27;SONAE-EV&#x27;. The logo of the defendant is also

                     6.3      The learned counsel for the defendant further asserts that the two
                    marks are also not identical when compared as a whole. Placing reliance
                    on the judgment in <a href="/doc/94612663/" id="a_1">United Biotech Pvt. Ltd. v. Orchid Chemicals &amp;
                    Pharmaceuticals Ltd. &amp; Ors., ILR</a> (2012) V Delhi 325, he submits that
                    the resemblance of the mark is to be considered by the ear as well as the
                    eye; both phonetic and visual tests are to be applied. Applying the said
                    test, the two marks cannot be said to be similar.
</blockquote><p id="p_18">                    6.4      The defendant asserts that the products in which the plaintiff and
                    the defendant deal are also distinct- the plaintiff deals only in automobile
                    parts, accessories, and components, while the defendant deals in electric
                    two-wheelers and charging stations (EV). The learned counsel for the
                    defendant submits that as the goods of the plaintiff and the defendant are
                    not common and the consumers are also not similar, there is no likelihood
                    of any confusion or deception being caused by the use of the impugned
                    mark by the defendant.

                     6.5      The defendant submits that it does not use the plaintiff&#x27;s registered
                    trade mark &#x27;SONA&#x27; in any form and therefore, the conditions under
                    <a href="/doc/1206371/" id="a_2">Section 29(5)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (in short, &#x27;the Act&#x27;) are not
                    satisfied. In support, the learned counsel for the defendant has placed
                    reliance on the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/149398882/" id="a_3">Mankind Pharma Ltd. v.
                    Chandra Mani Tiwari &amp; Anr</a>., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 9678 as also of

                    Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd</a>. 2010 (7) Mh.L.J. 646.
                    6.6      The learned counsel for the defendant further submits that the
                    adoption of the mark by the defendant is also bona fide inasmuch as it is
                    a venture of the &#x27;Sonai&#x27; group of companies. The firm was named
                    &#x27;Sonai&#x27; on the name of the late grandmother of Mr. Satish Deshmukh,
                    who had set up M/s Sonai Constructions, Nanded, Maharashtra in the
                    year 1994. The learned counsel for the defendant asserts that it adopted
                    the trade name &#x27;SONAE EV&#x27; for its venture into the EV Sector; the
                    modification to the last alphabet of the word, that is, from &#x27;i&#x27; to &#x27;e&#x27; was
                    done as &#x27;SONAI&#x27; was already a registered mark under Class 12 under the
                    application no. 1601832 owned by one Mr. Sonu Kohli.

                    of this Court dated 02.06.2022. The said ad-interim injunction has
                    caused undue hardship to the defendant as the business of the defendant

                    while reiterating the submissions made in the plaint, further submits that
                    the claim of the plaintiff is not confined to the use of the corporate name
                    alone of the defendant, but also of the use of the mark &#x27;SONAE&#x27; as a
                    trade mark. He submits that therefore, the plaintiff bases its claim on
                    <a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_5">Section 29(2)(b)</a> of the Act as well. He further submits that the mere
                    addition the alphabet &#x27;e&#x27; cannot be sufficient to distinguish the mark of
                    the defendant.

                    with the plaintiff dealing in components of the same. In this regard, he

                    dealing in electric two-wheelers and charging stations (EV), it cannot be
                    said that there would be no deception/confusion caused by the use of a

                    the fact that the plaintiff has a revenue of Rs.1640 Crore, its registrations
                    of its trade marks in India and other countries, and other factors
                    mentioned hereinabove, it can be said that the plaintiff has been able to
                    make out a good prima facie case of established reputation in its mark
                    &#x27;SONA&#x27; for the components of automobiles: both EV as also non-EV.
                    This was, in fact, not even disputed by the learned counsel for the
                    defendant in his submissions. On the other hand, the defendant in its
                    application filed under Order XXXIX Rule 4 of the CPC asserts that it is
                    yet to enter the market and is in the process to launch its electric two-
                    wheelers, which is expected to hit the market in 2023.

                     8.7      Whether the two marks are different: As far as the difference in
                    the two marks &#x27;SONA&#x27; and &#x27;SONAE&#x27; is concerned, it is well-settled that
                    in deciding the question of similarity between the two marks, the marks
                    have to be considered as a whole. The dissection of the mark is generally
                    not permitted and can be applied only in exceptional cases. The test to be
                    applied is the overall impression created by the mark and not the
                    impression created by the meticulous comparison of the two marks
                    examined by a microscope to find differences.         &quot;The true test&quot;, as
                    observed by Sargant, J. &quot;is whether the totality of the proposed trade
                    mark is such that it is likely to cause mistake or deception, or confusion,
                    in the minds of persons accustomed to the existing trade mark.&quot; (Law of
                    Trade Marks and Passing off by P. Naryanan, 6th Edition, page 332,
                    referring to Egg Products Appln. (1922) 39 RPC 155).

                    Mark, (1943) 60 RPC 87, it has been held that &quot;the answer to the
                    question whether the sound of one work resembles too nearly the sound
                    of another so as to bring the former within the limits of <a href="/doc/1728872/" id="a_18">section 12</a> of the
                    Trade Marks Act, 1938, must nearly always depend on first impression,
                    for obviously a person who is familiar with both words will neither be
                    deceived nor confused. It is the person who only knows the one word, and
                    has perhaps an imperfect recollection of it, who is likely to be deceived
                    or confused. Little assistance, therefore, is to be obtained from a
                    meticulous comparison of the two words, letter by letter and syllable by
                    syllable, pronounced with the clarity to be expected from a teacher of
                    elocution.&quot;

                     8.9      It is also well-settled law that where one mark contains the whole
                    of the other or its essential features, it is a factor to be taken into
                    consideration. It should be considered whether the individuality of the
                    common part is lost or whether the common part stands out prominently.
                    8.10 Applying the above test to the facts of the present case, prima
                    facie, by the use of the alphabet &#x27;e&#x27;, the two marks cannot be said to have
                    been sufficiently differentiated or distinguished. The common and
                    essential feature of the two competing marks is &#x27;SONA&#x27;, the trade mark
                    of the plaintiff. In my prima facie opinion, the mere addition of alphabet
                    &#x27;e&#x27; to the said common part is not sufficient to hold that the two marks
                    would not lead to any deception or confusion in the minds of an unwary
                    consumer.
</p><p id="p_55">                    8.11 The learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the defendant
                    uses the mark &#x27;SONAE EV&#x27; as its trade mark and this should be sufficient
                    to distinguish the mark of the plaintiff and the defendant. In my prima
                    facie opinion, the use of the suffix &#x27;EV&#x27; and/or &#x27;Roar of Electric&#x27; can also
                    not be considered to be sufficient to distinguish the two marks. EV
                    merely denotes &#x27;Electric Vehicle&#x27; and therefore, the pre-dominant part of
                    the mark shall remain &#x27;SONA&#x27;. The same would be the position with the
                    suffix &#x27;Roar of Electric&#x27;, which would be perceived more as a &#x27;tag line&#x27;
                    rather than a separate trade mark.

                     in case of composite mark. Thus, a particular element of a composite
                    mark which enjoys greater prominence vis-a-vis other constituent
                    elements, may be termed as a &#x27;dominant mark&#x27;.&quot; It was further held that

                    upon the consideration of the constituent elements of a composite mark.
                    The said elements may be viewed as a preliminary step on the way to an
                    ultimate determination of probable customer reaction to the conflicting
                    composites as a whole. Thus, the principle of &#x27;anti-dissection&#x27; and
                    identification of &#x27;dominant mark&#x27; are not antithetical to one another and
                    if viewed in a holistic perspective, the said principles rather compliment

                    remains the &#x27;dominant mark&#x27; of both, the plaintiff as also the defendant.
                    The use of the alphabet &#x27;e&#x27; or the suffix &#x27;EV&#x27; and/or &#x27;Roar of Electric&#x27; by
                    the defendant at least prima facie do not appear to sufficiently distinguish
                    the two competing marks.

<p id="p_57">                    8.13 Submission on <a href="/doc/1206371/" id="a_20">Section 29(5)</a> of the Act: As far as the submission
                    of the learned counsel for the defendant that as the goods of the plaintiff
                    and the defendant are not similar, <a href="/doc/1206371/" id="a_21">Section 29(5)</a> of the Act would have no
                    application, the same ignores the fact that the defendant is also using the
                    impugned trade mark &#x27;SONAE&#x27; as not only the trade name or the name of
                    the defendant&#x27;s business concern but also as a trade mark. This is also
                    evident from the various documents that have been placed on record by
                    the plaintiff along with the plaint. In fact, the defendant has itself also
                    applied for registration of its trade mark, of course as a label mark with
                    the suffix &#x27;Roar of Electric&#x27;. The judgments in Mankind Pharma (supra)

                     and Raymond Ltd. (supra), therefore, also cannot come to the aid of the
                    defendant. Therefore, the case of the plaintiff would prima facie also
                    attract <a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_22">Section 29(2)(b)</a> as also <a href="/doc/1646788/" id="a_23">Section 29(3)</a> of the Act.
</p><p id="p_58">                    9.       In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has been
                    able to make out a good prima facie case in its favour for the grant of an
                    injunction.
</p><p id="p_59">                    9.1      As far as the balance of convenience is concerned, as noted
                    hereinabove, the defendant is yet to enter the market, while the plaintiff
                    has been established and has a worldwide presence. The balance of
                    convenience is therefore clearly in favour of the plaintiff and against the
                    defendant.
</p><p id="p_60">                    9.2      The plaintiff is also likely to suffer grave irreparable injury in case
                    the defendant is not restrained from use of mark &#x27;SONAE&#x27; or any further
                    deceptively similar mark to that of the plaintiff, as the use of such a mark
                    can lead to the dilution of the rights of the plaintiff in its mark. It can also
                    lead to an unwary consumer drawing a conclusion of trade association
                    between the plaintiff and the defendant.
</p><p id="p_61">                    9.3      I have also considered the submission of the learned counsel for
                    the defendant that this Court would lack the pecuniary jurisdiction to
                    entertain the present suit inasmuch as the plaintiff has failed to give any
                    basis for valuing its suit for the purpose of the valuation in excess of Rs.2
                    Crore (Rupees Two Crore only). In my opinion, the said submission has
                    no merit as it is for the plaintiff to value the suit for the purposes of
                    jurisdiction in terms of <a href="/doc/70622933/" id="a_24">Section 7(iv)(d)</a> of the Court-Fees Act, 1870.
