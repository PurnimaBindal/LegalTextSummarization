The plaintiff, ZIFI Pvt Ltd, claimed to be the proprietor of the ZIFI family of trademarks and used the mark in several countries, including India.
The defendant, DocSuggest Healthcare Services Pvt Ltd., adopted and used the mark ZIFFI and the domain name www.ziffi.com for their business of booking appointments for spas, doctors, and diagnostic centers.
The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's use of the deceptively similar mark was without permission, illegal, unfair, unjustified, and in bad faith.
The plaintiff claimed infringement of its registered trademark ZIFI and ZIFI family of trademarks and its domain name zificoin, as well as an action of passing off against the defendants for passing off their services, website, and business as that of the plaintiff.
The main issue was whether the goods of the plaintiff and the services of the defendants were allied and cognate, and whether the defendants' use of the mark ZIFFI infringed the plaintiff's registered trademark ZIFI and amounted to passing off.
The court granted an ad-interim injunction in favor of the plaintiff, stating that the plaintiff had built a strong reputation with its distinctive mark "Zifi" within the medicinal and pharmaceutical sector in India.
The court found that the goods of the plaintiff and the services of the defendants were similar and associated, and that the defendants' mark "Ziffi" was visually, phonetically, and otherwise similar to the plaintiff's mark "Zifi".
The court held that the defendants' use of the mark without due cause took unfair advantage of the plaintiff's registered trademark and amounted to passing off.
The court rejected the defendants' claim that they were prior users of the mark under Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, and held that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of passing off against the defendants.
The court applied Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which sets out what constitutes infringement of a registered trademark.
The court found that the defendants' use of the mark ZIFFI was without due cause and took unfair advantage of the plaintiff's registered trademark, and that the plaintiff had a strong reputation with its mark "Zifi" in the medicinal and pharmaceutical sector in India.
The court also considered the similarity of the two marks and the degree of similarity between them, and found that the marks were visually, phonetically, and otherwise similar.
The court rejected the defendants' claim that they were prior users of the mark under Section 34 of the Act, and held that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of passing off against the defendants.
The court granted an ad-interim injunction in favor of the plaintiff, directing the defendants to cease and desist from using the mark ZIFFI and the domain name www.ziffi.com in relation to their services and business, and to maintain the status quo until the first hearing before the court.
The case is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting registered trademarks and the potential for confusion and deception when similar marks are used in relation to similar goods and services.
The case also clarifies the factors to be considered for similarity in goods and services and the scope of Section 34 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.
