</blockquote><p id="p_3">3.     The said arrangement was continued between the appellants and
Volvo in pursuant to four agreements but in the meanwhile, by virtue of an
Asset Purchase Agreement dated June 16, 1987, Volvo sold and transferred
all its business and assets including all its patents, registered designs,
trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights including the
subject Trade Mark(s) to the respondent.          The respondent was earlier
also known as PREMIARAKTOREN 689 AKTIEBOLAG AND NYA
MORGARDSHAMMAR AKTIEBOLAG.
</p><p id="p_4">3.1    As per Clause 4 of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated
June 16, 1987, Volvo assigned all its trademarks, copyrights and other
intellectual property rights without any limitation to the respondent.
Necessary entry was made by the Trade Mark Registry also with

between Volvo and the respondent by way of order passed on 23rd
September, 2008 whereby the respondent was registered as subsequent
proprietor of the marks from 1st June, 1987.
</p><p id="p_5">3.2    The Asset Purchase Agreement also gave an option to the respondent

 exercised vide Share Purchase Agreement between Volvo and the
respondent/plaintiff dated December 22, 1993.         However, the appellant-
company refused to register the name of the respondent as shareholder of
40% shares acquired by the respondent from Volvo.
</p><p id="p_6">3.3    Consequently, Volvo filed a Petition No.40/111/95-CLB before the
Company Law Board seeking appropriate directions which was allowed vide
order dated June 16, 1998. In the said judgment in paragraphs 36 and 37, it
is observed by the CLB that the appellant knew about the sale of business by
Volvo to the respondent who was the respondent No.2 in the said
proceedings and the appellant was really concerned whether the agreements
executed with Volvo would continue or not and it is for this reason that they
were opposing the transfer of shares.
</p><p id="p_7">3.4    Paras 36 &amp; 37 of the order passed by the CLB read as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">               "36. Coming to the facts of the case, it is an admitted
               position that the petitioner-company has entered into
               certain contracts in 1987 and 1988 for the transfer of
               their business and also certain assets including the
               impugned shares to the second respondent-company.
               It is also clear from the records that these transfers
               were within the knowledge of the first respondent-
               company. The case of the first respondent-company
               is that it was under a misapprehension based on
               information furnished by the petitioner-company that
               the transfer is within the same group. Incidentally the
               original name of the petitioner-company, viz.; the
               Morgardshammar AB is assumed by the second
               respondent-company. We have to now proceed to
               analyze the facts on two presumptions, namely, (a)
               that the first respondent-company was really misled to
               believe that the transfer is within the same group and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">               (b) that the first respondent-company was fully aware
               that the transfers are outside the group. We have
               already dealt in detail with the various correspondence
               between the second respondent and the first

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                            Page 5 of 44</span>
                respondent to show that the first respondent-company
               was actually aware that the transfer is to another
               group. In fact the correspondence refers to the
               coming in of the Danieli group to India as a major
               shareholder of the first respondent company instead of
               the Volvo group which is the original shareholding
               group. In fact the Danieli group also expressed a
               desire to increase their percentage of holding in the
               first respondent company. It is further evident that
               there had been meetings between the executives of the
               first respondent and the second respondent companies.
               A careful study of the copies of correspondence from
               pages 35 to 51 of the counter reply shows clearly that
               the first respondent-company was aware that the
               shares have been transferred to the Danieli group.
               The crucial letters in January and February, 1993,
               indicate the real issue which appears to be the
               controlling interest in the first respondent-company
               and the threat of the Danieli group to choose another
               alternative by starting a Danieli company. Thereafter
               a Danieli company has come to be established. This
               appears to be the rub when the first respondent-
               company started adopting a hostile attitude. As such
               the objections are unrelated to the transfer of shares.
               In the circumstances it is difficult for us to accept that
               the first respondent-company was not aware that the
               transfer is to a different group.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">               37. Even the contention that the transfer is outside
               the Volvo group and hence cannot be allowed was
               also considered by us. If the transfer from an existing
               group to another group is not to be allowed such a
               provision should be contained in the articles of
               association of the company. The first respondent-
               company being a public company, its articles do not
               contain any restrictive clause with regard to the
               transfer of the shares even though it does incorporate
               some of the covenants of the shareholders agreement
               with regard to the composition of the board, use of
               brand name, etc. We are in agreement with Dada that
               so long as there is no restrictive stipulation in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                               Page 6 of 44</span>
                articles of association, the board of directors of the
               company cannot enforce the contents of a private
               agreement between two shareholders. On this the
               case law is unambiguous and, therefore, the petition
               has to be granted. Even the restrictive stipulation
               contained in the shareholders‟ agreement does not bar
               a transfer of the shares but only prescribes two
               conditions; namely, that (a) before transferring to any
               other persons, the shares shall be offered to the other
               party to the agreement; (b) it is the burden of a
               transferring party to ensure that the transferee is
               bound by the shareholders‟ agreement. The petitioners
               have complied with the first part by offering the
               shares to the other party to the agreement which,
               however, has not been accepted. As regards the
               second stipulation, it is for the other party to enforce
               the provisions of the shareholders‟ agreement through
               appropriate proceedings. The company, however, has
               no prerogative to stop or stall the transfer on this score
               since it is not a party to the agreement."

It was specifically mentioned therein that from 16 th June, 1987 the Assignor

Trade Mark bearing registration No. 393277 and the goodwill attached to the
said Trade Mark), and technology related to the activities necessary to run
the Assignor‟s business for a consideration as defined under the APA. It
was stipulated that in accordance with mutual consent and pursuant to the
APA dated 16th June, 1987, Assignor has assigned the trade mark "MH
MORGARDSHAMMAR" (Indian Registration no. 393277) to the Assignee
for USD 10 (Ten dollars only).

Purchase Agreement filed an application for registering the said assignment
in the prescribed manner on TM-24 dated 20th June, 2006 in the Trademarks
Office. Separate deed of assignment dated 13th August, 2008 was executed
by Volvo in order to get the assignment registered as per rules in favour of
the respondent which was ultimately accepted. Order thereon was passed on
23rd September, 2008 whereby the respondent was registered as a subsequent

the Deed of Assignment dated 13th August, 2008.

been recorded as the proprietor and owner of the said trade mark with effect
from 1st July, 1987 by the Trade Mark Authorities without any restriction.

person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of
permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or
deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to goods or services in
respect of which the trade mark is registered and in such manner as to render
the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark.

name, of his business concern dealing in goods or services in respect of
which the trade mark is registered.

               Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a>, reported in AIR 1965 SC 980,
               the Supreme Court held that an action for infringement is a
               statutory remedy conferred on the proprietor of a registered
               trademark for the vindication of its exclusive right to the use of
               that trademark in relation to its goods. It was further held that

               infringe the plaintiff's mark is shown to be in the course of
               trade, the question whether there has been an infringement is to
               be decided by comparison of the two marks. Where the two

               Laboratories Pvt. Ltd</a>., reported in AIR 1986 SC 137, the
               Supreme Court observed that when a person gets his trademark
               registered, he acquires valuable rights by reason of such
               registration. It was observed that registration of a trademark
               gives him the exclusive right to the use of that trademark in
               connection with goods in respect of which it is registered, and if
               there is any invasion of this right by any other person using the
               mark, which is the same or deceptively similar to his trademark,
               he can protect his trademark by an action for infringement in
               which he can obtain an injunction, damages or an account of
               profits made by the other person. In such an action, the
               registration of the trademark is prima facie evidence of its

that there is no privity of contract between the appellants and the respondent,
therefore, the appellants are entitled to use the trade mark and trade name as
Volvo has not terminated the Trade Mark User Agreement which was
entered between them.
</p><p id="p_34">26.    It is well settled law that once the licence is revoked, any use by the
licensee of the trademarks and trade name would amount to infringement of
the trade mark and the rights of the proprietor and on revocation, the
licensee is restrained from using the trade mark and trade name belonging to
the proprietor. We refer the following decisions on this aspect:-

           defendant No.18 to use the trade mark "Fedders" for a period of
           five years, by virtue of the agreement dated 11th October, 1963. It
           was held that after this period came to an end in the year 1968,
           use of trade mark "Fedders" by defendant No.18 from 1968
           onwards was not in line with the rights available to the plaintiff as

           Industries B.V. &amp; Anr. vs. Velcro India Ltd., reported in 1993(1)
           Arb.LR 465, the facts involved were, more or less, similar to the
           present case. In the said case, Velcro Industries (plaintiff) had
           entered into collaboration agreement with the Indian Directors and
           pursuant thereof Velcro India Ltd. (Defendant) came in existence.
           Defendant was granted trademark license vide a License
           Agreement which was renewed and subsequently, defendant was
           permitted to use the word "Velcro" as part of its trade name.
           Renewed agreement also expired on 30th September, 1986,
           thereafter plaintiff called upon defendant to stop using the mark of
           the plaintiff which was not complied with. Accordingly, plaintiff
           approached the Bombay High Court wherein defendant was
           restrained from using the mark "Velcro" as their trade name in
           India. It was held that after the license expired, defendants had no
           right to use the same as that of their corporate name/trade name.

"MORGARDSHAMMAR" in question and the appellants are using the
identical trade mark as well as part of its trade name in respect of the same
goods as well as in its corporate name.          It is obvious that a case of
infringement of trade mark is made out by the respondent in case the
agreement is validly terminated. And after the termination of the Trade

 Mark Agreement, as per settled law, the appellants by no means can be
considered as permitted user. It is also not the case of the appellants that
they are holding the registration of the trade mark in question. They were,
after termination, using the identical trade mark and trade name, under those
circumstances, any such use by them if not permitted, under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_15">Section 29</a> of
the Act would likely to cause confusion to the public or which is likely to
have an association with the registered proprietor.
</blockquote><p id="p_35">28.    It is not denied by the appellants that admittedly, Volvo had not
assigned the trade mark and the corporate name to appellants. Volvo kept
the proprietary rights with them when four agreements were entered between
the appellants and Volvo with regard to the trade mark/logo. Appellants
were merely a permissive user. Volvo had sold all its patent, registered
design, trade mark/copyright and other intellectual property rights including
the one specified in Appendix 3 attached with APA to the respondent.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_86">       a) That in terms of the four agreements i.e. the Collaboration
           Agreement, Share Holders Agreements, Trade Mark License and
           Name License Agreement executed between the appellants and
           Volvo, intent was of subsisting rights to use the trademarks
           without any limit of time and in perpetuity. By virtue of Asset
           Purchase Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement executed
           between Volvo and the respondent, the respondent did not become
           the successor of Volvo as respondent/plaintiff did not step into the
           shoes of the original licensor and was a total stranger to the four
           agreements executed in their favour by Volvo.

<blockquote id="blockquote_87">        b) There is no privity of contract between the respondent and the
           appellants and the respondent had no right to notice calling upon
           the appellants to cease and desist the use of the trademarks/trade
           name in question or to institute the suit, nor the respondent had any
           right to terminate the licences granted to the appellant. It could
           have been terminated only by the Volvo as the Volvo‟s share
           holding to have reduced below 25% and the right to cancel could
           have been exercised by Volvo who did not exercise the right to
           terminate when its shareholding was reduced to below 25% in the
           appellant on 22.12.1993 upon sale of its 80,000 shares in the
           appellant-company. Thus, the right to terminate the agreements is
           waived and abandoned for all times. The appellants are entitled to
           use the trademarks and trade name perpetuity.

           the respondent as shareholder in the appellant-company and
           delivery of share certificate to the respondent pursuant to purchase
           of 40% shareholding from Volvo vide a separate Share Purhcase
           Agreement dated 22.12.1993 and not to transfer of rights and
           obligations of Volvo under two agreements of the respondent. The
           respondent cannot take the advantage of the order passed by the
           Company Law Board.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_89">       d) That the Board Resolution approving the transfer of shares in terms
           of the order of Company Law Board was not and cannot be
           construed as consent on the part of the appellants for the
           assignment of the rights of Volvo.

           respondent were aware that Volvo is prohibited under the

            Collaboration Agreement and Shareholders Agreement from
           assigning any rights when they executed the Asset Purchase
           Agreement. In Clause 8 of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the
           existence of the licenses is mentioned. The learned Single Judge in
           the impugned judgment and decree dated 2nd January, 2012
           wrongly held that the respondent had the right on its 40%
           shareholding    in   the     appellant-company      and    by    reducing
           shareholding below 25% by the appellant-company, the respondent
           then had a valid right to cancel the License Agreement.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_91">       f) That the respondent acquiesced in the appellants‟ use of the
           trademarks for a period of more than 21 years if the arguments of
           the respondent with the assignment of trade mark in their favour
           w.e.f. 1st July, 1987 by virtue of alleged deed of assignment dated
           13th August, 2008 which confirms the Asset Purchase Agreement
           dated 16th June, 1987 which was to be effective from 1st July, 1987
           are accepted. The respondent was debarred from objecting to the
           use of trademarks and trade name by the appellant No.1 as they
           failed to take any action for such a long period.
</blockquote><p id="p_37">30.    Mr. Sawhney has not denied the fact that the right to cancel the
appellants‟ right to use the trade mark and trade name were permissible only
on occurrence of the specific eventualities stated in the Collaboration
Agreement       (Clause   18.4),      the   Trade   Mark    License        Agreement
(Clause 15) and Name License Agreement (Clause 8.1). He also admitted
that the shareholding of the Volvo was reduced below 25% and when the
said eventuality was happened and by that time, the respondent already
entered the Asset Purchase Agreement dated 16th June, 1987 as well as the
Share Purchase Agreement dated 22nd December, 1993 with Volvo which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                               Page 34 of 44</span>
 includes the trade mark and trade name in dispute. It is also not denied by
the appellants that the respondent has become the subsequent proprietor of
the trade mark by virtue of these Assignments and Trade Mark Agreement
dated 13th August, 2008 by Volvo. The respondent (herein) was also arrayed
as respondent No.2 in the proceedings pending before the CLB who allowed
the petition No.40/111/95 filed by Volvo on 16 th June, 1998. In para-36 of
the said order, it is specifically referred that the Volvo has entered into
certain contract in the years 1987 &amp; 1988 for transfer of their business and
also certain assets including the impugned shares to the second respondent-
company and it was clear from the records that these transfers were within
the knowledge of the appellants herein.
</p><p id="p_38">       After having come to know about the transaction between the Volvo
and respondent, the appellants did not challenge the said order in higher
Fourm/Courts instead the appellant accepted the respondent as successor-in-
interest of Volvo which is evident from the Board Resolution dated 31 st July,
1998. No protest or rectification of the Trade Mark which was assigned to
the respondent was filed for removing the entry from the Trade Marks
office. No challenge was also made about the assignment of the trade mark
by the Volvo in favour of the respondent.
</p><p id="p_39">31.    In a way, the ownership of the trade mark being subsequent proprietor
was not disputed by the appellants by taking action in any manner. Even, no
counter claim in the written statement or a separate suit was filed by the
appellants against the respondent. Therefore, the submission of the
appellants that by execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Share
Purchase Agreement and Assignment Deed executed between the Volvo and
respondent, they have not become the successor of Volvo, is without any
substance. The conduct of the appellants itself shows that the respondent


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                           Page 35 of 44</span>
 was not a stranger to the proceedings. It is incorrect to argue that the
respondent had no right to issue a notice calling upon the appellants to cease
and desist from using of the trade mark or trade name or to institute the suit
by terminating the licence granted by the Volvo, as in their Board Meeting
dated 21st July, 1998 it was recorded by them that the respondent shall be
bound by all the agreements and restrictions as applicable to Volvo being its
successor-in-interest.
</p><p id="p_40">32.    The appellants have not denied the fact that when the shareholding of
Volvo which had become the property of the respondent were reduced below
25%, the respondent could not have exercised its right which is specifically
stipulated in the Collaboration Agreement (Clause 18.4), the Trade Mark
License Agreement (Clause 15) and Name License Agreement (Clause 8.1).
</p><p id="p_41">33.    The submission of Mr.Sawhney is that the Collaboration Agreement,
Shareholding Agreement and Trade Mark License Agreement have to be
read together and therefore, rights under the said Agreements cannot be
assigned without the consent of the appellants. These contentions were not
pleaded in the written statement filed by the appellants in the suit and also in
affidavit by way of evidence of the appellant of Mr.Brijeshwar Garg.
Therefore, the arguments are beyond pleadings and evidence (<a href="/doc/190957/" id="a_16">Refer Kalyan
Singh Chouhan vs. C.P.Joshi</a>, AIR 2011 SC 1127, paragraphs 15 to 20 and
</p><p id="p_42">24). Further, the appellants themselves had recorded, represented and
accepted that the respondent was the successor-in-interest and is bound by
the agreement between Volvo and the appellant-company and cannot resile
from that position or contend to the contrary after having taken benefit of the
same. Even, subsequent conduct of the appellants demolishes the arguments
of the appellants.

<p id="p_43"> 34.    The next submission of Mr.Sawhney is that even after the assignment
it could continue the use of the trademark(s) and trade name independently
of the permissive user from the respondent or that only Volvo could have
terminated this agreement after assignment, is untenable in law. It is also
settled law as has been laid down by this Court in the decision of <a href="/doc/152682715/" id="a_17">Sun
Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited vs. Cipla Limited</a>, 2009 (39) PTC 347
(Delhi) that upon assignment the assignee becomes the owner of the trade
mark and can sue even for infringement even before the mark is registered
by the Trade Mark Registry in his favour as a subsequent proprietor.
</p><p id="p_44">35.    It is contended that in view of Clause 15 of the Shareholders
Agreement which provides "this Agreement and all rights and obligations
hereunder are personal as to the parties hereto and none of the parties hereto
shall assign or attempt to assign any such rights or obligations without first
obtaining written consent of all the other parties", the rights and obligations
flowing from the said agreement, being personal to the parties to the
agreement, could not have been assigned by the Volvo in favour of the
plaintiff without the consent of defendant No.1.          Reliance has been
placed on Khardah Co. Ltd. Vs. Raymon &amp; Co. (India) (P) Ltd., AIR 1962
SC 1810.
</p><p id="p_45">36.    The Appendix 7 and 7/10 of the Asset Purchase Agreement have been
explained by the witness of the respondent in his affidavit by way of
evidence. The said testimony of PW-1 is not rebutted in the affidavit by way
of evidence of Mr.Brajeshwar Dayal Garg made on behalf of the appellants-
company.       The agreement referred to therein was the Collaboration
Agreement and not the Trade Mark License Agreement. The appendix
refers to a period of 5 years has a term and also for payment of royalty
which were provisions of Collaboration Agreement and not the Trade Mark


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                           Page 37 of 44</span>
 License Agreement. The Trade Mark License Agreement did not provide
any condition for any permission of the appellants.
</p><p id="p_46">37.    By direct evidence, it has come on record that the respondent is
successor-in-interest of Volvo after acquiring assets including trademarks by
virtue of APA and subsequently by purchasing 40% shareholding of Volvo
in the appellant No.1 which, in fact, has been acknowledged by the appellant
No.1 who has also accepted in categorical terms in its Board Resolutions.
A specific finding in this regard has been returned by the CLB and which
finding has not been assailed by the appellant No.1 in any higher forum, who
has apparently accepted by registering the transfer of shares in the name of
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_47">38.    Appellant No.1 was offered to buy 40% shareholding of Volvo, which
offer was declined by it and which fact has been mentioned in the judgment
of CLB. Even after coming to know about the transactions between Volvo
and the respondent, appellant No.1 did not challenge the same in any Court,
rather accepted the respondent as successor in interest of Volvo, which is
evident from the Board Resolution dated 31st July, 1998 of appellant-
company. It has been specifically mentioned in the Board Resolution that
"Morgardshammar AB" (respondent) being the successor-in-interest of
"Centro Morgardshammar AB" (Volvo) shall be bound by all those
agreements, restrictions as applicable to "Centro Morgardshammar AB".
The appellants now cannot be allowed to take a different stand that the
respondent is not the successor-in-interest of Volvo or it has not stepped into
the shoes of Volvo.
</p><p id="p_48">39.    Volvo being the proprietor/owner of the trademarks under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_18">Trade
Marks Act</a> could have transferred or assigned its rights where no consent of
appellant No.1 was required, as there was no such stipulation in the TMLA


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                           Page 38 of 44</span>
 that prior consent of the appellant No.1, who was a permissive user, was
required. Judgments relied upon by the defendant No. 1 are in the context of
different facts and are not applicable to the facts of the present case which
have already been distinguished by the learned Single Judge and we agreed
for the reasons given by him in para-40 of the judgment.
</p><p id="p_49">40.    It is evident from the facts and circumstances of the present case that
after becoming the subsequent proprietor of the trade mark, the respondent
still permitted the appellants to continue to use trademarks in terms of
TMLA since it had stepped in the shoes of Volvo, inasmuch as in the TMLA
itself it was mentioned that appellant No.1 had unfettered right to use the
trade mark only, till its termination on the conditions as stipulated in clause
15 of the TMLA, Collaboration Agreement (Clause 18.4) and Name License
Agreement (Clause 8.1). Appellant No.1 had admittedly reduced the
shareholding of the respondent, who had succeeded Volvo, to less than 25%,
thus respondent became legally entitled to terminate the licence, in terms of
TMLA, which it did by issuing a notice immediately on becoming aware of
the fact that its shareholding has been reduced to less than 25%. After the
licence was terminated by the respondent being proprietor of the trade mark
"MH MOGARDSHAMMAR", appellant No.1 has no right to continue to
use the same and such use tantamount to infringement of the trade mark of
the respondent.
</p><p id="p_50">41.    Lastly, it was argued by Mr.Sawhney that the respondent is guilty of
acquiescence and latches, therefore, no relief of injunction could be issued.
His contention is that the cause of action has arisen in the year 1993 when
Volvo transferred their share to the respondent. The said submission of
Mr.Sawhney is totally without any substance. Actually, the cause of action
in the present case arose when the respondent came to know about the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                           Page 39 of 44</span>
 appellants‟ reducing the shareholding of the respondent from 14% to 8% and
legal notice dated 15th March, 2010 was issued to the appellants. The suit
was filed in the end of April, 2010. Though admittedly, 7,50,000 shares of
appellant No.1-company were allotted to appellant No.2. Thus, the
respondent, under no circumstances, could have filed the suit earlier as the
respondent in view of the conditional clause did not do so. It appears from
the statements made by the respondent in the plaint that they came to know
during the month of November, 2009 about the allotment of 7,50,000 shares
to appellant No.2 and immediately, the notice was issued. There is hardly
any acquiescence and latches on the part of the respondent, therefore, the
arguments of Mr.Sawhney have no application in the eye of law.
</p><p id="p_51">42.      The present case is not a case where the principles of acquiescence
and latches can be applied. These are only applicable in the cases where
there is a fair play, equity and good conscience. Here, the appellants have
been using the trademarks and trade name with the implied consent and
without the permission of the owners. The doctrine of estoppel could only
be relied upon by the party to promote fair dealings.
</p><p id="p_52">43.    In so far as the acquiescence is concerned, the observations of the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_19">M/s. Power Control Appliances v. Sumeet Machines Pvt.
Ltd</a>., reported in (1994) 2 SCC 448, in paras 26 and 27 are noteworthy. They
read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_92">               "26. Acquiescence is sitting by, when another is
               invading the rights and spending money on it. It is a
               course of conduct inconsistent with the claim for
               exclusive rights in a trade mark, trade name etc. It
               implies positive acts; not merely silence or inaction
               such as is involved in laches. In Harcourt v. White
               Sr. John Romilly said: "It is important to distinguish
               mere negligence and acquiescence." Therefore,
               acquiescence is one facet of delay. If the plaintiff

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">RFA (OS) No.4/2012                                            Page 40 of 44</span>
                stood by knowingly and let the defendants build up an
               important trade until it had become necessary to crush
               it, then the plaintiffs would be stopped by their
               acquiescence. If the acquiescence in the infringement
               amounts to consent, it will be a complete defense as
               was laid down in Monsoon (JG) &amp; Co. v. Boehm, the
               acquiescence must be such as to lead to the inference
               of a licence sufficient to create a new right in the
               defendant as was laid down in Rodgers v. Nowill.</blockquote>

<p id="p_53">         The law of acquiescence is stated by Cotton, LJ in Pro tor vs. Bannis
as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_93">               "It is necessary that the person who alleges this lying
               by should have been acting in ignorance of the title of
               the other man, and that the other man should have
               known that ignorance and not mentioned his own
               title."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_94">         In the same case Bown, LJ said:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_95">               "In order to make out such acquiescence it is
               necessary to establish that the plaintiff stood by and
               knowingly allowed the defendants to proceed and to
               expend money in ignorance of the fact that he had
               rights and means to assert such rights."

               consistent in holding that if the defendant acts
               fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating
               the plaintiff s rights then in that case, even if there is
               an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in
               taking action against the defendant, the relief of
               injunction is not denied. The defense of laces or

                inordinate delay is a defense in equity. Inequity both
               the parties mud's come to the Court with clean hands.
               An equitable defense can be put up by a party who has
               acted fairly and honestly. A person who is guilty of
               violating the law or infringing or usurping somebody
               else's right cannot clarify the continued misuse of the
               usurped right. It was observed by Romer, J. in the
               matter of an application brought be J. R. Parkington
               and Co. Ld., (1946) 63 RPC 171 at page 181 that "in
               my judgment, the circumstances which attend the
               adoption of a trade mark in the first instance are of
               considerable importance when one comes to consider
               whether the use of that mark has or has not been a
               honest user. If the user in its inception was tainted it
               would be difficult in most cases to purify it
               subsequently". It was further noted by the learned
               Judge in that case that he could not regard the
               discreditable origin of the user as cleansed by the
               subsequent history. In other words, the equitable relief
               will be afforded only to that party who is not guilty of
               a fraud and whose conduct shows that, there had been,
               on his part, an honest concurrent user of the mark in
               question. If a party, for no apparent or a valid reason,
               adopts, with or without modifications, a mark
               belonging to another, whether registered or not, it will
               be difficult for that party to avoid an order of
               injunction because the Court may rightly assume that
               such adoption of the mark by the party was noting
               honest one. The Court would be justified in
               concluding that the defendant, in such an action,
               wanted to cash in on the plaintiffs name and
               reputation and that was the sole, primary or the real
               motive of the defendant adopting such a mark. Even
               if, in such a case, there may be an inordinate delay on
               the part of the plaintiff in bringing a suit for
               injunction, the application of the plaintiff for an
               interim injunction cannot be dismissed on the ground
               that the defendant has been using the mark for a
               number of years. Dealing with this aspect Harry D.

               aground for refusing an injunction in certain
               circumstances. In the present case, we are dealing
