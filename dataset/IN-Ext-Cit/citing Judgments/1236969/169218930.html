S.RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
</pre><p id="p_1">1.      This is an appeal against the judgment dated 05.09.2012 of a Learned
Single Judge of this Court, whereby CS(OS) No. 812/1997 (hereafter "the
suit") filed by Exide India/ the first plaintiff (hereafter called "the plaintiff"
or "Exide India") against the Appellants, - (hereafter referred to as "the
defendant" or "Exide US"), was decreed and Exide US‟s counterclaim was
dismissed. The impugned judgment held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">     a) Exide India is the registered proprietor of the trademark „EXIDE‟;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      b) Exide India is also the prior user of the trademark in India and,
        therefore, owner of the trademark „EXIDE‟ in India inasmuch as
        Exide US failed to plead and prove existence of special
        circumstances.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">     c) Exide US- the first two defendants were injuncted from selling their
        goods using their trade name with the trademark „EXIDE‟ of Exide
        India or any other name/mark deceptively similar thereto.
</blockquote><p id="p_2">2.      The brief facts of the case are that the first defendant, Exide
Technologies (earlier known as Exide Corporation USA), claims to be one
of the largest manufacturers of automotive batteries in the world and the
global owner of the mark EXIDE in at least 130 countries. The second
defendant is incorporated under Indian laws and the subsidiary of the said
first defendant/Exide US. The plaintiff, Exide India is an Indian company
and claims to be the owner of the mark „EXIDE‟ in India on the bases that it
is the registered owner of the trademark and that it is the prior user of the
mark in India. Accordingly, when Exide US sought to use the mark/name
„EXIDE‟ with respect to its products, the plaintiff, Exide India instituted the
suit for permanent injunction against the defendants from using the mark
„EXIDE‟ in any manner whatsoever. This culminated in the impugned
judgment. Plaintiff Nos. 2 to 9 are pro-forma parties in the present appeal
and no relief has been sought against them.

</p>
<p id="p_4">Plaint

</p><p id="p_5">3.      The plaintiff/Exide India claimed that it is engaged in the business of
manufacturing and selling high quality automotive batteries under the brand




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 2
 name „EXIDE‟ and its variants in India. It avers that its predecessors had
been carrying on that business under this brand since 1920, when Chloride
Eastern Storage Co. (UK) (hereafter referred to as "CESCO") - its
predecessor-in-interest - set up trading operations in India. Exide
India/plaintiff claims to be well known all over the country as the source of
technically higher and superior quality batteries bearing the trade- mark
„EXIDE‟.
</p><p id="p_6">4.     Exide India/plaintiff avers that the first Chloride factory was set up at
Shyamnagar, West Bengal in 1946 by CESCO. In 1947, the British
operations of CESCO were sold to Chloride Group plc and two Indian
companies were formed: Associated Battery Markers (Eastern) Ltd.
(hereafter referred to as "ABMEL") and Chloride and Exide Batteries
(Eastern) Ltd. (hereafter referred to as "CEBEL"). In 1972, ABMEL‟s name
was changed to Chloride India Ltd. In 1988, Chloride India Ltd. was
renamed as Chloride Industries Ltd. It is further stated in the plaint that
Chloride Industries Ltd. was part of the Chloride Group Plc (UK) till 1987
when Chloride Eastern Industries Ltd ("CEIL") was formed in Singapore,
incorporating business of Chloride Group plc in Singapore, Malaysia, Sri
Lanka and India. The subsidiaries of Chloride Group plc in these countries
then allegedly came under CEIL (Singapore).
</p><p id="p_7">5.     Exide India/plaintiff claims that by a „Deed of Assignment for Sale
and Purchase of Shares‟ dated 03.01.1991, Chloride Group plc (UK) sold its
shares in Chloride Eastern Industries Ltd. to Tech Trade (Singapore) plc. A
Technical and Marketing Agreement dated 26.01.1988 transferred the
exclusive ownership of trademarks including „CHLORIDE‟ and „EXIDE‟ to
Chloride Industries Ltd. Exide India/plaintiff states that it acquired the




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 3
 exclusive right to use the mark „EXIDE‟ in India by the said Agreement.
Chloride Industries Ltd. was renamed to Exide Industries Ltd. on
25.08.1995. Exide India/plaintiff submits that its presence in the Indian
market with the mark EXIDE is tangible and widespread and its impeccable
reputation for quality products has rendered it very popular. Exide
India/plaintiff and/or its predecessors-in-interest have been creating and
selling qualitatively superior batteries under the mark EXIDE for more than
50 years, which is evident from, inter alia, Exide India/plaintiffs‟ sales
figures and the awards won by it. Because of the widespread publicity of the
mark EXIDE, the identity of Exide India/plaintiff has become intertwined
with the said mark.
</p><p id="p_8">6.     Exide India/plaintiff further submits that it is the subsequent
proprietor of the mark EXIDE and its variants, which were originally owned
by Chloride Group plc - its predecessors-in-interest. The registration of the
trademark was duly assigned in favor of Exide India/the first plaintiff and
the goodwill and reputation that its predecessors had acquired also vested in
it. Exide India/ the plaintiff submits that it is the registered proprietor of the
marks, inter alia, „EXIDE‟ (registration application no. 694, class 9) and
"IRONCLAD-EXIDE‟ (registration application no. 697, class 9).
</p><p id="p_9">7.     It is claimed that the earliest registration of the mark EXIDE in India
was in 1942 and by an agreement dated 07.02.1978 made between Chloride
Group Ltd. and Exide India/plaintiff, Chloride Group plc had agreed to
assign and transfer the trademark EXIDE to Exide India/plaintiff subject to
the terms and conditions specified therein. In pursuance of this agreement,
Exide India/plaintiff executed a Deed of Assignment dated 02.06.1980
whereby Exide India/plaintiff reassigned and re-transferred to the Chloride




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                           Page 4
 Group plc the said trademarks with the intent that the said reassignment and
re-transfer would take place on the occurrence of certain events specified in
the Fourth Schedule to the said Agreement. However, the said re-assignment
never took place. Exide India/the first plaintiff, contends that it is the
exclusive proprietor of the mark EXIDE in India by virtue of obtaining
registration of the said mark under No. 366539 as of 22.09.1980. It is
submitted that Exide India and its predecessors-in-interest are the first in
India to use the word EXIDE and register it as its trademark under the Trade
and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_1">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958.
</p><p id="p_10">8.     Exide India/the first plaintiff alleges that in 1991, Chloride Group plc
sold all its shares in Chloride Eastern Industries (Singapore) to Tech Trade
(Singapore) plc ltd. by a Deed of Sale and Purchase of Shares dated
03.01.1991, and in 1992 the Chloride Group plc assigned its marks,
including EXIDE, to Chloride Eastern Industries Ltd. (Singapore) which is
the holding company of Exide India/plaintiff. Under Clause 6.3.1 of the said
Deed, the exclusive ownership of trademarks, including EXIDE, were to be
transferred to Chloride Industries Ltd. (India). The first plaintiff, thus,
submits that prior to 1978, it was the registered user of the mark EXIDE and
after 1978, the rights in the said mark devolved on Exide India/plaintiff
and/or its predecessors.
</p><p id="p_11">9.     Exide India further states that in February 1997, it came across
advertisements in newspapers in different cities comprising of the mark
EXIDE with identical script style (as one used by it (Exide India)) revolving
on the surface of a globe and the goods were similar to its goods. The
advertisements were about Exide US and were meant to mislead the
consumer, as a man of average intelligence would have confused the said




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 5

India/plaintiff sought the following reliefs in the Suit:

<p id="p_12">Written Statement




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 6
</p><p id="p_13"> 10.    Exide US contended- in the written statement-that they are prior users
of the mark EXIDE. The first defendant is a corporation incorporated under
the laws of State of Delaware in the United States of America. Its
predecessor - M/s Electric Storage Battery Company - was incorporated in
USA on 05.06.1988.The second defendant, an Indian company, is an
indirect subsidiary of Exide US. Exide US claims to be the successor to the
originator and first user of the mark EXIDE worldwide, including India, and
claims to have the right to use the same in India.
</p><p id="p_14">11.    The first defendant/Exide US, claims that till 1947, it was directly and
by itself - and through its agents and dealers, marketing batteries in India
under the EXIDE trademark. No batteries were in fact manufactured in India
up to 1960. From 1920 to 1960, batteries manufactured, inter alia, by ESBC
were imported into India by F&amp;C Osler Ltd. Exide US submitted that the
first battery to use the mark EXIDE was manufactured by ESBC in 1900. It
further states that Exide India/the first plaintiff had no manufacturing
capability in India till 1960 and till 1978 Exide US was the registered user of
the trademark EXIDE and consequently, the plaintiff did not have any
proprietary rights in the trademark EXIDE. It is submitted that Exide
India/the    first   plaintiff   is   the   successor-in-interest   of   the    first
defendant/Exide US and therefore, prior use of the mark EXIDE in India
belongs to the first defendant/Exide US.
</p><p id="p_15">12.    The defendants further contend that the agreements relied upon by
Exide India do not establish that the trademark EXIDE was validly assigned
to it, and that Exide India/the first plaintiff has not placed all the relevant
agreements in this regard on record. Further, it is submitted that Exide
India‟s name was changed in a deliberate attempt to show an association




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                              Page 7
 with the first defendant/Exide US, which is the world‟s largest and oldest
battery manufacturer, and that Exide India was trying to take advantage of
Exide US‟ goodwill and reputation. In various placed in the pleadings, Exide
US emphasizes that it was the originator of the word EXIDE and owned
registered trademarks; it also submits that Chloride Electrical Storage
Syndicate (a UK company later known as Chloride Group Plc) had entered
into a series of agreements with the Electrical storage Batteries Co (ESBC,
i.e., Exide US‟ predecessor) in 1891, 1892 and 1895. The last of these, the
"Harvey Agreement" provided for interchange of technical information
between the two companies and conferred reciprocal rights in regard to
patents and commercial exploitation on exclusive geographical basis.
Chloride enjoyed these rights exclusively on geographical basis for UK and
the British Empire. That document was produced as Ex. DW-1/28. It is
therefore contended that Chloride‟s use later in India, was really for and on
behalf of Exide US. The defendants also contended, in the suit that a
subsequent development, by way of decree of the US District Court, on
24.11.1947, in anti trust proceedings, resulted in Exide US being restrained
from proceeding with the Harvey agreement. It also had to desist
participating in Chloride‟s management and was divested of the rights as a
shareholder. This, coupled with India‟s restrictive trade policies, which
curtailed foreign investments, prevented its brand EXIDE and products
under that mark, being sold in India, after 1960.
</p><p id="p_16">13.    The defendants have also challenged the validity of registration of the
mark EXIDE by Exide India/the first plaintiff on the ground that the latter,
Exide India had not disclosed all the relevant facts before the Registrar of
Trade Marks and consequently, the registration was duplicitously obtained.
</p>



<p id="p_17">RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 8
 According to the defendants, Exide India failed to disclose that the
trademark was first registered in India in 1942 by CESCO, where the first
defendant/Exide US had a majority shareholding. Further, in terms of the
agreements dated 07.02.1978 relied upon by Exide India, the mark EXIDE
had to be re-assigned by it to the assignor/original owner.
</p><p id="p_18">14.    The defendants/Exide US challenge Exide India‟s claims regarding
the sale figures produced by them and the allegedly high levels of market
shares. They also contend that since Exide India used the mark EXIDE as
the registered user, such use is deemed to be by the registered proprietor and
not Exide India. The defendants also filed a counter-claim stating that Exide
India was liable for passing off its products as those belonging to it.
Impugned Judgment

</p><p id="p_19">15.    The learned Single Judge held in favor of Exide India and decreed the
suit. He held that it was an indisputable fact that in the record of the
Registrar of Trademarks, Exide India was the owner of the mark "EXIDE".
Notwithstanding the defendants‟ contentions that the registration was
fraudulent, the learned Single Judge noted that a civil court was required to
take it at face value, till its cancellation by the Registrar of Trademarks,
following proper proceedings. According to the learned Single Judge, the
Court was not authorized to go into the question of the validity or invalidity
of the trademark. According to <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_2">Section 56</a> of the Act, the High Court or the
Registrar to whom the application for cancellation is made, has the
jurisdiction to decide that issue. This impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of
the present court to do the same.
</p>



<p id="p_20">RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 9
</p><p id="p_21"> 16.    The Single Judge also held that under S.111 of the Act, a civil court
could refuse to proceed on a claim for injunction in one of two
circumstances: first, if prior to the filing of the suit, the defendant had
already applied to the appropriate forum for cancellation; and secondly, if,
upon an application filed seeking the leave of the court to challenge the
validity of the trademark before the appropriate forum, the court was prima
facie convinced that the trademark was invalid, then, it could stay the
proceedings to enable the defendant to file for cancellation. In all other
events, the suit would continue on the assumption that the trademark was
valid. The learned Single Judge held that since Exide US had filed no such
application in the present case, the proceedings could not be stayed and the
Court would be obligated to proceed on the assumption that the mark
EXIDE is valid.
</p><p id="p_22">17.    On merits, the Learned Single Judge held that the defendants/Exide
US had infringed Exide India‟s trademark and were also liable for passing
off the said mark. The learned Single Judge rejected the defendants‟ plea of
prior use on the ground that they had not used the mark EXIDE in India
since 1950 and there did not exist any special circumstances to justify the
non-use of the mark by Exide US. The Learned Single Judge rejected the
defendant/Exide US‟s reliance on <a href="/doc/1874558/" id="a_3">Hardie Trading v. Addison Paints &amp;
Chemicals Ltd</a>. 2003 (11) SCC 92 on the ground that they had not taken the
defense of special circumstances in their pleadings and that in any case, such
defense is factual in nature and it did not exist on facts herein. Therefore, the
learned Single Judge granted a decree in favor of Exide India and restrained
Exide US/the first defendant from selling their goods or having their trade




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 10
 name with the trademark 'EXIDE' or any other name/mark deceptively
similar thereto.
</p><p id="p_23">Arguments of the Appellants/Exide US:
</p>
<p id="p_24">18.    The Appellants‟ submissions can broadly be stated as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      a. Exide India/the first plaintiff indulged in gross and material
         suppression and concealments while obtaining the ex-parte order of
         injunction as well as at the stage of final arguments.
      b. Exide US is the prior user of the mark „EXIDE‟, both globally as
         well as in India. Exide India/the first plaintiff‟s predecessor-in-
         interest acquired rights in the word „EXIDE‟ from the first
         defendant/Exide US‟s predecessor-in-title and thus, Exide India/the
         first plaintiff has no independent right in the mark itself. Exide
         India/plaintiff‟s rights are inferior to that of the first defendant/Exide
         US.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">      c. Exide US did not abandon the use of the mark „EXIDE‟ in India. It
         could not use the mark „EXIDE‟ in India from 1947 to 1991 in light
         of „special circumstances‟.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">      d. In light of the above, Exide US is the legal owner of the mark
         „EXIDE‟ and cannot be restrained from using the said mark in India.
         Axiomatically, Exide India/the first plaintiff is liable for passing off
         its products as that of Exide US.
</blockquote><p id="p_25">19.    Developing the above submissions Ms. Pratibha Singh, learned senior
counsel for the defendant/Exide US submitted that Exide India has
concealed the entire history of the „EXIDE‟ mark as well as the relationship
between Exide India/plaintiffs, Chloride Group Plc and Exide US. Exide US




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                           Page 11
 contends that the mark „EXIDE‟ was coined by its predecessor - ESBC -
from the words „Excellent Oxide‟. It relies on Exhibit DW1/25, Exhibit
DW1/41, Exhibit DW1/42 and Exhibit DW1/43 and the deposition of DW1
in support of this contention. The defendant/appellants contend that the
deposition of PW1 in this regard was evasive or unsupported by any
documentary record. Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that Exide
US is proprietor of the mark „EXIDE‟ in 130 countries. It has registered the
said mark and its derivatives globally, sold EXIDE products since 1900
globally and advertised and protected the same.
</p><p id="p_26">20.    The defendants/Exide US contend that the alleged predecessor-in-
interest of Exide India/first plaintiff - CESCO - got the name EXIDE from
it, i.e., Exide US. It is argued that ESBC incorporated CESCO in England on
12.12.1891. It is alleged that it was the admitted position of Exide India/first
plaintiff in the final arguments before the learned Single Judge that CESCO
was an affiliate of ESBC, and has taken a contradictory stand in the cross
objection. The learned Single Judge specifically observed that CESCO was
permitted to use the mark EXIDE since it was a group company of ESBC. It
is further submitted that from 1920 to about 1950, ESBC and CESCO
imported batteries from USA and UK through a common dealer, M/s F&amp;C
Osler Ltd. In fact, the impugned judgment (in para 12) records that Exide
India/the first plaintiff did not dispute that Exide US was the prior user of
„EXIDE‟ even in India from 1902 to 1950. Since Exide India/the first
plaintiff is admittedly CESCO‟s successor, it cannot claim any superior
rights in the mark beyond the actual owner, i.e. Exide US. Reliance is placed
on the decisions in <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_4">N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation</a>, 1996 PTC 16

</p><p id="p_27">21.    The defendants/Exide US submit that till 1978, the first plaintiff was
only a licensee of CESCO and consequently did not possess any proprietary
rights in the mark EXIDE. The Deed of Assignment in 1978 (Exhibit P-114)
between Chloride Group UK and Chloride India Ltd. recognizes that
Chloride India Ltd. was only a registered user till 1978. Under <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_9">Section 48</a> of
the Act, the right of the registered user is that of a licensee and the use by
the registered user accrues to the proprietor or the licensor. Exide US
submits that Exide India, whose predecessors derived the right to use the
mark „EXIDE‟ in India from the defendant (Exide US‟s) predecessor-in-
interest, cannot be better placed than itself. The Defendant/Appellants rely

</p><p id="p_28">22.    The defendants/Exide US submit that the Single Judge has overlooked
their contention regarding the fraudulent nature of the assignment of the
mark EXIDE to Exide India/the first plaintiff. According to Exide US, the
supposed assignment of the mark EXIDE and its derivate to Exide India
through assignment dated 07-02-1978 was conditional and that there was a
re-assignment of the rights. Clause 2 of the 1978 assignment, which deals
with such re-assignment, was absent in the document filed before the Trade
Marks Registry. Further, the records from the Trade Marks Office with




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                       Page 13
 respect to registration Nos. 694, 697, 287589 and 287599 indicate that the
Deed of Re-assignment dated 02.06.1980 was not mentioned. This fact,
contends counsel, is admitted by Exide India/the first plaintiff‟s witness, Mr.
Barun Das.
</p><p id="p_29">23.    Exide US argues that since the registrations (of the marks) were
obtained by fraud, no rights flow out of the transaction. Further, it is Exide
India/first plaintiff‟s case that the assignment of EXIDE took place after an
Agreement for Sale and Purchase dated 03.01.1991. The terms of the said
sale agreement are un-known as the document was not placed on record.
Also, given that the averments made by Exide India pertaining to the sale of
shares by Chloride Group plc in Chloride Eastern Industries Ltd.
(Singapore) in 1991 and the change in shareholding of Exide India/first
plaintiff in 1992 are not supported by any documentary evidence, it is
impossible to determine as to what was the shareholding pattern, what rights
the plaintiff/Exide India acquired from Chloride Group plc and whether such
rights were legally enforceable.
</p><p id="p_30">24.    In order to justify their prolonged absence in the Indian market, the
Appellants rely on the decision of the United States District Court of 1947,
which forced ESBC to divest its shareholding in CESCO. Although the
decision continued to be in effect till 1983, Exide US continued its global
usage of the word „EXIDE‟ during this period. As regards India, the
Appellants urge that Exide US could not carry out business till 1991, as it
was impermissible under India‟s foreign direct investment regime- in
support, they rely on the affidavit of DW-1. During this period, Chloride
Group plc (CESCO‟s successor) illegally transferred the trademark EXIDE
to Chloride Industries Ltd. (earlier name of Exide India/first plaintiff).

<p id="p_31">RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 14
 Although Exide India relies on the said agreement, it has also not been
placed on record. Appellants also submit that the word EXIDE became a
part of a corporate name of a company in India for the first time in 1995,
when Exide India/first plaintiff changed its name upon having discovered
that Exide US had entered the Indian market.
</p><p id="p_32">25.    The Appellants impugn the Learned Single Judge‟s rejection of their
argument on „special circumstances‟ to justify the first defendant/Exide
US‟s abandonment of the mark EXIDE in India, on the premise that that
there was no pleading as to this ground and therefore, it could not be
considered. It is argued that since Exide India had never pleaded that the
first defendant/Exide US had abandoned the mark EXIDE in India, they
could not have taken the plea of special circumstances in the pleading. To
prove existence of special circumstances on merits, Exide US relies on
<a href="/doc/1874558/" id="a_12">Hardie Trading Ltd. v. Addisons Paint &amp; Chemicals Ltd</a>., (2003) 11 SCC
92; <a href="/doc/330682/" id="a_13">Fedders Lloyd Corporation v. Fedders Corporation</a>, 2005 (30) PTC 353
(<a href="/doc/943914/" id="a_14">Del) and Express Bottling Services Pvt. Ltd. v. PepsiCo</a>, 1989 PTC 14.
</p><p id="p_33">26.    Exide US further contended that under trademark law, if there is more
than one owner of the mark in different jurisdictions, the goodwill is deemed
shared by two entities. It never recognizes a situation where one entity has
superior right over that of the other entity. In any event, the original entity
can never be made subservient to the entity formed later. The Appellants
rely on <a href="/doc/681448/" id="a_15">Revlon Inc. v. M/s Sarita Manufacturing Co</a>., 67 (1997) DLT 399
and Habib Bank Ltd. v. Habib Bank AG Zurich, 1982 RPC 1.
</p><p id="p_34">27.    Thus, Appellants claim ownership over the mark EXIDE based on the
following facts:
</p>



<p id="p_35">RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 15
</p><p id="p_36">            a) ESBC - Exide US‟s predecessor-in-interest - created the mark
               EXIDE in 1900. ESBC has used the mark EXIDE in India from
               1920s till 1947 through its dealers. Thus, Exide US established
               common law rights in India as early as 1921. Chloride
               Electrical Co, UK was under the control and ownership of
               Exide US, which was its majority shareholder.
</p><p id="p_37">           b) Exide US never gave up its intentions to conduct business in
               India, even though it was unable to directly manufacture
               batteries in India and use EXIDE as a trademark from 1947 to
               1991. Exide US‟s inability to use the mark during this period
               was an account of special circumstances, i.e., the US District
               Court ruling of 24.11.1947 resulted in the discontinuation of the
               "Harvey Agreement", as well as trade in India. Its shareholding
               in Chloride Electrical Co. too had to be given up.
</p><p id="p_38">           c) The other special circumstance, which prevented Exide US
               from trading in India, was the Indian Foreign direct investment
               policy, which placed severe restrictions. This circumstance was
               relieved in 1991. By then, in 1984, the US District Court
               injunction had been vacated.
</p><p id="p_39">           d) Exide US acquired the second Appellant with the objective of
               resuming the use of the mark „EXIDE‟ in India once the special
               circumstances ceased to exist.
</p><p id="p_40">           e) The registration of the mark „EXIDE‟ obtained by Exide India
               was fraudulent in nature and therefore, ought to be cancelled.
</p><p id="p_41">28.    Based on such ownership, the Appellants/Exide US submit that the
injunction was obtained by Exide India by suppressing and concealing




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 16
 material facts; Exide India/the first plaintiff is not entitled to the relief
sought and that granted by the learned Single Judge; and Exide India/the
first plaintiff is liable for passing off its goods as that of the appellants and
consequently, appellants are entitled to damages for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_42">Submissions on Behalf of Exide India/plaintiffs:
</p>
<p id="p_43">29. Exide India/first plaintiff defends the impugned judgment and decree
and submits as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">            i. Exide India/first plaintiff is the continuous prior and registered
              user of the mark EXIDE in India and therefore, is entitled to
              restrain every person including the Appellants/Exide US from
              using the said mark in India.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">           ii. Exide US was not using EXIDE in India at any point of time.
           iii. The Appellants‟/Exide US‟ claims of trans-border reputation
              and existence of special circumstances is beyond the pleadings
              and cannot be urged as grounds of appeal.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">           iv. Exide India/the first plaintiff is entitled to restrain Exide US
              from using the corporate name/trade name EXIDE because
              EXIDE is a registered trademark owned by Exide India/first
              plaintiff and in any case, the trade name with the trade mark
              EXIDE is in use since 1947.</blockquote>
<p id="p_44">            v. In light of the above, Exide India submits that the appellants
              have not shown use of the mark EXIDE till 1997 when the suit
              was filed. Even if it is assumed (but not admitted) that the first
              defendant/Exide US used the mark EXIDE through CESCO till
              1947, there was clear abandonment of such use. By virtue of the




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 17
               fact that the appellants never challenged the right of Chloride
              Group Ltd./CESCO to use the mark EXIDE in England or in
              India from 1902 till date, there is clear-cut acquiescence by
              Exide US in the exclusive use of the mark in these territories by
              the respective companies. The assignment of the mark EXIDE
              in India by Chloride Group Ltd. (UK) to Exide India has not
              been challenged and Chloride Group has not been made party to
              the same. On these grounds the appeal ought to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_45">30.    Expanding on the said submissions, Exide India‟s senior counsel, Mr.
Rajiv Nayar - and later, Mr. Chetan Sharma, Senior counsel, submitted that
from 1902 to 1942, CESCO was importing batteries manufactured in
England into British India and selling them under the trademark EXIDE.
There was no Trademarks Act in India till 1940 and therefore, CESCO had
registered the trademark EXIDE in the UK on 23.12.1902- (trademark
Registration no. 250920). After the enactment of the Trademarks Act, 1940,
on 8.6.1942, CESCO registered the trademark EXIDE and IRONCLAD
EXIDE in India (trademark registration no. 694 and 697 respectively). In
1946, CESCO set up its first factory in India in West Bengal for
manufacturing EXIDE batteries.
</p>
<p id="p_46">31.    From 1902 to the Registration of the mark EXIDE in India in 1942,
the exclusive use of the mark was that of CESCO. From 1942 till 7.2.1978,
the use of the mark EXIDE in India was either that of CESCO or its
successor Chloride Group plc. This entire use from 1902 to 1978 stood
attached to Exide India upon assignment of the mark EXIDE to Exide India.
For this submission, Exide India/first plaintiff relies upon Dhariwal




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 18

Foundation v. M/s Raj Kumar Sah &amp; Sons, ILR</a> (2010) I Delhi 754.
</p>
<p id="p_47">32.    Exide India/first plaintiff submits that the Appellants cannot challenge
the assignment of the trademark in its favor on the ground of fraud without
providing any particulars of the fraud and without even impleading the
assignor (CESCO/Chloride Group plc). It is stated that in terms of the
judgment in <a href="/doc/1236969/" id="a_18">Thukral Mechanical Works v. P.M. Diesels Pvt. Ltd</a>., (2009) 2
SCC 768, an assignment cannot be challenged, without impleading the
assignor. Further, Exide US, in the present case accepted Chloride Group
plc‟s exclusive right to use „EXIDE‟ by obtaining license in the UK
according to its annual report. It is urged that nowhere in the written
statement did the Appellants challenge CESCO‟s right or that of Chloride
Group plc. Furthermore, the advertisements relied upon by Exide US do not
show that they were the source of EXIDE batteries in India prior to
Independence. Instead, they clearly show that Exide India‟s predecessor to
be the source.
</p>
<p id="p_48">33.    Exide India/the first plaintiff submits that the Exide US‟ plea that by
virtue of its majority shareholding in CESCO till 1947, the latter‟s use is that
of the Appellants is fallacious. Mere shareholding in a company does not
provide proprietary interest in the properties of the company/its
trademarks/its intellectual property to a given shareholder. For this
submission, Exide India/first plaintiff relies upon, inter alia, <a href="/doc/815442/" id="a_19">Sturtevant
Engineering Co. Ltd. v. Sturtevant Mills Co. of USA</a>, (1936) Vol. LIII RPC

Wescare (India) Ltd</a>., (2010) 5 SCC 306.
</p>
<p id="p_50">34.    Exide India/first plaintiff further submits that even after the
termination of the Harvey agreement in 1947, Exide US did not challenge
the use of the mark EXIDE in India and on the other hand accepted Chloride
Group‟s right to own the mark EXIDE in the UK by obtaining a license.
Even after the termination of the decree by the US District Court in 1984,
Exide US did not enter the Indian market. It is argued on behalf of Exide
India/first plaintiff that Exide US admitted the non-use of the mark EXIDE
in India from 1947 till 1997 and thus, it abandoned the use of the mark; they
acquiesced in the use of the mark EXIDE in India. Exide India/plaintiffs rely
upon <a href="/doc/1874558/" id="a_23">Hardie Trading Ltd. v. Addisons Paint &amp; Chemicals Ltd</a>., (2003) 11
SCC 92; Cycle Corporation of India Ltd. TI Raliegh, 1996 9 SCC 430 and
<a href="/doc/1829338/" id="a_24">JN Nicolas (Vimto) Ltd. v. Rose and Thistle</a>, AIR 1994 Cal 43.
</p>
<p id="p_51">35.    It is further urged by Exide India that the EXIDE trademark was
registered in its favor since 1942. In 1947, CESCO incorporated a subsidiary
in India named Exide Batteries (Eastern) Ltd., which changed its name to
CEBEL on 11.2.1948. Presently, CEBEL is a subsidiary of Exide India. The
first defendant/Exide US, however, adopted Exide as a part of its corporate
name for the first time on 18.12.1980. Exide India/first plaintiff contends
that it has been consistently held that merely because the holding company
has with a particular corporate name, used by an international subsidiary
does not authorize the holding company to invade in the local territory with
its corporate name, and dilute the trademark and reputation attached to the




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                      Page 20
 local company. Exide India/first plaintiff submits that goodwill attached in a
name or mark is territorial in nature.
</p>
<p id="p_52">36.    It is also submitted by Exide India/first plaintiff that a company with a
particular corporate name cannot be allowed to transact business in the same
corporate name in a place where another has been running its business under
that corporate name - <a href="/doc/870048/" id="a_25">M/s Montari Overseas Ltd. vs. Montari Industries
Ltd</a>., (1995) 33 DRJ 271 is relied on for this proposition. Exide India/first
plaintiff also cites <a href="/doc/486152/" id="a_26">Ellora Industries Ltd. v. Banarasi Das Goela</a>, AIR 1980
Del 254 to contend the territorial aspect of trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_53">37.    Exide India/first plaintiffs in its cross-objection argues that the
learned Single Judge has erroneously held that Exide US was a prior user of
the mark EXIDE from 1902 till 1950.Thus, Exide India/first plaintiff
claimed that the Appellants‟ appeal should be dismissed and its cross
objections should be allowed.
</p>
<p id="p_54">Analysis and Conclusions:
</p>
<p id="p_55">38.   The points that arise for our consideration can be summarized as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">           a) Whether Exide India is the lawful registered proprietor of the
           trademark „EXIDE‟ in India?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">           b) Whether the first defendant/Exide US is prior user of the mark
           „EXIDE‟ in India?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">           c) Whether use of the mark „EXIDE‟ by Exide US- in India,
           amounts to infringement/passing off?
</blockquote>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_22">            d) Whether Exide India‟s use of „EXIDE‟ amounts to passing off?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">           e) Whether Exide India suppressed any material/relevant facts and,
           if so, whether the suit deserves to be dismissed on such ground?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       Point No (a):
</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">39. Elaborate arguments (detailed above) were advanced on behalf of the
Appellants, Exide US to submit that Exide India is not the lawfully
registered proprietor of the mark „EXIDE‟ in India as:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">       (a) it has played fraud on the Registrar of Trade Marks to get itself
       registered as a registered proprietor; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">       (b) it is the first defendant/Exide US who is the prior user of the mark
       „EXIDE‟, both in India as well as globally, and therefore, Exide
       India/first plaintiff could not have been registered as the proprietor of
       the mark „EXIDE‟.
</blockquote><p id="p_57">40.    The learned Single Judge, according to us, correctly, declined to go
into the issue of validity of trademark registration on the ground of lack
jurisdiction of civil courts to examine such an issue under the Act. <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_27">Section
56</a> of the (old Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_28">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958), provides that any
party that seeks cancellation or variation of the registration of a trademark
shall apply to the High Court (having jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/136340/" id="a_29">Section 3</a> of the
Act) or the Registrar. It is settled that the jurisdiction of the civil court to
examine the validity of registration of a trademark with the Registrar of
Trade Marks is ousted by the Act. During the course of hearing, the court
was also informed that Exide US had preferred rectification proceedings
questioning validity of trademark registration.
</p>



<p id="p_58">RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 22
</p><p id="p_59"> 41.    As noted in the impugned judgment, in instances where the validity of
the trademark is challenged in a suit for infringement of the said trademark,
the procedure prescribed under <a href="/doc/235735/" id="a_30">Section 111</a> (of the old Act) was to be
strictly followed. In the event that the defendant challenged the validity of
the trade mark prior to the institution of the suit, the Court is obligated to
stay the infringement suit pending the outcome of the proceedings relating to
the validity of the trademark [<a href="/doc/235735/" id="a_31">Section 111</a>)(1)(i)]. However, where the
defendant challenges the validity of such registration in a suit for
infringement of trade mark subsequent to the institution of the suit, the civil
court upon prima facie satisfaction that the plea of invalidity of registration
of the plaintiff‟s trade mark, can adjourn the suit to enable the defendant to
file an application challenging the validity before the Registrar or the High
Court (now, under <a href="/doc/759423/" id="a_32">Section 124</a> of the Act, the Intellectual Property
Appellate Board) and the Court shall stay the suit pending the outcome of
the     such        challenge   proceedings    if    the     application      for
cancellation/rectification is duly filed. If no application is filed by the
defendant before the Registrar or the High Court (or IPAB), the defendant
would be deemed to have abandoned its right to challenge the validity of the
trade mark insofar as the suit proceedings are concerned [<a href="/doc/1498033/" id="a_33">Section 111(3)</a>].
</p><p id="p_60">42.    It is therefore evident- from the provisions of <a href="/doc/1755709/" id="a_34">Section 111(1)</a> (now
replaced by Section 124 of the Trademarks Act, 1999) that in no
circumstance where the defendant seeks to challenge the validity of
registration of the plaintiff‟s trade mark which forms the basis for the
infringement suit, the civil court adjudicates upon the issue of validity of the
registration. The jurisdiction to decide and pronounce upon the validity of a
registration is exclusively that of the Intellectual Property Appellate Board




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                          Page 23
 (formerly the High Court, under the old Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_35">Merchandise Marks Act</a>,
1958).
</p>
<p id="p_61">43.    It is not in dispute that the Appellants/Exide US did not institute any
proceedings challenging the validity of the registration of the mark „EXIDE‟
prior to the institution of Exide India/first plaintiff‟s suit. Further, it is also
not disputed that the Court has not held that the plea of invalidity raised in
the defense is prima facie merited. In the circumstances, the issue as to
validity of the mark „EXIDE‟ cannot arise for consideration in this case,
before this court. The Court therefore disagrees with the appellants‟
submission that the civil court may examine the validity of the registration
of trademark, on the ground of fraud. This submission does not find any
basis under the Act or case law. The jurisdiction to decide whether
registration of a trademark was lawfully given or otherwise, or whether any
user (of trademark) challenging registration has valid grounds for its
challenge, is that of the exclusive forum provided under the Act, i.e., the
Intellectual Property Appellate Board or the Registrar (<a href="/doc/322600/" id="a_36">Section 57</a>). As
noticed earlier, when the present suit was filed, the appellants had not
preferred any application or proceedings before the appropriate authority
(i.e., the IPAB) or the Registrar. Therefore, the suit could not have been
stayed. However, the appellant appears to have approached the concerned
authority for cancellation of registration. In these circumstances, there
cannot be any finding about the validity of Exide India‟s mark.
</p>
<p id="p_62">44.    The next question is with respect to the Appellants‟ plea of Exide US
being the prior user insofar as the mark „EXIDE‟ is concerned, and Exide
India‟s cross-objections contending that it is the prior user of the mark




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                           Page 24
 EXIDE from 1902 till 1950.This Court is not oblivious of the fact that the
defense of prior use is statutorily available to Exide US under <a href="/doc/187252/" id="a_37">Section 33</a> of
the Act in the event of a finding of infringement of Exide India/first
plaintiff‟s mark. However, a determination of this aspect in the present
proceeding would impinge upon the jurisdiction of the appropriate authority
under the Act to examine the Appellants‟ application under <a href="/doc/1071557/" id="a_38">Section 56</a> of the
Act challenging the validity of registration of Exide India‟s mark. Naturally,
once it is held that a finding on prior use is outside the jurisdiction of this
Court, the issues concerning abandonment and special circumstances also
cannot be examined, as they constitute exceptions/defenses to prior use.
</p>
<p id="p_63">45.    This Court‟s enquiry, therefore, would have to proceed on the
assumption that the trademark registration in Exide India‟s name is valid.
This is because of <a href="/doc/1833419/" id="a_39">Section 31(1)</a> of the Act, which provides that in all legal
proceedings in relation to a registered trademark, the original registration of
the mark shall be prima facie evidence of its validity. Noting this provision,
along with <a href="/doc/518582/" id="a_40">Section 28(1)</a> of the Act, this Court in <a href="/doc/1961341/" id="a_41">P.M. Diesels Pvt. Ltd. v.
Thukral Mechanical Works</a>, AIR 1988 Del 282 held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">               "The perusal of the aforesaid provision clearly shows that an
               exclusive right to the use of the trade mark has been given to
               the registered proprietor by Section 28(1) in relation to the
               goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered. It is the
               registered proprietor who is also given the right to obtain relief
               in respect of the infringement of the trade mark. It is true that
               Section 28(1) confers the right on the registered proprietor if
               the registration is valid. This provision has, Therefore, to be
               read along with Section 31(1) which, inter alia, provides that
               the registration of the trade mark shall be the prima facie




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 25
                evidence of the validity thereof. Reading the two provisions
               together, namely Section 28(1) and Section 31(1), the
               implication would be that as long as a trade mark stands
               registered in the name of a proprietor, the said registration
               shall be deemed to be valid and the registered proprietor would
               have an exclusive right to use the said trade mark. If the
               registration is cancelled by an action being taken under Section
               56 of the Act, then the protection and right afforded under
               Section 28(1) read with Section 31(1) would no longer be
               available, but till the Register of Trade Mark is corrected and
               the name of a person holding a trade mark is deleted, that
               person who is shown as the proprietor of the registered trade
               mark would continue to have all the rights and privileges which
               are conferred by the Act on the registered owner of the trade
               mark. Therefore, even though the plaintiff has filed an
               application in this Court being C.O. 6/87 for rectification of the
               Trade Mark Register for deletion of the name of the defendants
               there from, the registration of the trade mark in the name of the
               defendants is prima face evidence of the validity thereof
               because of the provisions of Section 31(1)."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_64">46.    In view of the above findings, the question of the plaintiff not being
the registered owner of the mark cannot arise. It is quite another matter that
in the proceedings for cancellation of the mark, instituted after the suit was
filed, Exide US impeached the title, on various grounds, including that the
assignment pursuant to which Exide India became owner of the mark is
suspect, or other grounds vitiating its registration. However, those aspects
cannot be the basis of any decisive finding, because the appropriate and
exclusive fora to adjudicate those issues are the IPAB or the Registrar. Issue
No. (a) is accordingly answered.

         Points (b), (c) and (d):

are liable for infringement/passing off in regard to Exide India‟s mark
EXIDE and conversely whether Exide US is entitled to the reliefs claimed,
in the counter claim. The test for infringement and passing off, and the
distinction between the two, has been discussed in various decisions of the
Supreme Court and this Court, which are quoted hereafter. <a href="/doc/165469/" id="a_42">In Ruston and
Hornsby vs The Zamindara Engineering Co</a>., [1970] 2 SCR 222 it was held
that:

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">               "In an action for infringement where the defendant's trade mark

               whether the infringement is such as is likely to deceive or cause
               confusion. But where the alleged infringement consists of using
               not the exact mark on the register, but something similar to it,
               the test of infringement is the same as in an action for passing -
               off. In other words, the test as to likelihood of confusion or
               deception and arising from similarity of mark is the same both
               in infringement and passing-off actions."

<p id="p_66"><a href="/doc/1132403/" id="a_43">M/S S.M. Dyechem Ltd. vs. M/S Cadbury (India) Ltd</a>., (2000) 5 SCC573
summarized the law in the following manner:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">        "(1) The essential features test: It is well-settled that the plaintiff
            must prove that essential features of his registered mark have
            been copied. The onus to prove 'deception' is on the part of the
            plaintiff who alleges infringement. A mark is said to be infringed
            by another trader if, even without using the whole of it, the
            latter uses one or more of its "essential features". The
            identification of an essential feature depends partly on the
            courts' own judgment and partly on the burden of the evidence




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 27
               that is placed before it. Ascertainment of an essential feature is
              not to be by ocular test alone; it is impossible to exclude
              consideration of the sound of words forming part or the whole of
              the mark. (Kerly, Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names, 11th
              Ed. 1983, para 14.21). It is no answer to a charge of
              infringement - as contrasted with a passing off action - that the
              defendant's mark, whilst including the plaintiff's mark, includes
              other matters too. (Paras 26-27)


           (1) When the question arises whether a mark applied for bears
               such resemblance to another mark as to be likely to deceive, it
               should be determined by considering what is the leading
               character of each. The one might contain many, even most, of
               the same elements as the other, and yet the leading, or it may
               be the only, impression left on the mind might be very different.</blockquote>
<p id="p_67">               On the other hand, a critical comparison of the two marks
               might disclose numerous points of difference, and yet the idea
               which would remain with any person seeing them apart at
               different times might be the same. Thus, it is clear that a mark
               is infringed if the essential features, or essential particulars of
               it, are copied. In cases of device marks, especially, it is helpful
               before comparing the marks, to consider what are the
               essentials of the plaintiff's device. (para 31)

           (2) "The true test is whether the totality of the proposed trade mark
               is such that it is likely to cause deception or confusion or
               mistake in the minds of persons accustomed to the existing
               trade mark". (para 31)

           (3) In yet another case of an infringement action, Parle Products
               the question was in relation to a wrapper with the words 'Gluco
               biscuit' and the particular colour scheme, the general get up
               used for sale of Parle's Gluco Biscuit' so printed on the
               wrapper. There was a farmyard with a girl in the centre
               carrying a pail of water and cows and hens around her in the
               background of a farm-house. The defendant was selling biscuits




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                          Page 28
                with the name 'Glucose Biscuits'. The wrapper contained
               picture of a girl supporting with one hand a bundle of hay on
               her head and carrying a sickle and a bundle of food, with cows
               and hens around, in the background of a building. This Court
               held, on those facts, that in an infringement action, it was
               sufficient if there was 'overall similarity' as would mislead a
               person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to
               him. Here the packets were of the same size and the colour
               scheme and design were having close resemblance. The
               marks should not be kept side by side and compared. The
               essential features of both marking were a girl with one arm
               raised and carrying something in the other while the cows or
               hens were near her, in the background of a house. (para 34)

           (4) Zamindara Engineering Co. (1969(2) SCC 727) was again a
               case of an infringement action. It was admitted that the words
               'Ruston and Rustam' were deceptively similar and the fact that
               to the latter, "India" was suffixed made no difference. The court
               pointed out the difference between an infringement action and a
               passing off action and held that if there was colourable
               imitation, the fact that the get up was different was not relevant
               in an infringement action though it might have had relevance in
               a passing off action. (para 34)

           (5) Broadly, under our law as seen above, it can be said that stress
               is laid down on common features rather than on differences on
               essential features, except for a passing reference to a limited
               extent in one case. (para 34)

           (6) It is clear that apart from the word PIKNIK, the essential
               features are also the special script of these words in block
               letters and the curve in which these words are inscribed and
               the caricature of the boy with a hat occurring between the
               words K and N on the plaintiff's mark. On the other hand, the
               defendant's mark contains the words PICNIC in a straightline,
               the script is normal and the words `Cadbury' are written above
               the words PICNIC. Neither the peculiar script nor the curve
               nor the boy with a hat are found in the defendant's mark. It is




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 29
                true that there is phonetic similarity and use of the word
               PICNIC. But what is the effect of the dissimilarities? This is
               the crucial part of the case. It is here that sufficient care is to
               be taken in applying the principles. In our opinion, in the
               present case, three tests to which reference has been made
               above, have to be applied. The first one is this: Is there any
               special aspect of the common feature which has been copied?
               The second test will be with reference to the `mode in which
               the parts are put together differently? That is to say whether
               the dissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to mark the
               whole thing dissimilar (Kerly para 17.17 referred to above).
               The third test is whether When there are common elements,
               should one not pay more regard to the parts which are not
               common, while at the same time not disregarding the common
               parts? What is the first impression? As to the first test, whether
               there are any peculiar features of the common part which have
               been copied, it is seen that the peculiar aspects of the common
               features of PIKNIK namely the peculiar script and the curve
               have not been copied; then, as to the second test, we have to see
               the dissimilarity in the part or parts and if it has made the
               whole thing dissimilar. Absence of the peculiar script in the
               letters, the curve and the absence of the caricature of the boy
               with a hat, in our view, have made the whole thing look
               dissimilar. Then, as to the third test, the above three
               dissimilarities have to be given more importance than the
               phonetic similarity or the similarity in the use of the word
               PICNIC for PIKNIK. That is how these three tests have to be
               applied in this case.

<p id="p_68">48.    The relevant test for deciding whether one trader or service provider,
passes off his goods as that of another, a different test is adopted. The test of

                A person may sell his goods or deliver his services such as in

               that the plaintiff should be able to show that the disputed mark
               or get-up has become by user in the country distinctive of the
               plaintiffs goods so that the use in relation to any goods of the
               kind dealt in by the plaintiff of that mark or get up will be
               understood by the trade and the public in that country as
               meaning that the goods are the plaintiffs goods. It is in the
               nature of acquisition of a quasi-proprietary right to the

               kind because of the plaintiff having used or made it known that
               the mark or get-up has relation to his goods. Such right is

                three elements of passing off action are the reputation of goods,
               possibility of deception and likelihood of damages to the
               plaintiff. In our opinion, the same principle, which applies to
               trade mark, is applicable to trade name."

<p id="p_79">49.    It was remarked in <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_46">Durga Das Sharma vs Navratan Pharmaceutical
Laboratories</a>, 1965 (1) SCR 737 that the rival or defendant‟s mark should be
similar, i.e., "so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise" as to its
likelihood of deception, the fact that the packaging and other get up used is
different is immaterial, to result in action for infringement. However in the
case of an action for passing off, "if the essential features of the trade mark
of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get up,
packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which
he offers his goods for sale show marked differences, or indicate clearly a
trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark
would be immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant may
escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to
distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff."

marks are identical; the word "Exide" is a coined one; equally the stylized
form, which the general public is familiar with, is distinctive and constitutes
a class by itself. The question then is whose prior use - among the two rival
claimants, i.e., Exide US and Exide India, is to be taken note of. In this, the
court, as a prelude would include a precautionary note - i.e., that the findings
recorded are only on the issue of infringement and passing off, and would
not in any manner be construed as final with respect to the validity of the
trademark, in favour of the plaintiff Exide India, which is the subject matter

 of exclusive jurisdiction before the IPAB. In other words, the use of the
mark EXIDE by the parties and their rival claims on this aspect are binding
as far as their rights to use, but not the validity of the mark is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_81">51.    The evidence on record shows that the mark „EXIDE‟ was coined by
Exide US‟s predecessor - ESBC - from the words „Excellent Oxide‟: this is
reinforced by Exhibit DW1/25, Exhibit DW1/41, Exhibit DW1/42 and
Exhibit DW1/43 and the deposition of DW1 in support of this contention.
The relationship between Exide US (through its earlier version and
predecessor in interest) and Chloride Group Plc (the UK company which
was consolidated and of which Exide US became the main shareholder) is a
matter of record. Exide US established its acquisition of majority
shareholding in Chloride Group Plc, through documents (Ex. DW-1/29 to
Ex. DW-1/33). That Exide US had to divest itself of that shareholding,
because of the Anti-Trust laws prevailing in the US and on account of the
ruling of the US District Court of New York (dated 24.11.1947) is also a
matter of record; the plaintiff/Exide India‟s line of questioning in this
regard, with respect to Ex. DW-1/35, the said ruling, makes this evident.
This ruling led to the Harvey Agreement, which resulted in Exide US being
kept away from the Indian market. Furthermore, Exide US had relied on
extensive documentary evidence (especially Ex. DW-1/44, DW-1/45 and
DW-1/50) upon which its witness was cross-examined comprehensively by
Exide India‟s counsel. These documents showed that Exide US had
registered the EXIDE trademark in US in 1901/1932. It had also relied on
the stylized version of the mark "Exide" (               )   which was created-
according to it- in 1904. This was registered as a mark in 1916 (Ex. DW-

 1/49 and DW-1/57). These facts prove that Exide US all along had interest
in the EXIDE mark. It was apparently trading in India, together with
Chloride Group Plc, the UK Company. Exide US in fact owned Chloride
Group- to a large measure.
</p>
<p id="p_83">52.    Other documentary evidence is relied upon by Exide US, to say that
its goods were sold through a common distributor, i.e F&amp; C Osler.
Advertisements to establish this fact were produced- in the form of
publication in "The Statesman": Ex. DW-1/52, Ex. DW-1/54; Ex. DW-1/55
and Ex. DW-1/56). There is material (Ex. DW-1/10) even to show that
Exide batteries (of Exide US) were supplied to light up the Taj Mahal, in the
early twentieth century. Ex. DW-1/52, Ex. DW-1/54; Ex. DW-1/55 reveal
that the representation made - in the advertisment- was that Exide batteries
of the US company were supplied by Chloride Group (the UK company)
and F &amp; C Osler. This in the opinion of the Court discloses profusion of
objective material to say that Exide batteries, manufactured by Exide US
were not only known in India, but marketed as such. What is important is
that at that stage- indeed till 1947 - there appears no conflict; Chloride
Group plc (maybe because of Exide US‟ position as its dominant
shareholder or other commercial reasons) never asserted that Exide US did
not have any right to market batteries in India under the trademark EXIDE.
</p>
<p id="p_84">53.    A significant argument made by Exide India is that till 1940, there
was no Trademark law in India and that the UK company (Chloride Group)
got the mark EXIDE registered in UK for the first time in 1902 and after the
first enactment came into force, had it registered sometime in 1942. This
fact is used to assert that with the coming into force of the Trademark Act in




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                       Page 35
 India, it was Chloride Group Plc and not Exide US which applied for the
mark (Ex. PW-2/1 and Ex. P-121). Exide India further states that this
trademark which existed in Chloride Group‟s favour, agreed to transfer and
assign various EXIDE trademarks to Exide India. This agreement was
produced as Ex. P-114. On 22.09.1980, the mark EXIDE was registered in
favour of Exide India, in Class 9: this was borne by Ex. P-112 and Ex. P-
</p><p id="p_85">117. Now, to say that its use of the trademark for the previous period (as a
licensee), crystallized into that of a full owner, Exide India relies on the
assignment documents (notably, Ex. P-126 and 128). The former is a crucial
document, which assigns "absolutely" the trademark rights of the previous
owner, Chloride Group Plc. Now, interestingly, the assignment deed (Ex. P-
</p><p id="p_86">126) does not assign the goodwill in the mark, which means that the
previous owner retained all residual rights arising out of use of mark in
India. This is apparent from the following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_32">       "that the Assignor doth hereby assign transfer and convey each and
       all the said trademarks unto the Assignee and all the right title and
       interest of the Assignor to and in the said trademarks TO HAVE AND
       TO HOLD the said trademarks to the Assignee absolutely."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_87">There is no indication that the goodwill in the mark was assigned or
transferred to the plaintiff Exide India.
</p>
<p id="p_88">54.    There is authority for the proposition that transfer, through assignment
of a registered trademark, without goodwill, does not confer exclusive rights.
It is possible for the assignor to claim the proprietary interest and all residual
rights which might arise out of exclusion of goodwill, from the assignment.
In the matter of an Application by Cranbux Ltd etc. (1928 (45) PTC 281) is




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                          Page 36
 an authority for the proposition that it is possible for a trademark owner to
retain goodwill in one territory, even without having a place of business
("The existence of a goodwill within Great Britain is of course perfectly
consistent with the possibility of the owner of the business having no place
of business within Great Britain"). That decision is also authority for the
proposition that the construction of an assignment deed is necessary to
decide whether the goodwill in the mark stands assigned.
</p>
<p id="p_89">55.     Habib Bank (supra, cited by Exide US) bears close scrutiny for the
purposes of this case. In that decision, the facts were somewhat similar.
Simply put, HBO was an overseas entity of HBL; the latter being a Pakistani
Bank. HBO had incorporated HBZ, in Switzerland and had some
shareholding in it. HBO had established a branch in the UK. Later, HBZ
also established a branch. Upon nationalization of HBO and HBL,
injunction was sought against HBZ from using the term and mark "Habib
Bank" on the ground that it amounted to a misrepresentation. It was held
that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">        "The proposition that a nationalisation decree which deprives
        individuals in a foreign jurisdiction of their control of a foreign
        company can have the effect of forcing those individuals to give up the
        use of a name which they have lawfully adopted and are lawfully
        using in another jurisdiction is one which, in any event, I find a little
        startling, and Mr. Jeffs has addressed to us, under his cross notice, an
        argument that the English Court will not prevent a company lawfully
        incorporated abroad from honestly using its corporate name in
        connection with a business carried on here."

<p id="p_90">56.     As a matter of detail, it would be necessary to notice here that cases
involving reorganization of businesses and corporations on account of




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 37
 expansion, mergers, takeovers and the problems arising from such events,
due to use of shared properties, particularly trademarks have been
considered in other decisions too. In Scandecor Development AB v
Scandecor Marketing AB (1999 FSR 26) reorganization and business
relationships resulted in expiration of a commercial arrangement; in the
meanwhile the rights over the mark were assigned. However, goodwill of
the overseas corporation was not assigned. The question was if the goodwill
acquired by the local company (a subsidiary) belonged to the overseas
trademark owner. The Court of appeal ruled as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">       "It may happen, as observed by Oliver L.J. in Habib Bank Ltd v.
       Habib Bank AG Zurich [1982] R.P.C. 1 at pages 20 and 30, that the
       goodwill in a mark is "shared" in the sense that an internationally
       known business based abroad, which establishes a branch in this
       country as part of that international organisation, does not case to be
       entitled to its existing goodwill because there is also a goodwill in the
       local branch. In that situation it would be correct to assert that the
       international organisation retains its existing "international"
       goodwill and that the newly created branch or subsidiary company
       has a local goodwill in the business carried on by it in this country--
       at the very least for the purpose of protecting it against injury by third
       parties.</blockquote>

<p id="p_91">       (2) The goodwill established by S Ltd in the United Kingdom
       remained exclusively associated with S Ltd on the consensual
       partition of the Scandecor business in 1979 on territorial lines--and
       that has been the position ever since. It did not cease to be the
       goodwill of S Ltd in consequence of both trademarks remaining
       registered in the name of SIAB or because those marks were
       thereafter licensed to S Ltd and SIAB in respect of calendars and

       similar products, as well as posters. SIAB had no pre-existin goodwill




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 38
        in the United Kingdom which it could licence to S Ltd. S Ltd was
       already entitled to that goodwill."
</p>
<p id="p_92">57.    To reiterate the relevant facts here, Exide US coined the mark; entered
into an arrangement whereby the Chloride Group of UK was given trading
rights by virtue of the Harvey agreement-a document produced as Ex. DW-
1/28. The Chloride group of companies in UK was entitled to trade in this
part of the British Empire. Exide US used to market its products right up to
1960, it had a common distributor, M/s Osler &amp; Co. Exide US has placed on
record several documents in support of its contentions in this regard. It has
also shown that the US District Court at New York issued an anti-trust
injunction restraining the operation of the Harvey Agreement, which
resulted in a trade embargo. This decree was issued on 24.11.1947 (Ex.
DW1/35); it resulted in the divesting of Exide US‟s shareholding in
Electrical Storage Company Ltd. This development is significant, because
the plaintiff is absolutely silent on it; in fact it derives and claims rights
through a predecessor, who in turn traced its right to the Chloride Electrical
Storage Co. Ltd. The decree was an involuntary action, which Exide US
could not help. The embargo operated right up to 1984; only on 17.12.1984,
the decree of 1947 was vacated (Ex. DW1/36).
</p>
<p id="p_93">58.    In this court‟s opinion, therefore, there was sufficient material on the
record showing that Exide US, the defendant had a bona fide use claim to
use of the mark. Till the US Federal Court injunciton operated, it was not in
a position to use the mark in India; before that, it did: indeed the commercial
operations adopted by it were such that the agent, F&amp; C Osler marketed its
products till the mid nineteen sixties. Exide US‟s worldwide reputation too




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 39
 was proved on the record, through the copious documentary evidence which
the single judge, erred in ignoring.
</p>
<p id="p_94">59.    The material on record also shows that the single judge fell into error
in holding that transnational or global reputation of Exide US was not
pleaded. On this, the authorities are clear that so long as the parties are left
without doubt as to what is required to be traversed, inexactitude in the plea
is not a bar; it is the substance of the pleading that matter, rather than the
text. The Supreme Court held so, in Konda Lakshmana Bapuji v Govt of
A.P.AIR 2002 SC 1012 that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">       "..it is a settled position that if the parties have understood the
       pleadings of each other correctly, an issue was also framed by the
       Court, the parties led evidence in support of their respective cases,
       then the absence of a specific plea would be no difference."

<p id="p_95">In Nedunari Kameshwaramma v Sampati v Sampati Subba Rao: [1963]

       refute that this was a Karnikam service inam. No doubt, no issue was
       framed, and the one, which was framed, could have been more
       elaborate; but since the parties went to trial fully knowing the rival
       case and led all the evidence not only in support of their contentions

       evidence and had an opportunity to produce evidence or cross
       examine witnesses in relation to the said issue, no objection as to
       want of specific pleading can be permitted to be raised later..."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">60.    In the present case, both prior use and transnational reputation was
averred by the defendant Exide US, in the following manner (in Para 21 of
the amended written statement):
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">               "21. Paragraph 21 as stated is denied. The first Defendant is
               called the Exide Corporation and the second Defendant is a
               subsidiary of the first defendant. In the advertisements referred
               in Paragraph 21 the factual position was reflected. The first
               Defendant was using its own name, which it had adapted in the
               year 1980. The Plaintiff has admittedly adopted the name Exide
               Industries Limited only in the year 1995. The first Defendant is
               the first adopteer and user of the trademark and trade name
               „Exide‟ worldwide and is entitled to use its own name and
               trademark in whatever advertisement it wishes to put out in the
               Media."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">61.    The last issue is that whether suppression of material facts relating to
the prior history of Exide US‟s use of the trademark disentitles the plaintiff
to the relief of permanent injunction, were it to be held to have been entitled
to it. The single judge ruled that though permanent injunction is a
discretionary remedy, in a given case, a plaintiff cannot be denied it, if
material facts are suppressed and that the doctrine operates only at the stage




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                         Page 41
 of grant of temporary or interim relief. This understanding, in our opinion, is
erroneous. The grant of permanent injunction is discretionary and not
compulsive. Indeed, Section 41 (of the <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_47">Specific Relief Act</a>), which contains
a "negative list" so to say, of situations where injunction can be refused,
clearly declares, in <a href="/doc/1436285/" id="a_48">Section 41</a> (i) that a court can refuse to issue injunction
"when the conduct of the plaintiff or his agents has been such as to
disentitle him to the assistance of the court". This necessity of disclosing
material facts and not practicing deception upon the court was emphasized
in <a href="/doc/100486606/" id="a_49">Maria Margarida Sequeira Fernandes vs Erasmo Jack De Sequeira</a> 2012
(5) SCC 370. To the same effect, is the reasoning in <a href="/doc/172581091/" id="a_50">Vidur Impex and
Traders (P) Ltd. v. Tosh Apartments (P) Ltd</a>. 2012 (8) SCC 384. It is
therefore held that the plaintiff Exide India‟s omission to aver the
background of circumstances relating to the acquisition of trademark rights
in respect of Exide was fatal to its suit. This point is therefore, held against
Exide India.

<p id="p_96">62.    Exide US proposed use of the mark „PRESTOLITE‟ to market its
products in India. The injunction sought by Exide India was to prevent them
from using anything describing the origin, or their link with Exide US‟s
corporate name and the fact that PRESTOLITE has links with Exide. The
documentary evidence overwhelmingly points to Exide US‟s predecessors
using the mark, in an unbroken manner in India for nearly half a decade; it
also shows that Exide US was compelled by reason of the US Court‟s
injunction to stop business in India for about three decades. Furthermore the
documentary materials show that the title to the mark was prima facie
obtained by the plaintiff, Exide India - however goodwill attached to the




RFA (OS) 113/2012                                                        Page 42
 mark was not parted by the plaintiff‟s predecessors. This Court, therefore,
holds that the Appellants/Exide US did not infringe the mark, or attempt to
pass off a mark over which they had no right. Their use of the word Exide
was, in the circumstances both bona fide and legitimately concurrent.
Furthermore they had, by reason of the transnational reputation pleaded and
proved, right to use it in India. The Appellants may describe the existing
relationship between the first defendant/Exide US and second Appellant
below the mark suitably. The suit for infringement and passing off has to
fail. Since the material on record shows that the plaintiffs are registered
owners of the mark, the counter claim cannot succeed; however, as to the
right of the plaintiff to the registered trademark, the issue is left to the final
decision of the IPAB.
