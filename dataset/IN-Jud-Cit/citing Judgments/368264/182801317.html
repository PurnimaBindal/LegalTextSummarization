<p id="p_1">1.     The plaintiff has filed the present suit for permanent injunction
restraining infringement of trademark, passing off, dilution of
trademarks, damages, delivery up etc. against the defendants.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     By this order, I propose to decide the pending application under
Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC being I.A. No. 2402/2010 filed by the
plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     The plaintiff's case as per the plaint is as under:
</p><p id="p_4">(i)    The plaintiff is a hospitality holding corporation originally set up
       in 1939 as a non-profit association under the name Quality
       Courts United, and became Choice Hotels International, Inc. on
       25th July 1990. The plaintiff's business consists of franchising,

         promoting and licensing high quality hotel services in various
        countries of the world.
</p><p id="p_5">(ii)    It is claimed that the plaintiff is one of the world's largest and
        most successful lodging franchisors with more than 5,800
        hotels, providing exceptional services and amenities to
        travellers in over 40 countries across the world. The plaintiff
        established a joint venture Company, Quality Inns India Private
        Limited as a master franchisee in India in 1987 and became
        Choice Hospitality (India) Private Ltd.
</p><p id="p_6">(iii)   In India, the plaintiff is holding several trademark registrations
        for its various brands such as Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites,
        Clarion, Quality, Sleep Inn, MainStay Suites, Econo Lodge and
        Rodeway Inn.

</pre><p id="p_8">(iv)   The plaintiff's website www.choicehotelsindia.com which has
       been functional since the year 2000 is an invaluable vehicle of
       the plaintiff's online business and a powerful marketing tool
       which is effectively used to advertise and promote its brands
       particularly, COMFORT, CLARION, QUALITY and SLEEP INN.
       The plaintiff's website is a powerful medium of communication
       that has spread the awareness and reputation of its brands.
</p><p id="p_9">(v)    The plaintiff enjoys extensive goodwill and reputation in India in
       relation to its business of franchising hotels, temporary
       accommodation and lodging services and its success in this
       field is self evident from the widespread geographical presence
       of its services in India. It is submitted that in particular the
       plaintiff has   a substantial reputation in the trademark
       COMFORT INN used by itself and with suffixes as:
        Comfort Inn Sunset - Ahmedabad
        Comfort Inn Vijay Residency - Bangalore
        Comfort Inn Hawa Mahal - Jaipur
        Comfort Inn Heritage - Mumbai
        Comfort Inn Marina Towers - Chennai
        Comfort Inn President - Ahmedabad
        Comfort Inn City Park - Hyderabad
        Comfort Inn Lucknow - Lucknow



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                            Page 3 of 65</span>
         Comfort Inn The President - Delhi
        Comfort Inn Saurabh - Haldwani
        Comfort Inn GSK - Amritsar
               Besides, the said trademark/service mark of the plaintiff
       appears prominently in websites, travel brochures, letter heads,
       catalogues and other print media elevating the COMFORT INN
       trademark to a famous and well known trademark.
</p><p id="p_10">(vi)   The plaintiff's COMFORT brand for hotels, which was adopted
       and first used in 1981, is one of the most popular of its brands.
       COMFORT INN is currently the fifth largest lodging chain in the
       United States. Hotels under COMFORT formative trademarks
       are operating through plaintiff No.2 in India since at least 1991.
       There are over 2500 properties under the well known
       COMFORT brand (Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Comfort Hotel,
       Comfort Inn &amp; Suites, Comfort Resort, Comfort Hotel &amp; Suites)
       worldwide, and include over 1600 COMFORT INN hotels
       worldwide of which 11 are located in India.
</p><p id="p_11">(vii) The plaintiff's chain of hotels, including the mark COMFORT
       INN is advertised widely in magazines and newspapers having
       circulation in India. Apart from websites, readers and potential
       customers, inter alia in India, can thus find information on the
       plaintiff's hotels from magazines such as OAG Travel Planner
       (Europe and Pacific Asia editions), Caterer and Hotel Weekly,
       TTG Japan, Asia Travel Trade, Business Traveller, The
       International Directory, The News Releases of World Travel
       Market and such other easily available publications. Besides,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                           Page 4 of 65</span>
        magazines such as Hotels and Restaurants International which
       keep the hotel industry up to date with all the developments in
       the major chains of hotels worldwide feature articles on the
       plaintiff regularly.
</p><p id="p_12">               The plaintiff has advertised its products and services
       through national media and satellite television channels and the
       consolidated advertisement expenses of the plaintiff since the
       year 2004 are as follows:
</p><pre id="pre_3">                             YEAR              AMOUNT (Rs. in crores)
                             2006                  3,050,586,107.25
                             2007                  3,752,364,131.93

(viii) The     plaintiff's    global   gross   sales   revenue   under      the
</pre><p id="p_13">       trademark/trade name/trading style COMFORT INN since 2004
       demonstrating the extent of goodwill and reputation accruing to
       its business are as follows:
</p><pre id="pre_4">                             YEAR              AMOUNT (Rs. in crores)
                             2007                 59,779,870,072.99
                             2008                 62,110,221,193.49


</pre><p id="p_14">               In addition to all the above, the plaintiff has been doing
       extensive business on the Internet under the domain name
       www.choicehotels.com and www.comfortinn.com and has
       offered internet reservation services since as far back as 1995.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                               Page 5 of 65</span>
<p id="p_15">        The said websites are used for aggressive engagements in
       business on the internet for providing exhaustive information on
       the plaintiff's group of hotels.   Online reservations are also
       facilitated by this website hence it is a fully interactive website
       for the purpose of e-commerce. The website contains several
       other features such as a site map, a search engine, details of
       the plaintiff company, reward programs and offers &amp; programs
       etc.
</p><p id="p_16">(ix)   The trademark COMFORT INN has acquired a high degree of
       distinctiveness due to long, continuous and extensive use so
       much as that COMFORT, COMFORT INN and COMFORT
       formative are among the most widely protected of the plaintiff's
       brands registered in over 143 countries across five continents.
       The plaintiff owns trademark registrations for its trademark
       COMFORT INN in over 40 countries. These registrations
       evidence the recognition of distinctiveness of the said
       trademark and the exclusive proprietorship of the plaintiff in
       these countries. Thus the common law proprietary rights and
       statutory rights of the plaintiff combine to make the said
       trademark strong and well known. The trademarks COMFORT/
       COMFORT INN enjoys a unique place in the hospitality
       industry worldwide and conveys an implicit assurance to
       consumers and the trade of a single source of origin and a
       certain degree of expectation of quality and consistency of the
       services under this mark.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                            Page 6 of 65</span>
<p id="p_17"> 4.     The plaintiff submits that on account of its priority in adoption,
use and registration, and its exclusive rights as the proprietor of the
trademark COMFORT INN in the hospitality sector the adoption or
use of the mark COMFORT INN or any deceptively similar mark in
relation to identical or cognate services will not only cause confusion
and deception but will also be contrary to the protection required to
be afforded to a well-known mark, and dilute its indication of a single
source.
</p><p id="p_18">Plaintiff's case against the defendants
</p><p id="p_19">5.     Defendant No.1 is the Managing Director and key person of
operations of defendant No.2, HOTEL RAJ COMFORT INN, located
at Paradise Circle, Secunderabad (AP). Defendants are using the
trade name / trademark COMFORT INN for a hotel in Secunderabad,
Andhra Pradesh.
</p><p id="p_20">6.     The plaintiff served a cease and desist notice dated 2nd April
2009 cautioning defendants of the plaintiff's legal rights and calling
upon them to refrain from using plaintiff's trademark/ service mark
COMFORT INN and/or COMFORT or other deceptively similar
marks,         to      discontinue      use      of     their       website
www.hotelrajcomfortinn.com to remove any reference to the plaintiff's
trademark and to carry out appropriate changes in its trade name so
as to render it dissimilar and distinguishable from the plaintiff's mark.
</p><p id="p_21">7.     On 18th April 2009 the defendants sent a reply through their
counsel acknowledging receipt of the plaintiff's cease &amp; desist notice
and attempted to justify their adoption and use of the mark
COMFORT          INN   as   being    bonafide   and   not   amounting          to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                              Page 7 of 65</span>
 infringement. The defendants further denied having any knowledge of
the plaintiff's well known status in the hospitality business or of their
reputation. It is stated by the plaintiff that the defendants neither
carried out a trademark search for the marks COMFORT
INN/COMFORT before naming their hotel as RAJ COMFORT INN
nor exercised due diligence especially when the existence of the
plaintiff's hotel 'Comfort Inn City Park' located at Chirag Ali Lane,
Abids, Hyderabad, could not have escaped their attention.              The
defendants admitted to being relatively recent users of the impugned
mark and subsequent to the plaintiff's HOTEL COMFORT INN CITY
PARK in Hyderabad which opened in the year 2006.
</p><p id="p_22">8.     It is averred by the plaintiff that the defendants are deemed to
have adopted the impugned mark not with bonafide intention but in
order to encash the reputation of the plaintiff's business and pass off
their hotel as that of the plaintiff.     Further, the plaintiff's said
trademark being a registered and well-known one in India in the hotel
industry as it is stated that such use is unauthorized use by the
defendants without any cause in order to take unfair advantage and
to tarnish the distinctive character of the plaintiff's registered
trademarks. The use of the impugned mark comprising of the word
COMFORT is per se an infringement of the plaintiff's statutory rights
in the trademarks COMFORT &amp; Design under No. 502842B (class
</p><p id="p_23">16), COMFORT INN under No.454036 (class 16), CS COMFORT
SUITES &amp; Design under No. 1238101 (class 42) and COMFORT
Wave &amp; Design under No. 1361095 (class 42), COMFORT INN with
Device under No. 1361094 (class 42), COMFORT INN &amp; SUITES


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                           Page 8 of 65</span>
 with Device under No. 1462362 (class 42) and COMFORT INN &amp;
SUITES under No. 1462363 (class 42).
</p><p id="p_24">       Further it is averred that the operation of the website
www.hotelrajcomfortinn.com which wholly incorporates the plaintiff's
trademarks COMFORT / COMFORT INN is also an infringement of
the plaintiff's rights and calculated to pass off the defendants'
business and services as and for those of the plaintiff.          This is
substantiated by the fact that the defendants on their own admission
have a prior existing hotel named hotel RAJ CLASSIC INN since
1995. However, they have opened another hotel under an infringing
mark/name comprising COMFORT INN which is used in essential
manner in order to confuse the tourists. The defendants are thus
aware about the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff and intend to
cause deception and/or confusion in the mind of consumers.
</p><p id="p_25">9.     The website of the defendants at www.hotelrajcomfortinn.com
has served to further expand the scope of infringement of the
plaintiff's rights by its wide reach and the fact that this gives
information about its services, list of facilities, etc. with an online
information form and email address to invite bookings from
anywhere. With the undeniable reach of businesses due to internet
access and dissemination of information all over the world, the
defendants' use of the name hotel RAJ COMFORT INN would be
mistaken for or believed to be associated with the plaintiff's business
under the trademark COMFORT INN and misrepresent the
defendant's hotel to be from the same origin as the plaintiffs' hotels.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                           Page 9 of 65</span>
<p id="p_26"> 10.      It is alleged by the plaintiff that the use of the trademark
COMFORT INN by the defendants as a part of their trading style and
trade name is highly misleading to travel agents and customers. The
continued use of the impugned mark will dilute the strength of the
plaintiff's trademark in the hospitality industry and thus diminish its
value which has been created over long years of sustained effort and
commitment to brand values. The defendants are conducting their
business in the same place as one of the chain of hotels of the
plaintiffs, which fact is also likely to lead the general public to
associate the defendant's hotel RAJ COMFORT INN with the
plaintiffs' COMFORT brand hotels.
</p><p id="p_27">Defendants' case in the written statement
</p><p id="p_28">11.      In the written statement filed by the defendants, the defendants
have contended that the suit is not maintainable. As per the
defendants, the question of infringement does not arise as the
plaintiff is claiming infringement and other reliefs against the
defendants on the basis of its alleged registered trademark "Comfort
Inn" in Class 16, which class pertains to paper and paper products.
However, defendants are not involved in any activity relating to class
16, therefore, there is no question of any infringement under the said
class.
</p><p id="p_29">         Further it is averred that though the plaintiff is also claiming
violation of its right on the word "Comfort" by virtue of registration in
class 42, plaintiff does not have any registration for the word
"Comfort Inn" in class 42, therefore, plaintiff cannot allege violation of
its right therein. It is averred by the defendants that the defendants


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                           Page 10 of 65</span>
 are using the word "Comfort Inn" in relation to the services in class 42
in respect of which the plaintiff has no registered trademark,
therefore, suit for infringement is not maintainable and liable to be
dismissed.
</p><p id="p_30">12.    It is contended that the plaintiff has relied upon registration
certificates under Form 2 which cannot be used in legal proceedings.
Plaintiff has not filed copy of the entry in register as required under
Section 137 of the Trademarks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as
"the Act") to prove its registration.
</p><p id="p_31">13.    Further, the defendants are carrying on their business at
Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. They neither actually nor voluntarily
reside and/or carry on business nor personally work for gain within
the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. Therefore this Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain and decide the present suit. Also, the website
of the defendants is not interactive. Though the plaintiff has referred
to the website of the defendants, plaintiff has not pleaded or
produced any evidence to prima facie show that some commercial
transaction was entered into by the defendants with a user of
defendants' website resulting in any injury or harm. There is no cause
of action for the suit to be maintainable in Delhi.
</p><p id="p_32">14.    It is averred that the defendants are using the trade name
"Hotel Raj Comfort Inn" since the year 2005 in a bonafide manner.
The word "Raj" is defendants' family name, while "Comfort" and "Inn"
are descriptive words that describe a comfortable hotel. Both the
latter words are common dictionary words and widely used in the
hotel and hospitality industry, which are inherently incapable of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                         Page 11 of 65</span>
 distinctiveness. The plaintiff cannot claim exclusivity or proprietary
rights over these words. It is further averred that the plaintiff has not
pleaded that the said words have acquired a secondary meaning in
connection with their services.
</p><p id="p_33">15.    It is also averred that there is inordinate delay in filing the suit
as the plaintiff was aware of the defendants and also in Para 15 of
the plaint the plaintiff stated that it owns "Hotel Raj Comfort Inn City
Park" at Hyderabad, which opened in the year 2006. It is averred that
the suit is hit by principle of latches and is liable to be dismissed. All
the other averments made by the plaintiff in the plaint are denied and
disputed by the defendants in their written statement.
</p><p id="p_34">16.    The plaintiff in the replication filed to the written statement has
stated that the trademark of the plaintiff COMFORT INN                  is a
registered trademark under Class 16 which relates to paper and
paper products. Plaintiff has travel brochures, letter heads,
catalogues and other print media which promotes the trademark
COMFORT INN. Also, COMFORT INN as a trademark had been
applied for registration to the Trade Marks Registry by the plaintiff
and the objection period of 4 months thereunder had expired in June,
2010. Therefore, the contention of the defendants that the suit for
infringement is not maintainable is baseless. All the other averments
made by the defendants in the written statement are denied and
disputed by the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_35">17.    The learned counsel for the defendants during the course of
hearing has not denied the fact that the plaintiff is the prior adopter
and user of the mark COMFORT INN. It is also denied that the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                            Page 12 of 65</span>
 plaintiff was earlier having COMFORT INN in Hyderabad and the
defendants have started using the said name being aware about the
COMFORT INN of the plaintiff. Admittedly the plaintiff is having the
registered trademark COMFORT in class 42 in respect of hotel and
motel services and the trademark COMFORT INN has been
protected by this Court from time to time by passing the interim
orders and final decrees.
</p><p id="p_36">18.    In case the entire arguments and pleading of the defendants
are examined in a meaning manner, it is evident that the defendants'
have taken the following defences :
</p><p id="p_37">(i)   No infringement as plaintiff is not holding registered
      trademark Comfort Inn in Class 42.
</p><p id="p_38">(ii) Comfort Inn is not distinctive mark, hence no passing off.
</p><p id="p_39">(iii) Honest adoption of the mark Comfort Inn by the defendants.
</p><p id="p_40">(iv) No similarity between Comfort Inn and Raj Comfort Inn,
      hence no confusion.
</p><p id="p_41">(v) Delay and latches for bringing action.
</p><p id="p_42">(vi) No territorial jurisdiction of this Court.
</p><p id="p_43">19.    First, I shall take the issue of infringement of trademark. The
defendant has not denied that the plaintiff is holding the registered
trademark Comfort Inn in Class 16. The plaintiff is also registered
proprietor of the trademark Comfort in Class 42. The said trademark
is registered prior to the adoption and user of the defendants'
trademark. On the date of user, it is evident that the defendants were
aware about the name of the plaintiff being in the same trade.

</p><p id="p_45">20.    Before I proceed to decide this issue, it is imperative to discuss
Section 29 of the Act that envisages the law relating to infringement
of a registered trademark and Section 28 of the Act that provides for
exclusive rights granted by virtue of registration. The said provisions
read as under:-

            (1) A registered trade mark is infringed by a person
                who, not being a registered proprietor or a person
                using by way of permitted use, uses in the course
                of trade, a mark which is identical with, or
                deceptively similar to, the trade mark in relation to
                goods or services respect of which the trade mark
                is registered and in such manner as to render the
                use of the mark likely to be taken as being used
                as a trade mark.

to cause confusion not deception or to cause any association with the
registered trade mark.

<p id="p_46"> 22.    This Court in the recent case has discussed the aspect of
determination of the well-known trade mark in the case of
<a href="/doc/115682582/" id="a_1">Bloomberg Finance LP vs. Prafull Saklecha &amp; Ors</a>., 2013 (56)
PTC 243 (Del) wherein was observed in Para 32-44, and 51 that :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_27">      "32. Section 29 of the TM Act contemplates the
      owner/proprietor of the registered trade mark alleging
      infringement of the said mark by another person who is
      neither a registered proprietor in relation to the goods and
      services for which the mark is registered, nor has
      permission to use such mark in the course of his trade.
      Under Section 29(1) infringement results if the mark is
      "identical with or deceptively similar to" the registered trade
      mark and is in relation to the goods and services for which
      the trademark has been registered. The use of infringing or
      impugned mark must render it "likely to be taken as being
      used as a trade mark".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      33.    Under Section 29(2)(a) infringement occurs where
      the impugned mark is identical with the registered
      trademark and the goods or service for which the
      impugned mark is being used is similar to the goods and
      services covered by the registered mark. Under
      Section 29(2)(b) infringement occurs where the impugned
      mark is similar to the registered mark and the goods and
      the services for which is used is identical with or similar to
      the goods and services for which the registered mark is
      used. Under Section 29(2)(c) infringement occurs where
      the impugned trade mark is identical to the registered trade
      mark and the goods or services for which the impugned
      mark is used is also identical to the goods/services covered
      by the registered trade mark.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      34.     An additional requirement in the above three
      situations for infringement to result is that the use of the
      impugned trademark "is likely to cause confusion on the
      part of the public" or "is likely to have an association with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                            Page 18 of 65</span>
       the registered trade mark". Under Section 29(3) when the
      impugned trademark is identical to the registered
      trademark and the goods/services for which it is used are
      also identical to the goods or services for which the
      registration has been granted then "the Court shall
      presume that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of
      the public".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      35.     Therefore, under Section 29(1), (2) and (3) for
      infringement to result (i) the impugned mark has to be
      either similar to or identical with the registered mark and (ii)
      the goods or services for which the impugned mark is sued
      has to also either be identical with or similar to the goods or
      services for which registration has been granted. The
      scenario is different as regards Section 29(4) of the TM Act
      1999. For infringement to result under Section 29(4), the
      following conditions are required to be fulfilled :

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">            (i) the person using the impugned mark is neither a
            registered proprietor in relation to the goods and

            it by way of permitted use

            India;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">            (vi) the use of the impugned mark is without due
            cause, and takes unfair advantage of or is
            detrimental to,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                             Page 19 of 65</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">             (a) the distinctive character of the registered trade
            mark; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_38">            (b) the reputation of the registered trade mark.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_39">      36.     The expression 'mark' has been defined in
      Section 2(m) of the TM Act to include "a device brand,
      heading, label, ticket, name, signature, word, letter,
      numeral, shape of goods, packaging or combination of
      colours or any combination thereof." (emphasis supplied)
      Therefore, for the purpose of Section 29(4), the use of a
      mark as part of a corporate name would also attract
      infringement. In other words, if the registered mark is used
      by a person, who is not the registered proprietor of such
      mark or a permitted user, as part of the corporate name
      under which he trades then also infringement would also
      result. What is however important is that the registered
      trade mark must be shown to have a reputation in India
      and should be shown to have been used by the infringer
      'without due cause". Further, it should be shown that such
      adoption or use has resulted in the infringer taking unfair
      advantage of the registered mark or is detrimental to the
      distinctive character or repute of the registered trade mark.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">      37.      Section 29(4) is also distinct from Section 29(1) to
      (3) of the TM Act in another important aspect. The element
      of having to demonstrate the likelihood of confusion is
      absent. Perhaps to balance out this element, the legislature
      has mandated the necessity of showing that (a) the mark
      has a reputation in India (b) that the mark has a distinctive
      character (c) the use by the infringer is without due cause.
      In other words, the legislative intent is to afford a stronger
      protection to a mark that has a reputation without the
      registered proprietor of such mark having to demonstrate
      the likelihood of confusion arising from the use of an
      identical or similar mark in relation to dissimilar goods and
      services. The words 'detriment' in the context of the
      'distinctive character' of the mark brings in the concept of
      'dilution' and 'blurring'. In the context of 'repute' they are


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                             Page 20 of 65</span>
       also relatable to the concept of 'tarnishment' and
      'degradation'. The words "takes 'unfair advantage" refers to
      'free-riding' on the goodwill attached to mark which enjoys
      a reputation. The disjunctive 'or' between the words
      'distinctive character' and 'repute' is designedly inserted to
      cater to a situation where a mark may not have a distinctive
      character and yet may have a reputation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">      38.     Section 2(zg) of the TM Act defines a 'well known
      trade mark' in relation to any goods or services to mean 'a
      mark which has become so to the substantial segment of
      the public which uses such goods or receives such
      services that the use of such mark in relation to other
      goods or service would be likely to be taken as indicating a
      connection in the course of trade or rendering of services
      between those goods or services and a person using the
      mark in relation to the first-mentioned goods or services.'
      Under Section 11(9)(i) and (v), for the purposes of
      registration of a well-known mark it is not necessary for
      such mark to have been used in India or be well-known to
      the public at large in India. It must be well known to a
      substantial segment of the relevant public.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">      39.       It may not be necessary for the proprietor of a
      registered mark to show that it is a 'well-known trademark'
      as defined in Section 2(zg) although if in fact it is, it makes
      it easier to satisfy the 'reputation' requirement of Section
      29(4) of the TM Act. The presumption of distinctiveness
      attached to a registered mark is a rebuttable one. At the
      interim stage, either of these elements should be shown
      prima facie to exist. Whether in fact these elements are
      satisfied would depend on the evidence led by the parties
      at trial.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">      40.    It may be noticed at this stage that even prior to the
      TM Act 1999 the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_2">N.R. Dongre v.
      Whirlpool Corporation</a> 1996 PTC (16) recognised the
      concept of cross-border reputation when it upheld the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                            Page 21 of 65</span>
       decision of the Division Bench of this Court which granted
      a temporary injunction in favour of a Plaintiff based abroad.
      The Division Bench of this Court followed the decision in
      <a href="/doc/1607318/" id="a_3">Apple Computer Inc. vs. Apple Leasing &amp; Industries</a> 1992
      (1) ALR 93, and held that it was not necessary to insist that
      a particular plaintiff must carry on business in a jurisdiction
      before improper use of its name or mark can be restrained
      by the court. The main consideration was "the likelihood of
      confusion and consequential injury to the plaintiff and the
      need to protect the public from deception. Where such
      confusion is prima facie shown to exist, protection should
      be given by courts to the name or mark".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      41.     Turning to Section 29(5) of the TM Act 1999, it is
      seen that it relates to a situation where (i) the infringer uses
      the registered trademark "as his trade name or part of his
      trade name, or name of his business concern or part of the
      name, of his business concern" and (ii) the business
      concern or trade is in the same goods or services in
      respect of which the trade mark is registered. If the
      owner/proprietor of the registered trade mark is able to
      show that both the above elements exist then an injunction
      restraining order the infringer should straightway follow.
      This is in the nature of a per se or a 'no-fault' provision
      which offers a higher degree of protection where both the
      above elements are shown to exist. For the purpose of
      Section 29(5) of the TM Act 1999, there is no requirement
      to show that the mark has a distinctive character or that
      any confusion is likely to result from the use by the infringer
      of the registered mark as part of its trade name or name of
      the business concern.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">      42.    However, in a situation where the first element is
      present and not the second then obviously the requirement
      of Section 29(5) is not fulfilled. The question is whether in

      mark as part of that person's trade name or business name
      by explicitly providing that such action shall also constitute

      where the name of a company resembles a registered
      trade mark, then the registration of the company in that
      name can be refused. The ROC is expected to gather
      information from the TM Registry. Under Section 22(5) of
      the CA, the owner of the registered trade mark can apply to
      have the name of a company that is purportedly infringing
      the mark cancelled. All of this only strengthens the

      name of his business concern or part of the name, of his
      business concern" and (ii) the business concern or trade is
      in the same goods or services in respect of which the trade
      mark is registered.

      provision which offers a higher degree of protection where
      both the above elements are shown to exist. If the
      owner/proprietor of the registered trade mark is able to
      show that both the above elements exist then an injunction
      order restraining order the infringer should straightway
      follow. For the purpose of Section 29(5) of the TM Act 1999
      there is no requirement to show that the mark has a
      distinctive character or that any confusion is likely to result
      from the use by the infringer of the registered mark as part
      of its trade name or name of the business concern.

      present and not the second then obviously the requirement

      mark is used as part of the corporate name but the
      business of the infringer is in goods or services other than
      those for which the mark is registered, the owner or

<a href="/doc/984243/" id="a_15">Section 29</a> of the Act are that the plaintiff's mark must be registered
under the Act; the defendant's mark is identical with or deceptively
similar to the registered trademark; and the defendant's use of the
mark is in the course of trade in respect of the goods covered by the
registered trademark. The rival marks are to be compared as a
whole. Where two rival marks are identical, it is not necessary for the
plaintiff to prove further that the use of defendant's trademark is likely
to deceive and cause confusion as the registration shows the title of
the registered proprietor and the things speak for themselves. In an
infringement action, once a mark is used as indicating commercial
origin by the defendant, no amount of added matter intended to show
the true origin of the goods can effect the question. If Court finds that
the defendant's mark is closely, visually and phonetically similar,
even then no further proof is necessary.

present matter, there is also another fact of the matter as to whether
the trademark COMFORT and/or COMFORT INN of the plaintiff is
well-known trademark as alleged in the plaint.
</p><p id="p_50">26.    From the material placed on record, it is apparent that the
trademark Comfort Inn has been registered in many countries in the

by the Courts from time to time in respect of goods and services in
relation to classes in which the same is registered. It cannot be used
as a whole mark in relation to any goods/services.

dissimilar goods used by the defendant. Although, in the present
case, the plaintiff is also providing hospitality services, it is averred by
the defendants that COMFORT INN is registered under class 16 and
also holding few registrations under class 42 even may not be for
hotel services, while the defendants are using the same for hotel
services, in view of the Bloomberg Finance LP (supra) judgment,

</p><p id="p_54">PASSING OFF
</p><p id="p_55">29.    One of the essential ingredients is goodwill. The classic case of
passing off as it existed since its genesis always insist the existence
of goodwill of a merchant in order to give him a locally enforceable
right to sue for passing off. This has been explained by Kerly's in his
book called Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names (Fourteenth
Edition) (South Asian Edition 2007), wherein the concept of goodwill
has always been categorized as local in character and the learned
author observed thus:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">      "Since an essential ingredient of passing off is damage (or
      prospective damage) to goodwill, he (the Plaintiff) must show
      that he had, at the date when the Defendants started up, in
      this country not merely a reputation but a goodwill capable of
      being damaged. Goodwill, however, is local; it is situated
      where the business is. Thus a foreign claimant may have a
      reputation in this country-from travellers or periodicals of
      international circulation or, increasingly, from exposure on the
      Internet-yet still fail in an action for passing off because he
      has here no business and so no goodwill. Such cases have
      been not uncommon in recent years, and have caused


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                           Page 28 of 65</span>
       considerable difficulty. Where there is a substantial reputation
      here, our courts will often accept minimal evidence that a
      business exists here, but there has to be some".
</blockquote><p id="p_56">30.    This concept of goodwill and the insistence of localized
business has been traditional concept of passing off which
sometimes is called as classic case of passing off. However, this
concept of passing off has undergone changes due to advent of
technology and modernization. For the said reason the tendency to
insist localized goodwill has been transformed into proving reputation
of a global character. All this would mean that courts entertaining the
case of passing off can discount the localized existence of goodwill
and the business in the territory specific if the substantial nature of
reputation has been proved which has some kind of nexus in the
territory where the protection is sought and the said concept in the
modern language is called trans-border reputation whereas the
goodwill is always local in character, the concept of reputation is
dynamic and is all encompassing.
</p>
<p id="p_57">31.    The reputation of a person can transcend boundaries by virtue
of its advertisement in the newspapers, media circulation, expatriate
reputation due to cultural akinness and all other relevant factors
which connect one country's business with that of another. This has
been aptly explained by the Division Bench of this Court in the case
of <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_19">N.R.Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation</a>, AIR 1995 Delhi 300
wherein the concept of trans-border reputation was approved in the
following words:-
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                           Page 29 of 65</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_58">       "(25) Thus a product and its trade name transcend the
      physical boundaries of a geographical region and acquire a
      trans border or overseas or extraterritorial reputation not only
      though import of goods but also by its advertisement. The
      knowledge and the awareness of the goods of a foreign trade
      and its trade mark can be available at a place where goods
      are not being marketed and consequently not being used.
      The manner in which or the source from which the knowledge
      has been acquired is immaterial".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_58">32.    The said judgment of Whirlpool [supra] has been approved by
the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_20">N.R. Dongre and Ors. vs
Whirlpool Corpn. and Anr</a>., 1996 (2) ARB.LR 488 (SC) wherein the
exposition of law laid down by the Division Bench of this Court was
again reiterated. This exposition of 1996 in the case of Whirlpool
[supra] has been further revisited by the courts in India more
importantly in the case of <a href="/doc/1913188/" id="a_21">Allergan Inc. v. Milment Oftho
Industries</a>, 1999 PTC (19) (DB) 160 wherein Ruma Pal, J. has
carefully analyzed the interplay between the goodwill and reputation
in a case of passing off action and has laid down that the Courts in
India have followed the third approach which is a middle path wherein
strict insistence of localized business is not necessary. However,
reputation which is sought to be protected has to be substantial one
having global character. The observation made by Hon'ble Judge is
as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_59">      "13. Reputation is the connection that the public makes
      between a particular product or service and a particular
      source which may or may not be known. Some Courts have
      held that reputation which is built up on the basis of trade
      within the country is entitled to protection from passing off.

<blockquote id="blockquote_60">       Others Court have made some concession to the
      communication explosion and held that if the plaintiff has a
      reputation in another country, his right to the mark will be
      protected if it is coupled with some actual or proposed
      business activity within the country (See Alain Beniardin et
      Cie v. Pavilion Properties, (1967) RFC 581; Amway
      Corporation. v. Eurway Int. Ltd. (1974) RFC 82."Still other
      Courts have held that with the increase in international
      commerce, mass media communications and the frequency
      of the foreign travel, political and geographic boundaries do
      not stem the exchange of ideas and instant information. Local
      business is not an essential ingredient of a passing off action.
      However, the reputation must be well established or a known
      one See : Panhard et Levassor v. Panhard Motor Co. Ltd.,
      (1901) 18 RPC 405; Sheraton Corpn. v. Sheraton Motels,
      (1964) RPC 202; Orkin Exterminating Co. Tnd. v. Pest Co. of
      Canada (1985) 5 Canadian Patent Reporter 433; Vitamins L.
      D.'s Application for Trademark, 1956 (1) RPC 1. The
      decisions which reflect the first and second view have so held
      for reasons which are partly historic, partly geographic and
      partly because reputation was equated with goodwill.
      Goodwill has been defined as the benefit derived from
      reputation. It is not the reputation required to found a passing
      off action. The law of passing off is not trammelled by
      definitions of goodwill developed in the field of revenue law
      [per <a href="/doc/1831577/" id="a_22">Hockhart J., Conagra Inc. v. McCain Foods (Aust) P.
      Ltd</a>., 1993 (23) IPR 193 231]. It is an asset of a business
      assessable in terms of money and transferable (See IRC v.
      Muller, (1901) AC 217, Trego v. Hunt (1896) AC 7; ITC v.
      B.C. Srinivas Shetty. In my opinion reputation framing the
      basis of a passing off action need not be so localised.
      Whatever the compulsion for the Courts taking the first or
      second view in other countries, as far as this country is
      concerned, Courts in India prescribe to the third view and
      have held that a plaintiff with a reputation which is
      established internationally can sue to protect it in this country
      even if it does not have any business activity here. In other
      words reputation of a product may precede its introduction

approved by Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href="/doc/292146/" id="a_26">Milment Oftho
Industries v. Allergan Inc</a>., (2004) 12 SCC 624 presided by S.N.
Variava, J. wherein the Supreme court has laid down that :
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">      "It must also be remembered that nowadays goods are widely
      advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other
      media which is available in the country. This results in a
      product acquiring a worldwide reputation. Thus, if a mark in
      respect of a drug is associated with the Respondents
      worldwide it would lead to an anomalous situation if an
      identical mark in respect of a similar drug is allowed to be
      sold in India. However one note of caution must be
      expressed. Multinational corporations, who have no intention
      of coming to India or introducing their product in India should
      not be allowed to throttle an Indian Company by not
      permitting it to sell a product in India, if the Indian Company
      has genuinely adopted the mark and developed the product
      and is first in the market. Thus the ultimate test should be
      who is first in the market".

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">      "(9) In the present case, the marks are the same. They are in
      respect of pharmaceutical products. The mere fact that the
      Respondents have not been using the mark in India would be
      irrelevant if they were first in the world market. The Division
      bench had relied upon material which prima facie shows that
      the Respondents product was advertised before the
      Appellants entered the field. On the basis of that material the

       Division Bench has concluded that the Respondents were
      first to adopt the mark. If that be so then no fault can be found
      with the conclusion drawn by the Division Bench."
</blockquote><p id="p_61">34.    The Courts in India have started recognizing the global
character of the brand names and have started giving them
protection merely on the basis of global nature of reputation without
insisting any localized business which was significant departure from
the classic trinity laid down by Lord Diplock in the case of Erven
Warnink (Supra).       The position of law uptill Milment has been
followed that the Courts in India by placing reliance on the said
decision have proceeded to grant interim orders to the multi-nationals
having their brands which are of global character and prevented the
misuse of the said brands by protecting trans-border reputation
subject to fulfilling of essential characteristics necessary to prove
trans-border reputation. The decision in the case of Milment was
also rendered in the year 2004 when the impact of internet, e-
commerce, social media was yet to be seen and realized.

relating to trans-border reputation has been further strengthened and
has been taken to another level wherein the court has not merely

is interesting in academic sense. However, due to advent of internet
media, international travel, the insistence on the localized business
as well as trans-border reputation is nowadays more or less dealt
with in a kind of presumptive approach rather than by actual
establishment of the same. As the international businesses grow and
proximity between the markets would increase, over the time this
concept will become weaker and on one good day world will be
treated as one market.
</p><p id="p_65">37.    In the present case, it cannot be denied by the defendants that
the plaintiff earlier had a hotel in Hyderabad. The defendants have
adopted and used the mark Raj Comfort Inn after the use of the said
name by the plaintiff. They were aware about the goodwill and
reputation of the plaintiff at the time of adoption. It is totally immaterial
if    now    the     plaintiff   has   no   hotel   in   Hyderabad   as     the
travellers/consumes may still think that the defendants may have
some association with the plaintiff or they are using the similar name
with the consent/licenses of the plaintiff which is actually untrue.

<p id="p_66"> Thus, the plaintiff has made out a classic case of passing off. Even
on the transborder reputation and local business/hotel in other parts
of India.
</p><p id="p_67">38.    It is pertinent to mention here that similar issue of the plea
raised by the defendants was discussed by this Court in the case of
Madhubhan Holiday Inn Vs. Holiday Inn Inc., 100 (2002) DLT 306
where the plaintiff/ respondent company Holiday Inn Inc, a registered
company of United States of America had filed a case against the
defendants/appellants for adoption of the words "Holiday Inn" by the
appellants who had before "Holiday Inn", used prefix "Madhuban"
and "Kapoor" in their mark. It was held in appeal that adoption of the
words "Holiday Inn" by the appellants is ex facie fraudulent and
malafide from the very inception. The words "Holiday Inn" have been
adopted by the appellant to ride on the global reputation of the
respondent. The appellant was actuated by bad faith and dishonest
motive. In the facts and circumstances, the learned Single Judge was
fully justified in granting the injunction and decreeing the suits in
order to protect the commercial goodwill and to ensure that the global
business reputation of the respondent is not exploited by the
appellants in a clandestine manner. In this case of Madhubhan
Holiday Inn (supra), the Court referred to the following decisions:

       DLT 508. In this case the plaintiff Rainforest Cafe Inc has 37
       restaurants world wide and is planning to open many more
       restaurants throughout the globe and particularly in India. The
       plaintiff has advertised in the leading and premier magazines


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                         Page 35 of 65</span>
        and newspapers. It is mentioned in the plaint that the
       revenues/sales in 1997 and 1998 were to the tune of US $ 108
       millions and US $ 213 millions, respectively. It is also
       incorporated in the plaint that because of its success, largely
       because due to its particular unusual and novel name,
       ambience and decor of its outlets, its shares are even quoted
       on the New York Stock Exchange. It has its own web-site.
       Consequent to its phenomenal progress, the plaintiff has been
       receiving trade inquiries from all corners of world. The
       defendant opened a restaurant with the name of "Rainforest
       Cafe" masquerading as one of the outlets of the plaintiff. The
       defendant has copied the plaintiff's name, as also the tagline
       of "A WILD PLACE TO EAT'. There is a certainty that because
       of the shoddy manner in which the restaurant is presently
       running, irreparable injury will be caused to the reputation and
       good will of the plaintiff world wide, and will also have adverse
       ramifications on the impending enquiries for its franchise in
       New Delhi as well as other parts of India. On consideration of
       the totality of the facts and circumstances, the Court found the
       balance of convenience in favor of the plaintiff and observed
       that the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable injury, if the
       defendant continues to run its restaurant in its present name
       and style which is a poor but blind copy of the plaintiff's cafes
       world wide. On consideration of the totality of the facts the
       Court granted injunction in favor of the plaintiff.

<p id="p_74">ORDINARY WORDS
</p><p id="p_75">39.    The test of confusion and deception in order to prove the case
of passing off has been very well discussed in the case of Laxmikant
vs. Patel vs. Chetanbhat Shah and Another, reported in (2002) 3
SCC 65, wherein the Supreme Court while considering a plea of
passing off and grant of ad interim injunction held in no uncertain
terms that a person may sell his goods or deliver his services under a
trading name or style which, with the passage of time, may acquire a
reputation or goodwill and may become a property to be protected by
the Courts. It was held that a competitor initiating sale of goods or
services in the same name or by imitating that name causes injury to
the business of one who has the property in that name. It was held
that honesty and fair play are and ought to be the basic policy in the
world of business and when a person adopts or intends to adopt a
name which already belongs to someone else, it results in confusion,
has the propensity of diverting the customers and clients of someone
else to himself and thereby resulting in injury.
</p><p id="p_76">40.    It was held in Laxmikant V. Patel (supra) that the principles
which apply to trade mark are applicable to trade name also. Para 10
of the aforesaid judgment reads as under:-
</p>

      in such a way as would persuade the customers or clients

       someone else are his or are associated therewith. It does
      not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or
      otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair
      play are, and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of
      business. Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to
      adopt a name in connection with his business or services
      which already belongs to someone else it results in
      confusion and has propensity of diverting the customers
      and clients of someone else to himself and thereby
      resulting in injury."

by the Single Judge of this Court speaking through Shri Mahinder

are as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">      ".......The words of common language which were held to be

      'Camel Hair". What was asserted in the Reddaway's case
      was that beltings were manufactured and sold by various
      persons; that the beltings used to be sold under the name of
      various animals like Yak, Llama, Buffalo, Crocodile etc. What
      Plaintiff Reddaway asserted was that Banham was their one
      time employee and that he had started selling the beltings
      under the name 'Camel Hair"; Reddaway also asserted that
      they were entitled to stop others, like Defendants Banham,
      from using the word 'Camel Hair with respect to the beltings
      manufactured by them.

<blockquote id="blockquote_66">       48. This case was decided by the House of Lords on or about
      26th March, 1896. The case was started on 3rd May, 1893
      when Frank Reddaway and F. Reddaway &amp; Co. Ltd.,
      commenced the suit in the Manchester District Registry of the
      Queen's Bench Division against George Banham and George
      Banham &amp; Co. Ltd., for an injunction to restrain the
      Defendants from infringing certain trade marks and from
      continuing to use the word 'Camel in such a manner as to
      pass off their goods as and for the plaintiff's goods. It was
      asserted that the plaintiffs had, during the course of trade,
      sold very large quantities of beltings as 'camel beltings' and
      that the word 'Camel' appeared upon, or was attached to
      their beltings as 'camel beltings'. In England and abroad the
      word 'camel', or the figure of a camel, was universally
      understood in all the places where their beltings was sold, to
      indicate goods to be of plaintiffs manufacture. It was also
      asserted that beltings was sold as 'camel' and 'camel hair
      beltings also. The action was commenced because the
      Defendants' company and the Defendant Banham had
      recently sold in England and advertised for sale in
      conjunction with the word "Camel" large quantities of beltings,
      which belting was not made by the plaintiffs and thus, the
      persons who desire for purchasing beltings of the Plaintiff
      would be deceived by the Defendants' use of the word
      'Camel', into the belief that they were purchasing the beltings
      of the plaintiffs' manufacture.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_67">      49. The plaintiffs got the injunction from Collins, J. but the
      Defendants' appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal
      holding that 'Camel Hair' Belting' was merely a truthful
      description of the nature of the goods and nobody can be
      prevented from using that name, although it may lead to
      goods being purchased under that name, as a goods of a
      particular maker. The Court of Appeal held that 'Camel Hair
      Belting was a true description of the goods, and that it was
      the name by which a person wanting to buy goods would ask
      for them. Again a judgment was given for the Defendants.
      The plaintiffs then appealed to the House of Lords.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                          Page 40 of 65</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_68">       50. The House of Lords examined the case, and held that
      even "descriptive words" like 'Camel Hair Belting' were
      capable of exclusively appropriation, that the words 'Camel
      Hair Belting' have acquired a secondary signification with
      respect to the beltings in the sense that the words 'Camel
      Hair' with respect to the trade in beltings had lost their
      primary meaning, to indicate belting made of camel hair, but
      has acquired a secondary significance or meaning in the
      trade, and came to connote the products of the plaintiffs. The
      House of Lords found that there was ample evidence to
      justify the finding that amongst those who were the
      purchasers of such goods, the words "Camel Hair" were not
      applied to beltings made of that material in general; that in
      short, it did not mean in the market belting made of a
      particular material, but belting made by a particular
      manufacturer. The House of Lords thus came to the
      conclusion that common words of a language can be
      exclusively appropriated to a particular manufacturer as they
      had acquired a special meaning as denoting the goods of a
      particular manufacturer/ trader.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_69">      51. Lord Herschell also dealt with "coined" words, that did not
      have any meaning in the language; and at page 228 line 19,
      said that "words never in use before, and meaningless except
      as indicating by whom the goods in connection with which it
      is used were made, there could be no conceivable legitimate
      use of it by another person". Thus the "coined" "created",
      "Fancy", or "new" words which were not in use in any
      language before, and which did not have any meaning in the
      ordinary language, us evidenced by their absence in
      authoritative and standard language dictionaries, were the
      exclusive property of the person who first "coined", or created
      them and adopted them for use, and used it in connection
      with any article the only reason why a hitherto meaningless
      word would be used by another in connection with his
      activities would be to deceive the public, that the letters
      article, thing or goods or the articles, thing or goods of the
      former. He also observed that "he was unable to see why a
      man should be allowed in this way, more than in any other, to

       deceive purchasers into the belief that they are getting what
      they are not, and thus to filch the business of a rival".
</blockquote><p id="p_78">42.    The likelihood of confusion or deception in such cases is not
disproved by placing the two marks side by side and demonstrating
how small is the chance of error in any customer who places his
order for goods with both the marks clearly before him, for orders
are not placed, or are often not placed, under such conditions. It is
more useful to observe that in most persons the eye is not an
accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks are remembered
rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by
any photographic recollection of the whole.
</p><p id="p_79">43.    In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is evident that the plaintiff's
trademark Comfort Inn is a distinctive trademark/name by virtue of
long and continuous user and the plaintiff is entitled for injunction as
prayed for.

</blockquote><p id="p_82">(ii) In Parker Knoll Ltd. v. Knoll International Ltd., 1962 R.P.C.
265, Lord Denning explained the words "to deceive" and the phrase
"to cause confusion" as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">      "Secondly, 'to deceive' is one thing. To 'cause confusion' is
      another. The difference is this :

      false representation to him and thereby cause him to believe
      a thing to be true which is false. You may not do it knowingly,
      or intentionally, but still you do it, and so you deceive him.
      But you may cause confusion without telling him a lie at all,
      and without making any false representation to him. You may
      indeed tell him the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
      truth, but still you may cause confusion in his mind, not by
      any fault of yours, but because he has not the knowledge or
      ability to distinguish it from the other pieces of truth known to
      him or because he may not even take the trouble to do so."

clarified that among the surrounding circumstances to be taken into
account,      one    of   considerable   importance   is   the     imperfect
recollection a person is likely to have of a mark with which he is only
vaguely acquainted. While approving the above tests for comparison

<p id="p_89"> Delay

</p><p id="p_90">46.    It has been decided in many cases that such statutory right
cannot be lost merely on the question of principles of delay, laches
or acquiescence. It was also held that a mere delay after knowledge
of infringement does not deprive the registered proprietor of a trade
mark of his statutory rights or of the appropriate remedy for the
enforcement of those rights so long as the said delay is not an
inordinate delay.
</p>
<p id="p_91">       The issue of delay and acquiescence has been considered by
Courts in various matters. Some of them are referred to as under:
</p><p id="p_92">a)    In the case of <a href="/doc/784265/" id="a_39">Midas Hygiene Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. Sudhir
      Bhatia and Others</a>, 2004 (28) PTC 121, relevant para-5 of the
      said judgment is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_93">         "5. The law on the subject is well settled. In cases of
         infringement either of Trade Mark or of Copyright normally
         an injunction must follow. Mere delay in bringing action is
         not sufficient to defeat grant of injunction in such cases.
         The grant of injunction also becomes necessary if it prima
         facie appears that the adoption of the Mark was itself
         dishonest."

         "There is then the question of delay. Learned counsel for
         the respondents had urged that the delay is fatal to the
         grant of an injunction. We are not so satisfied. A delay in

         refusing an injunction in certain circumstances. In the

         1958. An exclusive right is granted by the registration to the
         holder of a registered trade mark. We do not think statutory
         rights can be lost by delay. The effect of a registered mark
         is so clearly defined in the statute as to be not capable of
         being misunderstood. Even if there is some delay, the
         exclusive right cannot be lost. The registered mark cannot
         be reduced to a nullity....."

         comes to consider whether the use of that mark has or has

         disposed of as technically not maintainable in absence of
         proper relief, for all times to come in future defendant of

         such future acts."
</p><p id="p_99">       The ratio of the aforesaid decisions are squarely applicable to
the facts of the present case. Thus, injunction cannot be refused on
account of delay as the plaintiff has made a strong prima facie case
of infringement of trademark and passing off.
</p><p id="p_100">Balance of convenience tilts in plaintiff's favour :
</p><p id="p_101">47.    From the entire gamut of the matter, it emerges that the plaintiff has
been using the suit trademarks atleast since 1981 globally and atleast
since 1991 in India. The defendants' adoption and use of the suit
trademarks is clearly dishonest. The defendants' operations are limited
to one outlet in Hyderabad under the impugned name while the plaintiff,
being the proprietor of the suit trademarks, operates over 1500 Comfort
Inn hotels in the world and has spent huge resources in its brands. The
defendants have been using another mark 'Raj Classic Inn'. Therefore,
the balance of convenience completely tilts in favour of the plaintiff and
against the defendant. In case the defendant is allowed to use the
identical trade mark/name, the plaintiff would suffer injury in its business
not only in India but also in other parts of the world towards name,
goodwill and reputation.

<p id="p_102"> JURISDICTION

the defendants. The plaintiffs have invoked the jurisdiction of this

reads as under:

   entertain and try the present suit on account of the provisions of
   <a href="/doc/1985585/" id="a_42">Section 134</a> (2) of the Trademarks Act, 1999 as the Plaintiff
   being the owner of the registered trademark COMFORT
   INN/COMFORT, carries on business for profit and gain through
   its master franchisee operating from Comfort Inn The President
   at 4/23 B, Asaf Ali Road, Delhi. Territorial jurisdiction of this
   Hon'ble Court also exists as the Defendants' interactive website
   at www.rajcomfortinn.com is accessible inter alia in New Delhi
   and amounts to offering the Defendants' services for sale at
   Delhi since online bookings for rooms requested from Delhi are
   routinely accepted by the Defendants. The Defendants are also
   verily believed to have agents and coordinates at Delhi from
   promotion of their business to Hyderabad-bound travelers. The
   Defendants are also listed in the Just-Dial directory and
   therefore are clearly offering their services for sale in Delhi.
   Hence, a part of the cause of action also arises in Delhi,"

       appearing in the above two provisions. In Dhodha House
      (supra), the Supreme Court, inter alia, considered the
      meaning of the expression 'carries on business' The
      following extracts from the said decision would be
      relevant:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_91">         "46. The expression "carries on business" and the
         expression 'personally works for gain' connote two
         different meanings. For the purpose of carrying on
         business only presence of a man at a place is not
         necessary. Such business may be carried at a place
         through an agent or a manager or through a servant.
         The owner may not even visit that place. The phrase
         "carries on business" at a certain place would,
         therefore, mean having an interest in a business at
         that place, a voice in what is done, a share in the gain
         or loss and some control thereover. The expression is
         much wider than what the expression in normal
         parlance connotes, because of the ambit of a civil
         action within the meaning of section 9 of the Code. But
         it is necessary that the following three conditions
         should be satisfied, namely,

            "(1) The agent must be a special agent who attends
            exclusively to the business of the principal and
            carries it on in the name of the principal and not a
            general agent who does business for any one that
            pays him. Thus, a trader in the mufassil who
            habitually sends grain to Madras for sale by a firm of
            commission agents who have an independent
            business of selling goods for others on commission,
            cannot be said to "carry on business" in Madras. So
            a firm in England, carrying on business in the name
            of A.B. &amp; Co., which employs upon the usual terms
            a Bombay firm carrying on business in the name of
            C.D. &amp; Co., to act as the English firm's commission
            agents in Bombay, does not "carry on business" in



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                           Page 52 of 65</span>
             Bombay so as to render itself liable to be sued in
            Bombay.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_92">            (2) The person acting as agent must be an agent in
            the strict sense of the term. The manager of a joint
            Hindu family is not an "agent" within the meaning of
            this condition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_93">            (3) To constitute 'carrying on business' at a certain
            place, the essential part of the business must take
            place in that place. Therefore, a retail dealer who
            sells goods in the mofussil cannot be said to 'carry
            on business' in Bombay merely because he has an
            agent in Bombay to import and purchase his stock
            for him. He cannot be said to carry on business in
            Bombay unless his agent made sales there on his
            behalf. A Calcutta firm that employs an agent at
            Amritsar who has no power to receive money or to
            enter into contracts, but only collects orders which
            are forwarded to and dealt with in Calcutta, cannot
            be said to do business in Amritsar. But a Bombay
            firm that has a branch office at Amritsar, where
            orders are received subject to confirmation by the
            head office at Bombay, and where money is paid
            and disbursed, is carrying on business at Amritsar
            and is liable to be sued at Amritsar. Similarly a Life
            Assurance Company which carries on business in
            Bombay and employs an agent at Madras who acts
            merely as a Post Office forwarding proposals and
            sending moneys cannot be said to do business in
            Madras. Where a contract of insurance was made at
            place A and the insurance amount was also payable
            there, a suit filed at place B where the insurance Co.
            had a branch office was held not maintainable.
            Where the plaintiff instituted a suit at Kozhikode
            alleging that its account with the defendant Bank at
            its Calcutta branch had been wrongly debited and it
            was claimed that that court had jurisdiction as the

             defendant had a branch there, it was held that the
            existence of a branch was not part of the cause of
            action and that the Kozhikode Court therefore had
            no jurisdiction. But when a company through
            incorporated outside India gets itself registered in
            India and does business in a place in India through
            its agent authorized to accept insurance proposals,
            and to pay claims, and to do other business
            incidental to the work of agency, the company
            carries on business at the place of business in India"

      illustration of which is given in the above extract itself

      where orders are received, subject to confirmation by the

      can also include a branch office. This proposition is based
      on a decision of the Madras High Court in Wipro Limited
      (supra). But, this proposition is of no use to the appellant/
      plaintiff inasmuch as it is not the case of the appellant/
      plaintiff that it has any office within the territorial limits of
      this Court, what to speak of a branch office.

<blockquote id="blockquote_100">       16.     Faced with this eventuality, Mr Anand submitted
      that, in fact, there is no need to have any office at all at a
      particular place for establishing the fact that a person
      carries on business at that place. He placed reliance, once
      again, on Wipro Limited (supra), wherein it was observed
      that the plain meaning of the expression "carries on
      business" only conveys that wherever there is a business
      activity - be it the principal place or branch or branches -
      the party concerned is said to carry on business at such
      places. In fact, we may point out that Mr Anand need not
      haved laboured on this point at all because in Dhodha
      House (supra) itself, the Supreme Court had clearly
      observed that for the purpose of carrying on business, the
      presence of the person concerned at a particular place was
      not at all necessary and that such business could be
      carried on at that place through an agent or a manager or
      through a servant. Mr Anand also submitted that while
      considering the question of territorial jurisdiction at the
      threshold stage and particularly while considering the
      question of return of a plaint under Order 7 Rule 10 CPC,
      only the averments made in the plaint ought to be seen
      and, if, on a demurrer, a case for territorial jurisdiction has
      been made out, the plaint ought not to be returned. In our
      view, there is no quarrel with this proposition either.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_101">      17.    The main issue before us is one of considering as to
      whether on the basis of the averments made in the plaint,
      the appellant/ plaintiff carries on business in Delhi. It is
      nowhere pleaded in the plaint that the appellant/ plaintiff,
      has an agent or a manager or a servant, through whom the
      appellant/ plaintiff carries on business in Delhi. As pointed
      out above, it is also not the appellant/ plaintiff's case that it
      has an office in Delhi. The question then arises as to
      whether the third condition specified in Dhodha House
      (supra) is satisfied or not. If we recall, in Dhodha House
      (supra), the Supreme Court had observed that the
      expression "carries on business" as appearing in the above
      two provisions, is much wider than what the expression in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                              Page 56 of 65</span>
       normal parlance connotes because of the ambit of a civil
      action within the meaning of Section 9 of the CPC. The
      Supreme Court, however, cautioned that although the
      expression has a very wide meaning, it is necessary that
      the three conditions specified in the said decision should
      be satisfied.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">      18.     Insofar as the first two conditions are concerned,
      they relate to agents. Inasmuch as it is an admitted position
      that the appellant/ plaintiff has no agent in Delhi, those two
      conditions are clearly not fulfilled. However, it is the
      appellant/ plaintiff's case that it carries on business in Delhi
      directly inasmuch as its goods and services are sold to
      consumers in Delhi through its website which is accessed
      in Delhi. It is on this basis that the learned counsel for the
      appellant/ plaintiff submitted that the decision in Dhodha
      House (supra) as also in Archie Comic (supra) would
      really not be applicable in the present case as in those
      decisions web-based business models, which have been
      referred to as the new media', were not considered. The
      question which then arises is whether the introduction and
      spread of e-commerce and business over the internet
      impacts the meaning of the expression "carries on
      business" at a certain place. The learned Single Judge, as
      we have pointed out above, felt that the introduction of the
      new business models of doing business over the internet
      was not any different from the old model of doing business
      over the telephone or fax. He had placed reliance on the
      Supreme Court decision in the case of Bhagwan
      Goverdhandas Kedia (supra).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_103">      19.     Considering the fact that in Dhodha House (supra),
      the third condition stipulated that to constitute 'carrying on
      business' at a certain place, the essential part of the
      business must take place there, it would be necessary to
      examine this aspect in the backdrop of business over the
      internet. When a transaction takes place over the internet,
      where is the contract concluded? This is the question


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                             Page 57 of 65</span>
       which needs to be answered. In other words, at which
      place does the essential part of the business transaction
      take place? The example of the Bombay firm having a
      branch office at Amritsar, where orders were received,
      subject to confirmation by the head office at Bombay and
      where money was paid and disbursed, needs to be
      examined in the context of internet transactions. In that
      example, it was noted that the Bombay firm could be said
      to be carrying on business at Amritsar and was liable to be
      sued at Amritsar. In the present case, the plaintiff/
      appellant is incorporated in USA. It has a website. We do
      not know as to where that website is hosted. The server
      would, in all likelihood, be in USA. It has not been pleaded
      that the website of the appellant/ plaintiff is hosted on a
      server in Delhi. Therefore, it can be safely presumed that
      the web server is not located in Delhi. However, if a
      customer in Delhi wishes to purchase an article, which is
      available on the website of the appellant/ plaintiff, the
      purchaser in Delhi accesses the said website on his or her
      computer in Delhi. The said purchaser places the order for
      the said article from his computer in Delhi. The payment is
      made either through a credit/ debit card or through a cash
      card from Delhi and ultimately the goods are delivered to
      the customer in Delhi. In the nature of such transactions,
      the question arises as to which is the place where the
      essential part of the business occurs?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_104">      20. We may recall that the learned Single Judge had
      referred to the Supreme Court decision in Bhagwan
      Goverdhandas Kedia (supra), wherein transactions over
      the telephone and telegraph had been considered. It would
      be instructive to examine that decision of the Supreme
      Court. The facts before the Supreme Court in Bhagwan
      Goverdhandas Kedia (supra) were that the plaintiff therein
      had commenced an action in the City Civil Court at
      Ahmedabad against the defendant for a decree of
      Rs.31,150/- on the plea that the defendants had failed to
      supply cotton seed cake, which they had agreed to supply


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                         Page 58 of 65</span>
       under an oral contract entered into on 22.07.1959, which
      had been negotiated between the parties through a long
      distance conversation over the telephone. The question
      arose as to whether the City Civil Court at Ahmedabad had
      jurisdiction to entertain the said suit. The offer to purchase
      cotton seed cake had emanated from the plaintiff and that
      offer had been accepted by the defendant. The City Civil
      Court held that as the contract was concluded over the
      telephone, the place where the acceptance of the offer is
      intimated to the offeror is the place where the contract is
      made, and, therefore, the City Civil Court at Ahmedabad
      would have jurisdiction to try the suit. The matter travelled
      up to the Supreme Court, which, by a majority decision,
      upheld the conclusion of the City Civil Court at Ahmedabad
      by holding that :-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_105">            "The trial Court was therefore right in the view
            which it has taken that a part of the cause of
            action arose within the jurisdiction of the Civil City
            Court, Ahmedabad, where acceptance was
            Communicated by telephone to the plaintiffs."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_106">      In doing so, the Supreme Court considered the relevant
      provisions of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_49">Indian Contract Act</a>, 1872 as also the
      common law of England. The Supreme Court also
      undertook to compare contracts concluded over the post
      and telegraph on the one hand and contracts concluded
      over the telephone on the other. The Supreme Court noted
      that acceptance and intimation of acceptance of an offer
      are both necessary to result in a binding contract. The
      Supreme Court held that in the case of a contract which
      consists of mutual promises, the offeror must receive
      intimation that the offeree has accepted his offer and has
      signified his willingness to perform his promise. The
      Supreme Court further noted that when parties are in the
      presence of each other, the method of communication will
      depend upon the nature of the offer and the circumstances
      in which it is made and that when an offer is orally made,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                              Page 59 of 65</span>
       acceptance may be expected to be made by an oral reply,
      but even a nod or other act which indubitably intimates
      acceptance, may suffice. Furthermore, if the offeror
      receives no such intimation, even if the offeree has
      resolved to accept the offer, a contract may not result. The
      Supreme Court further observed as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_107">            "But on this rule is engrafted an exception based
            on ground of convenience which has the merit not
            of logic or principle in support, but of long
            acceptance by judicial decisions. If the parties are
            not in the presence of each other, and the offeror
            has not prescribed a mode of communication of
            acceptance, insistence upon communication of
            acceptance of the offer by the offeree would be
            found to be inconvenient, when the contract is
            made by letters sent by post....."

<blockquote id="blockquote_108">            xxxx     xxxx       xxxx        xxxx        xxxx

      ".....The exception has long been recognised in the United
      Kingdom and in other countries where the law of contracts
      is based on the common law of England. Authorities in
      India also exhibit a fairly uniform trend that in case of
      negotiations by post the contract is complete when
      acceptance of the offer is put into a course of transmission
      to the offeror: see Baroda Oil Cakes Traders case ILR
      (1954) Bom 1137: (AIR) 1954 Bom 451, and cases cited
      therein. A similar rule has been adopted when the offer and
      acceptance are by telegrams. The exception to the general
      rule requiring intimation of acceptance may be summarised
      as follows. When by agreement, course of conduct, or
      usage of trade, acceptance by post or telegram is
      authorised, the bargain is struck and the contract is
      complete when the acceptance is put into a course of
      transmission by the offeree by posting a letter or
      dispatching a telegram."        (underlining added)



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">CS(OS) No.332/2010                                             Page 60 of 65</span>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_109">       21.     From the above, it is clear that the general rule is
      that the contract is complete when the offeror receives
      intimation that the offeree has accepted his offer. An
      exception to this has been carved out in respect of
      contracts negotiated by postal communications or
      telegrams. The exception being that the bargain in such
      cases (post or telegram) would be struck and the contract
      would be complete when the acceptance of the offeree is
      put into a course of transmission by him by posting a letter
      or despatching a telegram. The Supreme Court then held
      as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_110">         "10. It is true that the Post and Telegraphs Department
         has general control over communication by telephone
         and especially long distance telephone, but that is not
         a ground for assuming that the analogy of a contract
         made by post will govern this mode of making
         contracts. In the case of correspondence by post or
         telegraphic communication, a third agency intervenes
         and without the effective intervention of that third
         agency, Letters or messages cannot be transmitted. In
         the case of a conversation by telephone, once a
         connection is established there is in the normal course
         no further intervention of another agency. Parties
         holding conversation on the telephone are unable to
         see each other: They are also physically separated in
         space, but they are in the hearing of each other by the
         aid of a mechanical contrivance which makes the
         voice of one heard by the other instantaneously, and
         communication does not depend upon an external
         agency." (underlining added)

      It is obvious that the Supreme Court distinguished the case
      of a contract negotiated over the telephone from that of
      contracts through letters or through telegrams. Whereas in
      the latter, there was an intervention of an external agency,
      which took time to deliver the acceptance of the offer by
      the offeree to the offeror, in the former, the communication

       of the acceptance was             instantaneous once the
      communication link had been established. The Supreme
      Court, by virtue of its majority decision, went on to hold as
      under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_111">         "14. Obviously the draftsman of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_50">Indian Contract
         Act</a> did not envisage use of the telephone as a means
         of personal conversation between parties separated in
         space, and could not have intended to make any rule
         in that behalf. The question then is whether the
         ordinary rule which regards a contract as completed
         only when acceptance is intimated should apply, or
         whether the exception engrafted upon the rule in
         respect of offers and acceptances by post and by
         telegrams is to be accepted. If regard be had to the
         essential nature of conversation by telephone, it would
         be reasonable to hold that the parties being in a sense
         in the presence of each other, and negotiations are
         concluded by instantaneous communication of speech,
         communication of acceptance is a necessary part of
         the formation of contract, and the exception to the rule
         imposed on grounds of commercial expediency is
         in-applicable."                   (underlining added)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_112">      22.    It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court had
      observed that the draftsman of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_51">Indian Contract Act</a>
      could not have envisaged use of the telephone as a means
      of personal conversation between parties separated in
      space and could not have intended to make any rule in that
      behalf. This applies with greater vigour insofar as
      commerce and business over the internet is concerned.
      Just as in the case of telephone conversation, there is
      instantaneous communication, so, too, in the case of
      business over the internet. Therefore, the rule that applies
      to contracts concluded over the telephone would apply with
      equal vigour to contracts concluded over the internet. In
      other words, contracts would be completed at the place
      where the acceptance is communicated. In the case before

       the Supreme Court, the offer had emanated from the
      plaintiff, who was situated in Ahmedabad. The acceptance
      of the offer was by the defendants, who were to make the
      supply of cotton seed cakes to the plaintiff therein. The
      acceptance, since it was over the telephone, was
      instantaneously communicated via that technology to the
      plaintiff at Ahmedabad. The Supreme Court held that the
      cause of action would arise within the jurisdiction of the
      City Civil Court at Ahmedabad, where the acceptance was
      communicated by telephone to the plaintiff."
