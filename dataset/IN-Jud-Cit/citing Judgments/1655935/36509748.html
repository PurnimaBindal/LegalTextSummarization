                   appellant's MAGIC MASALA instant noodles in the market, had adopted an

                   identical and/or deceptively similar mark MAGICAL MASALA for its instant

                   noodles only with a mala fide intention of riding on the goodwill of the

                   respect to instant noodles in India. However, the respondent has been loosing

                   deceptively similar mark MAGICAL MASALA for identical goods by the

                   respondent is a clear case of violation of common law rights vested with the

                   appellant. The appellant is the prior adopter and user of the mark MAGIC

                   the year 2010 on an extensive scale continuously since then. It is further

                   stated that an ordinary customer with imperfect recollection, who is used to

                   the same has been used by the appellant to qualify the quality of masala as

                   “MAGIC MASALA” so as to describe the masala used for flavour of bland

                   noodles in the pack as wonderful/extraordinary/excellent/fantastic, etc., and

                   no passing off action is maintainable;

<p id="p_24">                            (iii) The appellant is selling its instant noodles under the trade mark

                   “ITC” “SUNFEAST” and “YIPPEE” in three flavours - “Classic Masala,

                   MAGIC MASALA and Chinese Masala”. Therefore, the appellant cannot

                   claim any proprietary right in such product/flavour description. The trade

                   mark of the appellant for noodles of three different flavours is “ITC,

                   SUNFEAST” and “YIPPEE”. The three flavours are Classic Masala, MAGIC

                   MASALA and Chinese Masala and it is not used as a trade mark to indicate

                   the connection between the appellant and its product for identifying the

                   source or origin of the product and therefore, there is no trade mark usage

                   according to <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_2">Section 2(zb)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (for brevity, “the

                   Act”) and consequently the appellant cannot claim any proprietary right for

                   maintaining passing off action;

                   newspaper advertisements, etc., the trade mark is “SUNFEAST YIPPEE !!”

                   and the three types of masala are product descriptor or flavour descriptor;

                   noodles as of 2012 is Rs.2,377 Crores. MAGGI is well known trade mark in

                   India. The trade mark MAGGI is a coined mark used internationally since the

                   year 1884 and in India since 1974 for flavour solutions in the form of cubes.

                   Therefore, the competing trade mark for the purposes of deciding the suit are

                   “SUNFEAST YIPPEE” and “MAGGI”. The packing of the two products are

                   completely different and there is no question of any confusion or deception

                   among the consumers or traders.        MAGGI has approximately 80% market

                   share and therefore, the question of MAGGI trading upon the reputation and

                   goodwill of SUNFEAST YIPPEE does not arise and therefore, the suit is

                   misconceived;

                   whatsoever in common parlance and is not a dictionary word. The trade mark

                   Daniel, learned counsel for the respondent/defendant submitted that the suit

                   filed by the appellant/plaintiff is not a suit for infringement of trade mark and

                   the distinction between the test of infringement and passing of is crucial and

                   this has been rightly maintained by the learned Single Bench. In this regard,

                   the learned counsel placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme

                   Court in the case of <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_23">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma vs. Navaratna

                   Pharmaceutical Laboratories</a> [AIR 1965 SC 980].             It is submitted that

                   passing of is an action in deceit and not an action for violation of any

                   statutory right of exclusive use granted only by way of registration. The

                   learned Single Bench while deciding the issue Nos.2 and 6 rightly held that

                   the adoption of 'MAGIC MASALA' by the respondent is bonafide and

                   legitimate and the use of 'MAGIC MASALA' is by way of flavour descriptor

                   and not as a trademark. Further, the learned Single Bench rightly held that

                   passing of is an action in deceit. The products of both the parties are well

                   distinguished from each other on account of the trademark 'SUNFEAST

                   YIPPEE' AND 'MAGGI' and the competing package are visually also

                   completely different. Further, it has been rightly held that it is a requirement

                   of law as test deceptive similarity that the trademarks must be compared as a

                   whole and not in bits and pieces. Accordingly, it was rightly held that the

                   competing trademarks SUNFEAST YIPPEE, MAGIC MASALA AND

                   MAGGI XTRA DELICIOUS are completely different and so is the packing.

                   Further in a passing of action, it is essential and a pre-condition for the

                   plaintiff to first establish its proprietary right to the trademark in question and

                   if such right is not established, the question of any further enquiry in the issue

                   of confusion or deception does not arise. The appellant/plaintiff to claim and

                   establish a proprietary right in 'MAGIC MASALA' as a trademark under

                   common law for passing of has to establish that on account of the exclusive

                   and extensive use thereof, the said mark has acquired distinctiveness, qua the

                   goods and business of the appellant/plaintiff to the exclusion of other traders.

                   'MAGIC' is a mark common to food industry and not exclusively used by the

                   appellant/plaintiff, no distinctiveness can be established and no exclusive

                   right can be permitted in favour of the appellant. Further 'MAGIC' is a

                   laudatory epithet, lauding the quality of masala sold along with plain noodles

                   under the trademark 'SUNFEAST YIPPEE'!, use of such laudatory word

                   cannot confer any proprietary right on the appellant to the exclusion of the

                   impugned judgment, it is submitted that the learned Single Bench was right in

                   referring to the meaning of the word 'MAGIC' from the dictionary to mean

                   marvellous, excellent, fantastic, exciting, etc. and that the word 'MAGIC' is

                   the mix of spices for food preparation known to the Indian culinary. Further

                   by referring to paragraph 207 of the impugned judgment, it is submitted that

                   the Court after carefully analysing the evidence on record arrived at a finding

                   that both the words 'MAGIC' and its derivative 'MAGICAL' are common to

                   the trade and therefore neither the plaintiff nor the defendant can claim any

                   monopoly over the expression 'MAGIC' OR 'MAGICAL' as they are common

                   words in Indian food industry.      Further, the learned counsel referred to

                   carefully analysed the documentary evidence placed before it and held against

                   conclusion that the word 'MAGIC' being laudatory and common to trade,

                   none can claim proprietary right to the exclusion of other traders. The learned

                   counsel referred to Ex.D19 to show that the word 'MAGIC' has been

                   registered by several entities. Further, by referring to Ex.D43, it is submitted

                   that approximately 546 applications are filed with the Registrar of

                   Trademarks seeking registration of 'MAGIC' as a trademark in one form or

                   MILKY MAGIC' was challenged by Parle Products Private Limited in a

                   passing off action, the plaintiff has stated that no single trader can monopolize

                   a common dictionary word which is used in a descriptive manner by a

                   numerous traders. Further, it had been stated that several traders are using the

                   word 'MAGIC' with respect to several goods including biscuits, a search in

                   are registered and/or have applied for trademarks comprising of the word

                   'MAGIC' in Classes 29 and 30. It is argued that the plaintiff and P.W.1 are

                   guilty of committing acts of perjury on account of making false deposition on

                   synonymous with instant noodles as the respondent was first to introduce

                   instant noodles in India in 1984. The respondent holds over 80% of market

                   share of instant noodles market segment with its turnover of Rs.1725 Crores

                   in 2010. The respondent in addition to the trademark 'MAGGI' has used

                   'MAGICAL' and 'MAGIC' since 1986 in relation to culinary products.

                   However, the use of 'MAGICAL' and 'MAGIC' by the respondent has always

                   been laudatory epithet/mark to laud and exclaim the exceptional or

                   extraordinary quality of spice marketed in cubes/taste enhancer/flavour

                   enhancer used for enhancing the taste or flavour of culinary products. It is

                   misplaced, misconceived and not tenable. It is further submitted that it is

                   incorrect to state that the Court while deciding the suit did not consider the

                   oral and documentary evidence.       Referring to various paragraphs of the

                   impugned judgment, it is submitted that all relevant materials placed on

                   record has been taken into consideration and judgment has been rendered

                   which does not call for any interference. Further, it is submitted that the

                   interim order which was granted pending suit was an order where there was

                   no finding of passing of but only on the ground of confusion and deception.

                   It is submitted that confusion is not passing of, passing of is never qua the

                   trademark as passing of is on the product. Infringement will arise only when

                   a trademark is used as against a registered mark and not when it is used

                   descriptively. The appellant/plaintiff having miserably failed to establish any

                   proprietary right, the suit for passing of is to be dismissed in limine. The

                   appellant/plaintiff was required to establish that 'MAGIC MASALA' was

                   Trademark stating on oath that 'MAGIC' is a common word. In the counter

                   affidavit filed by the appellant in C.M.P.No.9158 of 2020, the appellant now

                   takes a stand that its explicit position in the present proceedings has been to

                   restrain the respondent's illegal adoption of the appellant's distinctive

                   combination 'MAGIC MASALA' for instant noodles. This would go to show

                   Further, the learned counsel referred to <a href="/doc/1463645/" id="a_38">Section 47</a> of the Act which deals with

                   removal from the registry and imposition of limitations on ground of non use.

                   need not be the same product. Further, it is submitted that noodles and spices

                   are cognate goods and so far as prior use is concerned, it is qua the mark. It is

                   further submitted that the appellant cannot read the impugned judgment in

                   bits and pieces and in this regard, the learned counsel has drawn our attention

                   to the relevant paragraphs in the impugned judgment. Further, it is submitted

                   conceived as as a brand or trademark by the appellant and therefore, there is

                   no misrepresentation by the respondent. Further, it is submitted that the Court

                   rightly held that if the appellant had filed an application for registration of the

                   Competition, Third Edition to explain the two basic categories that form the

                   complete spectrum of distinctiveness of marks. It is pointed out that the

                   categories are (1) generic terms, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive and (4)

                   arbitrary or fanciful.    It is submitted that generic terms can never be

                   submitted that the name of a thing cannot identify a source and to explain this

                   concept, once again reference was made to McCarthy.              It is therefore

                   submitted that 'Magic' and 'Masala' cannot be a mark as Masala is generic and

                   'MAGIC MASALA' cannot be distinctive. Further by referring to McCarthy,

                   it is submitted that if a term is generic, all synonyms will also be generic. The

                   learned senior counsel referred to the book by Prof.Christopher Wadlow –

                   The Law of Passing Off and by referring to the learned Author, it is submitted

                   that there is no tort of copying, there is no tort of taking a man's market or

                   customers, neither the mark nor the customers are the plaintiffs to own, there

                   is no tort of making use of another's goodwill as such and there is no tort of

                   competition.    Further, the learned Author has observed that the basic

                   economic rule is that competition is not only lawful but the mainspring of the

                   economy and the legislator has recognized that there should be exceptions, it

                   has laid down the rules for these, namely, the laws of patents, trademarks,

                   copyrights and designs have all been fashioned for the purpose. Reliance was

                   PTC 736 (Del.)(DB)], where the question was whether the appellant's

                   registration gives it exclusive right to use the subject trademarks “LOSORB”

                   and “LO-SORB” and consequently whether an action for infringement is

                   maintainable if a person such as the respondent uses a trademark which is

                   deceptively similar or nearly identical or identical to the registered

                   trademarks. It is submitted that in the said decision, it was pointed out that

                   registration only confers prima facie validity and does not prevent the Court

                   from denying the injunction inspite of registration. The second issue which

                   was pointed out is with regard to the claim pertaining to passing off. In this

                   regard the court referred to the decision in the case of <a href="/doc/204866/" id="a_42">Cadila Healthcare Ltd.

                   exclusive ownership rights on the trademark of 'LOW ABSORB' as the

                   expression is quite clearly a common descriptive expression/adjective. Thus,

                   it is submitted that even if the term 'MAGIC MASALA' was registered as a

                   mark by the plaintiff, yet the defendant cannot be injuncted as the word

                   'Masala' is generic and the prefix 'Magical' is laudatory. Reliance was placed

                   on the decision of the High Court of Justice – Chancery Division in British

                   Sugar PLC vs. James Robertson &amp; Sons Ltd. [(1996) RPC (No.9) 281].

                   This decision was relied on to support the contention wherein the Court while

                   examining the word 'soap' could turn into a trademark, it was held that no

                   matter how much use a manufacturer made of the word 'soap' as a purported

                   trade mark for the word 'soap', the word would not be distinctive of his goods,

                   he could use fancy lettering as much as he liked, whatever he did would not

                   turn the work into a trade mark. The learned counsel has drawn our attention

                   to various paragraphs of the said judgment and pointed out that a word or

                   words to be really distinctive of a person's goods must generally speaking be

                   incapable of application to the goods of anyone else. It is further submitted

                   that the common laudatory word is incapable of being monopolist. Further by

                   referring on the same decision, it was submitted that though the plaintiff

                   claims to have been in the market for three years, it cannot be a ground to

                   state that the public have regarded it as a trade mark. Further in the very same

                   decision, the Court held that the market survey was not sufficient to ascertain

                   as to whether a mark is acquired sufficiently distinctive character that the

                   evidence that the name “Oven Chips” was descriptive of the product and the

                   was cited in support of the submission that the descriptive name does not

                   indicate the source of the goods but the nature of the goods. Further it has

                   been held that merely because lot of money was spent on advertising, other

                   and (3) defacto distinctiveness. If there are multiple users of the same mark,

                   it looses its inherent distinctiveness. The conduct of the appellant/plaintiff

                   should be noted that no attempt has been made by them to register their mark

                   'MAGIC MASALA' nor did they take any action to prevent several other

                   traders who are using the same. The learned counsel referred to <a href="/doc/828839/" id="a_52">Section 9(b)</a>

                   of the Act to point out that the trademark which indicates the kind, quality or

                   intended purpose, it is a ground for refusal of registration. Further, it is

                   submitted that the sales figures which were relied on by the appellant/plaintiff

                   when the injunction was in force cannot be taken into consideration as no

                   person can be put to prejudice on account of an order of Court. Further, it is

                   submitted that the rate of growth of the appellant/plaintiff should be

                   established during the period 2013-2015 and there was no evidence before the

                   trial Court and therefore, the Court will drawn adverse inference against the

                   appellant/plaintiff. Further, it is reiterated that the deceptive similarity will be

                   examined by the Court and it is not for either P.W.4 or P.W.5 or P.W.6 to state

                   whether there is deceptive similarity or confusion between both the products.

                   defendant is passing of their goods as if that of the goods of the

                   appellant/plaintiff. Admittedly, the appellant does not have any registration

                   for the mark 'MAGIC MASALA'. Before the learned Single Bench, six

                   witnesses were examined by the appellant as P.W.1 to P.W.6 and one witness

                   was examined by the respondent/defendant, namely, D.W.1, there were seven

                   of its goods as that of the appellant and without examining the evidence, the

                   Court could not have dismissed the suit.        On a careful reading of the

                   impugned judgment, it is evidently clear that the learned Single Bench has

                   scanned the entire evidence which was on record. It is not necessary for the

                   Trial Court to verbatim deal with each and every word spoken by a witness.

                   Many a times, the questions which are put to the witness during cross

                   examination may be irrelevant or not germaine to the issue involved in the

                   proceedings. Therefore, the Court has to scan the evidence and take into

                   account such evidence which is relevant for the purpose of deciding the issues

                   framed for consideration.

                   it is not a judgment but an order in an interlocutory application. Owing to

                   such submission, we had to examine as to what is a judgment as defined in

                   The argument that the judgment gives an impression to be an order in an

                   interlocutory application is predicated on the submission that there is no

                   discussion on the evidence of P.W.6 who is supposed to be a valuable trusted

                            relevant, this court in Dyechem case sought to examine the
                            difference in the two marks "PICNIK" and "PICNIC". It
                            applied three tests, they being : (1) is there any special
                            aspect of the common feature which has been copied ? (2)
                            mode in which the parts are put together differently, i.e.,
                            whether dissimilarity of the part or parts is enough to make
                            the whole thing dissimilar, and (3) whether, when there are
                            common elements, should one not pay more regard to the

                            disregarding the common parts ? In examining the marks,
                            keeping the aforesaid three tests in mind, it came to the
                            conclusion, seeing the manner in which the two words were

                            trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the
                            use of the trade mark in relation to those goods (Vide S.21 of
                            the Act). The use by the defendant of the trade mark of the
                            plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but is
                            the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement.
                            No doubt, where the evidence in respect of passing off
                            consists merely of the colourable use of a registered. trade
                            mark, the essential features of both the actions might
                            coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable
                            imitation of a trade mark in a passing off action would also
                            be such in an action for infringement of the same trade mark.
                            But there the correspondence between the two ceases. In an
                            action for infringement, the plaintiff must, no doubt, make
                            out that the use of the defendant's mark is likely to deceive,
                            but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the
                            defendants mark is so close either visually, phonetically or
                            otherwise and the court reaches the .conclusion that there is

                            the plaintiff's rights are violated. Expressed in another way,
                            if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have
                            been adopted by the defendant, the fact that the get- up,
                            packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the
                            packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked
                            differences, or indicate clearly a trade origin different from
                            that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be
                            immaterial; whereas in the case of passing off, the defendant
                            may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is
                            sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.
                            When once the use by the defendant of the mark which is
                            claimed to infringe the plaintiffs mark is shown to be "in the
                            course of trade,, the question whether there has been an
                            infringement is to be decided by comparison of the two
                            marks. Where the two marks are identical no further
                            questions arise; for then the infringement is made out. When
                            the two marks are not identical, the, plaintiff would have to
                            establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly
                            resembles the plaintiffs registered trade mark as is likely to
                            deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods in

                            covered by the words "likely to deceive" and it has
                            sometimes been answered by saying that it is merely an
                            extension of the earlier test and does not add very materially
                            to the concept indicated by the earlier words "likely to
                            deceive". But this apart, as the question arises in an action
                            for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to
                            establish that the trade mark used by the defendant in the
                            course of trade in the goods in respect of which his mark is
                            registered, is deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be
                            ascertained by a comparison of the two marks-the degree of
                            resemblance which is necessary to exist to cause deception
                            not being capable of definition by laying down objective
                            standards. The persons who would be deceived are, of
                            course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the likelihood of
                            their being deceived that is the subject of consideration. The
                            resemblance may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea
                            represented by the plaintiffs mark. The purpose of the
                            comparison is for determining whether the essential features
                            of the plaintiff's trade mark are to be found in that used by
                            the defendant. The identification of the essential features of

                               as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered

</p><p id="p_181">                            62.As explained in the above decisions, an action for passing off is a

                   Common Law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a

                   passing off by a person of his own goods as those of another. However, the

                   same is not the gist of an action for infringement which is a statutory remedy

                   conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trademark for the

                   vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trademark in relation to

                   those goods. It has been further pointed out that the use by the defendant of

                   the trademark of the plaintiff is not essential in an action for passing off, but

                   is the sine qua non in the case of an action for infringement. No doubt where

                   the evidence in respect of passing off consists merely of the colourable use of

                   a registered trademark, the essential features of both the actions might

                   coincide in the sense that what would be a colourable imitation of a trademark

                   in a passing off action would be such in an action for infringement of the

                   same trademark. It was further pointed out that in an action for infringement

                   the plaintiff must no doubt make it the use of the defendant's mark is likely to

                   deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff's and the defendant's

                   mark is so close either visually, phonetically or otherwise and the Court

                   reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation, no further evidence is

                   required to establish that the plaintiff's rights are violated. Whereas in the

                   case of passing off, the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the

                   added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff.

                   Further, it was pointed out that undoubtedly the question whether the

                   plaintiff's action of passing off against the defendant will be accepted or not

                   has to be accepted by the Court after the evidence is let in in the suit.

                   have to apply the aforementioned tests to decide the question of deceptive

                   similarity between the mark used by the defendant with that of the plaintiff.

                   Both the marks are word marks with the distinctive colour scheme, patterns

                   and font and admittedly, they are not similar much less deceptively similar

                   same for both the noodles and method of purchase would also be same for

                   both products and the only issue would be degree of resemblance between the

                   to the word MAGIC and MAGICAL.               The plaintiff has used the mark

                   passing off action, the issue is “is the defendant selling goods so marked as to

                   be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the

                   plaintiff's goods?”. In an infringement action, the issue is “is the defendant

                   using a mark which is the same as or which is a colourable imitation of the

                   plaintiff's registered trademark? The action for infringement is a statutory

                   right, it is depend upon the validity of the registration and subject to other

                   restrictions laid down in <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_75">Sections 30</a>, <a href="/doc/94346/" id="a_76">34</a> and <a href="/doc/1034981/" id="a_77">35</a> of the Act. Whereas, the gist

                   of the passing off action is that the defendant is not entitled to represent his

                   goods as the goods of the plaintiff but it is not necessary for the plaintiff to

                   prove that the defendant did this knowingly or with an intent to deceive. It is

                   enough that the get-up of the plaintiff's goods have become distinctive of

                   them and that there is a probability of confusion between them and the goods

                   of the defendant. Therefore, in a passing off action, it is against the goods

                   whereas in infringement action, it is in respect of the registered mark.

                   pointed out the three elements of passing off, namely, the reputation of goods,

                   possibility of deception and likelihood of damages to the plaintiff.

                   that the plaintiff should be able to show that the disputed mark or get-up has

                   registration gives it exclusive right to use the trademark 'LOSORB' and 'LO-

                   SORB' such as the respondent uses the trademark which is deceptively similar

                   or nearly identical or identical to the registered trademarks. The second issue

                   was with regard to the claim of the appellant therein pertaining to passing off

                   and whether the respondent's user of the expression 'LOW ABSORB

                   TECHNOLOGY' in relation to its edible oil product amounts to passing off

                   the goods of the appellant which uses the unregistered trademark 'LOW

                   by the decision in Cadila Healthcare Limited and it was held that the

                   appellant therein can have no exclusive ownership on the trademark 'LOW

                   ABSORB' as the expression 'LOW ABSORB' is quite clearly a common

                   coined word and at best, it is a combination of two popular English words

                   which are descriptive of the nature of the product as held in Cadila

                   Healthcare Limited. To be noted such finding was rendered though the

                   plaintiff's mark was a registered mark. In this regard, it was pointed out that

                   no registered trademark 'LOW ABSORB' only describes the characteristics of

                   the product edible oil and ordinarily/normally incapable of being distinctive.

                   Further, it was held that it is high time that those persons who are first to

                   block in using a trademark which is purely descriptive expression pertaining

                   to the subject product ought to be discouraged from appropriating a

                   descriptive expression or an expression which is more or less in a descriptive

                   expression as found in the English language for claiming the same to be an

                   exclusive trademark and which descriptive word mark bears an indication to

                   the product's kind, quality, use or characteristic, etc. This was held to be in

                   accordance with the spirit of various sub sections of <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_79">Section 9</a> and <a href="/doc/1974480/" id="a_80">Section 30</a>

                   of the Act besides <a href="/doc/1034981/" id="a_81">Section 35</a> of the Act.       Further, explaining the term

                   'distinctiveness', it was held that when a trademark which is a word mark, is

                   arbitrarily adapted and is such having no co-relation to the goods in question,

                   then in such a case distinctiveness is achieved by normal and ordinary use of

                   the trademark with respect to the goods and it has been repeatedly held that

                   such trademarks is entitled to the highest degree of protection. However, this

                   is not and cannot/should not be so for a trademark which is a descriptive work

                   mark and Courts should ordinarily lean against holding distinctiveness of a

                   descriptive trademark unless the user of such trademark is over such a long

                   period of time of many many years that even a descriptive word mark is

                   unmistakably and only and only relatable to one and only source, i.e. the same

                   has acquired a secondary meaning.       It was therefore held that when the

                   descriptive trademark is used by one person undisturbed for a very long

                   period of time, without anyone else attempting to use the trademark during

                   this long period of time, a case can be established of a descriptive word

                   having achieved distinctiveness and a secondary meaning. Further, it was

                   held that once others claim a right to the descriptive trademark before the end

                   of the long period essential for a descriptive trademark to become distinctive

                   then the original user of a descriptive trademark cannot ordinarily establish

                   distinctiveness. In the said case [Marico Limited], on facts it was found that

                   the user is only about seven years and noting the sales, it was held that such

                   user qua a descriptive expression 'LOW ABSORB' cannot be stated to have

                   'STAY FREE', which is a registered mark in respect of sanitary napkins and

                   personal hygiene products since 1978. The defendant contended that their

                   mark was 'COMFIT ALWAYS' and not 'STAY FREE' and the word 'STAY

                   FREE' is a common descriptive work for the products and it is incapable of

                   distinguishing the goods and thirdly, the words 'STAY FREE' is a common

                   dictionary word and was in existence much before either of the plaintiff's

                   came into existence and lastly there is no likelihood of any confusion or

                   deception. The Court after taking note of the facts and various decisions,

                   observed that the central question in each case is whether the name or

                   description given by the defendant to these goods is such as to create a

                   likelihood that a substantial section of the purchasing public will be misled

                   into believing that his goods are the goods of the plaintiff. It is pointed out

                   that the main question is not the intention of the defendant in using certain

                   word but the probable effect of such action on the minds of the customers and

                   in the end, the Court has to trust to its own perception into the mind of the

                   reasonable man. It was further pointed out that the true test is whether the

                   totality of the trademark is such that it is likely to cause deception or

                   confusion or mistake in the minds of persons accustomed to the existing

                   trademark; on totality of circumstances, prima facie, it is difficult to anyone to

                   take the goods of the defendants thinking that they are the goods of the

                   plaintiff. The Court approved the opinion of the learned Single Bench who

                   well as the respondent have been incorporated in the impugned judgment in

                   more than one place and the Court has compared the two wrappers found that

                   the packaging of the appellant/plaintiff has primarily a red and orange colour

                   in background whereas the respondent/defendant has primarily yellow, green

                   and red colour in the background. Further, the trademark of the appellant is

                   prominently on top of the packing as 'SUNFEAST YIPPEE'.                'MAGIC

                   MASALA' is written for the flavour sachet inside the pack to give taste to the

                   noodles. So far as the respondent, it has been stated that the trademark is

                   mentioned at the top as 'MAGGI'. The trademark 'MAGGI' and 'MAGGI'

                   logo used since the year 1974 in India is mentioned and XTRA-DELICIOUS

                   MAGICAL MASALA is written for flavour sachet inside the pack. Thus the

                   conclusion arrived at by the learned Single Bench in paragraphs 237 and 238

                   denying the suggestion put to him, he stated that the data from IMRB suggest

                   that there is evidence to show that the defendant lost market share to the

                   plaintiff in the instant noodles category after the launching of 'SUNFEAST

                   YIPPEE MAGIC MASALA' noodles. Further states that market observation

                   and other secondary sources suggest that YIPPEE's market share has crossed

                   in excess of 35% in the States like Tamil Nadu as on the said date. A

                   cumulative consideration of evidence of P.W.1 would go to show that the

                   contention of the plaintiff that upon introduction of the plaintiff's instant

                   noodles, it has had a dent on the market share of the defendant was largely

                   based upon the market study which undoubtedly was not conducted by P.W.1

                   nor by the plaintiff. Therefore, P.W.1 is not the author of the report. In such

                   circumstances, was such evidence admissible in law. To be noted that the

                   sales in Ex.P3 nor the signatory of the market survey Ex.P7 were examined.

                   The question would be whether such evidence is admissible. <a href="/doc/1681167/" id="a_82">Section 60</a> of

                   the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 states that oral evidence must be direct, i.e. if it

                   refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who

                   says he saw it; if it refers to fact which could be heard it must be the evidence

                   of a witness who says he heard it; if it refers to a fact which could be

                   perceived by any other sense or in any other manner, it must be the evidence

                   of witness who says he perceived it by that sense or in that manner; if it refers

                   to an opinion or the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the

                   evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.

                   have seen the same and oral evidence of that witness as given by him is

                   considered as primary evidence. Testimony of the person based on opinion of

                   another person is inadmissible in the absence of examination of the informant

                   as a witness. Therefore, the testimony of P.W.1 regarding the stand taken by

                   him qua the sales statistics would be inadmissible in evidence as the

                   person who had signed Ex.P7 was examined. Thus, in terms of <a href="/doc/487818/" id="a_83">Section 65</a> of

                   the Indian Evidence Act, the secondary evidence would be inadmissible in the

                   absence of an explanation given in support of non-examination of the authors

                   of Ex.P3 and Ex.P7. In terms of <a href="/doc/850939/" id="a_84">Section 66</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, the

                   secondary evidence of the contents of the documents refer to Section 65

                   Clause (a) shall not be given unless the party proposing to give such

                   secondary evidence as previously given to the party in whose possession or

                   power the document is such notice to produce it as it prescribed by law and if

                   no notice is prescribed by law, then such notice if the Court considers

                   reasonable under the circumstances of the case.       Thus, the settled legal

                   position is that mere production and marking of a document as exhibit by the

                   Court cannot be held to be a due proof of its contents but the situation may be

                   difficult where the documents are marked with consent.          Therefore, the

                   learned senior counsel for the respondent is right in his submission that both

                   the documents, namely, Ex.P3 and Ex.P7 marked through P.W.1 are

                   inadmissible as he had no personal knowledge about the contents nor he had

                   Mohan Kumar who deposed that he had been purchasing his needs from

                   M/s.Mariappan Wholesale Traders at Mannady, Chennai. The said witness

                   was a salesman in slippers. He has stated that P.W.5 is his friend and he knew

                   him because he purchased things from his shop. Further he stated that he had

                   deposed on a request made by P.W.5, he has never deposed as a witness in any

                   other proceedings of complaint with respect to confusion of food products.

                   Thus, it could be seen that the evidence of P.W.6 apart from being vague

                   could easily be stated to have been at the instance of P.W.5 who is the

                   wholesale dealer dealing with the plaintiff's products and as rightly

                   contended, the evidence of P.W.6 cannot be the sole reason to hold that the

                   'MAGIC' from the Chambers dictionary to mean marvelous and exciting

                   from the new Shorter ... Oxford dictionary to mean superlatively good,

                   excellent, fantastic. Therefore, the word 'MAGIC' is undoubtedly laudatory.

                   Equally right is the learned Single Bench in coming to the conclusion upon

                   consideration of the evidence placed on record that both the words 'MAGIC'

                   and 'MAGICAL' are common to trade, more particularly, in the food industry.

                   In the light of the law which we had referred supra, if the word 'MAGIC' is

                   common to trade, none can claim any proprietary interest over such

                   expression. The word MASALA is extensively used in India and describes

                   Indian spices and obviously the plaintiff cannot claim any exclusive right

                   over the word 'MAGIC' nor had they claimed in the present proceedings.

                   Then what would be the combination 'MAGIC MASALA' or 'MAGICAL

                   MASALA'. 'MAGIC' and 'MAGICAL' is to denote something in superlative

                   being excellent, cut above the rest, etc. By adding the prefix 'MAGIC' or

                   'MAGICAL' before MASALA is with an intention to give twist to the spice

                   which is provided to the customer in a sachet packed and sealed and kept

                   inside the package containing uncooked raw bland noodles. The package also

                   consists instructions to the customer as to how the noodles has to be cooked

                   and at what stage, the masala which is contained in the sachet has to be

                   added. On the plaintiff's own showing, they have different types of masalas,

                   there were three variants of masalas which were packed as sachets and kept

                   inside the packing containing raw noodles. They being CLASSIC MASALA,

                   for protection of the mark CLASSIC MASALA OR CHINESE MASALA.

                   The answer to this obviously should be in the negative as no person can claim

                   exclusive right over the word CLASSIC or for that matter CHINESE. The

                   plaintiff's conceived the term MAGIC MASALA as a sub-brand. Therefore,

                   if we were to accede to the case of the plaintiff by observing that they are

                   entitled for protection of the word MAGIC MASALA, it will fall fowl of the

                   plaintiff is the prior user of the word MAGIC MASALA for instant noodles.

                   MASALA is a word which denotes Indian spices and condiments and no

                   person can claim exclusivity over the said word/expression.         The word

                   MAGIC/MAGICAL are laudatory in character, exclusivity can be claimed by

                   none. Therefore, the combination of the word MAGIC MASALA/MAGICAL

                   MASALA can never be entitled to protection. Therefore the findings of the

                   learned Single Bench that the plaintiff is the prior user of the word MAGIC

                   MASALA for instant noodles can hardly be a reason to accord protection to

                   the plaintiff to use the same as a trademark and maintain a passing off action

                   against the respondent. The learned Single Bench has rightly concluded that

                   the respondent/defendant is the prior user of the word MAGIC and they have

                   proved by document during trail that they have been using the word in several

                   of the food products, substitutes and additives, etc. Therefore, the ultimate

                   the impugned judgment requires to be set aside.          In support of such

                   contention, reliance was placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

                   in the case of Sebastiao Luis Fernandes and the decision in the case of

                   'MAGIC MASALA', therefore, decided to use 'MAGICAL MASALA', the

                   Court erred in holding that the appellant is not entitled to succeed in the

                   passing off action as there is no passing off by the respondent. Though the

                   misrepresentation to ride upon the alleged reputation and goodwill of the

                   inroad into the food industry, particularly, in the instant noodles. There is also

                   an observation that the product of the appellant was successful and that the

                   respondent was inspired by the expression 'MAGIC MASALA'. Further, it is

                   by the plaintiff as there is no flavour known to the word which is called

                   'MAGIC', however the Court proceeded to hold that 'MAGIC MASALA',

                   'CLASSIC MASALA' and 'CHINESE MASALA' were used to describe the

                   name of the flavour and not the sub brand and accordingly answered issue

                   SCC 257], while concluding held that the appellant has used the expression

                   'MAGIC MASALA' in a laudatory manner to praise the masala in the sachet

                   and such laudatory epithet cannot be given monopoly or protection as has

                   been held by Courts. Further, it is submitted that in paragraph No.242 of the

                   impugned judgment, there is an observation that had the respondent not used

                   the word 'MAGICAL MASALA', the appellant/plaintiff could have perhaps at

                   a later point of time made a claim that the expression 'MAGIC MASALA' had

                   become distinctive and therefore was entitled for a monopoly. Though there

                   was such an observation, in paragraph No.226 the Court held that the

                   appellant/plaintiff did not intend to use 'MAGIC MASALA' as trademark or

                   sub-brand. Further, the Court ought to have seen that the suit was for a

                   fulfilled the trinity test as pointed out in P.Sulochana Bai, it has been held

                   that passing off in common law is considered to be a right for protection of

                   goodwill in the business against misrepresentation caused in the course of

                   trade and for prevention of resultant damage on account of the said

                   misrepresentation. The three elements are (1) goodwill owned by a trader, (2)

                   misrepresentation and (3) damage to goodwill. What is important in the case

                   on hand is whether on account of use of the words 'MAGIC MASALA' did

                   the appellant acquire goodwill. As observed earlier, the appellant did not use

                   masala in a separately sealed sachet kept inside the packed noodles. The oral

                   and documentary evidence which the appellant heavily relies upon is with

                   regard to goodwill which they have established for their SUNFEAST YIPPEE

                   products. There is no acceptable evidence to show that the goodwill and

                   reputation said to have been earned by the appellant was relatable to the

                   words 'MAGIC MASALA'. If such is the position then there can be no

                   damage to any goodwill on account of the word 'MAGIC MASALA'. If that

                   is so, the appellant should have established that they acquired goodwill for

                   CLASSIC MASALA, they acquired goodwill for CHINESE MASALA as

                   well. The case of the appellant as could be seen from the plaint and the

                   evidence of P.W.1 is that they have made a dent in the instant noodles market.

                   This claim made by the appellant has not been established to be on account of

                   use of the words 'MAGIC MASALA'. As observed by the learned Single

                   Bench there is absolutely no similarity in the packing. The appellant would

                   state that they have filed a suit on account of the phonetic similarity between

                   the word 'MAGIC' and 'MAGICAL'. However, we find that the case as

                   pleaded in the plaint, more particularly, in paragraph No18 is that the

                   defendant's mark is visually, phonetically and deceptively similar.            The

                   learned Single Bench on considering the facts on record, wrappers, lettering,

                   the colour scheme found that there is no similarity, much less deceptive

                   similarity. Consequently, there can be no visual similarity. The claim of

                   phonetic similarity can arise only if the plaintiff has established the case that

                   the word 'MAGIC MASALA' is a trademark or it is a sub-brand. In the

                   course of our discussion, we have upheld the finding of the learned Single

                   Bench that the appellant did not used the words 'MAGIC MASALA' as a sub-

                   brand but only as a flavour descriptor. This finding is deducible from the

                   plaintiff's own case that there are three variants of masala. Therefore, they

                   can never plead the case that the words 'MAGIC MASALA', 'CLASSIC

                   MASALA' and 'CHINESE MASALA' are sub brands and they are entitled for

                   protection. CLASSIC, MAGIC and CHINESE are all prefixes attached to the

                   word MASALA to indicate the flavour of the masala inside the sachet.

                   Therefore, not one of the three trinity tests have been fulfilled by the

                   appellant and therefore, the learned Single Bench rightly dismissed the suit.

                   argues that the finding is contrary to those observations. In our considered

                   view the procedure adopted by the appellant is a thorough misreading of the

                   impugned judgment. It is a cardinal legal principle that the judgment has to

                   be read as a whole and if it is done, the ultimate conclusion arrived at by the

                   learned Single Bench is to deny relief to the appellant on the ground that they

                   were not entitled to the reliefs pleaded, not established a case for passing off,

                   not established a case of malafide use of the alleged sub brand of the

                   recognition of the mark among consumers and the extra earning power that it

                   generates. So far as a well known mark, reputation is sufficient for passing

                   off action. In fact the High Court of Delhi has held that the mark “Maggi” is

                   a well known mark entitled for protection. The elements of goodwill are such

                   as Company's good reputation, loyal consumer base, brand identity and

                   recognition. Therefore, at best the appellant can state a case that they have

                   earned goodwill for M/s.ITC Limited, a Company which has earned

                   reputation and a loyal consumer base and on account of which they have

                   gained recognition. None of these features can be remotely relatable to the

                   words 'MAGIC MASALA'. On the own showing, the appellant's trademark is

                   ITC-SUNFEAST YIPPEE, the product is instant noodles, the flavour of the

                   the appellant to support their argument of malafide adoption of the mark. It

                   was contended that the respondent has offered no explanation whatsoever for

                   adoption of the mark 'MAGICAL MASALA' and they felt threatened, as

                   observed by the Court, that the appellant has made inroads into the market

                   and captured substantial instant noodles market share. The respondent has

                   been successful in establishing through documentary evidence before the

                   learned Single Bench that they have been using the word 'MAGIC' in several

                   of their products for several decades. The attempt of the appellant to get over

                   the same is by arguing that those products are not ready to eat food products

                   but are flavour enhancers, masalas, etc. Unfortunately, the test which the

                   appellant wants us to apply is a wrong test because admittedly the word

                   MAGIC has been used by the respondent in several of their products and all

                   are products used for food preparation which would fall within the same class

                   under the Act. In fact, it is the appellant who had failed to establish as to how

                   they zeroed in the words “MAGIC MASALA” when they were fully aware of

                   the position that the respondent was using the word “MAGIC” in several of

                   their products concerning the food industry. We can stretch the issue a little

                   further by going to the extent of making an observation that it is the

                   appellant's conduct which can be regarded as not bonafide as they have

                   sought to ride piggy back on the goodwill at the cost of the respondent.

                   Therefore, in our considered view the decision in the case of Needle

                   such principle has to be applied to the appellant/plaintiff because the

                   appellant has submitted before the Registrar of Trademarks with regard to

                   their right to use the mark SUNFEAST MILKY MAGIC which was

                   challenged by Parle Products Private Limited in a opposition proceedings.

                   The respondent has referred to the pleadings made in the said opposition

                   proceedings wherein they have contended that no single trader can

                   monopolize a common dictionary word which is used in a descriptive manner

                   by numerous traders. The respondent seeks to establish the said stand by

                   seeking to mark certain additional documents which appears to be not

                   disputed by the appellant as it is their own document available in the Registry

                   the application for marking additional documents at the appellate stage, yet

                   the Court can take judicial notice of certain admitted facts which are before

                   statutory authorities. The appellant resists the prayer for marking additional

                   such is the case pleaded by the appellant, then obviously the same plea will

                   hit against them as they have taken a plea that several traders are using the

                   and search on the website of the Trademark Registry revealed that there are

                   comprising of the word MAGIC in Class 29 and 30. In fact, the respondent

                   would contend that P.W.1 is guilty of committing acts of perjury on account

                   of making false deposition on oath in the present suit and according to the

                   respondent, this came to their notice only in the month of July 2020 while

                   examining the appeal paper book and in view of the misrepresentation and

                   false deposition given on behalf of the appellant, the appeal itself is liable to

                   survey was conducted by the National Opinion Polls [NOP] which conducted

                   essentially at random. The Court after considering the various questions

                   posed by the interviewers to the randomly selected public, it was held that in

                   the case of common or apt descriptive or laudatory words compelling

                   evidence is needed to establish distinctive character and in particular, mere

                   where the plaintiff was the first to introduce their product with a coined name

                   'Oven Chips'. The question was whether it had acquired distinctiveness and

                   whether the defendant's adoption of that name in conjunction with their brand

                   name sufficiently distinguishing was entitled for an injunction. It was held

                   term, wherein it was held that when a name, truly descriptive of an article, has

                   always been associated with the particular name of the manufacturer, then a

                   monopoly of the name of the article, apart from the name of the manufacturer,

                   is almost impossible to acquire; and, accordingly, it is almost impossible to

                   succeed in a passing-off action, the substantial ground of which would be the

                   assumed possession of such a monopoly.

                   filed against the defendant at that time inspite of the fact that the plaintiffs

                   had already filed application in 1995 for registration of its trademark in India.

                   In the plaint, it was alleged that they came to know about the use of the

                   trademark “FLEXGRIP” in India in the last week of July 1999 only. It was

                   held that the word “FLEX” and “GRIP” are descriptive words

                   and while taking this opinion one is also influenced by the fact that the

                   word“FLEXGRIP” is descriptive in nature because of the use of the word

                   “GRIP” that too used in relation to pens and other writing instruments. The

                   question which fell for consideration was whether there would be confusion

                   and deception in the minds of the customers and the Court compared the

                   complete trademark in totality and held that confusion is unlikely. The Court

                   held that the trade names of the product of the parties to be compared are

                   'LUXOR PAPER MATE FLEXGRIP' vs. 'EKCO FLEX GRIP' and not

                   FLEXGRIP alone; the word 'FLEX' and 'GRIP' are descriptive words; it was

                   unlikely that consumers would be confused when the two marks are

                   compared.

                   for registration of the unused trademark 'MAGIC SAFE' in in respect of safes,

                   cash safes, etc. It was refused by the hearing officer on the ground that the

                   word 'Magic' was laudatory and the mark did not qualify for registration

                   under <a href="/doc/529244/" id="a_104">Section 9(1)(d)</a> or 10 of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_105">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1938 (as amended). The

                   applicants appealed to the Secretary of State. The application was refused

                   holding that the word 'Magic' was plainly being used as a laudatory epithet

                   for the goods and would be seen as such and did not qualify for registration.

                   It was further held that once it was recognized that 'Magic' was a laudatory

                   epithet there could be no assurance, prima facie, that other honest traders

                   might not be embarrassed by registration of the mark.

                   has been held that MAGIC is a very well known word and is not directly

                   descriptive of any aspect of the goods claimed and it is very much in doubt

                   that realistically it will be seen by purchasers of the goods sold under the

                   mark as an indication that the goods are of superior quality. In relation to the

                   goods claimed, the word MAGIC was to be seen as purely fanciful and non-

                   descriptive. Reference has been made to Collins English Dictionary which

                   includes among the meanings of 'Magic': - 'Any mysterious or extraordinary

                   quality or power'. The word is used from time to time in a figurative sense to

                   describe anything which operates in such a novel, fast or effective way that it

                   appears to operate 'by magic'. Reference was made to a Dictionary of Slang

                   and Unconventional English (8th Edition) published by Routledge, Keegan

                   and Paul Inc. in 1984 which defines “MAGIC” as Excellent; first rate;
