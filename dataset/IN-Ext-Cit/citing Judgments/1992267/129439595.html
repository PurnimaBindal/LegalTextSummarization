follows:

Gurudijhatia in Cuttack district and, accordingly, the Department of

Energy, Government of Odisha had approved the acquisition of private

land in March, 2007. The Department of Revenue &amp; Disaster

Management pursuant to such an administrative approval had issued

a notification under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_1">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894

(hereinafter referred to as the '<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_2">L.A. Act</a>'). It is admitted that certain

objections were raised before the Collector, Cuttack. During hearing of

objections and as a consequence of which, the said notification under

Under cover of their letter dated 19.02.2008, the IPICOL enclosed a

copy of the land schedule to the Department of Energy and the

Department of Energy on 26.06.2008 issued an administrative

approval "for acquisition of private land for the purpose of power

plant proposed by the KVK". The administrative approval was for

acquisition of private land measuring 548.38 acres in the specified

four villages of Athagarh Tahasil of Cuttack district and it is further

stated that the acquisition of private land was for the purpose of

proposed power plant project of KVK. After the administrative

approval was accorded, a fresh notice under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_4">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act was thereafter issued by the Revenue &amp; Disaster

namely, Damodar Chaini, petitioner in the writ petition i.e. W.P.(C)

No.17476 of 2009 filed a detailed objection which would be dealt with

separately. But, it is important to take note herein that the said

objector did, in fact, participate at the hearing. Out of the 62

objectors, 47 attended the hearing and the 15 who did not participate

at the hearing, sought for adjournment on the ground of non-

availability of the lawyer on the said date. After conclusion of the

hearing, the records of the proceedings were duly sent to the State

Government along with the report of the Collector, Cuttack. The report

of the Collector as well as the objections filed by the land losers and

objectors were duly considered by the State Government and before

acquisition of land, the State Government carried out a "socio-

economic survey" in view of the direction issued by this Court vide its

order dated 27.11.2008 passed in W.P.(C) No.16822 of 2008. The

report of the Collector after conclusion of the hearing under Section 5-

A is extracted herein below:

         time petitions were not considered keeping in view
         the time stipulation provided in the Act. For each

</p><p id="p_70">The petitioners/land owners present in the hearing
were heard individually with reference to their
individual petitions. Perusal of the petitions filed
U/s. 5-A and time petitions filed by some land
owners revealed that all most all are computer
generated applications with identical claims
containing signatures of petitioners/Land owners at
the bottom. However, the individual objection co-
relating land acquisition in all the villages appear to
have one tenor in its spirit. The objections filed
appear to have its genesis more in apprehension and
public rumor that in reality. In any land acquisition,
for any purpose common apprehension expressed by
the petitioners are but obvious, as the rural
agricultural land owners are going to lose their
ancestral land during acquisition. However, R. &amp; R.
Policy, 2006 which is said to be the best R &amp; R
Policy, in the country can redress the grievances of
the petitioners/land owners through its meaningful
implementation.

<p id="p_79">Category-I- Challenge to Land Acquisition Proceedings

</p><p id="p_80">11.       The petitioners have raised the contention that the State

Government should have acquired the land under Part-VII and not

part-II of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and acquiring the land under

Part-II   amounts to a "colourable exercise of power" by the State

Government for the benefit of a private party namely KVK.

</p><p id="p_81">12.       A further issue raised by the petitioners in this batch of writ

petitions was that the Collector forwarded his report but, without

assigning any detailed reason for each individual case as required

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_14">Section    5-A</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, which grossly violates

the rights of the petitioners and, therefore, defeats the independent

application of mind by the State and consequently vitiates the entire

</p>
<p id="p_94">14.      The facts that have been highlighted by the petitioner in

support of their aforesaid contentions is that KVK had on its own

selected site and made a request to the Government of Odisha, IPICOL

and IDCO requesting the said land be acquired and administrative

approval for acquisition was granted for KVK alone. Therefore, the

administrative approval being the foundation of all subsequent steps

taken in the acquisition of land by the Government, the acquisition

was for a specific company at its cost and, therefore, such acquisition

for a company cannot come within the definition of public purpose

under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_24">section 3(f)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act (As amended in 1984)

since, from the date of the 1984 amendment, acquisition for

"companies" is expressly barred from the scope of "public purpose".

</p><p id="p_95">15.       The next contention raised by the petitioner in this respect

is that IDCO, a creature of the State Legislature and corporation of

the State is bound by the statute i.e. IDCO Act and Rules thereunder

and acquisition can only be made by IDCO for the purpose of setting

up and "industrial area" which is declared to be industrial area by the

State Government by notification. It is alleged that no such

notification has been issued by the Government of Odisha declaring
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                     20</span>


the acquired area as an industrial area and, therefore, IDCO was not

competent to seek such acquisition under its authority of law and

further that the acquisition of land on the basis of requisition made by

the IDCO is merely a cloak to give benefit of part-II of the Land

Acquisition Act to a private company for which it is not otherwise

entitled. In this respect reliance is placed on the following judgments:

<p id="p_96">Submissions of learned Advocate General

</p><p id="p_97">16.       It is submitted by the learned Advocate General that the

State is committed to encouraging the Private Sectors to set up Power

Plant for meeting the needs of the State Industrial Sector and for

domestic consumption. Therefore, acquisition for such purpose

satisfies the requirements of the definition under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_31">Section 3</a> (f) of the

<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_32">Land Acquisition Act</a> i.e. "public purpose". It is asserted that the term

"public purpose" is an "inclusive definition" and setting up of a

thermal power plant by a private entrepreneur, definitely comes within

the definition of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_33">Section 3</a> (f) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_34">Land Acquisition Act</a>. It is further

submitted that the acquisition in the present case has been made for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                    21</span>


and on behalf of IDCO, a Government of Orissa Statutory Corporation.

Therefore, under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_35">Section 3</a> (f) (iv) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_36">Land Acquisition Act</a> acquiring

land for the purpose of a Corporation owned or controlled by the State

is sufficient for the applicability of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_37">Section 3</a> (f) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_38">Land Acquisition

Act</a>. On a perusal of the notification made under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_39">Sections 4(1)</a> and

<a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_40">6(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act and the said declaration it would be

clear that the entire land acquisition proceedings falls under Part II of

the Land Acquisition Act and not Part-VII of the Land Acquisition Act

as alleged by the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_98">          It is further highlighted by the Advocate General that the

MOU entered into between the State of Orissa and KVK contains

various salient features which are in the interest of the State and its

people at large. Setting up of a thermal power plant would be

beneficial to the State which is power deficient. In this regard, learned

Advocate General has placed reliance on certain clauses of the MoU,

which are quoted herein below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">          "1(i) Power generated in excess of 80% Plant Load
          Factor (PLF) from the Thermal Power Plant will be
          made available to the State by KNPL at variable cost
          plus incentive (the incentive would be as fixed by
          Central Electricity Regulatory Commission).
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">          (iii) A nominated agency(s) authorized by Government
          will have the right to purchase up to 25% of power sent
          out from the Thermal Power Plant(s) excluding the
          quantum of power indicated at item (i) &amp; (ii) under
          terms of Power Purchase Agreement to be mutually
          agreed upon on the basis of existing laws and
          regulations in force and the tariff for such power
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                 22</span>


          purchase will be determined by the appropriate
          Regulatory Commission."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_99">17.       It is further submitted on behalf of the State that the

allegation that the KVK has paid the cost of the land, is wholly false

and incorrect. Reference is made to Section-20 of the Industrial

Infrastructure Developments Corporation Act, 1980 (IDCO Act), which

is as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">          "20. Corporation's fund- The Corporation shall have
                and maintain its own fund, to which shall be
                credited-
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">          (a) all amounts received by the Corporation from the
          State Government by way of grants, subventions,
          loans, advances or otherwise;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">          (b) all fees, costs and charges received by the
          Corporation under this Act;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">          (c) all amounts received by the Corporation from the
          disposal of lands, buildings and other properties
          movable and immovable and other transactions;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">          (d) all amounts received by the Corporation by way of
          rents and profits or in any other manner or from any
          other source;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">          (e) all amounts received by the Corporation from
          Government undertakings, companies, Financial
          Institutions, Commercial Banks or from any other
          source."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_100">18.       Therefore, the learned Advocate General submits once

payment is made by the KVK to the IDCO, such payments made by

KVK get merged with IDCO's fund and consequently becomes part of

the Corporation's fund. Therefore, any money paid to the Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                   23</span>


by IDCO for the land acquisition comes only from the funds of the

Corporation. Reliance was also placed on Section 6(1)(ii) Explanation-2

of the Land Acquisition Act, which is quoted hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">          "Section-6(1)(ii)   Explanation-2      of   the    Land
          Acquisition Act provides that "where the compensation
          to be awarded for such property is to be paid out of the
          funds of a Corporation owned or controlled by the
          State, such compensation shall be deemed to be
          compensation paid out of public revenues."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_101">19.       Therefore, it is submitted that the IDCO being a State

Corporation, the funds of IDCO is a "public fund" and consequently

since no payment has been received by the State Government from the

KVK and payments instead have only been received from IDCO,

therefore, Part-VII of the Land Acquisition Act has no application and

there is no violation of the condition imposed under Part-II. It is

further submitted that the acquisition of land for IDCO under Para-II

of the Land Acquisition Act and lease thereof to KVK thereafter, is fully

justified in the facts and circumstances of the present case and there

in fact is "no colourable exercise of power". In this context, reliance is

placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court i.e. (i) (2003) 10

SCC 626-Pratibha Nema and (ii) (2010) 10 SCC 282-Nand Kishore

Gupta.
</p>
<p id="p_102">          It is further submitted that the term "public purpose" as

defined in <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_41">Section 3(f)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act has to be interpreted

as an "inclusive definition" and has to be given the widest meaning.

</p><p id="p_103">                       Reliance is also placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

</blockquote><p id="p_110">Land Matters
          The genesis of the land matter arises from a
Writ petition filed in W.P.(C) 16822/08 before the
Hon'ble High Court of Odisha, seeking a direction to
the State Government in Revenue &amp; D.M. Department
not to give protection U/s.73(c) of OLR Act in favour of
KVK Nilachal Power, as well as a direction to both Sub-
Collector and Tahasildar, Athagarh to initiate
proceedings against the said company under the
relevant provisions of the OLR Act. The Hon'ble High
Court of Odisha was pleased to dispose of the writ
petition on 27.11.2008 with a direction to the
petitioners to move a representation before the
appropriate authority to ventilate the grievances.
</p><p id="p_111">          In their representation the prime contention
alludes to following:
</p><p id="p_112">          That the company has purchased land
directly from the farmers prior to the notification U/S
73(c) of OLR Act and violating the provisions of Sec.22
of the said Act.</p><pre id="pre_8">
FOREST &amp; ENVIRONMENT
          The    petitioners   also   allege   regarding
</pre><p id="p_113">acquisition and alienation of both Government and
non-Government land which are Forest land. They
contend that the project area is surrounded with forest
land and especially by Reserved Forest. Further they
have contended about the existence of an Elephant
corridor.
</p><p id="p_114">          It is further contended that the proposed
Thermal Power Plant will affect the inhabitants living
around with heat, ash, coal dust and other chemicals.
Topography &amp; Cropping Pattern
          The petitioners have alleged that the project
site and its surrounding areas have perennial water
sources which naturally irrigate agricultural land in
Dalua, Kanderai and Rehangola villages. The
representation also refers to 2 Lift Irrigation points
inside the project site capable of irrigating more than
100 acres of land. The land also yields two crops a year
and such land should not be acquired for industries.
Socio-economic issues
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                        28</span>


           The petitioners emphasized that 62% of the

who will not only be deprived of their livelihood but
also rendered landless.

FINDINGS

A.   LAND MATTERS
           The main allegation in land matter is that the
company has purchased land directly from farmers
before the notification by Govt. u/s.73(c) of OLR Act
and that the company has also purchased land from
SC &amp; ST persons in violation of Sec.22 of the said Act.
</p><p id="p_116">           On perusal of records of Tahasil Office, it is
found that the President of Charidesh Krushaka
Sangha Sri Narayana Sahoo had filed a grievance
before the Tahasildar, Athagarh toi execute the order of
the Hon'ble High Court dated 27.11.2008 vide W.P.(C)
No.16822 of 2008. The main concern of the grievance
was initiation of ceiling case under chapter 4 of the
O.L.R. Act, 1960 against M/s. K.V.K. Nilachala Power
Pvt. Ltd., who has purchased private land directly
before obtaining the permission under 73(C) of O.L.R.
Act.
</p><p id="p_117">           It was ascertained that the Company has
purchased a total area of Ac.188.37 dec. of land
without any statutory authority for which Rev. Misc.
Case vide No.27/08-09 was initiated on 07.01.2009
after following the direction of the Hon'ble High Court
in W.P.(C) 16822 of 2008.
</p><p id="p_118">           Further on 16.12.2009 basing on the report
of R.I.Khuntuni a ceiling case under O.L.R. Act.
bearing No.1/2009 was initiated, as the entire area
owned by the authorized officer M/s. K.V.K. Power Pvt.
Ltd. is more than 10 standard acre. The authorized
Officer of the company was directed to file return in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                        29</span>


Form No.12 u/s.40(A) of O.L.R. Act. Subsequently a
W.P.(C) bearing No.19908 of 2009 has been filed by the
company and interim stay was granted by the Hon'ble
High Court till 21.01.2010. Further in Misc. Case
No.17266 of 2009 on dated 04.02.2010, Hon'ble High
Court has suspended the notice dated 16.12.2009
u/s.40(A) of O.L.R. Act of the Tahasildar till next date.
Further progress in the OLR Case will depend on the
disposal of the case pending on the Hon'ble High
Court.
</p><p id="p_119">           The next allegation is that the company has
violated Section 22 of Orissa Land Reforms Act (OLR
Act) where by it has purchased land directly from SC &amp;
ST persons without obtaining permission from the
competent authority. On verification of the records and
report of the Sub-Collector, it is ascertained that the
company has not executed a single sale deed in the
Sub-registrar's Office regarding purchase of land by
the company from any SC &amp; ST persons directly.
However, the company has entered in to an agreement
with 3 farmers belonging to SC &amp; ST community for
purchase of 4.92 Ac. Land but no sale deed has been
executed. Hence Section 22 of OLR Act has not been
violated.
</p><p id="p_120">           It is further ascertained that the Government
of Odisha in Revenue &amp; D.M. Department have issued
notification under 4(1) of the L.A.Act, on 11.7.08. In
respect of Khanduali, Rahanagol, Kandarei and Dalua
villages. Consequently 62 nos. of objections, including
8 petitioners, were filed under <a href="/doc/66420479/" id="a_47">Section 5-</a>'A' of the said
Act. The entire hearing by the Collector, Cuttack has
been video recorded and submitted along with the
proceedings       to the     Government     in Rev. &amp;
D.M.Department, Thereafter, declaration U/S6(1) of <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_48">LA
Act</a> have been notified by the Government in respect of
these 4 villages. The present land acquisition process
is being carried on in accordance with law except for
the land which the company has directly purchased.
B. FOREST &amp; ENVIRONMENT
           The petitioners have alleged that the
company have proposed to acquire 207.69 Ac. of non-
Govt. forest land and 192.90 Ac of forest land. The
DFO, Athagarh who was present during the inquiry
informed that the Project is not a part of the Reserve
Forest. This has been de-notified vide Government of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                         30</span>


Orissa Notification No.16282-'D' dt.30.10.1953. The
land classified as Gramya Jungle comes to only 125.85
Ac. For which the requisitioning authority has
submitted proposal for forest diversion.
</p><p id="p_121">          Further there is no Elephant corridor inside
the project area. The nearest Elephant corridor has
been identified near Dabagadia which is about 5.5 kms
from the project area.
</p><p id="p_122">          As regards concerns of the petitioners
regarding pollution and possible impact of the project
on the environment, M/s.KVK Nilachal Power Pvt. Ltd
has already been given Environment clearance by the
Ministry of Environment and Forest vide their letter
No.J-13011/51/08-1A II(T) dt.18.2.09.
</p>
<p id="p_123">C. Topography &amp; Cropping Pattern
           The petitioners have alleged that the project
area and its surrounding area have a perennial water
source which naturally irrigate agricultural land in
Dalua, Kanderi and Rahangola villages, It is a fact that
the Barajora Nala drainage system passes through the
proposed plant site and the existing drain runs
through flat terrain without embankments on any side.
The Company i.e. KVK Nilachal Power Pvt. Ltd. has
submitted a proposal to the E.E., Drainage Division,
Cuttack to divert the drain outside, adjoining the
boundary of the acquired area. The company has
agreed to pay the direct and indirect expenses to be
incurred for its construction, maintenance and
monitoring of the system, along with any land
acquisition further required for the purpose.
</p><p id="p_124">           There were two LI points in the project area.
The villagers informed that since people are not taking
any interest in agriculture, the two LI points have been
defunct and damaged. The petitioners have alleged
that the area produces two crops and it is a irrigated
area. It is ascertained from the revenue records that
this is a rain-fed area and there is no regular irrigation
source other than two defunct LI points. Generally,
farmers grow paddy during Khariff season and
vegetable in Rabi season. It is not an Irrigated area.
Since the drain will not be affected by the company as
it will be properly relocated, the farmers will not be
affected from the Irrigation benefit they derive from this
drain.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                        31</span><p id="p_125">


D. Socio-economic Issues
          The petitioners have alleged that this
Panchayat has 62% of the population belonging to SC
&amp; ST. However, as per 2001 census figures the total
number of SC population inhabiting in the 4 villages
notified for the company by the Government in
Revenue &amp; D.M. Department is 9.6% only and the S.T.
population 38.8%. Adequate compensation under the
provisions of Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy
2006 of Govt. of Odisha will address such grievances
and also augment their general standard of living
through employment generation.
</p><p id="p_126">          Out of the total project area of 975.00 Ac, the
SC &amp; ST population only occupy 120 Ac. of land. All
these people who will be losing land would be getting
permanent jobs in the company as per the
Rehabilitation &amp; Resettlement Police, 2006 of
Government of Orissa. Under this policy, the
Rehabilitation &amp; Periphery Development Advisory
Committee will be constituted which shall look into all
local needs of the villagers including roads,
communication, health, education etc.
          During my inquiry, a large number of
villagers   including    the    Sarapanch      and    the
representatives of Charidesha Krushak Sangha were
present. The Charidesha Krushak Sangha is an
Organization registered in 2009 although the company
has started its activities in 2008. Although the
Charidesha Krushak Sangha is agitating for some good
causes, they have very few supporters. The genuine
concerns expressed by them are being adequately
taken care of, but some concerns are without basis.
Almost all the villagers present during my inquiry
supported the project as it will improve the socio-
economic condition and provide employment to the
local people. Since, in Orissa we have R &amp; R Police,
2006 under which RPDAC is functioning, local needs
can easily be addressed.

</p><p id="p_129">23.      The Learned Advocate General placed reliance on the

"Industrial Policy Resolution of the State of Orissa, 2007" and the

definition of the term "Infrastructure Project" as found in Annexure-1

thereof at Clause-10, which is quoted hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">                "10. "Infrastructure Project" means roads,

</p><p id="p_131">         Further reliance was placed on Clauses-1.6, 9, 9.1, 9.3, 16,

16.3 &amp; 16.6 of the Industrial Policy Resolution, 2007, which are

quoted hereunder:
</p>

</pre><p id="p_135">24.       Placing reliance on the above and, in particular, that the

State in its Industrial Policy Resolution has declared "power plant", as

"infrastructure project", there can be no doubt whatsoever that setting

up of a power plant sub-serves "public purpose" and clearly the

acquisition of land for an "infrastructure project" i.e. production of

power by KVK cannot but be held to be covered by <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_49">Section 3(f)</a> of the

Land Acquisition Act. Consequently, acquisition under Part-II of the

Land Acquisition Act cannot be faulted.
</p>
<p id="p_136">          The Learned Advocate General further stated that the State

only provides the land for "public purpose" through IDCO and whether

the KVK purchased additional land on its own is not a criteria to be

taken into consideration while challenging the act of acquisition of

land under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_50">Land Acquisition Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_137">Submissions of IDCO

</p><p id="p_138">25.       Mr. Jagannath Patnaik, learned Senior Advocate appearing

for the IDCO confined his argument to the cases under category-I

relating to the validity and legality of the land acquired under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_51">Land

Acquisition Act</a>, 1894. He submitted that the Orissa Industrial

Infrastructure Development Corporation Act, 1980 was set up by the

State of Orissa and is guided by the both Act, 1980 and rules framed

thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_139">          The Corporation was established for development of
Industrial Infrastructure in the State of Orissa. The State of Orissa
entered into an MoU with various companies including KVK and the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                  35</span>


State Government directed IDCO to develop the infrastructure for
establishment of industries in the State serving public interest and
more importantly, to support the industries establishing Power Plants
which would be then required to sell part of power production to the
State Government. Since KVK wanted to establish a coal based power
plant in the State of Orissa, the said company applied to the State
Government and the State Government forwarded the application to
the High Level Clearance Committee constituted under Section 3 of the
Orissa Industries (Facilitation) Act, 2004. The said High Level
Industries Clearance Authority cleared the proposal of the company
and directed administrative department to do the needful for
establishment of the power plant. In view of the MoU entered into
between the State and KVK and in view of the fact that certain clauses
of MoU required KVK to supply a portion of the power generated by its
plant to the State. The said terms of the MoU and the State being
requirements of power directed IDCO to take necessary steps in the
matter. Mr. Patnaik placed reliance Section 31 of the IDCO Act, 1980,
which reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">                 "31. Acquisition of land: (1) Whenever any

the L.A. Act has been issued. It is submitted that <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_59">Section 6-A</a> of the

L.A. Act provides for a declaration to be made by the Government that

a particular land is made for a "public purpose" or for a company. It is

for a company then such declaration shall be subject to the provisions

of Part-VII of the Act which provides under the heading "Acquisition of

land for Companies". Thus, <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_60">Section 6</a> of L.A. Act makes an apparent

distinction between acquisition of a land for a "public purpose" and

acquisition for a company. He further submitted that there is an

important and crucial second proviso to <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_61">Section 6</a> of the L.A. Act which

has a immense bearing on the issues raised by the petitioners on the

question whether the acquisition is for a "public purpose" or for a

company. In this respect, he placed reliance on Section-6 (Second

Proviso) read with Explanation-2, which is quoted hereunder:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">         "Second Proviso of Section-6.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_63">                  "............ no such declaration shall be made
         unless the compensation to be awarded for such
         property is to be paid by a company, or wholly or partly
         out of public revenues or some fund controlled or
         managed by a local authority."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                  37</span>


<blockquote id="blockquote_64">                   Explanation 2 to the proviso has made it
         clear that where compensation to be awarded is to be
         paid out of the funds of a Corporation owned or
         controlled by the State, such compensation shall be
         deemed to be compensation paid out of public
         revenues."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_141">27.        Thus payment of compensation wholly or partly out of

public revenues is mandatory for making a declaration to the effect

that the particular land is needed for public purpose. In the present

case declaration has been made under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_62">Section 6</a> that the land is

needed for public purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_142">28.       Learned counsel for the IDCO asserts that in the present

case, since the entire compensation amount was paid for by IDCO, it

has to be "deemed" that it is out of "public revenue" and, therefore, the

State issued the necessary declaration, that the particular land was

needed for "public purpose". In the present case, since a declaration

has been made under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_63">Section 6</a>, that the land is needed for "public

purpose", no challenge to the same on the purported ground of

"colorable exercise of power" can be entertained.

</p><p id="p_143">          Insofar as certain advances made by KVK to IDCO is

concerned, it is submitted that the corporation has paid the

administrative charges for the acquisition of land in question and has

also deposited the necessary compensation amount for the said

acquisition. In this respect, reliance was placed by Mr. Patnaik on the

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/37254300/" id="a_64">Smt.

<a href="/doc/1313008/" id="a_66">Sooraram Pratap Reddy and others vs. District Collector, Ranga

Reddy District and others</a>, (2008) 9 SCC 552. He submitted that in

the last judgment, the Hon'ble apex Court while interpreting the effect

of Explanation-2 of the Second proviso to <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_67">Section 6</a> of the L.A. Act,

once even a part of the compensation amount is paid for acquisition

from the fund of the State Corporation, the acquisition becomes for

"public purpose" and satisfies the definition of <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_68">Section 3(f)</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act. Therefore, he submits that no contention would

survive that Part-VII and not Part-II of the L.A. Act would be applicable

to the present case. Learned counsel for the IDCO further submitted

that while it is a fact that the KVK has advanced certain money to

IDCO towards advance lease premium, the same was credited to the

account of the Corporation and once such money is from became part

of the corporation's fund, it becomes the public fund and, therefore,

payment for compensation having been paid from out of public fund

satisfying the requirements of Explanation-2 under proviso-II of

<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_69">Section 6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act. Mr. Patnaik relies upon <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_70">Section

14</a>, <a href="/doc/1235658/" id="a_71">15(a)</a> and Section 31 of the OIIDC Act and submits that IDCO is

competent to acquire land for furtherance of the object of the said Act,

</p>
<p id="p_156">29.       Mr. Patnaik laid stress on Section 14 of the OIIDC Act and

submits that <a href="/doc/133862424/" id="a_73">Section 4(ii)</a> thereof, in particular, begins with the words

"in particular and without prejudice to the generality of clause (i)".

Therefore, he submits that all the instances cited in <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_74">Section 14(ii)</a>

ought to be treated as merely illustrative without in any manner

limiting the scope of sub-clause (i). In this respect, he placed reliance

on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/174507/" id="a_75">S.K.

Singh vs. V.V. Giri</a>, AIR 1970 SC 2097 (Para-39, 41) in particular,

wherein the Hon'ble apex Court came to hold that where such a

phrase is used in <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_76">Section 14(ii)</a> is concerned, it has been held that the

first part of the section is independent and is no way narrowed down

by the illustrations given in the second part of the said Section.

Therefore, he submits that the IDCO invoked its authority under

Section 31 of the OIIDC Act only after the State Government was duly

satisfied that the Corporation was unable to acquire the land by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                  41</span>


agreement and, therefore, it became necessary for to the Corporation

file a requisition for initiating process of land acquisition under the

<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_77">L.A. Act</a>, 1894. The act of making such a "requisition" itself,

presupposes that the Corporation having failed to acquire the land in

question by agreement has had to resort to seeking acquisition under

the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_78">L.A. Act</a>, 1894 and such Act on the part of the Corporation cannot

be held to be illegal or invalid or done in a manner which can be

described to be a "colorable exercise of power". He further submitted

that apart from the action of the IDCO under its statutory power, the

State Government issued Notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_79">Section 4</a> of the Land

Acquisition Act, which once again declares that the land in question is

required for establishment of industrial area by IDCO and, therefore,

there was no necessity of issuing any second notification notifying an

industrial area. In conclusion, it is submitted       that the land in

question was acquired by IDCO under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_80">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894

for "public purpose" for leasing the same to KVK for setting up of a

thermal power plant, which is declared to be an "infrastructure

project" under the IPR, 2007 and in terms of the MoU entered into

between the State and the KVK, the benefits of the plant would enure

to the benefit of the people of the State which is being starved of power

and consequently no allegation of "lack of public purpose" ought to be

entertained. He submits that the land in question has been leased in

favour of the KVK on various terms and conditions stipulates in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                   42</span>


lease agreement and no permanent interest for the land acquired has

been transferred in favour of KVK and in the event of any violation of

the terms of lease, it remains open to the IDCO to revoke the lease for

breach of any terms and conditions. Consequently, it cannot be said

that there has ever been any transfer of interest in the land in favour

of the KVK, apart from what is contained in the lease deed and the title

of such land continues to be vested in the State.

Submissions of KVK

</p><p id="p_157">30.       Mr. Pinaki Mishra, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the

KVK submits that the contentions of the petitioners pertaining to the

alleged illegalities committed in acquiring the land under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_81">L.A. Act</a>

are wholly, misconceived and baseless both in fact and law. It is

submitted on behalf of the KVK that, the acquisition in the present

case is clearly covered under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_82">Section 3(f)(iv)</a> and Part-II of the L.A. Act.

In terms of the notification issued under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_83">Sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_84">6</a> of the L.A.

Act, the acquisition of land by the State Government is for IDCO, for

setting up industry for public interest at the expense of Government.

Such acquisition of land is squarely covered by the definition of "public

purpose" under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_85">Section 3(f)(iv)</a>, Part-II of the L.A. Act namely the

provisions of land for a corporation owned or controlled by the State

Government.
</p>
<p id="p_158">          The acquisition would result in vesting the acquired land

with the Government and Government will become the owner of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                       43</span>


land and will give the same to IDCO on long term lease. In fact, the

Govt. has already given possession of part of the acquired land to

IDCO. IDCO in turn will sub-lease the land to the KVK for the

purpose of setting up the Thermal Power Plant for a fixed tenure on

payment of rent and premium, with onerous conditions including

covenants for forfeiture.
</p>
<p id="p_159">          It is submitted that the definition of "public purpose"

u/s3(1)(f) of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_86">LA Act</a> is an "inclusive" one and has been given a

very wide and broad meaning by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

various judgments. Therefore, the present acquisition, would be, in

any event, covered under the definition of "public purpose" and would

therefore fall under Part II of the LA Act.
</p>
<p id="p_160">          It was further submitted that the land was required for

setting up a 1200 MW Thermal Power Project by the KVK.

Undisputedly, "Power Plant" is an "Infrastructure Activity", covered

under     the   Industrial   Policy    Resolution     issued   by   the   State

Government and is therefore, for the benefit of the people of the

State.
</p>
<p id="p_161">          The KVK has executed a Memorandum of Understanding

("MOU")    dated    26.09.2007        (which   is   being   renewed/extended

annually) under which the Government has undertaken to provide

land to the KVK.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                  44</span><p id="p_162">


</p><p id="p_163">         Additionally   the MOU       dated 26.9.2006     in Clause (i)

stipulates that power will be made available to state at cheaper rate

i.e. only at 'variable cost' (which means non-recovery of 'fixed cost'). A

preferential right is given under Clause (ii) to State to purchase 25%

power. The KVK has executed a Power Purchase Agreement with Grid

Corporation of Orissa, dated 26.09.2006, for supplying 25% power.

The KVK has executed a Power Purchase Agreement with Grid

Corporation of Orissa, dated 26.9.2006, for supplying 25% of power

to be generated from the project at vastly concessional rates.

</p><p id="p_164">         The MOU also stipulates that in the maters of employment

preference will be given to people of Odisha and local people and the

KVK will make efforts for improving the skill levels of such persons.

This activity is being scrupulously pursued by the KVK.

</p><p id="p_165">         The power project would generate numerous direct and

indirect employment opportunities for the people of the State and is

in the larger interest of the people and economy of the state.

</p><p id="p_166">         In view of the above, it is asserted that setting up of the

present power plant is for a public purpose and is clearly covered by

the broad definition of "public purpose" under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_87">Section 3(I)(f)</a> of the LA

Act.
</p>
<p id="p_167">The KVK relies on the following judgments:-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                  45</span>


</p><p id="p_168">(i) Pratibha Nema and Ors. Vs. State of MP - (2003) 10 SCC 626-

    establishment was held to be public purpose.

</p><p id="p_172">31.       Insofar as the Involvement of KVK in the process of

acquisition is concerned, it is submitted that for setting up a power

plant of this magnitude (1200 MW) with an investment of Rs.4,990

crores, it is imperative that the location of land is suitable in the

sense of important parameters such as rail and road connectivity,

access to water, power evacuation facilities etc., which the KVK is

always in the best position to ascertain. That, however, does not

mean that the acquisition will lose its "public purpose" character.

</p><p id="p_173">32.       The further fact that the name of KVK is mentioned in

notices u/s.5-<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_88">A of the LA Act</a> is not a determinative factor, when

otherwise the facts of the present case, clearly establish that the

acquisition is under Part II of the Act. It is pertinent to mention that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                 46</span>


neither in <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_89">Section 4</a> nor in Section 6 Notification the name of the

KVK is mentioned.
</p>
<p id="p_174">33.     Insofar as the allegation of "colorable exercise of power" by

the State Government is concerned, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

various judgments including in Somawanti Vs. State of Punjab -

AIR 1963 SC 151 (quoted in Para 12 of Pratibha Nema case (supra)

has held that conclusiveness of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_90">Section 6</a> declaration is open to

challenge only on the ground of colourable exercise of power. It

is also settled law that in order to allege and establish malafides and

colourable exercise of power by the Govt. the burden is heavy on the

petitioners. In the present case, apart from merely using the

expression "colourable exercise of power", the petitioners have failed

to make out any case.
</p>
<p id="p_175">        The Hon'ble Supreme Court has further held in Para 119 of

Sooraram Pratap Reddy's case that "In our judgment, in

deciding whether the acquisition is for "public purpose" or not,

prima facie, the Government is the best judge. Normally, in such

matters, writ court will not interfere by substituting its

judgment for the judgment of the Government."

</p><p id="p_176">34.     Insofar as the payment of Compensation, it is stated that

the MoU executed between the KVK and State Government under

Clause 5.A(iv) provides that the KVK agrees to pay cost of the land to

IDCO in case the land is acquired for the purpose. In the present
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                 47</span>


case, admittedly, no payments have been made by the KVK to LAO.

All payments have been made by the KVK to IDCO and it is IDCO

which has made payment of compensation for acquired land to the

LAO. It is important to note that under Section 20 of the IDCO Act,

IDCO maintains a statutory fund. Once the amounts/monies are

paid by the KVK to IDCO, the said amounts/monies merged into the

funds of IDCO and lost their character.
</p>
<p id="p_177">        Reliance is placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in Pratibha Nema case (supra), held that "The genesis of

the fund is not the determinative factor, but its ownership in

prasenti that matters.". Applying this principle laid down by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court to the facts of the present case, the monies

once deposited in the account of IDCO by the KVK, belonged to IDCO

and any payments made by IDCO to LAO would be out of public

funds thereby complying with second proviso to <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_91">Section 6</a> of the LA

Act and the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Pratibha Nema's case.

                     allegation of the petitioner regarding delay in publication of 6(1)

                     notification is factually incorrect and misplaced and consequently,

land to KVK and ten persons who have filed objections have no

connection with the acquisition since they are not land losers and

the balance 20 persons named in the "Other Category" are the only

persons, who have not collected their compensation from the Land

Acquisition Officer and are effectively the persons who challenge the

L.A. proceeding in the present batch of petitions.

</p><p id="p_182">38.     Insofar as the persons who have been named in the "Not

Land Loser group" or "Private Sale group", writ petition on their

behalf obviously are infructuous since such persons either have not

lost any land or have made private sale of their land to the KVK.

Insofar as the persons grouped under the "Compensation Received"

having received their compensation, may at best be aggrieved by the

quantum of compensation awarded and consequently are at liberty

to seek enhancement of compensation before the appropriate forum

if they feel aggrieved by the quantum determined.

</p><p id="p_183">        Insofar as the persons grouped under "Other category" are

concerned, 18 of them have filed cyclostyled objections. Except one

Damodar Chaini, petitioner in W.P.(C) No.17476 of 2009, has filed a

detailed objection and participated at the hearing. The others though

present at the time of hearing sought for adjournment of the hearing.

</p><p id="p_186">         On considering all the objections raised, the Collector came

to conclude that the identical objections had been raised and

consequently submitted a common report on conclusion of the

proceeding under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_100">Section 5-A</a> of the Land Acquisition Act. The

Collector also took into account the fact that the State having

prepared R &amp; R. Policy, all the issues raised related to compensation,

displacement,      rehabilitation    and   employment    which    would

necessarily be taken care by the R &amp; R policy. In the said proceeding,

it appears that the entire hearing was recorded in the form of

videographics and the C.D. of such proceedings were also attached to

its report.

<p id="p_187">         At this point, it become necessary to take note of the

No.17476 of 2009. On perusing the averments made therein and

after hearing Mr. S.K. Das, learned Senior Advocate appearing for

Damodar Chaini, we observe that the said petitioner has highlighted

the efforts made by him to develop the land and to make the land fit

for agricultural operation and he has highlighted the tremendous

efforts both physical as well financial investments made by him on

his land. The petitioner also stated that he had settled in the said

land with his wife after retiring from Government service and had

also became extremely attached to the land since he was developing

it post retirement. While there can be no doubt that when land is

acquired every persons who loss his/her land is emotionally

disturbed and the relationship between the occupier of the land with

the land is extremely intense and personal. Yet such issues and

sentiments are not matters which can be taken into consideration by

the Collector at a hearing under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_101">Section 5-A</a> of the Land Acquisition

Act. <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_102">Section 5-A</a> of the Land Acquisition Act is quoted hereunder.

issuance of <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_131">Section 4(1)</a> notification in favour of the beneficiary

company was made on the basis of the requisition made by Vedanta

Foundation but    not Anil Agarwal      Foundation, which is the

beneficiary company. Thereafter, held that the initiation of the

proceedings by issuance of notifications under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_132">Section 4(1)</a> of the

L.A. Act had been made for the establishment of Vedanta University

which was not in existence either under the State University Act or

was made by issuing preliminary notifications which was held to be

bad in law. The facts of the present case are distinct and no

similarity to the case as referred to.

<p id="p_199">         However, in the said judgment this Court on perusing the

records produced by the State Government reached at a conclusion

that "from the perusal of the records produced by the State

Government, it appears that except in respect of four land owners,

the political executive passed order overruling the objections in

respect of three and in respect of one person accepting the same. The

files do not disclose that the political executive has applied its mind

and granted approval as required under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_133">Section 6</a> declaration

Court again referred to Om Prakash and observed that it is
trite that hearing given to a person must be an effective one

(Hindustan Petroleum Corpn. Case, SCC p.635, para 9)
                    "9.....Formation of opinion as regards
             the public purpose as also suitability thereof

             This Court further observed that the State in its
decision-making process must not commit any misdirection
in law. This Court observed that it cannot be disputed that
                   "<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_147">Section 5A</a> of the LA Act confers a
             valuable important right and having regard to

             Corporation case, SCC p.635, para-9)

where there has been total non-compliance or substantial
non-compliance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_149">Section 5A</a> of the LA
Act, the Court cannot fold its hands and refuse to grant relief

same view."
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_87">                    28. By no stretch of imagination, it can
             be said that the Second Land Acquisition
             Officer had applied his mind to the objections
             raised by the appellant. The above-quoted
             paragraphs        are      bereft     of       any

             Acquisition Officer has only reproduced the
             contentions of the officers of the Acquiring
             Body. The objections taken by the appellants
             are rejected on a very vague ground. Mere use
             of the words `for the greater interest of public'
             does not lend the report the character of a
             report made after application of mind. Though

</p><p id="p_208">         In the light of the reliance placed by the petitioners

essentially on two judgments, namely, Kamal Trading (supra) and

Rajiv Pujari (supra), the learned counsels for the opposite parties do

not raise any objections to the principles enunciated in the aforesaid

judgments. On the contrary, they also assert that in the fact

situation of the present case all procedural requirements which are

meant for safeguarding the interest of the possible land losers have

been duly complied with and, therefore, the aforesaid judgments

would have no application to the fact situation of the present case.

On perusal of the documents produced by the State and the

objections filed by the petitioners, we find that all the objections have

been cyclostyled and are identified in nature except the objection of

Damodar Chaini (petitioner in W.P.(C) No.17476 of 2009). Out of 62

objectors, 40 persons have also participated at the hearing and the

report of the Collector has duly considered and categorized the

specific points of objections raised. So unlike the case of Rajiv Pujari

(supra) where the records of the State indicated otherwise, in the

case at hand, we find to the contrary. In other words, substantial

number of land losers participated in the hearing which was also

videograph by the Collector. All objections as well as the C.D. of the

video was sent to the State. The State thereafter based on an earlier

direction of this Court in W.P.(C) No.16822 of 2008, directed the

R.D.C. to carry out a "socio-economic survey". The report of which

has been quoted hereinabove in para-7 and only thereafter directed

entire exercise of acquisition was designed to serve the interest of

builders and the veil of "public purpose" was used to mislead people

into believing that the land was being acquired for a "public

purpose". In the said case the Hon'ble Supreme Court took note of

the fact that the authorities had invoked the urgency clause under

<a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_154">Section 17(1)</a> and had dispensed with the enquiry under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_155">Section 5-A</a>

and came to hold that in the fact situation of the said case, there was

no justification for invoking such urgency clause nor dispensing with

<a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_156">Section 5-A</a> hearing. In the present case at hand, neither the urgency

clause under <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_157">Section 17(1)</a> has been resorted to nor has 5-A hearing

been dispensed with.

clearly in consonance with the Industrial Policy Resolution of the

State Government, provisions of the OIIDC Act and Rules as well as

the mandatory requirements of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_158">L.A. Act</a>, 1894 and consequently,

we are of the further considered view that the facts of the present

case are clearly distinguishable from the judgment relied upon by the

an acquisition of land under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_160">L.A. Act</a>, in conclusion of which the

land acquired, was alienated to a private party after 12 years of

acquisition and consequently, the Hon'ble Supreme Court came to

hold that, if the land is to be acquired for a company, the State

Government and the company are bound to comply with the

mandate of the provisions of part-VII of the L.A. Act. In the case at

hand, the acquisition has been made by the State Government for

IDCO i.e. a State undertaking created under the State statute, who

in turn, have leased the land in favour of the project proponent-KVK

for setting up of a "power plant" which in the Industrial Policy

Resolution of the State has been declared to be an "infrastructure

project" and all infrastructure projects have been held and declared

of Punjab and Others</a>, (2008) 1 Supreme Court Cases 728 is

concerned, on the fact situation that arose in the said case, it

appears that M/s International Tractors Limited had made an

application which is a company incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_162">Companies

Act</a>, 1956 intended to set up a project named "Ganesha Project" for

which it requested the State to acquire lands under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_163">Land

Acquisition Act</a>, 1894. A notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_164">Section 4</a> was issued and

in the case at hand it was found by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that

the said acquisition could not have proceeded under part-II of the

L.A. Act but ought to have proceeded under part-VII. In the said

judgment, although it was contended on behalf of the project

proponent that once a declaration that the land has been acquired

for "public purpose" is made, the same is conclusive yet, the Hon'ble

Supreme Court came to hold that when such an order is passed

without jurisdiction, the same amounts to a "colourable exercise of

power.". In the present case, <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_165">Sections 4</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_166">6(1)</a> notifications clearly

indicates that the land is being acquired for and on behalf of IDCO

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                 69</span>


upheld the view that the point of distinction between the acquisition

of land under part-II and part-VII, would be the source of funds to

cover the cost of the acquisition and further held that the 2nd proviso

to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_167">Section 6(1)</a> is the main dividing line for the two types of

acquisition.

the Government Corporation which paid the money for the

acquisition to the L.A.O while the project proponent had, in fact, paid

money to IDCO and once the payment made by the KVK-project

proponent to IDCO, the said amounts merges with the funds of IDCO

and any payment made by IDCO therefrom has to be held to be made

from out of "public fund" and consequently, this distinction which

had been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Pratibha Nema (supra) has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of Devinder Singh (supra) and, therefore, we find

no hesitation in holding that the fact situation of the present case is

distinct from that which arose for consideration in the case of

</p>
<p id="p_221">43.     Therefore, we are of the considered view that the fact

situation that has arisen for consideration in the present case is not

similar to that which arose in the case of Rajiv Pujari (supra) and we

are satisfied that the records produced clearly disclose the necessary

application of mind by the executive prior to granting approval for

publication of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_172">Section 6</a> declaration.
</p>
<p id="p_222">44.     We next come to deal with the issue as to whether the State

could have proceeded to acquire the land under part-II ant not Part-

VII of the L.A. Act as alleged and whether the action taken by the

State amounts to a "colourable exercise of power" by the State. In

this respect, it would be important to take note of the fact that the

State in its submissions before this Court has stated that setting up

of a power plant is of a vital importance for the development of the

State and its industrial sector as well as domestic consumption and,

therefore, satisfies the requirements of "public purpose" as defined

under <a href="/doc/740483/" id="a_173">Section 3(f)</a> of the L.A. Act. The State have also referred to its

Industrial Policy Resolution, 2007 and, in particular, Clause-10

thereof wherein "infrastructure project" includes power plants. Since
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                     71</span>


setting up of a "power plant" as declared by the State to be an

"infrastructure project" in terms of its Industrial Policy Resolution,

2007, Clause 9.3 the State enterprise, known as "Industrial

Development Corporation Orissa" (IDCO) was required to carry out

its objectives and, in particular, for infrastructure project Clause

16.3   entitled   allocation   of   Government   land   at   concessional

industrial rates and consequently, since the IPR 2007 had declared

"power plant" as "infrastructure project", establishment of a power

plant would in our view no doubt subserve "public purpose". Once

the power plant is set up in terms of the MoU entered into between

the State Government as well as the KVK, the State would be entitled

to substantial benefits arising out of the said MoU and there cannot

be any doubt raised that the acquisition, sub-serves a "public

purpose".
</p>
<p id="p_223">45.      Learned counsel appearing for the IDCO also supported the

aforesaid submissions and stated that under Section 31 of the OIIDC

Act, 1980 stipulates that whenever land is required by the

Corporation for any purpose in furtherance of the objectives of the

Act, it could approach the State Government to initiate action under

the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_174">L.A. Act</a> on behalf of the Corporation, since admittedly the IDCO

is an instrumentality of the State to sub-serve Government policy.

</p><p id="p_224">         In view of the aforesaid findings, we are clearly of the

considered view that acquisitions of land for the purpose of setting
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                 72</span>


up of KVK Power Plant does fulfill the criteria for being declared as

sub-serving "public purpose".
</p>
<p id="p_225">46.     Insofar as the contention raised regarding payment having

been made by the KVK to IDCO and who in turn, made the payments

to the Land Acquisition Officer, for disbursement to the land oustees.

It is important to take note of Section 31(2) of the OIIDC Act, 1980,

whereby the IDCO is empowered to make requisition to the State for

the purpose of acquisition of land under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_175">L.A. Act</a>, 1894. The

amount of compensation awarded and all other charges incurred in

the acquisition of such land shall be paid by the Corporation and the

land shall vest in the Corporation. In the case at hand, admittedly,

even though KVK has paid the money to IDCO, IDCO has, in fact,

deposited the compensation amount with the Land Acquisition

Officer. In this respect, reliance is also placed on Section 6 (Second

Proviso) read with Explanation-2 which clearly provides that, no

such declaration under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_176">Section 6</a> shall be made unless the

compensation to be awarded is to be paid out of the funds of the

Corporation   owned    or   controlled   by   the   State   and   such

compensation shall be deemed to be compensation to be paid out of

"public revenue". In the case at hand, Explanation-2 (2nd proviso) of

<a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_177">Section 6</a> is clearly attracted and there exists no evidence on record

to the contrary. Therefore, it is held that since IDCO (the

Government Corporation) has deposited the money with the Land
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">                                 73</span>


Acquisition Officer, the deeming provision of Explanation-2 comes

into operation and consequently, it has to be "deemed to be

compensation paid out of public revenue". In this respect the

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pratibha

Nema (supra) and Soorarama Pratap Reddy (supra) are vitally

important.
</p>
<p id="p_226">47.     The next issue is to be dealt with in the present case is

based on the allegation that KVK was involved in the process of

selecting the land for acquisition. In this regard, on consideration of

the submissions advanced by the learned counsel representing the

various parties, we are of the considered view that for the purpose of

setting up of mega power plant having a capacity of 200 M.W.

requiring a investment of nearly Rs.5000.00 crores, it is absolutely

essential that the location of such land must be suitable, for the

purpose of the Thermal Power Plant and various important criteria,

such as, rail and road connectivity, availability of water and

convenience of power evacuation are all issues which only the project

proponent    company    i.e.   KVK   has   to   ascertain   for   itself.

Consequently, identifying the land and suggesting the land to IDCO

for the purpose of acquisition by the KVK, does not in any manner

effect the "public purpose" part of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_178">Land Acquisition Act</a>. In a

country such as ours, where industrialisation is vital for its economic

petitioners that the mere involvement of the project proponent i.e.

KVK in identifying the land brought the said acquisition under Part-

VII and not part-II of the Land Acquisition Act.

</p><p id="p_227">48.     In the case of Pratibha Nema (supra), similar arguments

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para-1 and Para-33 respectively

<blockquote id="blockquote_88">               "1.   The acquisition of 73.3 hectares of dry
        land situate in Rangwasa village of Indore district and
        tehsil belonging to the appellants and others is the
        subject matter of challenge in these appeals filed by
        the land holders. The said extent of land was notified
        for acquisition under <a href="/doc/169774/" id="a_179">Section 4(1)</a> of the Land
        Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") for
        the alleged public purpose of "establishment of
        diamond park". This parcel of land together with an
        extent of 44.8 hectares of government land was meant
        to be placed at the disposal of the Industries
        Department and/or Madhya Pradesh Audyogik Kendra
        Vikas Nigam Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "the
        Nigam") for the purpose of allotting the same to various
        industrial units- the foremost among them being the
        9th respondent company, for setting up diamond
        cutting and polishing units with modern technology.
        The proposal in this regard emanated from the General
        Manager of District Industries Centre, on the initiative
        taken by the 9th respondent. After the land was located
        by a Joint Inspection Committee of the officials, the
        Government of Madhya Pradesh (Commerce and
        Industries Department) had given sanction "in
        principle" for the acquisition. The District Collector,
        Indore through his letter dated 24-1-1996 sought the
        approval of the Commissioner, Indore Division to
        invoke <a href="/doc/423817/" id="a_180">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act in order to expedite the
        process of acquisition. In that letter, the Collector
        mentioned that prestigious exporters from India as well
        as foreign countries were likely to establish their units
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                 75</span>


        in this park which would generate a good deal of
        foreign exchange and create employment potential."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_89">                33. We are of the view that none of the factors
        pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants
        make any dent on the orientation towards public
        purpose nor do they establish that the acquisition was
        resorted to by the Government to achieve oblique ends.
        The speed at which the proposal was pursued should
        be appreciated rather than condemning it, though the
        overzealousness on the part of authorities concerned to
        short-circuit the procedure has turned out to be
        counter- productive. True, the tardy progress of
        acquisition would have sent wrong signals to the
        prospective investors, as contended by the learned
        Advocate-General. However, due attention should have
        been given to the legal formalities such as holding of
        enquiry, specification of public purpose in clear terms
        and giving sufficient indication of State meeting the
        cost of acquisition wholly or in part. At the same time,
        we cannot read mala fides in between the lines; in fact,
        no personal malice or ulterior motives have been
        attributed to the Chief Minister or to any other official.
        The material placed before us do not lead to the
        necessary or even reasonable conclusion that the
        Government machinery identified itself with the private
        interests of the Company, forsaking public interest.
        Public purpose does not cease to be so merely because
        the acquisition facilitates the setting up of industry by
        a private enterprise and benefits it to that extent. Nor
        the existence or otherwise of public purpose be judged
        by the lead and initiative taken by the entrepreneurs
        desirous of setting up the industry and the measure of
        coordination between them and various state agencies.
        The fact that despite the unwillingness expressed by
        AKI Ltd., to go ahead with the project, the Government
        is still interested in acquisition is yet another pointer
        that the acquisition was motivated by public purpose."

<p id="p_228">49.     The name of KVK having been mentioned in the notice

under <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_181">Section 5-A</a> by itself could not make the acquisition come

under Part-VII of the Act, when ingredients of Part-II have been fully
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                 76</span>


satisfied. No doubt, the name of KVK has been mentioned in <a href="/doc/85678/" id="a_182">Section

5-A</a>, but in the notification under <a href="/doc/43654/" id="a_183">Section 4</a> and under <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_184">Section 6</a> of

the L.A. Act, the name of the KVK has not been mentioned.

</p><p id="p_229">        In this respect, we are of the considered view that

mentioning the name of KVK in 5-A notice is essential in order to

make the land owners aware of the purpose to which the land in

question would be utilized. In fact, we are of the considered view that

the State while not indicating the name of KVK in Section-4 and

Section-6 notification, has correctly indicated the name of KVK

under Section-5 notification in order to make the people who are

likely land oustees aware of the actual purpose of the acquisition. In

fact, we are of the considered view that, had the name of the KVK

had not been indicated in the Section-5 notice, it may probably have

given rise an objection being raised on behalf of the land oustees that

they had not been informed as the actual purpose of acquisition.

Thus the naming of the KVK Section-5 notice, was in compliance of

the principle of audi alteram partem and not in derogation thereof.

</p><p id="p_230">        We are of the further considered view that the acquisition in

fact was made for and on behalf IDCO and consequently the name of

IDCO was mentioned both in Section-4 as well as Section-6

notification and we find no error in the same. Insofar as allegation of

"colourable exercise of power" in the matter of acquisition is

concerned, we find no material available on record to substantiate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                77</span>


the aforesaid allegation. No motive had been alleged by the

petitioners either to KVK or to the State Government to allege that

the acquisition of land was initiated by mala fide or colourable

exercise of power. It is well settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

both in the case of <a href="/doc/37254300/" id="a_185">Somawanti v. State of Punjab</a> (supra) and

Pratibha   Nema   (supra) that the conclusiveness of Section-6

declaration is open to challenge only on the ground of colourable

exercise of power. It is well settled that in order to establish the

allegation of mala fides and/or colourable exercise of power, the

burden is on the petitioner. In the present case, apart from merely

making allegation of colourable exercise of power, the petitioner had

provided no material whatsoever before this Court to substantiate

such allegation. It is also to be borne in mind that in the case of

Soorarama Pratap Reddy (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

paragraph-119 has came to hold as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_90">               "119. In our judgment, in deciding whether
        acquisition is for "public purpose" or not, prima facie,
        Government is the best judge. Normally, in such
        matters, a writ Court will not interfere by substituting
        its judgment for the judgment of the Government."</blockquote><p id="p_231">

</p><p id="p_232">        And consequently, we hold that the allegation of colourable

exercise of power is unsubstantiated.
</p>
<p id="p_233">50.     Insofar as payment of compensation is concerned, the MOU

entered into between the KVK and the State Government required

KVK to pay the cost of the land to IDCO in case the land acquired for
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                  78</span>


the purpose. As noted hereinabove, no payments have been made by

KVK to the Land Acquisition Officer and instead, IDCO has made all

payments to the Land Acquisition Officer as required under Section

31(2) of the OIIDC Act read with <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_186">Section 6</a> (second proviso)

Explanation-2 to the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_187">L.A. Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_234">51.     In the case of Pratibha Nema (supra), the Supreme Court

held in paragraph-25 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_91">        "25. It seems to be fairly clear, as contended by the
        learned counsel for the appellants, that the amount
        paid by the Company was utilised towards payment of
        a part of interim compensation amount determined by
        the Land Acquisition Officer on 7.6.1996 and in the
        absence of this amount, the Nigam was not having
        sufficient cash balance to make such payment. We
        may even go to the extent of inferring that in all
        probability, the Nigam would have advised or
        persuaded the Company to make advance payment
        towards lease amount as per the terms of the MOU on
        a rough-and-ready basis, so that the said amount
        could be utilized by the Nigam for making payment on
        account of interim compensation. Therefore, it could
        have been within the contemplation of both the parties
        that the amount paid by the Company will go towards
        the discharge of the obligation of the Nigam to make
        payment towards interim compensation. Even then, it
        does not in any way support the appellants' stand that
        the compensation amount had not come out of public
        revenues. Once the amount paid towards advance
        lease premium, maybe on a rough-and-ready basis, is
        credited to the account of the Nigam, obviously, it
        becomes the fund of the Nigam. Such fund, when
        utilized for the purpose of payment of compensation,
        wholly or in part, satisfies the requirements of the
        second proviso to <a href="/doc/466483/" id="a_188">Section 6(1)</a> read with Explanation 2.
        The genesis of the fund is not the determinative factor,
        but its ownership in praesenti that matters."</blockquote><p id="p_235">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                 79</span>


</p><p id="p_236">        And consequently, in view of the aforesaid judgment once

the money is deposited by the KVK in the account of IDCO, the said

money becomes part of the public fund of IDCO and payment out of

public fund held by IDCO to the Land Acquisition Officer would

amount to the out of public fund. Therefore, complying with the

second proviso of <a href="/doc/1792838/" id="a_189">Section 6</a> of the Land Acquisition Act, this

conclusion is also supported by another decision of Hon'ble Supreme

Court in the case of Nand Kishore Gupta (supra). Paragraph 61 of

the said judgment is quoted hereinbelow:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_92">              "... ... This is apart from the fact that through
        this agreement, only the extent of the compensation
        payable by the company to YEIDA was decided.
        However, once all the amounts went to the coffers of
        YEIDA, it would lose its independent character as
        premium. When it goes into the coffers of YEIDA, it is
        YEIDA which would make the payments of the
        estimated compensation and thereby it would be as if
        the compensation is paid not by the Company, but by
        YEIDA."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_237">52.     In view of the aforesaid judgment of Nand Kishore Gupta

(supra), Hon'ble Supreme Court stated that the case for determining

whether acquisition under Part-II or Part-VII of the L.A. Act, the case

laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Nand Kishore

Gupta (supra) states that the basic idea for acquisition of part-VII of

the Act is the "total transfer of ownership of the acquiring land in

favour of the petitioner". In this respect, para-53 would be most

relevant which is as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                 80</span><p id="p_238">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_93">               "53. This would suggest that even when the
        acquisition is meant for Company, the concept of
        public purpose has to be at the back of the mind of the
        acquiring body like the Government. Here, of course,
        there is no question of any agreement with the
        Company as three eventualities described under
        <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_190">Section 40</a> of the Act are not available for the simple
        reason that the basic idea for the acquisition under
        Part VII of the Act is the total transfer of the ownership
        of the acquiring land in favour of the Company. That is
        obviously not present here. We do not see any factual
        background for holding that any agreement was
        contemplated in between the State Government and
        the Company or for that matter, YEIDA and the
        Company, as envisaged in <a href="/doc/775887/" id="a_191">Sections 39</a>, <a href="/doc/1694707/" id="a_192">40</a> and <a href="/doc/1759624/" id="a_193">41</a> of
        the Act."</blockquote><p id="p_239">

</p><p id="p_240">         We are of the considered view that the aforesaid judgment in

the case of Nand Kishore Gupta (supra) squarely applies to the fact

situation which arise for consideration in the present case and

clearly in the case at hand, in fact, there is no transfer of ownership

of land in favour of KVK. Upon the acquisition of land, the land gets

vested with the State Government and the State Government in turn

grants long term lease of the said land to IDCO who in turn have

sublease the land in favour of KVK in terms of the lease agreement.

Consequently, it is clear therefrom that the acquisition in the present

case is an acquisition under Part-II and not under Part-VII of the L.A.

Act as alleged.
</p>
<p id="p_241">53.      Further contentions raised by the petitioners that the KVK

had made certain concurrent purchase of land. In this respect, in

consideration of the submissions made, we find that KVK had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                  81</span>


purchased certain amounts of land privately through negotiation

(chart has been indicated hereinabove in para-37). The fact that KVK

has purchased such land after the issue of 4(1) notification under

the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_194">L.A. Act</a>, is specifically permitted under the R &amp; R Policy, 2006

framed by the State of Orissa which is quoted hereinbelow:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_94">               "Project proponent of for direct purchase of land
       on the basis of negotiated price after issue of notification
       requiring acquisition of land under the relevant Act. If
       acquisition of land through direct purchase fails, other
       provisions of the relevant Act may be invoked."</blockquote><p id="p_242">

</p><p id="p_243">         Therefore, the purchase of private land by the KVK after 4(1)

notification is specifically encouraged by the State under the R &amp; R

policy 2006 and this fact by itself is of no consequence and has no

impact on the issue as to whether the land acquired by the State

Government comes under Part-II or Part-VII of the L.A. Act. The only

issue as to whether "public purpose" is subserved in terms of the

judgment cited hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_244">54.      The further contention of the petitioners is that IDCO would

only make acquisition of land under the OIIDC Act, 1980 for the

purpose of "establishing industrial estate" or "industrial area" Under

<a href="/doc/331372/" id="a_195">Section 2(h)</a> and <a href="/doc/83913863/" id="a_196">2(i)</a> respectively is not to be considered.

</p><p id="p_245">         Section 31 of the OIIDC Act 1980 specifically vests the

power in IDCO to make requisition of acquisition of land by the State

Government under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_197">L.A. Act</a>. In this respect, <a href="/doc/475622/" id="a_198">Section 14(i)</a> which

has been quoted in para-28 hereinabove clearly states the function of

trade and commerce in the State, and sub-Section(ii) thereof says

that in particular, and without prejudice to the generality of Clause-

</p><p id="p_246">(i)". Thereafter states the various particular purposes for which

acquisition can take place. In this respect, learned counsel for the

IDCO's submission is that the words "in particular" and without

prejudice to the generality of sub-clause(i) ought to be treated as

merely illustrative and not limiting the scope of sub-clause-(i) in any

manner.

system of government. in our opinion the argument
mentioned above is fallacious. It completely disregards
the structure and the provisions of<a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_203"> s. 171C</a>. <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_204">Section

contains the definition of "undue influence". This is in
wide terms and renders a person voluntarily interfering
or attempting to interfere with the free exercise of any
electoral right guilty of committing undue influence.
That this is very wide is indicated by the opening
sentence of sub-s. (2), i.e. "without prejudice to the
generality of the provisions of sub-section (1)." It is
