<p id="p_4">2.       Amar Singh (PW-4) is a migrant labourer from Nepal.

He and his minor daughter Sushma aged six years               were

residing in the locality known as Raj Mahal Hotel Compound

Mallital, Nainital.    On September 25, 2003 at about 8.00 A.M.

Sushma       left her home to ease herself. When she did not

return for quite some time, she was looked for in the market,

around the lake and near about by her father but of no avail.

Despite frantic efforts when her whereabouts          could not be

known,      PW-4      reported   her disappearance (Ext.Ka-10) at

around 4.00 P.M. at Police Station, Mallital. The night became

horrendously          eventful for PW-4; he and three migrant

labourers from Nepal, namely, Veer Bahadur (PW-2), Puran

(PW-3) and Mangal (PW-5) were waiting for Sushma to return.

At about 1.30 A.M., four persons came from the side of the

road up to vacant plot of one Sardarji in that locality and were

seen throwing the dead body of a girl from the gunny      bag in

that plot. The gunny bag was also thrown over there. PW-2,

PW-3, PW-4 and PW-5 raised alarm and caught hold of them;

they were Babu (A-1), Aamir (A-2), Pawan (A-3) and Arjun (A-

under <a href="/doc/1279834/" id="a_27">Sections 376</a> and <a href="/doc/1836974/" id="a_28">377</a> IPC were also added.

</p><p id="p_12">8.      The defence of the accused persons was one of simple

denial.    They stated that they have been falsely implicated in

the case.
</p>
<p id="p_13">9.      Dr. K.S. Dhami (PW-1) who conducted post mortem

examination on the dead body of victim found following injuries.

        laceration &amp; abrasion around the external region
        on separation of gluteal fold large rectal canal is
        visible which is dilated. Spintsers are damaged.
        There is blood present in the anal canal. Mucosa
        is also damaged. Both rectal and vaginal smears
        are taken. There is well defined ligature mark on
        the upper part of neck slightly depressed and
        encircling the neck     horizontally and completely.
        Colour is reddish &amp; margins are ecchymosed. On
        dissection of ligature mark there is extra vassion of
        blood into the sub cutaneous tissue under the
        ligature mark as well as adjacent structures."



Dr.K.S. Dhami (PW-1) recorded cause of death being asphyxia

as a result of strangulation. These injuries according to Dr.

K.S. Dhami were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to

cause death.
</p>
<p id="p_15">10.       On the basis of the medical evidence, no doubt is left

      that victim died of homicidal death and that she was

      raped before    being murdered.     The medical evidence

      shows     that her hymen was ruptured;           labiamajora

      separated and there was reddish secretion inside the

      vagina.   These are indicative of having the sexual assault.

      Dr. K.S. Dhami further opined the rape on the deceased is

      possible to have occurred during the time of 8.00 A.M. on

      September 25, 2003 to the night (intervening night between

      September 25 and 26, 2003). The evidence of Dr. K.S.

      Dhami has gone unchallenged in so far as A-3 and A-4 are

      concerned and in his cross examination on behalf of A-1

      and A-2, nothing has been elicited which may cast doubt

      with regard to his testimony.
</p>
<p id="p_16">11.          There    is no eye witness    account and the case

      depends wholly upon circumstantial evidence.

</p><p id="p_17">12.          When a case rests on circumstantial evidence, such

      evidence must satisfy oft-quoted       tests viz: (1)    the

      circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to

      be drawn,     must be cogently and firmly established; (2)

      those circumstances should be of definite tendency

      unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; (3) the

      circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so

      complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that

      within all human probabilities the crime was committed by

      the accused     and none else; and (4) the circumstantial

      evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete

      and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than

      that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                                                 7</span>
      not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but

      should be inconsistent with his innocence.

</p><p id="p_18">13.         Where      the entire case hinges on         circumstantial

      evidence,   great   care   must   be    taken   in    evaluating

      circumstantial evidence to ensure that the circumstances

      on which the    prosecution relies are wholly consistent with

      the sole hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.

</p><p id="p_19">14.          Legal principles with regard to the circumstantial

      evidence in criminal trial have been explained by this Court

      time and again; the first in long line of these cases being

      Hanuman Govind Nargundkar v. State of M.P. [AIR (1952)

      SC 343] and of late, <a href="/doc/1789800/" id="a_37">State of U.P. v. Satish</a> (2005)3 SCC

</p><p id="p_20">      114. Reference to all these decisions is not necessary as

      we have already noticed these          principles in preceding

      paragraphs.     However, Mr.T.V. George, learned counsel

      appearing for A-3, referred to a decision of this Court in the

      case of        <a href="/doc/1339608/" id="a_38">Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit      vs. State     of

      Maharashtra</a>, (1981) 2 SCC 35 which we may refer to.

      The learned counsel relied upon the following observations

      made therein:

<p id="p_21">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                                     8</span>
     ".....It is not to be expected that in every case
     depending on circumstantial evidence, the whole of
     the law governing cases of circumstantial evidence
     should be set out in the judgment. Legal principles
     are not magic incantations and their importance lies
     more in their application to a given set of facts than
     in their recital in the judgment.         The simple
     expectation is that the judgment must show that
     the finding of guilt, if any, has been reached after a
     proper and careful evaluation of circumstances in
     order to determine whether they are compatible with
     any other reasonable hypothesis.
</p>
<p id="p_22">     The High Court, it must be said, has referred to the
     recent decisions of this Court in <a href="/doc/820224/" id="a_39">Mahmood v. State
     of U.P</a>. (1976) 1 SCC 542 and Chandmal v State
     of Rajasthan (1976) 1 SCC 621 in which the rule
     governing cases of circumstantial evidence is
     reiterated. But, while formulating its own view the
     High Court, with respect, fell into an error in stating
     the true legal position by saying that what the court
     has to consider is whether the cumulative effect of
     the circumstances establishes the guilt of the
     accused beyond the "shadow of doubt". In the first
     place, `shadow of doubt', even in cases which
     depend on direct evidence is shadow of
     "reasonable" doubt.      Secondly, in its practical
     application, the test which requires the exclusion of
     to her alternative hypotheses is far more rigorous
     than the test of proof beyond reasonable doubt."



</p><p id="p_23">15. It needs no emphasis that while evaluating circumstantial

  evidence, which of course has to be done carefully, the

  circumstances must be of such a nature as to be capable of

  supporting the exclusive hypothesis       that the accused is

      with no other reasonable hypothesis.

<p id="p_47">19.    Mr. T.V. George, the learned counsel for A-3 highlighted

inconsistencies in the ocular version of PW-2, PW-3, PW-4

and PW-5 to bolster up his       contention that   their evidence

deserves     rejection.   He referred to variations in the first

information report and the deposition of these witnesses. With

reference to the site plan (Ext.Ka-13), the learned counsel

sought to contend that Hotel Rajmahal and its compound have

not been shown and it was not probable for these witnesses to

see in the midnight the dead body being thrown from the gunny

bag.    He argued that circumstances (iv), (v) and (xiv) cannot

be held to be established.

<p id="p_48">20.    PW-4 is the father of victim. PW-2, PW-3 and PW-5 are

migrant labourers from Nepal like PW-4. They all were residing

in the same compound viz, Rajmahal Hotel Compound.             If

despite frantic search throughout the day, the girl could not be

traced, there was nothing unusual if they were sitting outside

the hut of PW-4 in the night with a hope that the girl may return

or somebody may leave her.       In the night at about 1.30 A.M.,

they saw four persons carrying one gunny bag and going

towards plot of one Sardarji. They saw those persons throwing

a dead body from the gunny bag in that plot.      The dead body

was of Sushma. They raised alarm and caught hold of the

accused persons.      They took the accused persons to the

police station and handed them over to the police. PW-4

lodged F.I.R. and all of them came back to the place near the

dead body. Sans insignificant and minor contradictions here

and there,   all these four witnesses are consistent in their

version on material aspects as noticed above.              Merely

because the names of two witnesses were not mentioned in

the F.I.R., their presence does not become doubtful. Omission

of the names of two witnesses in the F.I.R. is not material

particularly because it is not necessary that all the names of the

witnesses be mentioned in the F.I.R.. It is true that in the site

plan (Ext. Ka-13), Hotel Rajmahal and its compound have not

been shown but the site map basically reflects the place from

where dead body of the deceased was recovered and the place

from   where the accused persons are said to have been

apprehended.     Site map also reflects the place from where

gunny bag containing hawai chappal of the deceased was

recovered. However, the evidence of PW-2, PW-3, PW-4 and

PW-5 leaves no manner of       doubt that Hotel    Rajmahal is

situate in that vicinity and near the Hotel Sitakiran which is

shown in the site plan. PW-2 is specific that Hotel Sitakiran is

situate near Hotel Rajmahal.    In the site plan drain has been

shown in the east to Hotel Sitakiran. Sanwal School has also

been shown in the site plan.   PW-2 in his deposition has also

stated that Sanwal School is in the east of the hotel.      The

testimony of PW-4 also shows that Sanwal School is situate at

a short distance of his hutment. All these witnesses reside in

that locality. Seen thus, merely because Hotel Rajmahal and

its compound have not been shown in the site plan, it does not

in any way affect the deposition of PW-2,     PW-3, PW-4 and

PW-5.
</p>
<p id="p_49">21.   The submission of      the learned counsel that in the

absence of any light at the place of occurrence, it was highly

improbable that PW-2, PW-3, PW-4 and PW-5 saw the four

accused persons carrying gunny bag and going to the vacant

plot of Sardarji and throwing a dead body does not appear to

us to be of substance. The testimony of PW-3 and PW-5 in

respect of light stands corroborated by the testimony of

investigating officer (PW-11) who has also deposed that there

hutment of PW-4. Significantly, none of these witnesses (PW-

2, PW-3, PW-4 and PW-5) has been cross-examined in this

regard.
</p>
<p id="p_50">22.   Having carefully gone through the deposition of PW-2,

PW-3,and PW-4 and PW-5, we find ourselves in agreement

with the view of the trial court as well as that of the High Court

that circumstances (iv), (v) and (vii) are clearly proved.

</p><p id="p_51">23.   That the underwears of the accused were seized on

September 27, 2003 when they were in jail and these articles

were sent for chemical examination is not in dispute. That the

evidence pertaining to chemical examination of underwears

shows that those underwears were found stained with human

semen and spermatozoa is also not in dispute.            Mr.   T.V.

George, learned counsel, however, strenuously           urged that

merely because underwears were found stained with human

semen     by   itself   cannot   be   used   as   an   incriminating

circumstance against the accused. Learned counsel in this

regard placed reliance upon the following decisions: (1)

</p>
<p id="p_52">24.   Learned counsel heavily relied     upon paragraph 28 of

the report in the case of Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit which

reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "The discovery of a blood-stain of the `B' Group
      measuring 0.5 cm in diameter on the appellant's
      pant and of dried stain of semen on his underpant
      are circumstances far too feeble to establish that
      the appellant raped or murdered Sunita. `B' Group
      is not an uncommon group of blood and no effort
      was made to exclude the possibility that the blood
      of the appellant belonged to the same group. As
      regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant's
      underpant, he was a grown up man of 30 years
      and no compelling inference can arise that the
      stain was caused during the course of the sexual
      assault committed by him on the girl."</blockquote><p id="p_53">



</p><p id="p_54">      In Shankarlal Gyarasilal Dixit,   the presence of a dried

stain of semen    on the underpant of the accused, aged 30

years, was held too feeble a circumstance      to establish the

guilt. The aforesaid observation cannot be read to mean that in

no    case    presence of     dried stain of semen      on the

underpant/underwear of the accused can be considered as an

incriminating circumstance against the accused.

upon by learned counsel reads thus:
</p>
<p id="p_56">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "In the present case the age of the accused was
      about 21 years at the time of the incident. On his
      arrest he was subjected to medical examination and
      found to be a potent and capable person.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      Presence of semen stain on underwear, assuming
      that the underwear belonged to the accused,
      though there is no evidence adduced in this regard,
      is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence
      connecting        the accused with the crime in
      question.    So also the discovery of Group B
      bloodstain on the underwear cannot be treated as
      an incriminating piece of evidence against the
      accused connecting him with the crime because
      there is no evidence that the underwear belonged
      to the accused and further the possibility of the
      underwear being stained with the blood of the
      person to whom it belonged, or the accused if he
      was wearing it has not been ruled out."</blockquote><p id="p_57">



</p><p id="p_58">      It   would be seen that in the case of Subhash Chand

there was no evidence that the underwear belonged to the

accused and further the    possibility of the underwear being

stained with the blood of the person to whom it belonged or

the accused if he was wearing was not ruled out.

</p><p id="p_59">26.   In the case   of   Sadashiv Ramrao Hadbe,        this Court

made the following observations:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "It is true that the petticoat and the underwear
      allegedly worn by the appellant had some semen
      but that by itself is not sufficient to treat that the

      prosecutrix.    That would only        cause    some
      suspicion on the conduct of the appellant but not
      sufficient to prove the case, as alleged by the
      prosecution."</blockquote><p id="p_60">



</p><p id="p_61">      The aforesaid observation has to be read in the light of

the observation made in paragraph 6 of the report that the

prosecution evidence was found to have many contradictions

and the whole incident seemed to be highly improbable.

</p><p id="p_62">27.     As a matter of fact there is no challenge with regard to

proof of the circumstances (ix) and (xvi). The challenge is on

relevance of these circumstances on the ground that the

accused persons are labourers and they do not change their

underwears daily and merely because their      underwears were

found to have semen stains, that by itself cannot be used as

an incriminating circumstance.      We find no merit in this

contention. In our opinion, the circumstances (ix) and (xvi) do

provide link in forming the chain together with other

Court.

</p><p id="p_64">28.   In so far as circumstances (xi), (xii)      &amp; (xvii) are

concerned, the evidence of Dr. K.S. Dhami (PW-1) establishes

that victim was subjected to rape and murder.         Mr. T.V.

George, learned counsel for A-3, however, sought to urge that

the injuries and medical evidence make it highly improbable

that four persons raped the minor girl. Firstly, no question or

suggestion has been put to PW-1 in this regard. Secondly,

and more importantly, semen stain with spermatozoa were

found on the underwears of all the four accused. Thirdly,

chemical examination of the vaginal smear of the victim has

also confirmed     presence of human blood, semen and

spermatozoa. In view of this evidence, rape of victim by more

than one culprit can be safely held to be established.     The

medical evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that the

victim died of homicidal death and that she was raped before

Nainital for disposal according to law and on
receipt of the record this transferee court fixed
16.3.2004 for framing of          the charge.     The
Additional Sessions Judge took up the case for this
purpose on 16.3.2004 and in the presence of all the
four accused persons framed charges against
them for the offences as mentioned above and for
the commission of which the accused were later on
convicted. The order sheet of the said date does
not reflect the presence of the defence lawyer or
even the public prosecutor before the learned
Additional Sessions Judge and perhaps the
charges were framed after perusal of the
documents of the prosecution without referring that
the Judge was of the opinion that there were
grounds for presuming that the accused have
committed offences which are exclusively triable by
the court as envisaged by <a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_45">Section 228</a> of the
`Code'. Record also reveal that till that date neither
the accused have engaged their own lawyer nor
they were provided with a defence lawyer at the

Sessions Judge however after framing the charges
and making an endorsement that the accused
pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried, fixed
24.3.2004 for recording of the evidence of the
prosecution and directed the prosecution witnesses
to be summoned.             On 24.3.2004 A.D.G.C.

the trial was adjourned to 7.4.2004 for recording of

Curiae for the accused. On 7.4.2004, as is evident
from the record and the order sheet of the said
date, three prosecution witnesses, P.W.1, P.W.2
and P.W.3 were examined by the prosecution, and
on the same day Sri M.A. Khan, Advocate was

of    two accused Babu and Aamir only which
indicate that only      these two accused were

accused Pawan and Arjun which indicate that they
have engaged the lawyer of their choice after the

charges were framed against the accused on
16.3.2004 without the accused being represented
by their counsel and without recording of the
satisfaction of the Judge that there are grounds for
presuming that the accused have committed the
offences with which they were being charged as
envisaged by <a href="/doc/1969991/" id="a_48">Section 228</a> of the `Code', but we are
of the considered view that there was enough
evidence and material available on record at that
time to form an opinion that there was sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accused. The
reason being that at the stage of framing of the
charge the Judge is not required to enter into
detailed scrutiny and consideration of the material
and evidence which is available in the form of the
record of the investigation or the documents
submitted with the charge sheet and therefore as
the allegations stand against the accused
supported by the collected evidence even the above
infraction in the compliance of the legal provision do
not indicate any prejudice having been caused to
the accused and in a situation like this the above
aspect would not entail vitiation of the entire trial
against the accused.

three prosecution witnesses were examined in the

Amicus Curiae for the two accused and he
proceeded to cross-examine all the three witnesses
on that date itself. Learned Senior Counsel Sri
Panwar submitted that a duty is cast on Sessions
Judge to see that raw and inexperienced juniors are
not appointed to defend an accused in capital
punishment cases and in support of the argument
learned counsel pressed into service the reported
decisions <a href="/doc/988538/" id="a_49">Panchu Gopal Das vs. State</a>; A.I.R.
1968 Cal. 38, and <a href="/doc/6965/" id="a_50">Mohd. Kunnumal vs. State of
Kerala</a>; A.I.R. 1963 Ker. 54. The argument was
advanced on the assumption that the Amicus
Curiae appointed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge was an inexperienced Advocate,
but we find nothing on record to sustain the
submission made in that behalf. It appears that Sri
M.A. Khan, Advocate was practicing in criminal side
in the Sessions Court at Nainital and judicial
notice can be taken of the fact that he is at present
a Brief Holder of the State of Uttaranchal in the
High Court and is conducting criminal appeals in
the High Court. This indicate that Sri Khan has
long standing as a criminal lawyer and was rightly
appointed as Amicus Curiae to defend the accused
in capital punishment case.         Further he was
assigned the case to defend the two accused at the
expense of the state on the day when the three
prosecution witnesses were examined but the
learned       Amicus Curiae had not sought
adjournment to avail some time to prepare the
case. This indicate that the learned Amicus Curiae
has not felt handicapped and must have prepared
the case to his satisfaction so as to proceed with
the cross-examination of the witnesses on that very
day and looking at the cross-examination of the
witnesses we do not find that for this reason any
prejudice was caused to the two accused for whom
he was appointed Amicus Curiae."

(A-1) and Aamir (A-2). The learned counsel submitted that A-

1 and A-2 were      `juvenile' within the meaning of Juvenile

Justice (Care and <a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_51">Protection of Children) Act</a>, 2000 (for short

`the Act, 2000') on the date of incident and the trial held by

Additional Sessions Judge, Nainital, under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_52"> the         Code</a> of

Criminal Procedure was illegal. With regard to the age of A-2,

reliance is placed on his statement recorded under <a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_53">Section

313</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54">Cr.P.C</a>. wherein his age has been recorded as 17 years

and a school leaving certificate indicating his date of birth as

March 12, 1987.    For A-1, his school leaving certificate which

records his date of birth July 16, 1988 is being relied. The

learned counsel would submit that juvenility can be claimed at

any stage; even for the first time before this Court. He referred

to <a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_55">Section 7A</a> of the Act, 2000.

      claim of juvenility is raised before any court or a court is
      of the opinion that an accused person was a juvenile on
      the date of commission of the offence, the court shall
      make an enquiry, take such evidence as may be
      necessary (but not an affidavit) so as to determine the
      age of such person, and shall record a finding whether
      the person is a juvenile or a child or not, stating his age
      as nearly as may be:

      any court and it shall be recognized at any stage, even
      after final disposal of the case, and such claim shall be
      determined in terms of the provisions contained in this
      Act and the rules made thereunder, even if the juvenile
      has ceased to be so on or before the date of
      commencement of this Act.
</p><p id="p_86">      (2) If the court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date

      shall forward the juvenile to the Board for passing
      appropriate order, and the sentence if any, passed by a
      court shall be deemed to have no effect."



</p><p id="p_87">35.   Proviso to sub-section (1) does lay down that a claim of

juvenility may be raised at any stage, even after final disposal

of the case. In the case of <a href="/doc/97130729/" id="a_57">Gurpreet Singh v. State of Punjab</a>,

(2005) 12 SCC 615, the claim of          juvenility under Juvenile

It was held:

      legality or otherwise of conviction of the accused and in
      case the conviction is upheld, a report should be called
      for from the trial court on the point as to whether the
      accused was juvenile on the date of occurrence and upon
      receipt of the report, if it is found that the accused was
      juvenile on such date and continues to be so, he shall be
      sent to juvenile home. But in case it finds that on the date
      of the occurrence, he was juvenile but on the date this
      Court is passing final order upon the report received from
      the trial court, he no longer continues to be juvenile, the
      sentence imposed against him would be liable to be set
      aside. Reference in this connection may be made to a
      decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1161696/" id="a_58">Bhoop Ram v. State of U.P</a>.
      (1989) 3 SCC 1, in which case at the time of grant of
      special leave to appeal report was called for from the trial
      court as to whether the accused was juvenile or not which
      reported that the accused was not a juvenile on the date
      of the occurrence but this Court, differing with the report
      of the trial court, came to the conclusion that the accused
      was juvenile on the date the offence was committed
      and as he was no longer a juvenile on the day of
      judgment of this Court, sentence awarded against him
      was set aside, though the conviction was upheld."

<p id="p_88">36.     A benefit of Act, 2000 was sought for the first time by

claiming juvenility   before this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1211001/" id="a_59">Murari

Thakur and Another v. State of Bihar</a>, AIR 2007 S.C. 1129 but

negated. This Court said:

      any merit in the said contention. The question of age of
      the accused appellants is a question of fact on which
      evidence, cross-examination, etc. is required and,
      therefore, it cannot be allowed to be taken up at this late
      stage. Hence, we reject this submission of the learned
      counsel for the appellant."

<p id="p_89">37. The question is : should an enquiry be made or report be

called for from the trial court    invariably where juvenility is

claimed for the first time before this Court.          Where the

materials placed before this Court by the accused, prima facie,

suggest that the accused was `juvenile' as defined in the Act,

2000 on the date of incident, it may be necessary to call for the

report or an enquiry be ordered to be made.        However, in a

case where plea of juvenility is found unscrupulous or the

materials lack credibility or do not     inspire confidence and

even, prima facie, satisfaction of the court is not made out, we

do not think any further exercise in this regard is necessary. If

the plea of juvenility was not raised before the trial court or the

High Court and is raised for the first time before this court, the

judicial conscience of the court must be satisfied by placing

adequate and satisfactory material that the accused had not

offence; sans such material any further enquiry into juvenility

would be unnecessary.

<p id="p_90">
</p><p id="p_91">38.   As regards A-2, two documents are relied upon to show

that he had not attained age of eighteen years on September

25/26, 2003. His age (17 years) mentioned by the trial court at

the time of recording his statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_61">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.

is tentative observation based on physical appearance which

is hardly determinative of age.    The other document is         the

school leaving       certificate issued by     Headmaster, Prem

Shiksha Niketan, Bilaspur, Rampur which does not inspire any

confidence as it seems to have been issued on October 16,

2006 after A-2 has already been convicted. Primary evidence

like entry from the birth register has not been produced. We


find it difficult   to accept   Annexure P-3 (school leaving

certificate) relied upon by counsel. For A-1, the only document

placed on record is a school leaving         certificate which   has

been procured after his conviction. In his case also, entry from

the birth register has not been produced.             We are not

impressed or satisfied with such material.         There being no

persuaded to call for report about the age of A-1 and A-2 on

the date of commission of offence.

view taken by the High Court is the only possible view on a

proper appraisement of evidence and no other view is possible

and it has not committed any error in upholding the conviction

of the accused persons for the offences punishable under

<a href="/doc/1973522/" id="a_62">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/268170/" id="a_63">34</a>; 376 and 201/34 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_64">IPC</a>. The sentence awarded
