issue in the lis stands covered by the judgment rendered by

this   Court    in   W.P.No.21723         of    2022     disposed      on

25-01-2023 which concerns the sister of the petitioner.

<p id="p_5">       3. Learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for

the respondents would also accept the same.

<p id="p_6">       4. This Court in W.P.No.21723 of 2022 disposed on

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">             &quot;3. Brief facts that leads the petitioner to this
       Court, in the subject petition, as borne out from the
       pleadings, are as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">              Petitioner claims to be belonging to a community
       recognized as backward class in terms of the central list
       notified by the Union Government. The petitioner is an
       MBBS graduate and seeking to pursue her M.D. - Doctor
       of Medicine. The petitioner aspiring to attempt INI-CET
       examination for the January 2023 session which was
       slated to be held on 13.11.2022, seeks to apply claiming
       reservation under the OBC-NCL category. The purpose of
       the certificate was to apply under the quota reserved for
       backward classes in the said examination.                 The
       jurisdictional Tahsildar declines to issue the certificate on
       the ground that the income of the family would cross the
       limit for issuance of the said certificate. It is this action
       that drives the petitioner to this Court in the subject
       petition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">              4. The learned senior counsel representing the
       petitioner would contend with vehemence that the
       Tahsildar erroneously includes the income of the brother
       of the petitioner to be the income of the father and

    declines to issue the certificate on the ground that the
    income exceeds the limit for issuance of a certificate to
    the petitioner under the category OBC-NCL. He would
    place reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the
    case of <a href="/doc/22081445/" id="a_1">SURINDER SINGH V. PUNJAB STATE
    ELECTRICITY BOARD, PATIALA</a> reported in (2014)15
    SCC 767.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           5. On the other hand, learned Additional
    Government Advocate representing the State would seek
    to contend that the income of the children of the father of
    the petitioner exceeds the limit prescribed for issuance of
    a certificate and therefore, no fault can be found with the
    declining of grant of a certificate to the petitioner.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">          6. I have given my anxious consideration to the
    submissions made by the learned senior counsel and the
    learned Additional Government Advocate      and have
    perused the material on record.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">           7. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The
    entitlement of the petitioner flows from certain
    Government orders issued.         All such and identical
    Government orders became the subject matter before the
    Apex Court in SURINDER SINGH1 (supra). The Apex
    Court considering the entire spectrum of the law has held
    as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                           &quot;....   ....     ....
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">                  2. Respondent 4 Anil Kumar Uppal, had also
          applied for appointment by way of direct recruitment, in
          response to the same advertisement (in furtherance
          whereof, the appellant was selected and appointed). His
          candidature was, however, not accepted. It is therefore,
          that Respondent 4 approached the Punjab and Haryana
          High Court at Chandigarh (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the
          High Court&quot;) seeking an appropriate direction to the
          Board, requiring it to allow him (Respondent 4) to
          participate in the process of selection. By an interim
          order [Anil Kumar Uppal v. Punjab SEB, WP (C) No.
          11699 of 2003, order dated 1-8-2003 (P&amp;H)] passed by
          the High Court, Respondent 4 was allowed to participate
          in the process of selection.

</p><p id="p_8">        3. On considering the candidature of Respondent
4, the Selection Committee awarded him 146 marks. It
is therefore apparent, that in terms of merit, Respondent
4 could not march over the superior claim of the
appellant. This was so because, whilst the appellant had
been awarded 164 marks in the process of selection,
Respondent 4 had been awarded only 146 marks.
</p>
<p id="p_9">       4. Respondent 4, in order to claim
appointment, chose to assail the claim of the
appellant by asserting, that the appellant did not
factually belong to the &quot;backward class&quot;, and as
such, his merit could not be determined with
reference to the posts reserved for &quot;backward
class&quot; candidates. If he could succeed in
establishing the aforesaid position, he would fall in
the zone of selection, being possessed of the next
highest marks (after the appellant) from the
category of backward class candidates. Insofar as
the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, the
pointed contention of Respondent 4 was, that the
appellant belonged to the &quot;creamy layer&quot;, and as
such, he was disentitled for being considered from
amongst &quot;backward class&quot; candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_10">       5. The High Court, while disposing of Writ
Petition No. 7660 of 2004, vide the impugned order
dated 2-3-2009 [Anil Kumar Uppal v. Punjab SEB,
ILR (2009) 2 P&amp;H 66 : (2009) 154 PLR 191] ,
arrived at the conclusion, that the appellant
actually belonged to the &quot;creamy layer&quot;, and as
such, was disentitled to be considered as a
&quot;backward class&quot; candidate. In arriving at the
aforesaid conclusion, the High Court took into
consideration the income of the appellant himself,
to declare that he belonged to the &quot;creamy layer&quot;.
The aforesaid determination was rendered by
reading down the policy instructions issued by the
State Government, on the basis whereof, the
backwardness of a candidate had to be adjudged.
The aforesaid policy instructions were read down,
to include the income of the person concerned,
along with the income of the parents of the person,
contemplated by the policy instructions.
</p>
<p id="p_11">        6. In the present appeal, the appellant seeks to
assail the aforesaid determination rendered by the High
Court. It was the vehement contention of the learned
counsel for the appellant, that the judgment referred to
by the High Court, for arriving at the conclusion, that the
personal income of the individual concerned had to be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                   -6-</span>
                                              WP No. 21720 of 2022




          taken into consideration, was a misreading of the
          judgment rendered by this Court. It is in the aforesaid
          background, that we shall endeavour to examine the
          policy instructions regulating the determination of the
          backwardness of candidates, and the judgments relied
          upon by the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                  7. First and foremost, reference needs to be
          made to the Office Memorandum dated 8-9-1993 issued
          by the Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public
          Grievances and Pension (Department of Personnel and
          Training). It is not a matter of dispute between the rival
          parties, that the aforesaid office memorandum is
          applicable to the present controversy. Under the Office
          Memorandum dated 8-9-1993, the claim of the appellant
          for grant of a backward class certificate was
          determinable under Category IV thereof, since it is not a
          matter of dispute that the appellant is a qualified
          Chartered Accountant. However, in Column 3 to the
          Schedule relating to Category IV, it is mentioned that the
          criteria specified against Category VI would be applicable
          to those who fall under Category IV. In the above view
          of the matter, our interpretation on the eligibility of the
          appellant for being declared as belonging to the
          backward class, would be determinable on the basis of
          the description relatable to Category VI. Category VI and
          the depiction to whom the same would be applicable, are
          being extracted hereunder:</p><pre id="pre_2">

</pre><p id="p_13">Having minutely examined Category VI, as also the
description contained in the Schedule, to whom the same
would apply, there is really no room for any doubt, that
in clauses (a) and (b) thereof, it is the income/wealth of
the parents of the individual concerned, which is of
relevance. The description is clearly silent about the
individual&#x27;s own income. It is not possible for us to
accept, that the individual&#x27;s own income could have been
taken into consideration. The above determination of
ours, is with reference to Categories IV and VI.
Therefore, even with reference to Category IV, which
includes professionals, the income of the professional,
has not been included. Thus viewed, we are satisfied,
that on the plain reading of Category VI of the Office

income of the individual concerned, but that of his
parents, that would determine whether he would fall
within the creamy layer or not.

<p id="p_14">       8. The question which still arises is, whether
it was open to the High Court, to include the
individual&#x27;s income in determining his eligibility for
being declared as backward class, by reading down
the policy instructions on the subject? Insofar as
the instant aspect of the matter is concerned,
there can be no doubt that the issue is
determinable with reference to the decision
rendered by this Court in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_3">Indra Sawhney v. Union

the present controversy, we need not travel to the

this Court, having examined the Office Memorandum
dated 8-9-1993, approved the same by observing as
under: (SCC p. 417, para 10)

        &quot;10. We have carefully examined the criteria for
identifying the &#x27;creamy layer&#x27; laid down by the
Government of India in the Schedule, quoted above, and
we are of the view that the same is in conformity with
the law laid down by this Court in Mandal case (<a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_6">Indra

India, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&amp;S) Supp 1

approving the rule of exclusion framed by the
Government of India in Para 2(c) read with the Schedule
of the Office Memorandum quoted above. The learned
counsel for the petitioners have also vehemently
commended that the State Governments should follow
the Government of India and lay down similar criteria for

<p id="p_16">       9. Based on the aforesaid declaration of law,
we are of the view that it was not open to the High
Court to evaluate the Office Memorandum dated 8-
9-1993 from any other parameters. It also needs
to be noticed, that the issue which came up for
determination in Ashoka Kumar Thakur case
[<a href="/doc/1866453/" id="a_8">Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar</a>, (1995) 5

decisions rendered by this Court in both Ashoka Kumar
Thakur cases [<a href="/doc/1866453/" id="a_14">Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar</a>,
(1995) 5 SCC 403 : 1995 SCC (L&amp;S) 1248 : (1995) 31

(2008) 6 SCC 1 : 3 SCEC 35] , we are of the view that
the High Court clearly erred in reading down the Office
Memorandum dated 8-9-1993 and to include therein the
income of the individual concern while determining
whether or not he fell within the &quot;creamy layer&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_21">       10. Despite the declaration of law in the
judgments, referred to hereinabove, it is also necessary
to take into consideration the clarification issued by the
Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public
Grievances and Pensions (Department of Personnel and
Training) dated 21-11-2002. The aforesaid clarification
was with reference to the Office Memorandum dated 8-
9-1993. Relevant extract of the clarificatory letter dated
21-11-2002 is being reproduced below:
</p>
<p id="p_22">       &quot;I am directed to refer to your Letter No.
2/25/2001 RC-1/670 dated 17-10-2002 on the
abovenoted subject and say that determination of
creamy layer for an OBC candidate is done with
reference to the income of parents as per instructions
contained in DoPT&#x27;s OM No. 36012/22/93-Estt(res) dated
8-9-1993.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_23">                                     (emphasis supplied)

        Based on the aforesaid conclusion, there is really
no room for any doubt, that the exposition with
reference to Category VI in the Office Memorandum
dated 8-9-1993 related only to the income of the parents
of the individual concerned. And that, the income of the
individual concerned was not to be taken into
consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_24">        11. The above issue came to be examined
yet again by the Government of India, Ministry of
Personnel,    Public   Grievances   and   Pensions
(Department of Personnel and Training) through
its memorandum dated 14-10-2004. In the above
memorandum, a large number of queries were
clarified. Queries at Serial Nos. (vi) and (vii) of
Para 4 are relevant to the present controversy, and
are accordingly reproduced hereunder:

        &quot;4. Following questions have been raised from
time to time about the application of the above
provisions to determine creamy layer.</blockquote>

<p id="p_25">        (vi) Will a candidate who himself is a directly
recruited Class I/Group A officer or a directly recruited
Class II/Group B officer who got into Class I/Group A at
the age of 40 or earlier be treated to be falling in creamy
layer on the basis of his service status?
</p>
<p id="p_26">       (vii) Will a candidate who has gross annual
income of Rs 2.5 lakhs or above or possesses wealth
above the exemption limit as prescribed in the <a href="/doc/983571/" id="a_16">Wealth
Tax Act</a> for a period of three consecutive years be
treated to fall in creamy layer?&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_27">       The aforesaid queries came to be answered in
Para 8 by observing as under:
</p>
<p id="p_28">       &quot;8. In regard to clauses (vi), (vii) and (viii) of
Para 4, it is clarified that the creamy layer status of a
candidate is determined on the basis of the status of his
parents and not on the basis of his own status or income
or on the basis of status or income of his/her spouse.
Therefore, while determining the creamy layer status of
a person the status or the income of the candidate
himself or of his/her spouse shall not be taken into
account.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_29">                                      (emphasis supplied)

        In view of the above, there is no room for
any further consideration, whether or not the
individual&#x27;s   income    is   to  be   taken   into
consideration, while computing the total income
relevant to determine whether an individual
belongs to the &quot;creamy layer&quot;. The above
clarification reveals, that it is only the parents&#x27;
income, which has to be taken into consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_30">        12.      While     referring    to     the
clarification/circular dated 14-10-2007 and 14-10-
2004 respectively, we have extracted hereinabove
the clear view of the Government of India. It
would also be necessary for us to notice, that the
above determination of the Government of India,
was adopted by the State of Punjab, as is apparent
from the letter issued by the Government of
Punjab, Welfare Department (Reservation Cell)
</p><p id="p_31">                                   - 12 -

              dated 14-10-2007, whereby the letter dated 17-8-
              2005 and the Memorandum dated 14-10-2004
              were circulated by the State Government to all its
              Deputy Commissioners. It is also not a matter of
              dispute, that the aforesaid circulars were expressly
              adopted by the Punjab State Electricity Board.
              Thus viewed, we are satisfied that the individual&#x27;s
              income was not required to be clubbed with the
              income of his parents, while determining whether
              or not he was eligible to be granted a backward
              class certificate. The determination to the contrary
              by the High Court is liable to be set aside. The
              same is accordingly hereby set aside.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_33">                                           (Emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_34">             8. The issue in the case at hand is identical. The
     Apex Court holds that in view of certain clarifications
     issued by the Government of Punjab therein there was no
     room for any further consideration while computing the
     total income relevant to determine whether the individual
     belongs to the creamy layer, it is only the parents income
     that is to be taken into consideration. In the case at hand
     as well, the Competent Authority takes the income of the
     brother of the petitioner to come to conclude that the
     income of the family would cross the limit for issuance of
     a certificate OBC-NCL.          The reason for which the
     certificate is declined is on the face of it contrary to law.

<p id="p_35">          9. The issue in the lis thus stands covered by the
     judgment rendered by the Apex Court in the case of
     SURINDER SINGH on all its fours.&quot;
</p>

<p id="p_36">     The only difference in the case at hand is that the income

of the petitioner is taken into consideration for rejection of his

application    seeking    OBC-NCL          certificate,   which   is   also

impermissible in the light of the law laid down by the Apex

Court and this Court (supra). All other findings rendered in the
