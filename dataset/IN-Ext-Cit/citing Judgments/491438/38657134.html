D.O. No. 6(3)(58)/99-LC(LS) dated : 3-5-1999
Dear Shri Kumarmangalam,

I am fonrvarding herewith the 169th report on "Amendment of Army, Navy and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_2">Air Force Act</a>s."

2. The subject was taken up suo motu in view of the observations ofthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lt. Col. <a href="/doc/278740/" id="a_3">Prithi
Pal Singh V. Union of India</a>, 1982(3) SCC 140 underlining a glaring deficiency in the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_4">Army Act</a> I72 absence ofthe
remedy of appeal against the orders of courts martial, and the desirability of recording reasons by courts martial in
support of their conclusions and orders. The Court in this case has also reviewed the developments in other coun-
tries such as U.K. and U.S.A. while making its recommendations.

3. The idea underlying the report is that while maintaining the discipline in the Armed Forces, the dignity of the
individual must be respected. It is necessary to ensure that Armed Forces are not deprived of the services of the
bright and courageous young men of the society on account of inadequate machinery for getting justice in the
Armed Forces, or for fear of being punished for no wrong done by them orforimposition ofdisproportionate punish-
ment for an offence. Effective justice system needs to be evolved to safeguard interests of officers in the military
with due regard to higher standards of conduct and discipline in the Armed Forces. Justice and discipline should go
together. "

4. in as much as no action has been taken by Parliament so far in pursuance ofjudgement of Prithi Pal Singh's
case the Law Commission considered it appropriate to undertake review of the existing laws on the subject.

5. The Law Commission had extensive discussions with the retired as well as serving officers of the three Armed
Forces before finalising its conclusions.

6. The recommendatiaons in this report seek to meet the deficiencies pointed out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in its decisions on the subject by suggesting measures for expeditious disposal of appeals against the orders of
courts martial. The report also recommends certain measures for prompt redressal of grievances relating to condi-
tions of service of the mambers of the Armed Forces.

With regards,

Yours Sincerely,

(B.P. Jeevan Reddy)

Shri P. Kumarmangalam,
Minister for Law, Justice &amp;
Company Affairs,

INTRODUCTION

1.</pre><p id="p_1">1 The Objective:--The idea underlying this report,
taken up -am» ///u///, is that while maintaing the
discipline in the Armed Forces, the dignity of the
individual must be respected. it is necessary to ensure
that Armed Forces are not deprived of the services
of the cream of the society and that the bright and
courageous among them do not keep out on account
of inadquate machinery for getting justice in the Armed
Forces, or for fear of being punished for no wrong
done by them. It is equally necessary to ensure that
punishment is not disproportionate to the offence and
also to make the military law more humane and
dynamic to bring it in tune with the culture in the armed
forces of the developed countries. it should be
remembered that a soldier's life is not a comfortable
one. Most ofthe time he is away from his family. It is
the sense of pride and sacrifice in the cause of
country's defence that sustains him. It would not be
proper to deny him justice which is available to other
citizens of the country. It must also be remembered
that military discipline cannot be based only upon
domination and implicit obedience to the orders of
the superiors. The superiors must continuously
demonstrate their competence and technical ability
in order to command respect and loyalty of those
under them. Keeping this in mind, many democratic
nations have felt it necessary to rewrite their military
laws to provide greater protection against arbitrary
action. It is not correct to say that in as much as the

number of persons affected by military law and the
courts martial are small or because the members of
the Armed Forces have voluntarily submitted
themselves to the existing system with all its defects,
no reform of the law is called for. It should not be
forgotten that military justice system is evolved to
enforce certain standards of behaviour, some of which
are identical to standards enforced in civilian life. The
higher standards of conduct and discipline in the
Armed Forces are called for not only to keep in
readiness an efficient fighting machine but also to
command public respect for the Armed Forces.
Justice and discipline should go together.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.2 It should also be borne in mind that even today
interference by High Court and Supreme Court with the
decisions and findings of courts martial are not totally
excluded. instead of each High Court adopting its own
approach in these matters. it would be desirable, and it
would be conducive to better discipline, if a single
appellate tribunal is created to hear the appeals against
the findings, decisions and orders of the courts martial
under all the three enactments. <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_5">The Army Act</a> and the
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_6">Air Force Act</a> were enacted in 1949-50 and are based
mostly upon the British Acts. While the law in the United
Kingdom has made several advances as indicated
hereinbefore, the military law in India hasremained more
or less rooted in the past. This report is an attempt to
rectify the situation in certain respects.

<p id="p_3">Chapter I

INDIAN MILITARY LAW--|TS ORIGIN AND EXTENT

</p><p id="p_4">(i) Introductory

2.1 Origin of the Indian Army:--The origin of Indian
Military Law is succintlydescribed in the Manual of
Military Law 1. The Indian Army sprang from very small

' beginnings. Guards were enrolled for the protection of

the factories or trading posts which were establihsed
by the East India company at Surat, Masulipatam,
Armagon, Madras, Hooghly and Balasore in the first half
of the seventeenth century. These guards were at first
intended to add to the dignity of the Chief Officials as
much as for a defensive purpose, and in some cases
special restrictions were even placed by treaty on their
strength, so as to prevent their acquiring any military
importance. Gradually, however, the organisation of
these guards was improved and from them sprang the
East Indian Company's European and Indian troops.
Both these steadily increased in numbers, until in 1857,
it numbered (including local forces and contigents, and
a body of 38,000 military police) no less than 311038
officers and men (Imperial Gazetter of India, 1907, Vol.
IV (Ch. XI).
</p>
<p id="p_5">2.2 E.l., Company's Mutiny Act:-Statutory provision
was first made for the discipline of the East India
Company's troops by an Act (27 Geo ll, Cap 9) passed
in 1754 for "Punishing Mutiny and Desertion of officers
and soliders in the service of the United Company of
Merchants of England trading to the East Indies, and
for the punishment of offences committed in the East-
Indies, or at the Island of Saint Helena". <a href="/doc/1001185/" id="a_7">Section 8</a> of
this Act empowered the Crown to make Articles of War
for the government of these troops, and such articles
were accordingly made and published. The terms of
the Act were wide enough to cover both European and
Indian troops, but the language of the articles
themselves showed that they were originally intended
for Europeans only. In the absence of any other code,
however, the Government of Bengal, Madras and
Bombay seem to have applied these articles, with such
modifications and omissions as appeared necessary,
to the bodies of Indian troops maintained by them, of
which the present Indian Army is the descendant. In
1813, owing to doubts having arisen as to the legal
validity of the existing arrangements for the discipline
of the Indian troops, provisions were inserted in the Act
(53 Geo Ill, Cap 155 ss 96 and 97) which was passed

in that year to extend the Company's privileges for a
further term, which Iegalised the existing system and
gave power to each of the Governments of Fort William,
Fort Saint George and Bombay to make laws,
regulations, and Articles of War for the government of
all Indian officers and soldiers in their respective
services. It was further provided in 1824 (4 Geo Iv, Cap
81, s 63). that such legislation should apply to the Indian
troops of each presidency, wherever serving, and
whether within or beyond His Majesty's dominions.
</p>
<p id="p_6">2.3 Each Presidency Frames its own code :--Under
the statutory sanction of these two enactments a military
code was framed by the government of each presidency
and put in force as regards its own troops. These codes
still followed to a great extent the Articles of War then
applicable to the Company's Europeans, but the only
punishments awardable to Indian officers seem to have
been death, dismissal, suspension and reprimand and
to Indian soliders, death and corporal punishment.
Transportation and imprisonment were not awardable.
</p>
<p id="p_7">(ii) The Articles of War

2.4 Government of India Act, 1833, and the "Articles
of War" :-- By section 73 of the Government of India
Act, 1833 (3 and 4 Will. IV, Cap 85) the power to legislate
forthe whole Indian Army was restricted to the Governor
General of Council and laws so made were given
general application to all Indian Officers and soldiers
wherever serving. Under the powers conferred upon it
by the Act of 1833 the Indian Legislature, for the first
time, provided a common code for the Indian officers
and soldiers in 1845, "Articles of War" being enacted
for them by the Governor General in Council as Act XX
of that year. <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_8">This Act</a> was shortly afater repealed and
replaced by Act XIX of 1847 which, having been
frequently amended (Acts of Governor General in
Council VI of 1850, XXXVI of 1850, III of 1854, X of
1856, VIII of 1857, XXII of 1857, and VI of 1860 in the
intervening period) was in turn repealed by Act XXXIX
of 1861. This was repealed by Act V of 1869 ("The Indian
Articles of War') which replaced it. The preamble to this
Act indicates that for the first time recognition was
granted to the existence of what are commonly known



as "fot|owers" and Act V was equally made applicable
to them.
</p>
<p id="p_8">2.5 Amendment of "Articles" in 1894 .-The
amalgamation of the three armies maintained by the
Presidencies into one in 1895 necessitated considerabte
amendments in the ''Indian Articles of War". These
amendments were effected by Act Xli of 1894 and
the Indian Articles of War, as altered by this Act, and
by various minor amendig Acts, (Acts of Governor-
General in Council, XII of 1891, I of 1900, I of 1901,
IX of 1901, XII! of 1904, and V of 1905) furnished the
statutory basis of the Indian Military code until 1911.
As time went on, however, and the Indian Army began
to take its share in the imperial responsibilities ofthe
British Army, it was found that an Act originally framed
for three separatelocal forces, each serving as a rule
in its own Presidency, failed to provide adequately
forthe discipline and administration of that army under
modern conditions. Owing also to the mass of
amendments super-imposed on the original articles,
these were often difficult to understand and sometimes
even self-contradictory.
</p>
<p id="p_9">2.6 <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_9">The Indian Army Act</a>, 1911 :--The amendment of
the Indian Articles of War was, therefore, again taken
up in 1908, but the consideration then given to the
subject showed that a new consolidating and amending
Act would be necessary, any further amendment of the
articles of 1869 being only tikely to accentuate the
existing confusion. Accordingly, <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_10">Indian Army Act</a>,
consolidating the existing law as to the Indian Army into
one simple and comprehensive enactment and adding
such provisions as experience had shown to be
necessary, was passed into law in March, 1911 and
came into force on 1st Januan/. 1912. All previous Acts
dealing with the subject were repealed by <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_11">section 127</a>
of the said Act. Amendments were subsequently made
to this Act by various amending Acts. (Acts of Governor-
General in Council, XV of 1914, X of 1917, XI of 1918,
XVIII of19't9, ll of1920, XXXVII of 1920, X)(XlII of1923,
VIII of 1930, X)(XllI of 1934 and VII of 1935).
</p>
<p id="p_10">2. 7 The Indian Anny (Suspension of Sentences) Act,
1920 :--During the 1914-18 was temporary Acts (Acts
of Governor General in Council IV of 1917 and XVII of
1918) were passed to provide for the suspension of
sentences. These measures were found to be beneﬁcial
and on 23rd March, 1920 a permanent Act to provide
for the suspension of sentences of imprisonment or
transportation passed by courts martial on persons
subject to the indian <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_12">Army Act</a>, which repealed the
temporary Acts, came into force. <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_13">This Act</a> which is
known as the "Indian Army (Suspension of Sentences)
Act" (Act of Governor General in Council XX of 1920)
was to be read as one with the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_14">Indian Army Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_11">2.8 <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_15">Army Act</a>, 1950 :--The need for a general revision
of the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_16">Indian Army Act</a>, 1911 was felt for some time
prior to 1947. Some of the provisions of the said Act
had become out of date and insufﬁcient for modern
requirements; but after 15 August 1947, the need for
revision became imperative for obvious reasons. A Bill
to consolidate and amend the law relating to the
government of the regular Army was, therefore,
introduced in the Constituent Assembly of India on 21
December, 1949. This was passed into law by the
Parliament on 20th May, 1950 as <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_17">Army Act</a> (Act XLVI of
1950) and came into force on 22nd July, 1950.
Amendments subsequently made by the amending Ads
are Acts XIX of 1955, XXXVI of 1957, adaapted by 3
ALO 1956.
</p>
<p id="p_12">2.9 Rules and other "subordinate Eegislation" :--The
present military code of Army is thus contained in the
<a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_18">Army Act</a>, 1950 and certain rules and other matters
which latter, being made in pursuance of the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_19">Army Act</a>
by authorities therein empowered to do so, have the
force of law. Examples of this latter class of "subordinate
legislation" are the Army Rules, 1954 framed by the
Central Government under <a href="/doc/1445586/" id="a_20">Section 191</a> of the Army Act,
and those as to "Summary and Minor punishments"
contained in para 443 of the Regulations forthe Army,
1962 which derive their statutory force from orders
issued by the COAS with the consent of the Central
Government in pursuance of AA.s.82.
</p>


<p id="p_13">Chapter III

OBSERVATIONS OF THE HON'BLE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

3.1 Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh's case :--As far back as
1982, the Supreme Court had, in its decision in Lt. Col.
Prithi Pal Singh v. union of India' pointed out a glaring
deficiency in the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_21">Army Act</a> z absence of the remedy
of appeal against the orders of courts martial. The court
also pointed out the changes brought about in recent
decades on this subject both in U.K. and U.S.A. and
observed that Parliament should bring about similar
legislation consistent with the changed value system.
They also pointed out the desirability of recording
reasons by the court martial in support of their
conclusions and orders. it would be appropriate to notice
the relevant observations of the Supreme Court in
paragraphs 44 and 45 of the said judgment :--
</p>
<p id="p_14">"Reluctance ofthe apex court more concerned with
civil law to interfere with the internal affairs of the
Army is likely to create a distorted picture in the minds
of the military personnel that persons subject to <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_22">Army
Act</a> are not citizens of India. It is one of the cardinal
feature of our Constitution that a person by enlisting
in or entering Armed Forces does not cease to be a
citizen so as to wholly deprive him of his rights under
the Constitution. More so when this court held in <a href="/doc/162242/" id="a_23">Sunil
Batra v. Delhi Administration</a> (1979) 1SCR 392,
495 that even prisoners deprived of personal liberty
are not wholly denuded of their fundamental rights.
In the larger interest of national security and military
discipline, Parliament in its wisdom may restrict or
abrogate such rights_in their application tothe Armed
Forces but this process should not be carried so far
as to create a class of citizens not entitled to the
benefits of the liberal spirit of Constitution. Persons
subect to <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_24">Army Act</a> are citizens of this ancient land
having a feeling of belonging to the civilised
community governed by the liberty-oriented
Constituion. Personal liberty makes forthe worth of
human being and is a cherished and prized right.
Deprivation thereof must be preceded by an enquiry
ensuring fair, just and reasonable procedure and trial
by a judge of unquestioned integrity and wholly
unbiased. ...Absence of even one appeal with
power to review evidence, legal formulation,
conclusion and adequacy or otherwise of
punishment is a glaring lacuna in a country where
a counterpart civilian convict can prefer appeal after
appeal to hierarcy of courts. Submission that full
review of finding and/or sentence in confirmation

proceeding under <a href="/doc/1450427/" id="a_25">section 153</a> is provided for is
poor solace. A hierarchy of courts with appellate
powers each having its own power ofjudicial review
has of course been found to be counter-productive
but the converse is equally distressing in that there
is not even a single judicial review. With the
expanding horizons of fair play in action even in
administrative decision, the universal declaration of
human rights and retributive justice being relegated
to the uncivilised days, a time has come when a
step is required to be taken for at least one review
and it must truly be a judicial review as and by
way of appeal to a body composed of non-military
personnel or civil personnel. Army is always on
alert for repelling external aggression and
suppressing internal disorder so that the peace-loving
citizens enjoy a social order based on rule of law;
the same cannot be denied to the protectors of this
order. And it must be realised that an appeal from
Ceaser to Ceaser's wife--confirmation proceeding
under <a href="/doc/1450427/" id="a_26">section 153-</a>-has been condemned as
injudicious and merely a lip sympathy to form. The
core question is whether at least there should be
one appeal to a body composed of non-military
personnel and who would enjoy the right of
judicial review both on law and facts as also
determine the adequacy of punishment being
commensurate with the gravity of the offence
charged. Judicial approach by people well-versed in
objective analysis of evidence trained by experience
to look at facts and law objectively, fair play and
justice cannot always be sacrificed at the altar of
military discipline. Unjust decision would be
subversive of discipline. There must be a
judicious admixture of both. And nothing
revolutionary is being suggested. OurArmy Act was
more or less modelled on the U.K. Act. Three decades
of its working with winds of change blowing over the
world necessitates a second look so as to bring it in
conformity with liberty-oriented constitution and rule
of law which is the uniting and integrating force in
our political society. Even U.K. has taken a step of
far reaching importance for rehabilitating the
confidence ofthe Royal Forces in respect ofjudicial
review of decisions of court martial. U.K. had enacted
a Court Martial (Appeals) Act of 1951 and it has
been extensively amended in Court Martial
(Appeals) Act, 1968. Merely providing an appeal by



itself may not be very reassuring but the personnel
of the appellate court must inspire confidence. The
court martial appellate court consists of the ex-officio
and ordinary judges of the Court of AppeaI,.such of
thejudges of the Queen's Bench Division asthe Lord
Chief Justice may nominate after consultation with
the Master of the Rolls, such of the Lords,
commissioners of Justiciary in Scotland as the Lord
Chief Justice generally may nominate, such Judges
of the Supreme Court ofthe Northern Ireland as the
Lord Chief Justice of the Northern Ireland may
nominate and such of the persons of legal experience
as the Lord Chancellor may appoint. The cour martial
appellate court has powerto determine any question
necessary to be determined in order to do justice in
the case before the court and may authorise a new
trial where the conviction is quashed in the light of
fresh evidence. The court also has power inter alia,
to order production of documents of exhibits
connected with the proceedings, orderthe attendance
of witnesses, receive evidence, obtain reports and
the like from the_ members ofthe court martial orthe

persons who acted as Judge-Advocate, order a'

reference of any question to a Special Commissioner
for Enquiry and appoint a person with special expert
knowledge to act as an assessor (Halasbury's Laws
of England, 4th Edn., paras 954-55, pp 458-459).
Frankly the appellate court has power of full judicial
review unhampered by any procedural claptrap.
Turning towards the U.S.A., a reference to Uniform
Code of Military Justice Act, 1950, would be
instructive. A provision has been made for setting up
of a court of militry appeals. <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_27">The Act</a> contained many
procedural reforms and due process safeguards not
then guaranteed in civil courts. To cite one example,
the right to legally qualified counsel was made
mandatory in general court martial cases 13 years
before the decision of the Supreme Court in Gideon
v. Wainwright (372 US 335 (1963). Between 1950
and 1968 when the Administration of Justice Act,
1968 was introduced, many advances were made in
the administration of justice by civil courts but they
were not reflected in military court proceedings. To
correct these deficiencies the Congress enacted
Military Justice Act, 1968, the salient features of which
are: (1) a right to legally qualified counsel guaranteed
to an accused before any special court martial; (2) a
militaryjudge can in certain circumstances conduct
the trial alone and the accused in such a situation is
given the option after tearing the identity ofthe military
judge of requesting forthe trial by thejudge alone. A
ban has been imposed on command interference with
military justice, etc. Ours is still an antiquated
system. The wind of change blowing over the

county has not permeated the close and
sacrosanct precincts of the Army. If in civil courts
the universally accepted dictum is that justice must
not only be done but it must seem to be done, the
same holds good with all the greater vigour in case
of court martial where the judge and the accused
done the same dress, have the same mental
discipline, have a strong hierarchical subjugation and
a feeling of bias in such circumstances is
irremovable".
</p>
<p id="p_15">(emphasis supplied)

The Supreme Court concluded with the following
observations :--
</p>
<p id="p_16">"We, therefore, hope and believe that the
changes all over the English-speaking
democracies will awaken our Parliament to the
changed value system. In this behalf, we would
like to draw pointed attention of the
Government to the glazing anomaly that courts
martial do not even write a brief reasoned order
in support of their conclusion, even in cases
in which they impose the death sentence. This
must be remedied in order to ensure that a
disciplined and dedicated Indian Army may not
nurse a grievance that the substance ofjustice
and fair play is denied to it."
</p>
<p id="p_17">(emphasis supplied)

3.2 S.N. Mukherjee's case :----In 1990, a Constitution
Bench of the Supreme Court, in <a href="/doc/400596/" id="a_28">S.N. Mukherjee v.
Union of India</a>' while emphasising the undeniable
desirability of the recording of reasons as a principle of
natural justice, held that the same cannot be insisted
upon in the proceedings taken under the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_29">Army Act</a>. The
court pointed out that the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_30">Army Act</a> and the rules made
thereunder provided for recording of reasons only in
two situations and in no other situation. The two
situations in which reasons are required to be recorded
are--(a) where the court martial makes a
recommendation of mercy and (b) where the
proceedings of the summary court martial are set
aside or the sentence imposed by it is reduced. The
court held furtherthat;
</p>
<p id="p_18">"reasons are not required to be recorded for an order
passed by the confirming authority conﬁrming the
findings and sentence recorded by the court martial
as well as for the order passed by the Central
Government dismissing the post-confirmation
petition".
</p>

RELEVAi'éT STATUTDRY FROWSIGNS

«it in the year 1992, Partiament enacted the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_31">Army
(Amendment) Act</a>, 3992, being Act hip 37' of 1992.
Severai provisions of the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_32">Army Act</a> were amended but
no provisions were made as recommended by the
Supreme Court in Prithi Pal Singh. However, under
SRO 17E dated December 6, 1993, sub--rule (1) or rule
62 of the Anny Rules was amended obligirrg the tribunal
to give brief reasons in support of its decision. The
amendment reads :-
</p>
<p id="p_20">"(1) The finding on every charge upon which the
accused is arraigned shall be recorded and, except
as provided in these rules, shall be recorded as
finding as 'Guilty' or of 'Not Guilty'. After recording
the finding on each charge, the court shall give brief
reasons in support thereof. The judge advocate or, it
there is none, the presiding officer shall record or
cause to be recorded such brief reasons in the
proceedings. The above record shalt be signed and
dated by the presiding officer and the judge advocate,
if any."
</p>
<p id="p_21">4.2 inexplicably, similar amendment has not been
effected in respect of courts menial under the Navy and
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_33">Air Force Act</a>s.
</p>
<p id="p_22">4.3 Need for taking up the subject sue motu :---In
as much as no action has been taken on Parliament so
far as recommended by the Supreme Court in Prithi
Pal Singh, where the developments in other countries
such as in UK. and U.S.A. had also been taken into
consideration, the Law Commission has considered it
appropriate to undertake review of the existing laws on
the subject suo motu.
</p>
<p id="p_23">4.4 Brief surveyor thet<a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_34">Army Act</a>, 1350 :-«<a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_35">The Army
Act</a>, enacted in the year 1950, contains as many as
16 chapters. Chapter Vi sets out the various offences
and chapter Vii sets out the punishments. We are,
however, concerned only with the provisions
contained in chapters X, X! and Xlt which deal with
courts martial, procedure of courts martial and

comprises <a href="/doc/1195410/" id="a_36">sections 108</a> to <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_37">127</a>. <a href="/doc/1195410/" id="a_38">Section 108</a> provides

general courts-martial and summary courts-martial.
The other provisions in the chapter provide for

convening of the various kinds of courts martial, their
powers and ctiserinciderrtal matters.

the title of the chapter itself indicates, these sections
prescribe the procedure to be followed by court martial

4.4.2 Chapter Xll comprising <a href="/doc/1450427/" id="a_41">sections 153</a> to <a href="/doc/1615380/" id="a_42">165</a>,
provides for confirmation and revision of the orders of
court martial. <a href="/doc/1450427/" id="a_43">Section 153</a> says that no finding or
sentence of a general, district or summary general
court-martial shall be valid except so far as it may be
conﬁrmed as provided by Act. {The finding and sentence
of a sumrnary court martial, however, is not required to
be confirmed and it can be carried out forthwith as
provided in section tot. Of course, the very section
provides an exception to the said rule oz, it the officer
holding the trial is of less than five years service, he
shall not, except on active service, carry into effect any
sentence until it has received the approval of an officer
commanding not less than a brigade.) <a href="/doc/138051/" id="a_44">Section 160</a>
provides for revision of a finding or sentence recorded
by the court--martlal. it says " any finding or sentence of
a court martial which requires confirmation may be once
revised by order of the conﬁrming authority and on such
revisions, the Court if so directed by the contirrning
authority, may take additional evidence." Section t63
provides that even where the finding of guilty by a court
martial has been confirmed or where such a ﬁnding does
not require confirmation, is found for any reason to be
invalied or not supported by evidence, the authority
competent to commute the punishment under-<a href="/doc/1840070/" id="a_45">section
179</a> may substitute a new finding and pass a sentence
for the offence specified or involved in such ﬁnding.
<a href="/doc/1154592/" id="a_46">Section 164</a> provides for conﬁrmation and the remedy
for the persons against whom a finding or sentence of
the court martial has been confirmed. it would be
appropriate to reproduce <a href="/doc/1154592/" id="a_47">section 164</a> in its entirety :
</p>
<p id="p_25">"164 . Remedy, against order, ﬁnding or sentence
of courtanartial :--{1) Any person subject to this Act
who considers himself aggrieved by any order passed
by any court-martiai may present a petition to the
officer or authority empowered to confirm any ﬁnding
or sentence of such court-martial, and the confirming
authority may take such steps as may be considered
necessary to satisfy itself as to the correctness,
iegality or propriety of the order passed or as to the



regularity of any proceeding to which the order
relates.
</p>
<p id="p_26">(2) Any person subjectto this Act who considers
himself aggrieved by a finding or sentence of any
court-martial which has been conﬁrmed, may present
a petition to the Central Government, the Chief of
the Army Staff or any prescribed officer superior in
command to the one who confirmed such finding or
sentence, and the Central Government, the Chief of
the Army Staff or other officer, as the case may be,
may pass such orderthereon as it or he thinks fit."
</p>
<p id="p_27">4.4.3 <a href="/doc/1615380/" id="a_48">Section 165</a> empowersthe Central Government,
the Chief of the Army Staff or any prescribed officer to
annual the proceedings of any court martial on the
ground that they are illegal or unjust.
</p>
<p id="p_28">4.5 No existing right of appeal against the order
of the courts matial :--It is thus evident that in the
case of a final finding or sentence awarded by the
ganeral courts martial, district courts martial and
summary general courts martial, the only remedy
provided to the accused persons is the one provided
in sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1154592/" id="a_49">section 164</a> as pointed out by
the Supreme Court in S.N. Mukherjee's case. (The
opportunity to make a representation to the confirming
authority before conﬁrmation is not a remedy but only
an opportunity to make a representation before the
final order is passed). The said remedy under <a href="/doc/1906530/" id="a_50">section
164(2)</a> can be invoked only after the finding of the
sentence has been confirmed by the confirming
authority and not before the confirmation of the
same. The power or revision and the power to alter
the finding or sentence in certain cases or for that
matterthe power to annual the proceedings provided
by <a href="/doc/138051/" id="a_51">sections 160</a>, <a href="/doc/1993658/" id="a_52">163</a> and <a href="/doc/1615380/" id="a_53">165</a> are not so much the
remedies given to the accused persons but are really
the powers ofthe various specified authorties. ln sum,
there is no right of appeal against the order of the
court martial (/A, where it has been confirmed as
required by law or where it does not require such
confirmation, as the case may be), or against an
orader passed under sub-section (2) of sectio 164,
with which the accused is aggrieved.
</p>
<p id="p_29">4.6 Differences in the procedures in the <a href="/doc/957745/" id="a_54">Navy Act</a>
and the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_55">Army Act</a> :--Pausing here, we may point out
that the procedure provided by the <a href="/doc/957745/" id="a_56">Navy Act</a>, 1957, in
this behalf is different from that under the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_57">Army Act</a> in
certain respects. The differences between the two
are :-
</p>
<p id="p_30">(a) <a href="/doc/957745/" id="a_58">The Navy Act</a> does not require confirmation of the
sentence or order recorded by the courts martial
as is required by the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_59">Army Act</a>. The only exception
is where a sentence of imprisonment lS awarded to
an officer-in which case the sentence pronounced
by the court martial cannot be implemented until
the same has been communicated to the Chief of
Naval Staff, who is entitled to pass such orders
thereon as he may think fit. The sentence or order
shall be implemented subject to such directions as
he may make. it is the responsibility of the convening
authority to take necessary steps to give effect to
the sentence (Regulation 194 of the Regulations
forthe Navy Part-ll).
</p>
<p id="p_31">(b) <a href="/doc/957745/" id="a_60">The Navy Act</a> provides for judicial review of the
proceddings of trials held by court martial. The
power of judicial review is vested in the Judge
Advocate General which power can be exercised
either suo motu or on an application made by the
aggrieved person. it is open to the Judge Advocate
General to afford an opportunity of personal hearing
to the convict if the circumstance of the case so
call for. The convict can be heard either in persons
or through an advocate or an officer of the Indian
Navy. The Judge Advocate General then makes a
report to the Chief of Naval Staff for such orders
thereon as the latter may think fit. (<a href="/doc/138051/" id="a_61">Section 160</a>).
<a href="/doc/136290/" id="a_62">Section 161</a> of the Navy Act provides that in all
cases of capital sentence and in all cases where
the courts martial is ordered by the President, the
Chief of Naval Staff shall send the matter with his
recommendations to the Central Government. In
other cases, the discretion lies with him to send such
a report to the Central Government or not.
</p>
<p id="p_32">(c) According to sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/160306/" id="a_63">section 161</a> . an order
of acquittal made by the courts martial cannot be
interfered with or set aside either by the Judge
Advocate General orthe Chief of the Naval Staff.
</p>
<p id="p_33">(d) <a href="/doc/1114044/" id="a_64">Section 162</a> provides that it is open to a person
aggrieved with the finding or sentence of any court
martial to present a petition to the Central
Government orthe Chief of Naval Staff. This remedy
is in addition to the remedy of filing an application
before the Judge Advocate General provided by
<a href="/doc/138051/" id="a_65">section 160</a>. <a href="/doc/1993658/" id="a_66">Section 163</a> provides that on such
petition being filled the Central Government or the
Chief of Naval Staff may make any of the orders
specified therein except on order to enhance the
sentence.
</p>


<p id="p_34">Chapter V

HOW THE OBJECTIVES CAN BE ATTAINED

5.1 Conclusions regarding appeals against the ﬁnal
orders passed by the courts martial :--The Law
Commission is of the opinion that in order to achieve
the objectives discussed in the Chapter I :--
</p>
<p id="p_35">It is necessary to provide an appropriate appellate
forum to enterin appeals against the ﬁnal orders
passed by the courts maratial. As explained
hereinabove, while the Army and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_67">Air Force Act</a>s
provide for confirmation of the sentence or ﬁnding
made by the courts martial (except the summary
courts martial), the <a href="/doc/957745/" id="a_68">Navy Act</a> does not provide for
any such conﬁrmation. In this connection, we are also
of the opinion that it is not necessary to compel every
aggrieved person to necessarily adopt the procedure
prescribed by sub-section (2) of section 164 of the
Army Actor for that matter corresponding provision
of the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_69">Air Force Act</a>, 1950. An appeal should be
available against the ﬁnal order (sentence or finding)
of court martial. Indeed in view of the Tribunal
proposed herein, sub-section (2) of the <a href="/doc/1154592/" id="a_70">Section 164</a>
and the corresponding provision in the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_71">Air Force Act</a>
may as well be deleted. Eventhe provisions relating
to judicial review by Judge-Advocate General in the
<a href="/doc/957745/" id="a_72">Navy Act</a> can also be deleted.
</p>
<p id="p_36">5.1.1 The appellate tribunal, in our opinion, should not
be a totally civilian appellate tribunal as has been
provided in the United Kingdom since it may not be
conducive to the discipline of the Armed Forces. We
think it more appropriate to create a tribunal headed by
a civilian judge whose other members shall be drawn
from the retired members of the Armed Forces, and,
from among those who have acted as or worked in the
Judge Advocate General's department. To be precise,
it shall be a three-member tribunal consisting of (1) a
retired Judge of the Supreme Court or a retired Chief
Justice of High Court who shall be the Chairman for a
term of 4 years, (2) a retired ofﬁcer of the Army of the
rank of Major General or above, or a retired ofﬁcer of
the Air Force of the rank of Air Vice Marshal or a retired
officer of the Navy of the rank of Rear Admiral, and (3)

a retired Judge Advocate General of the ArmylAir Forcel
Navy.
</p>
<p id="p_37">The term of the.President and members shall be four
years. However, if an appeal is preferred by a person
holding a rank higher than the rank held by the person
appointed as member at the time of his retirement from
category 2 above, the President ofthe Tribunal will write
to the'Central Government to nominate a retired ofﬁcer
forthe case as a member of the Tribunal, who shall be
of a rank not lower than that of the person who has
preferred an appeal, in place of the member from
category 2.
</p>
<p id="p_38">5.1.2 The quorum forthe tribunal shall be two, but no
decision shall be rendered by the tribunal except with
the participation of the President.
</p>
<p id="p_39">5.1.3 The tribunal shall be common to Army, Navy and
Air Force. The seat of the tribunal shall be Delhi, but it
shall be open to the tribunal to hold its sittings at such
other places as it may -decide in the interest of
convenience of all concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_40">5.1.4 From the decision of the tribunal, a direct
statutory appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court. This is
not something new since such direct appeals are already
provided by certain other enactments. For example,
<a href="/doc/25877546/" id="a_73">section 130-E</a> of the Customs Act, and <a href="/doc/36356506/" id="a_74">section 35-L</a> of
the Central Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_75">Salt Act</a>, 1944, or forthat matter
<a href="/doc/271754/" id="a_76">section 23</a> of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. In
view of proposed statutory appeal to the Supreme Court,
it is expected that no High Court will entertain a writ
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_77">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India
against the orders of the appellate tribunal. if such an
appeal is provided, it would be appropriate to delete
clause (2) of <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_78">Article 136</a> of the Constitution which
provides that the powerto grant special leave to appeal
conferred upon the Supreme Court by clause (1) of the
said article shall not apply to any judgment,
determination, sentence or order passed or made by
any court or tribunal constituted by or under any law
relating to the Armed Forces.
</p>


<p id="p_41">Chapter Vi

OTHER CONCLUSIONS

6.1 Examination of Views of the Armed Forces
Personnel :---Betore ﬁnalising this report, the Law
Commission had extensive discussions with the retired
as well as serving officers of the three armed forces.
They not only supported the proposals contained in
Chapter-V, but also requested that that the tribunal so
created should not be confined to the orders passed by
courts martial but should also havejurisdiction in respect
of disputes relating to conditions of service of the
members of these armed forces. They brought to our
notice that every year hundreds of writ petitions were
being filed by members of the armed forces in several
High Courts in india concerning their service matters
including questions of seniority, promotion, pension and
other conditions of service. They submitted that in many
High Courts such matters were entertained and
disposed of by a single judge. against whose orders a
writ appeal/special appeal lies to the division bench of
that High Court and against the orders of the division
bench the appeals are being filed in the Supreme Court
with the leave of the court under <a href="/doc/1218877/" id="a_79">article 136(1)</a> of the
Constitution. They submitted that in the interest of
discipline of the Armed Forces and for the prompt
redressal of any grievances concerning their conditions
of service, there ought to be a special tribunal against

_whose orders an appeal should directly lie to the

Supreme Court. The present position. they submitted.
was not satisfa ctory, apart from the fact that the remedy
of writ was a restricted remedy where the courts
interfered only on certain limited grounds. They pointed
out that even while adjudicating the disputes relating to
service conditions, the adjudicating authority should be
aware of the discipline and working culture of the Armed
Forces to arrive at an appropriate decision.
</p>
<p id="p_42">6.2.1 it would be seen at once that the aforesaid
request practically amounts to a request for creation of
a service tribunal forArmed Forces more of less on the
pattern of administrative tribunals created under the
<a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_80">Administrative Tribunals Act</a>, 1985 except for the fact
that the proposal contemplates a direct statutory appeal
to Supreme Court. if so, one must, in this connection,
take note of the fact that such a tribunal may fall within
the four corners of <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_81">article 1323-10.</a> of the Constitution. We
must also take notice of the decision ofthe seven-Judge
Bench of the supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1152518/" id="a_82">L. Chandra Kumar v.
Union of India</a>' and the background and development
leading up to the said decision. One must also take note

of the mechanism created by the said decision
whereunder all service disputes are directed to be raised
in the first instance before the administrative tribunal
against whose decision, remedy of judicial review under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_83">article 226</a> is made available, subject to the condition
that such a petition forjudicial review should be heard
by a division bench. One of the considerations
underlying this decision was to stop the unmanageable
flow of appeals filed in Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_84">article
136</a> against the decisions of the Administrative
Tribunals--indeed even against the decisions rendered
by administrative members sitting singly. <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_85">The
Administrative Tribunals Act</a>, however, did not provide
for a statutory appeal as is provided by the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_86">Central
Excise Act</a>/<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_87">Customs Act</a> (in certain matters) and the
<a href="/doc/1733066/" id="a_88">Consumer Protection Act</a> and, therefore, the appeals
against the orders of the Administrative Tribunal had to
be and were being filed under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_89">article 136.</a> Yet the
reluctance of the Supreme Court to entertain appeals
in service matters has to be taken into consideration.
Of course, had the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_90">Administrative Tribunals Act</a> provided
a statutory appeal to Supreme Court against the orders
of Administrative Tribunals. the decision in L. Chandra
Kumar could not have created the alternative
mechanism aforesaid. Keeping all the above
considerations. we have objectively examined the
request of these retired and serving members of the
Armed Forces to create a forum for adjudication of their
service disputes.
</p>
<p id="p_43">6.2.2 in <a href="/doc/491438/" id="a_91">Bonkya Alias Bharat Shivaji Mane and
others v. State of Maharashtra</a>', the Supreme Court
held regarding exclusion of the jurisdiction of the High
Court under Section 19 of TADA as foltows 2-
</p>
<p id="p_44">"20.... Learned counsel submitted that the appellants
should not be denied the opportunity to get the ﬁrst
hearing in the High Court because in the event of
their faialure in the High Court, they still have a
chance to approach this Court under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_92">article 136</a> of
the Constitution of indie. The argument is fallacious
and runs in the teeth of the express provisions of
Section 19 of TADA. <a href="/doc/1386225/" id="a_93">Section 19</a> (1) and (2) of TADA
read as follows :--
</p>
<p id="p_45">"19. Appeal--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained
in the Code. an appeal shall lie as a matter of right
from anyjudgement, sentence or order, not being an



interlocutory order. of a Designated Court to the
Supreme Court both on facts and on law.
</p>
<p id="p_46">(2) Except as aforesaid, no appeal or revision shall
lie to any Court from any judgement, sentence or
order including an interlocutory order of a Designated
Court."
</p>
<p id="p_47">-21. A bare perusal of the above Section shows that
an appeal against thejudgement, sentence or order.
of the Designated Court (except an interlocutory
order) shall lie on facts and on law to the Supreme
Court and that no appeal or revisio shall life to any
other Court. In the face of this express provision. there
is no scope to urge that the appeal may be transferred
to the High Court because of the acquittal of the
appeltants forthe offence punishable under Section
3 TADA by us. in a case where the Designated Court
finds that no offence under TADA is made out, it is
open to the said Court to transfer the case to the
regular Criminal Court under Section 18 TADA but
once the charge is framed and the case is tried by
the Designated Court, an appeal against conviction,
sentence or acquittal lies only to the Supreme Court
and to no other Court."
</p>
<p id="p_48">6.2.3 in <a href="/doc/7107408/" id="a_94">S.S. Jain Samiti vs. Management</a>
committee, R.J.l. College, Agra', it was observed :-----
</p>
<p id="p_49">"8.... The writ jurisdiction is meant for doing justice
between the parties where it cannot be done in any
otherforum."
</p>
<p id="p_50">6.2.4 An aggrieved party will not have a right of
recourse to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_95">article 226</a> against
the decision of the proposed Tribunal since it is setteled
law that where adequate remedy of appeal is there, one
cannot have recourse to the writ jurisdiction of the High
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_96">article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. Thus
when an aggrieved person is conferred right to appeal
to the Supreme Court directly against the final judgement
or order ofthe proposed Tribunai, then he will not have
a right of recourse to the writ jurisdiction under articie
226 against the decision of the proposed Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_51">6.2.5 In the backdrop of the above legal position, we
proceed to give our conclusions.
</p>
<p id="p_52">6.3 conclusions regarding adjudication of service
disputes :--Hereinbelow, we recommend the
following :--
</p>
<p id="p_53">6.3.1 The Amiy, Navy and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_97">Air Force Act</a>s should be
amended providing for creation of a Tribunal to
adjudicate the disputes and complaints with respect to
conditions of service of persons appointed to Army,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">10</span>

Navy and Air Force. The Amendment should further
provide for a statutory appeal to the Supreme Court
against the final decisions and orders of such a Tribunal.
An appeal against me interlocutory orders should be
expressely barred. it is hoped that the High Courts would
give due regard to the legislative intention behind such
a provision, concerned in the public interest of discipline
in the Armed Forces. In this behalf, the observations of
the Supreme Court in para 108 (x) of the decision in
Mafatlal industries <a href="/doc/1902038/" id="a_98">Ltd. v. Union of India</a>' may be
referred to :--_

",,,So far as the jurisdiction of the High Courts under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_99">article 226</a> of the Constitution--or of this Court under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_100">article 32--</a>is concerned, it remains unaffected by
the provisions of the Act. Even so, the Court would,
while exercising the jurisdiction under the said
articles. have due regard to the legislative intent
manifested by the provisions of the Act... This is for
the reason that the power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_101">article 226</a> has to
be exercised to effectuate the regime of law and not
for abrogating it. Even while acting in exercise of the
said constitutional power, the High Court cannot
ignore the law nor can it override it. The power under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_102">article 226</a> is conceived to serve the ends of law and
not to transgress them."
</p>
<p id="p_54">6.3.2 It would be appropriate to provide further that
every service matter should necessarily be decided by
a Bench of two members, one of whom shall be a
Judicial Member. in case of difference of opinion
between the Members of the Bench. the matter shall be
referred to the Bench of three members, one of whom
shail be a Judicial Member.
</p>
<p id="p_55">in such a situation, it would be easierto convince the
Supreme Court of the desirability of such a direct appeal
mainly on the ground that the necessity of prompt
disposal of service disputes in the Armed Forces and in
the interest of the discipline therein justify such a course.
While indiscipline in any public service is not desirable
and every service dispute should be adjudicated
promptly, their need is much more so in the case of
Armed Forces. in this context, It must be remembered
that the Armed Forces are treated as a separate class
even by the Constitution; <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_103">article 33</a> provides that
Parliament may, by law, determine to what extent any
of the Fundamental Rights (in Part III) shall apply to
Armed Forces. <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_104">Article 311</a> including clause (2) thereof
which contains very important protections to members
of service-is made inapplicable to defence forces; the
artaicle applies only to civil services.
</p>
<p id="p_56">The Service Tribunal so created shall be common to
all three services. There shall be four Benches of the



Tribunal, 17/7 at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta,
with the Delhi Bench being treated as the Principal
Bench. (The machinery provisions ofthe <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_105">Administrative
Tribunals Act</a>. 1985 can be impoited  the extent
necesary, for giving shape to this idea). Such a course
wiil undoubtedly contribute towards a more satisfactory
and prompt adjudication of such disputes But this has
to be an independent service tribunal apart from and in
addition to the Appellate Tribunal recommended in
Chapter V of this Report

6.3.3 In case such a Tribunal is created. the
Parliament may also consider to bring other para-
military services too under the jurisdiction of this
Tnbunal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">11</span>

6.4 Pending the amendment of Anny, Navy and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_106">Air
Force Act</a>s on above lines, the proper thing to do so
expedite disposal oi petitions in High Courts would be
tortrie Centrai Government to make a request to all the
Chief Justicies of various High Courts in the country to
amend the respective High Court rules and to provide
that ail service disputes concerning the Army, Navy and
Air Force shall be entertained and adjudicated only by
a division bench or' the High Court and that such disputes
should be given priority over other matters as far as
possible. In such a case, the High Court would mean
only one stage of litigation whereafter an appeal may
lie to Supreme Court by special leave under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_107">article 136</a>
of the Constitution. This recommendation can be
adopted straight away.
</p>


<p id="p_57">Chapter VII

RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1 To sum up, the Law Commission makes the
following recommendations :--
</p>
<p id="p_58">(a) <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_108">The Army Act</a>, 1950 be amended providing for the
creation of an Armed Forces Appellate Tribunal
which shall entertain appeals against the sentence!
finding/order of the courts martial under the <a href="/doc/165229/" id="a_109">Army
Act</a>. The appeals can be preferred against the final
orders ofthe courts martial. It shall be open to the

person concerned either to file an appeal before'

the tribunal directly against the final order, finding
or sentence of the courts martial or to adopt the
remedy under sub--section (2) of <a href="/doc/1154592/" id="a_110">section 164</a> in the
first instance and then approach the appellate
tribunal. The choice should be left to the aggrieved
person. Indeed, it would be more appropriate to
delete sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1154592/" id="a_111">section 164</a> of the Army
Act and the corresponding provision in the <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_112">Air Force
Act</a>. Similarly, the provisions in the <a href="/doc/957745/" id="a_113">Navy Act</a> relating
to.judicial review by the Judge Advocate General
too may be deleted.

</p>
<p id="p_67">(Paragraph 5.1.3, Chapter V, supra)

7.2 (a) It would contribute to greater discipline and
prompt disposal of service disputes pertaining to the
three Armed Forces if a separate Service Tribunal is
created. The Army, Navy and <a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_116">Air Force Act</a>s should be
amended providing for creation of a Tribunal to
adjudicate the disputes and complaints with respect to
conditions of service of persons appointed to Army,
Navy and Air Force. The Amendment should further
provide for a statutory appeal to the Supreme Court
againstthe ﬁnal decisions and orders of such a Tribunal.
An appeal against the interlocutory orders should be
expressely barred. It is hoped that the High Courts would
give due regard to the legislative intention behind such
a provision, concerned in the public interest of discipline
in the Armed Forces. In this behalf, the observations of
the Supreme Court in para 108 (x) of the decision in
<a href="/doc/78882931/" id="a_117">Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of India</a>' may be
referred to :--
</p>
<p id="p_68"> So far asthe jurisdiction ofthe High Courts under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_118">article 226</a> of the Constitution of this Court under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_119">article 32</a>»is concerned, it remains unaffected by the
provisions ofthe Act. Even so, the Court would, while
exercising the jurisdiction under the said articles, have
due regard to the legislative intent manifested by the
provisions ofthe Act.... This is forthe reason that the
power under artaicle 226 has to be exercised to
effectuate the regime of law and not for abrogating



it. Even while acting in exercise of the said
constitutional power. the High Court cannot ingnore
the law not can it override it. The power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_120">article
226</a> is conceived to serve the ends of law and not to
transgress them."
</p>
<p id="p_69">it would be appropriate to provide further that every
service matter should necessarily be decided by a
Bench of two members. one of whom shall be a Judicial
Member. in case of difference of opinion between the
Members ofthe Bench, the matter shall be referred to
the Bench of three members, one of whom shall be a
Judicial Member.
</p>
<p id="p_70">In such a situation. it would be easierto convince the
Supreme Court of the desirability of such a direct appeal
mainly on the ground that the necessity of prompt
disposal of service disputes in the Armed Forces and in
the interest of the discipline therein justify such a course
While indiscipllne in any public service is not desirable
and every service dispute should be adjudicated
promptly, their need is much more so in the case of
Armed Forces. in this context, it must be remembered
that the Armed Forces are treated as a separate class
even by the Constitution, <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_121">article 33</a> provides that
Parliament may, by law, determine to what extent any
of the Fundamental Rights (in Pan lll) shall apply to
Armed Forces. <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_122">Article 311</a> including clause (2) thereof
which contains very important protections to members
of service-is made inapplicable to defence forces; the
article applies only to civil services.
</p>
<p id="p_71">The Service Tribunal so created shall be common to
all three services. There shall be four Benches of the
Tribunal, :72 at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Calcuta,
with the Delhi Bench being treated as the Principal
Bench. (The machinery provisions of the <a href="/doc/195735/" id="a_123">Administrative
Tribunals Act</a>, 1985 can be imported, to the extent
necessary, forgiving shape to this idea). Such a course
will undoubtedly contribute towards a more satisfactory
and prompt adjudication of such disputes. But this has
to be an independent service tribunal apart from and in
addition to the Appeltate Tribunal recommended in
Chpater V of this Report.
</p>
<p id="p_72">(Paragraph 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, Chapter Vi. supra)
In case such a Tribunal is created, the Parliament
may also consider to bring other para-military services

too underthe jurisdiction of this Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_73">(Paragraph 6.3.3, Chapter VI, supra)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">13</span>

An aggrieved party will not have a right of recourse
to the writ. jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_124">article 226</a> against the
decision of the proposed Tribunal since it is settled law
that where adec,-uate remedy of appeal is there, one
cannot have recourse to the writjurisdiction ofthe High
Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_125">article 226</a> ofthe Constitution of India. Thus
when an aggrieved person is conferred right to appeal
to the Supreme Court directly against the final judgement
or order ofthe proposed Tribunal, then he will not have

_ a right of recourse to the writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_126">article

226</a> against the decision of the proposed Tribunal.
(Paragraph 6.3.4, Chapter VI, supra)

</p><p id="p_74">(b) Pending the amendments ofthe Army. Navy and
<a href="/doc/1786905/" id="a_127">Air Force Act</a>s as proposed in paragraph 7.2 (a), the
Central Government may request the Hon'bIe Chief
Justices of various High Courts to amend their
respective High Court rules to provide that all service
disputes con cerning the said three Armed Forces should
be heard only by a division bench and that such disputes
should be disposed ct as promptly as possible in the
circumstances but not later than six months.
