<p id="p_1">1.   Leave granted.

<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">2.    This batch of appeals and writ petition raises questions as to the

applicability and construction of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_1">Section 396</a> of the Companies Act,

1956, which deals with compulsory amalgamation of companies by a

Central Government order when this becomes essential in the public

interest. The appellant, 63 Moons Technologies Ltd. (hereinafter

referred to as “FTIL”, which name was changed to 63 Moons

Technologies Ltd. on 27.05.2016), is a 99.99% shareholder of the

National Spot Exchange Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “NSEL”), and

is a listed company. About 45% of the shareholding of FTIL is held by

Shri Jignesh Shah and family, and about 43% of the shareholding is

held by members of the Indian public. Approximately 5% of the

shareholding is held by institutional investors. FTIL is a profitable

company, having a positive net worth of over INR 2500 crore, and is in

the business of providing software which is used for trading by brokers

and exchanges across the country. FTIL has about 900 employees,

and a Board of Directors which is different from the Board of Directors

of its wholly owned subsidiary, i.e., NSEL. On the other hand, NSEL


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                                                       2</span>
was incorporated in 2005 by Multi Commodities Exchanges [“MCX”]

and its nominees. NSEL provided an electronic platform for trading of

commodities between willing buyers and sellers through brokers

representing them. On 05.06.2007, the Union of India issued an

exemption notification under <a href="/doc/726507/" id="a_2">Section 27</a> of the Forward Contracts

(Regulation) Act, 1952 [“FCRA”] exempting forward contracts of one-

day duration for sale and purchase of commodities traded on NSEL

from operation of the provisions of the FCRA. NSEL commenced

operations in October 2008. On 27.04.2012, the Department of

Consumer Affairs [“DCA”] issued a show cause notice to NSEL as to

why action should not be initiated against it for permitting transactions

in alleged violation of the exemption granted to it under the FCRA.

NSEL replied to the show cause notice on 29.05.2012 stating that it

had not violated the exemption granted to it. Without adjudicating upon

the show cause notice, on 12.07.2013, the DCA directed NSEL to give

an undertaking that no further contracts shall be launched until further

instructions, and that all existing contracts will be settled on due dates.

This was effectively a “freezing” order. On 22.07.2013, NSEL gave an

undertaking to the DCA.

members of NSEL, visited some of the warehouses which were at

different locations in order to verify stocks therein and reported

existence of full commodity stock in the said warehouses. Sometime in

July 2013, 13,000 persons who traded on the platform of NSEL

claimed to have been duped by other trading members (being 24 in

number), who defaulted in payment of obligations amounting to

approximately INR 5600 crore. Due to the sudden and abrupt

stoppage of fresh contracts, and media reports about the same,

market participation on NSEL’s platform reduced considerably, forcing

NSEL to suspend trading and close its spot exchange operations w.e.f.

31.07.2013. The Forward Markets Commission [“FMC”] recommended

to the DCA on 12.08.2013 that steps be taken to verify quantity and

quality of commodities at various warehouses; financial status of

buyers and trading members be ascertained, and the liability be fixed

on promoters of NSEL, i.e., FTIL. On 14.08.2013, NSEL issued a

press release in which Shri Sinha, its CEO/MD, made a statement that

he and his management team were responsible for all operations at

NSEL. On 27.08.2013, the FMC directed a forensic audit of NSEL by

Grant Thornton LLP, and the Union of India, on 30.09.2013, ordered

inspection of the books of accounts of NSEL and FTIL under <a href="/doc/1421843/" id="a_3">Section

209A</a> of the Companies Act. On the same day, the Economic Offences


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                                                    4</span>
Wing    [“EOW”]    registered   cases    against   Directors   and    key

management personnel of the NSEL and FTIL, trading members of

NSEL, and brokers of NSEL under various provisions<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_4"> of the Indian

Penal Code</a> and the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors

Act, 1999 [“MPID Act”]. Several suits were filed by the traders who

allegedly have been duped, the most important of which is Suit No.173

of 2014 pending in the Bombay High Court, which is a representative

suit filed under Order I Rule 8<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5"> of the Code</a> of Civil Procedure, 1908

[“CPC”]. NSEL also filed third-party notices in the said suit for recovery

of INR 5600 crore against 24 defaulter traders. It has also filed various

arbitration proceedings against them, and is in the process of recovery

of INR 3365 crore out of INR 5600 crore, which are in the form of court

decrees and arbitration awards.

<p id="p_6">
</p><p id="p_7">4.     On 17.12.2013, based on the Grant Thornton report dated

21.09.2013, the FMC passed an order declaring that FTIL was not “fit

and proper” to hold equity in any commodity exchanges, and must

dilute its shareholding to not more than 2% of the paid-up equity

capital of MCX. The said order is under challenge in Writ Petition No.

337 of 2014 before the Bombay High Court.           On 28.02.2014, the

Division Bench of the Bombay High Court refused a prayer for stay of

the aforesaid order, stating that findings of fact of a serious nature

to the tune of INR 5500 crore.

chargesheets against the Managing Director and CEO of NSEL, Shri

Sinha, the Head of Warehousing of NSEL, Shri Babu Kanvi, and two

other defaulters. In the chargesheet, it was revealed that the aforesaid

three employees of NSEL, in exchange for monetary kickbacks, had

colluded with the defaulters to enable them to trade on NSEL’s

platform without depositing adequate goods in the warehouses, in

breach of rules and byelaws of NSEL.

Bombay High Court appointed a three-member committee consisting

of Mr. Justice V.C. Daga, Mr. J. Solomon, and Mr. Yogesh Thar for

ascertaining and crystallising the liability of the defaulters and to assist

in recovery of debts from the defaulters. This committee continues to

function even on date. Thus, in addition to INR 3365 crore, i.e., the

total of decrees and arbitration awards against the defaulters, this

high-level committee has also crystallised a further sum of INR 835.88

Bombay High Court.

<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7.    On 19.09.2014, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India,

issued a notification withdrawing the exemption granted to NSEL vide

notification dated 05.06.2007. Exemptions granted to the National

Commodity and Derivatives Exchange Ltd. (NCDEX) Spot Exchange

and the National Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) were

also withdrawn as the Government was of the view that ready delivery

or spot delivery contracts in commodities ought not to be traded on

commodities exchanges at all. On 15.10.2014, Dr. K.P Krishnan,

Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, wrote a letter to

the Ministry of Corporate Affairs stating that FTIL and NSEL appear to

be maintaining separate identities for a fraudulent purpose, i.e., to

deprive investors of their money. As a result, there is a need to lift the

corporate veil in order to unearth the fraud, as a result of which,

amalgamation of two companies, where one has defrauded market

participants and the other company is cash-rich and capable of

addressing the payment crisis more effectively. It was therefore

proposed to merge FTIL and NSEL under <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_6">Section 396</a> of the

Companies Act. On 21.10.2014, a draft order of amalgamation, made

in accordance with <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_7">Section 396(3)</a> of the Companies Act, was

circulated to the relevant stakeholders. As a result, FTIL filed Writ

Petition No. 2743 of 2014 on 10.11.2014, in which it challenged the

impugned draft order. On 27.11.2014, the Bombay High Court directed

the parties to maintain status quo. On 16.12.2014, the Union of India

filed an affidavit in reply, categorically confirming that the impugned

draft order has been made by the Central Government on the basis of

the FMC’s proposal dated 18.08.2014. On 04.02.2015, the Bombay

High Court vacated the status quo order, and passed an order allowing

FTIL, NSEL, and their shareholders to file their objections to the draft

amalgamation     order.   Meanwhile,    under    <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_8">Section    396(3)</a>,   a

compensation order was made on 01.04.2015, which involved

compensation only to a particular shareholder of NSEL. On

28.08.2015, the Central Government issued a notification to merge the

functions of the FMC with the Securities and Exchange Board of India

[“SEBI”] w.e.f. 28.09.2015. On the same day, the FCRA was also

repealed. Thus, SEBI was now vested with the powers of the FMC

which is to be governed by the Securities and <a href="/doc/1365176/" id="a_9">Exchange Board of India

</p><p id="p_16">9.    On 12.02.2016, a final amalgamation order was passed in terms

of <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_10">Section 396(3)</a>, thereby merging FTIL and NSEL, wherein all assets

and liabilities of NSEL would become assets and liabilities of FTIL. The

writ petition already filed was amended on 28.03.2016 to include a

challenge to this order. On 04.12.2017, the impugned judgment of the

Bombay High Court was passed in which the said writ petition was

dismissed.

</p><p id="p_18">10.   We have heard Shri Mukul Rohatgi, Shri Vikas Singh, Dr. A.M.

Singhvi, and Shri Kavin Gulati, learned Senior Advocates, and Shri

Arvind Lakhawat, learned Advocate, on behalf of the appellants.

According to learned counsel, the first important point to be noted is

that in company law, the holding company, viz. FTIL, is distinct and

separate from its subsidiary, viz., NSEL. It was pointed out to us that

there are separate and independent Boards of Directors for managing

the day-to-day affairs of both companies, which deal in completely

different businesses. It was pointed out that FTIL has never

participated in the profits of NSEL, and except for receiving annual



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                       9</span>
maintenance charges for providing technology-related services by way

of fees, FTIL has not derived any revenue from NSEL. In fact, over a

long period of nine years, FTIL has received only a sum of INR 84

crore from NSEL which, in any case, is deposited by FTIL in the

Bombay High Court pursuant to an order dated 12.06.2015 in Writ

Petition No. 2187 of 2015. Learned counsel were also at pains to point

out that NSEL has not defrauded anybody since it is only a platform.

Currently, the business of NSEL is closed, whereas, on the other hand,

the business of FTIL is flourishing. A compulsory amalgamation order

would be ultra vires <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_11">Section 396</a> if the only object is to foist

unadjudicated liability of NSEL on FTIL. It was also pointed out that the

basis of the amalgamation order was a letter by the FMC, which in turn

was based on a “forensic” audit report of 2013 by Grant Thornton. The

so-called report itself stated that there is no independent verification of

information provided, and consequently, would not constitute an audit,

let alone a forensic audit. It also stated that should additional

information become available, which impacts upon conclusions

reached in the report, Grant Thornton reserved the right to amend their

findings, which are not intended to be interpreted to be either legal

advice or opinion; in short, that the findings themselves were

inconclusive.

<p id="p_19">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                                        10</span>
</p><p id="p_20">11.   Learned counsel have argued that the impugned order is ultra

vires <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_12">Section 396</a> for many reasons. First and foremost, the condition

precedent to passing an amalgamation order is that compensation be

assessed under <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_13">Section 396(3)</a> of the Act. Compensation has to be

assessed qua both the transferor and transferee company. In the

present case, compensation has been assessed only for NSEL or its

shareholders, without any compensation being awarded to FTIL or its

shareholders. Secondly, a member or creditor is required to be placed

in the same position “as nearly as possible”. In the present case, the

amalgamated company would become a company of negative net

worth upon amalgamation, having had a positive net worth of almost

INR 2800 crore pre-amalgamation. This being so, the very basis for

application of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_14">Section 396</a> would disappear as the amalgamated

company, i.e., the transferee company would have to pay the

compensation that is assessed. This obviously cannot be done when

the amalgamated company itself becomes a negative net worth

company. It was then argued that the amalgamation order interfered

with the judicial process in that decrees and arbitral awards obtained

by NSEL against defaulters are wholly ignored. Further, the process of

adjudication, which will determine whether there are defaults and

whether they need to be paid back, has been short-circuited by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                   11</span>
amalgamating NSEL with FTIL. Thus, the learned counsel have all

argued that various conditions precedent for applicability of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_15">Section

396</a> are wholly absent. Also, in the present case, the Central

Government has not applied its mind to whether such an order is, first

of all, “essential”. Secondly, unadjudicated so-called liabilities to

persons who are members of one particular exchange can hardly be

said to be something which requires the Central Government to

amalgamate both companies in the “public interest”. The public

interest consists of the interests of the general public which would

include, inter alia, the interest of the 63,000 shareholders of FTIL, who

are now going to be mulcted with a huge liability which would reduce

the market value of their shares to nil. They have cited several

judgments to buttress these submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
</p><p id="p_22">12.   Thus, the amalgamation order oversteps recognised separation

of powers’ limits, and is therefore, ultra vires both <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_16">Section 396</a> of the

Companies Act and the Constitution of India. It was then argued that

there are three grounds in support of the order of amalgamation, which

are to be found in the impugned judgment, namely:

</p><p id="p_23">      A.   Restoring / safeguarding public confidence in forward

      contracts and exchanges which are an integral and essential part



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                                                      12</span>
      of the Indian economy and financial system, by consolidating the

      businesses of NSEL and FTIL;
</p>
<p id="p_24">      B.    Giving effect to the business realities of the case by

      consolidating the businesses of FTIL and NSEL and preventing

      FTIL from distancing itself from NSEL, which is even otherwise

      its alter ego; and

      C.    Facilitating NSEL in recovering dues from the defaulters by

      pooling human and financial resources of FTIL and NSEL


Admittedly, reasons A and B are not in the draft order. This being so,

obviously, no objections or suggestions could be made qua reasons A

and B, as a result of which the final order would, therefore, be ultra

vires <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_17">Section 396(3)</a> of the Companies Act.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">13.   All the stated objectives at page 1 of the amalgamation order

itself – (a) to leverage combined assets, capital and reserves; (b) to

achieve economy of scale; (c) efficient administration; (d) gainful

settlement of rights and liabilities of stakeholders and creditors; (e) to

consolidate businesses; and (f) to ensure coordination and policy – are

totally vague and do not lead to any application of mind to such

amalgamation order being essential in public interest. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_18">Article 31A</a> of

the Constitution of India was relied upon, and it was argued that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                                                       13</span>
amalgamation under <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_19">Article 31A(1)(c)</a> of two or more corporations can

only be made in public interest or in order to secure proper

management of any of the corporations, which is wholly missing in the

present case. It was also argued that only Shri Pritam Singh had

signed the order which dismissed the objections, even though the

objections were heard by a two-member committee. They also made

submissions that even otherwise, the impugned order was violative of

natural justice and of Articles 14, 19, and 300A of the Constitution of

India. Also, since the amalgamation order is based upon an order of

the FMC, which in turn is based upon the Grant Thornton report, which

was delivered in a great hurry, and with such disclaimers that it could

never be relied upon to render final findings, as has been done by the

amalgamation order, the amalgamation order itself would be without

application of mind, excessive and arbitrary, and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_20">Article 14</a>

of the Constitution of India on this score alone.


</p><p id="p_27">14.   When it came to the impugned judgment, the learned counsel for

the appellants were at pains to point out that when the impugned

judgment held that no compensation need be paid to FTIL as the

number of shares in the amalgamated company of shareholders

remain the same, economic value or market value of the shares was

totally ignored. Thus, in ignoring economic value, a totally artificial,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                                                      14</span>
formal, and non-substantial test has been applied by the Bombay High

Court, which says that there is no necessity to compensate the

shareholders of FTIL, even though once they become members of the

amalgamated company, their shares would be worth nil on the date of

amalgamation. And, in the event of winding up, they would get back

nothing. It was also pointed out that the three grounds of the

amalgamation order, being reasons for the amalgamation order, which

were accepted by the Bombay High Court, are grounds which do not

exist. In ground A, for example, restoring / safeguarding public

confidence in forward contracts and exchanges which are an integral

and essential part of the Indian economy, does not obtain as there

were only three commodity exchanges in the country, all of which were

shut down w.e.f. September 2014. No similar exchanges have been

created subsequently. In any case, the business done at such

exchanges cannot be said to be an integral and essential part of the

Indian economy. Reason B, which is that NSEL is an alter ego of FTIL,

is pending adjudication in the suits filed in the Bombay High Court. To

come to a conclusion that one is the alter ego of the other is not only

contrary to the facts pointed out hereinabove, namely, that the

businesses of the two companies are entirely different and the

management of both companies is by completely different and distinct


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                                    15</span>
Boards of Directors. Thus, to arrive at the conclusion that one

company is the alter ego of the other, without adjudication, would itself

be arbitrary and violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_21">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. The

only reason which would remain, therefore, would be reason C, which

is that the real object of the entire exercise to recover alleged dues

from alleged defaulters pre-adjudication and pending adjudication,

which would be looking at the problem in a wholly one-sided way, and

would be an excessive invasion of the rights of the shareholders and

creditors of FTIL, all of whom have overwhelmingly voted against

amalgamation. In fact, it is pointed out that there is no question of

“public interest” and <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_22">Section 396</a> is actually used in order to penalise

“Ram”, namely, NSEL and FTIL, for the default of “Shyam”, namely, the

24 alleged defaulters, when not even a single default or any civil or

criminal wrong can be attributed either to FTIL or to NSEL. The

impugned order would therefore also fail on the ground of

proportionality, which is a facet of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_23">Article 14.</a> For all these reasons, in

addition, the impugned order ought to be struck down as ultra vires

</p><p id="p_28">15.   Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf

of Respondent No. 4, NSEL Investors Action Group, supported the

impugned judgment in its entirety. According to the learned Senior

Advocate, it must never be forgotten that FTIL held 99.9998% of

NSEL’s shares, and that NSEL was promoted by and is part of the

FTIL group. The Board of Directors of NSEL is entirely under the

control of FTIL. NSEL’s exchange was treated, held out, and

represented by FTIL to be its own, and was part of its “exchange

verticals”. Shri Jignesh Shah is the common linchpin of both the

companies. He holds 45% shares of FTIL and is its Chairman-cum-

Managing Director. He is also Vice Chairman on the Board of NSEL,

being one of the “key managerial personnel” of the aforesaid company.

He also was a member of the Audit Committee of NSEL. All the

minutes of the Board meetings of NSEL were regularly tabled at the

Board meetings of FTIL, showing therefore, that FTIL has full

knowledge of the goings-on in NSEL. NSEL’s outward emails were

routed through an outbox called “FT outbox” through which all emails

of all FTIL-group companies were routed. What is clear, therefore, is

that on a reading of the Grant Thornton report, NSEL has, at least from

2009, promoted what are called “paired contracts” in commodities

which were, in fact, financing transactions, which were totally distinct


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                                                     17</span>
from sale and purchase transactions in commodities. In fact, by April to

July, 2013, 99% of the turnover of NSEL was made up of such paired

contracts. This mechanism was in breach of the conditions of

exemption granted to NSEL dated 05.06.2007, and in breach of the

provisions of the FCRA. Contrary to what was actually going on in

NSEL, NSEL kept inducing persons to come to its platform by

reiterating that they deal only with commodities and spot delivery of

the same. It is only in 2012 that the FMC, being apprised of the real

activities of NSEL, wrote to the DCA, indicating that its business was in

complete breach of the FCRA. What is extremely important is that Shri

Jignesh Shah made representations to the DCA and the FMC on

10.07.2013, in which he stated that NSEL had full stock of

commodities as collateral and had 10-20% of open position as margin

money. He also stated that the stock currently held in NSEL’s 120

warehouses was valued at around INR 6000 crore. It is in July, 2013

that the payment crisis of INR 5600 crore arose on NSEL, FTIL

admitting that this was the result of a fraud. On 14.08.2013, NSEL

wrote to the FMC, setting out a detailed settlement plan. The plan

indicated the period within which the entire dues would be paid, with

simple interest at 8% to 16% per annum. This plan was an abject

failure. As a result, a forensic audit was conducted by Grant Thornton,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                      18</span>
which in its report dated 21.09.2013, came out with damning facts and

figures as to the real operations of NSEL, namely, that they are not a

commodity exchange, but a finance exchange, and that no

commodities were really in stock. As a result, the FMC issued show

cause notices and then passed its order dated 17.12.2013 based on

the aforesaid report, in which it found NSEL guilty of severe

malpractice. Based on this order, the draft order and final order of

amalgamation were then made. Shri Divan was at pains to point out

that as early as on 18.08.2014, the FMC had written a detailed letter to

the Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in which it indicated that as

NSEL was financially incapable of repaying all those investors/traders

who allegedly got duped, it would be expedient in public interest to

amalgamate NSEL with its parent, FTIL, so that its parent’s resources

could be used to repay these debts. He then argued that the reason

for the amalgamation order was not merely the repayment of debts of

the allegedly duped investors/traders, but to instil confidence in

commodity markets, for it is only when their debts are immediately

paid would persons come forward to platforms like NSEL to trade in

commodities. According to the learned Senior Advocate, there was no

breach of natural justice in passing the final amalgamation order as

FTIL and NSEL were both heard pursuant to a Bombay High Court


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                        19</span>
order, even though <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_29">Section 396</a> of the Companies Act does not require

any hearing. He also argued that the order of amalgamation is of the

nature of delegated legislation and is not an administrative order, as a

result of which, the immunity granted by <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_30">Article 31A</a> to “all laws”

dealing with such amalgamation from challenge on the ground of

Articles 14 and 19 would come into full play. This being so, none of the

grounds taken up by the appellants could be gone into as they all

pertained to infractions of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of

India. According to the learned Senior Advocate, the order was passed

after being satisfied on the objective facts set out hereinabove that it

was essential in public interest to pass such order and could not,

therefore, be held to be ultra vires. He also supported the judgment of

the High Court when it stated that the economic value of shares of

FTIL is not the subject matter of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_31">Section 396</a>, and that, therefore, it

was not necessary to provide FTIL’s shareholders any compensation

under <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_32">Section 396(3)</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">16.   Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Advocate also appearing

on behalf of Respondent No.4, supplemented the submissions of Shri

Divan. According to him, nowhere does the Central Government order

direct any payment to be made by the amalgamated company. The

amalgamation is only so that the finances of FTIL can be used to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                     20</span>
pursue on-going litigation as NSEL does not have the wherewithal to

do so. Thus, it is wholly incorrect for the appellants to say that FTIL will

become mulcted with the liabilities of NSEL, as a result of which the

shareholders of FTIL will suffer. He added that the overwhelming

majority of shares in FTIL are owned by Shri Jignesh Shah and his

family (45%) and by Shri Ravi Sheth and Shri Bharat Sheth (8%).

Thus, the majority shares held in FTIL are by two masterminds of the

scam. That apart, after the scam, 24% of the shares have been

purchased by speculators, taking advantage of the low price at which

such shares were offered. Such persons, therefore, are purely

speculative investors who do not need to be compensated under

<a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_33">Section 396</a> of the Act. Also, the economic value of shares, if at all it is

to be taken into account, is an uncertain and fluctuating phenomenon.

As examples, he stated that the book value of a share of FTIL, after

the scam broke out, was only INR 2/-, whereas the listed value actually

went up after the FMC order of 17.12.2013. All this, therefore, is

dependent on market forces, and share price varies according to

market forces and not as a result of any amalgamation that is effected.

He also added that it is incorrect to state that one of the conditions

precedent for applicability of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_34">Section 396</a> was absent. Even if a

compensation order was made awarding nil compensation to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                                         21</span>
shareholders and creditors of FTIL, they could have appealed against

the same. Not having done so, it cannot be said that the Central

Government order was passed without adhering to the provisions of

<a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_35">Section 396(3)</a> and (4) of the Act. When it came to the three grounds

of public interest stated by the High Court, the learned Senior

Advocate argued that grounds (a) and (b) are only inferences to be

drawn from facts which are all stated in the order, and therefore, need

not have been in the draft order. There is thus no infirmity or breach of

principles of natural justice as provided in <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_36">Section 396(3)</a> and (4). He

was at pains to analyse <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_37">Article 31A</a>, and stated that the expression

“public interest” contained in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_38">Article 31A</a> will have to be construed

broadly. Equally, the word “essential” in <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_39">Section 396</a> is essentiality

according to the Central Government, and thus, very wide latitude

needs to be extended to the Government when it exercises its

discretion, stating that it is essential in public interest to amalgamate

two companies. He laid great emphasis on the judgment in <a href="/doc/139001/" id="a_40">Ganesh

Bank of Kurundwad Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, (2006) 10 SCC 645

[“Ganesh Bank”], stressing that amalgamations that are made under

<a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_41">Section 45</a> of the Banking Regulation Act, like amalgamations made

under <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_42">Section 396</a>, can be made so that a weak entity merge with a

strong entity in the interest of the depositors of the weak entity. He also


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                        22</span>
cited various judgments to show that stock exchanges are intimately

linked with the economy of the country, and therefore, if anything goes

wrong with them, there is a direct link with public interest. He

emphasized the fact that in <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_43">Section 396(3)</a>, the shareholders of FTIL

only need to be compensated “as nearly as may be” and that

mathematical precision is not necessary.     He then distinguished the

judgment in <a href="/doc/1831036/" id="a_44">Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner</a>,

(1978) 1 SCC 405 [“Mohinder Singh Gill”], cited by the appellants,

stating that where larger public interest is involved, the ratio of that

judgment will not apply. He cited two judgments in support of this

proposition. He also went on to cite certain judgments which

distinguished <a href="/doc/1502934/" id="a_45">K.I. Shephard v. Union of India</a>, (1987) 4 SCC 431

[“K.I. Shephard”], and therefore, argued that the Central Government

order passed under <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_46">Section 396</a> is really in the nature of delegated

legislation and need not conform to any natural justice outside what is

provided for in the Section itself. He then cited certain judgments on

lifting of the corporate veil, and ended by saying that as was held in

<a href="/doc/960821/" id="a_47">J.K. (Bombay) (P) Ltd. v. New Kaiser-i-Hind Spinning and Weaving

Co. Ltd</a>., [1969] 2 SCR 866 [“J.K. (Bombay) (P) Ltd.”], the Central

Government order would have statutory force, and therefore, cannot

be said to be a mere administrative order.

of SEBI, fully supported the impugned judgment and took us through

various portions of it. He was at pains to point out that the Grant

Thornton report was a report of a forensic auditor chosen by NSEL

itself, though required to do so by the FMC. He took us through the

FMC order dated 17.12.2013 meticulously, and said that none of the

findings therein could be assailed by either FTIL or NSEL. He then

referred to the Central Government order and supported the High

Court judgment’s upholding of it. He then relied upon the Director’s

Report of NSEL dated 20.07.2015, and balance sheet as on

31.03.2015 to show that no potential liability of INR 5600 crore is at all

referred to in the Director’s Report or in the balance sheet. He was at

pains to point out, therefore, that NSEL itself was an exchange which

made it clear that it would not be responsible for any liabilities incurred

by its members except to the extent of the SG fund created out of the

members’ contribution. He then argued that given the magnitude of the

scam that broke out in July 2013, the Government had to act. It could

have chosen one of many ways in which to act, but since it had bona

fide chosen the amalgamation route provided by <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_48">Section 396</a> of the

Companies Act, it is obvious that in dealing with a scam of this

magnitude, the Government has acted in public interest.

</p><p id="p_33">18.   Ms. Pinky Anand, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing

on behalf of the Union of India, meticulously took us through a long list

of dates and events which showed that NSEL had flouted the

conditions of its exemption order and had never really carried out

ready delivery or spot delivery contracts in goods. Indeed, according to

her, NSEL never had a single registered warehouse in its name as the

Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority had rejected

NSEL’s application for registration of its warehouses as far back as on

16.05.2011. Therefore, NSEL stating that it had 120 warehouses

owned by itself was a misrepresentation made to the public from the

very beginning. It is also clear, that when the scam broke out, Grant

Thornton, as forensic auditor, went into the affairs of NSEL and came

out with a number of key findings, which she referred to and took us

through portions of the Grant Thornton report. The FMC order dated

17.12.2013 was also referred to and relied upon by her. She also

referred to the fact that the exemption order dated 05.06.2007 granted

to NSEL was withdrawn on 19.09.2014 as commodities markets which

were supposed to be markets where spot delivery of goods took place,

had never in fact taken place and therefore, exemption granted to all

spot exchanges dealing in commodities, including two other spot

exchanges that existed, were withdrawn. However, the Bombay Stock

Exchange Ltd. (BSE), the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.

(NSE), and MCX continued with commodity trading, but not on a spot

basis. She also referred us to a subsequent event, that is an event

subsequent even to the impugned judgment, namely, to a serious

fraud investigation report dated 31.08.2018 which, according to her,

corroborated all the findings made by Grant Thornton, the FMC, and

the Central Government by its final order. She then argued that

<a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_49">Section 396</a> of the Companies Act is a special, self-contained,

standalone code by itself and must be read as such, and that all

procedural aspects of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_50">Section 396</a> have been complied with on the

facts of the present case. The satisfaction of the Central Government

that it is essential in public interest to act under <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_51">Section 396</a> is purely

subjective satisfaction. She referred to and relied upon <a href="/doc/1873699/" id="a_52">Bacha F.

Guzdar v. Commissioner of Income Tax</a>, [1955] 1 SCR 876 [“Bacha

F. Guzdar”], to support the reasoning of the High Court on the

compensation order. She also referred to and relied upon the share

market prices to show that market fluctuations took place on their own,

and that share prices plummeted only as a result of the scam which

came to light in July, 2013. She also stated that since neither FTIL nor

its shareholders    and    creditors   filed   any appeal   against   the

compensation order, they waived their right to do so. She then


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                                                       26</span>
supported the final amalgamation order and stated that it was manifest

that it was made in “public interest”. For this, she relied upon a number

of judgments to support her contention that “public interest” has to be

given a broad connotation. She also countered the submission of Shri

Rohatgi that of the two persons who heard the objections, only one

person signed, and therefore, their report would be non-est. She

stated that this technical objection cannot stand in the way of the final

government order which took into account all objections and

suggestions made, and answered all of them. She also referred to the

role of stock markets in the national economy and stated that to prop

up stock and commodities exchanges is certainly in public interest.

The three distinct grounds on public interest, found by the High Court,

are more than sufficient to sustain the impugned Central Government

order. Finally, in her last written argument, she relied upon two

judgments of this Court, namely, <a href="/doc/107483/" id="a_53">Union of India v. G. Ganayutham</a>,

(1997) 7 SCC 463 and <a href="/doc/1285195/" id="a_54">Om Kumar v. Union of India</a>, (2001) 2 SCC

reflects the Government’s reaction to a large scam which broke in the

year 2013, and which effected the commodities market generally. He

dwelt at some length on subjective satisfaction and judicial review, and

referred to <a href="/doc/1748256/" id="a_55">Barium Chemicals Ltd. v. Company Law Board</a>, [1966]

Supp SCR 311 [“Barium Chemicals”], <a href="/doc/443837/" id="a_56">Rohtas Industries Ltd. v. S.D.

Agarwal</a>, [1969] 3 SCR 108 [“Rohtas Industries”], and other

judgments to emphasise that it was not for the Court to sit in judgment

over the sufficiency of the reasons for which the Central Government

passed its order in public interest. He also stated that the right to

choose between different courses of action is a right inherent in a

responsive government, and it is only when such choice is so unfair or

unreasonable that no reasonable person would have taken such

action, that the Court can intervene. For this purpose, he cited

<a href="/doc/747596/" id="a_57">Haryana Financial Corporation v. Jagdamba Oil Mills</a>, (2002) 3

SCC 496. According to him, essentiality is not reviewable except by

the Wednesbury test, and the Court should ask itself the question as to

whether no reasonable person could have concluded that the

impugned order was essential in the public interest. He reiterated that

the order dated 12.02.2016 is not ultra vires <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_58">Section 396</a> as several

has been arrived at on the basis of undisputed facts, and that

therefore, the said order should be upheld. He also argued that such

order, if passed, is in the nature of delegated legislation, and therefore,

does not have to satisfy any rules of natural justice outside what is

prescribed by <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_59">Section 396</a> itself which, according to him, has been

procedurally and substantively complied with, as reflected in the order

appearing on behalf of some of the alleged duped investors/traders,

referred to the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (in

Financial Establishments) Act, 1999, and stated that the persons who

had invested monies in the commodities exchange of NSEL have been

held to be “depositors” by a judgment dated 01.10.2015 of the High

Court of Bombay, from which an SLP has been dismissed by this

Court. He also brought to our notice another judgment dated

01.11.2018, also of the Bombay High Court, in which NSEL and FTIL

had breached an injunction order, and had to apologise and pay back

monies in order to avoid being held guilty of contempt of court. He also

stressed that “economic value” of shares is a stranger to <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_60">Section

challenged on the ground of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_76">Article 14</a> or <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_77">Article 19</a>, given <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_78">Article 31A</a>

of the Constitution of India. However, this does not mean that <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_79">Section

or unreasonable results. <a href="/doc/1049434/" id="a_80">In Prem Nath Raina v. State of Jammu &amp;

      is to advance public welfare. In other words as observed
      by Crawford in his book on Statutory Constructions that
      the entire legislative process is influenced by
      considerations of justice and reason. Justice and reason
      constitute the great general legislative intent in every
      piece of legislation. Consequently where the suggested
      construction operates harshly, ridiculously or in any other
      manner contrary to prevailing conceptions of justice and
      reason, in most instances, it would seem that the

      the one intended by the law-makers. In the absence of
      some other indication that the harsh or ridiculous effect
      was actually intended by the legislature, there is little

This Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       “46. <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_96">Article 31A</a> of the Constitution saves laws which

       impossible to accept that the protective umbrella of the

       Orders and Notifications issued under those Acts and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                                                     35</span>
      Regulations. <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_100">Article 31B</a> constitutes a grave
      encroachment on fundamental rights and doubtless as it
      may seem that it is inspired by a radiant social
      philosophy, it must be construed as strictly as one may,
      for the simple reason that the guarantee of fundamental
      rights cannot be permitted to be diluted by implications
      and inferences. An express provision of the Constitution
      which prescribes the extent to which a challenge to the
      constitutionality of a law is excluded, must be construed
      as demarcating the farthest limit of exclusion.
      Considering the nature of the subject-matter which
      <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_101">Article 31B</a> deals with, there is, in our opinion, no
      justification for contending by judicial interpretation the
      provisions of the field which is declared by that article to
      be immune from challenge on the ground of violation or
      abridgement of fundamental rights. The article affords
      protection to Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth
      Schedule. Therefore, whenever a challenge to the
      constitutionality of a provision of law on the ground that it
      violates any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part
      III is sought to be repelled by the State on the plea that
      the law is placed in the Ninth Schedule, the narrow
      question to which one must address oneself is whether
      the impugned law is specified in that Schedule. If it is,
      the provisions of <a href="/doc/282612/" id="a_102">Article 31B</a> would be attracted and the
      challenge would fail without any further inquiry. On the
      other hand, if the law is not specified in the Ninth
      Schedule, the validity of the challenge has to be
      examined in order to determine whether the provisions
      thereof invade in any manner any of the fundamental
      rights conferred by Part III. It is thus no answer to say
      that though the particular law, as for example a Control
      Order, is not specified in the Ninth Schedule, the parent
      Act under which the Order is issued is specified in that
      Schedule.”

</p><p id="p_61">26.   In the present case, this judgment has no direct application

except to say that <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_103">Article 31A</a> also constitutes a grave encroachment

on fundamental rights, and must be construed strictly. The expression

used in <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_104">Article 31A</a> is “law”, for which, one is to see the definition

contained in <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_105">Article 13(3).</a> “Law” in <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_106">Article 13(3)</a> certainly includes

“order”. The only question is whether this would include an

administrative order as well.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">27.   It is clear, on a reading of <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_107">Article 13(3</a>), that the expression “law”,

as defined in <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_108">Article 13(3)(a</a>), includes an Ordinance, rule, regulation,

notification, and custom or usage having in the territory of India the

force of law. Obviously, therefore, when the expression “order” is used,

it would take colour from Ordinance, rule, regulation, notification, which

are all legislative in nature, and not administrative. Even custom or

usage having the force of law refers to general rules of conduct, as

opposed to administrative orders passed on the facts of a given case.

Construing <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_109">Article 31A</a> in the light of <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_110">Article 13(3)(a</a>), it is clear that the

“order” referred to, can therefore, only be a legislative order.

Examples of legislative orders are of the kind dealt with in Prag Ice &amp;

Oil Mills (supra) and <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_111">Union of India and Anr. v. Cynamide India Ltd.

and Anr</a>., (1987) 2 SCC 720 [“Cynamide India”], namely, orders

passed under statutes which are in the nature of subordinate

legislation, which deal generally with a whole class of persons who are

governed by the same in which general rules of conduct are laid down.

WHETHER    THE   CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ORDER          IS ADMINISTRATIVE IN
NATURE



</p><p id="p_64">28.   This brings us to what is the nature of the order of the Central

Government that is passed under <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_112">Section 396</a>. It has been argued on

behalf of the Union of India, relying upon a number of judgments, that

the nature of the order passed under <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_113">Section 396</a> is that of delegated

legislation. This being the case, it would, therefore, get immunity from

challenge on the ground of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of

India, as it would then amount to a “law” within the meaning of <a href="/doc/660119/" id="a_114">Article

31A</a> read with <a href="/doc/654960/" id="a_115">Article 13(3)(b).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_65">
</p><p id="p_66">29.   The difference between an order which is legislative in nature

and that which is administrative in nature has been discussed in some

of our judgments. Thus, in Cynamide India (supra), this Court drew a

distinction between administrative and legislative orders thus:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       “7. …… Any attempt to draw a distinct line between
       legislative and administrative functions, it has been said,
       is ‘difficult in theory and impossible in practice’. Though
       difficult, it is necessary that the line must sometimes be
       drawn as different legal rights and consequences may
       ensue. The distinction between the two has usually been
       expressed as ‘one between the general and the
       particular’. ‘A legislative act is the creation and
       promulgation of a general rule of conduct without
       reference to particular cases; an administrative act is the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                                     38</span>
       making and issue of a specific direction or the
       application of a general rule to a particular case in
       accordance with the requirements of policy’. ‘Legislation
       is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct
       without reference to particular cases and usually
       operating in future; administration is the process of
       performing particular acts, of issuing particular orders or
       of making decisions which apply general rules to
       particular cases.’ It has also been said: ‘Rule-making is
       normally directed toward the formulation of requirements
       having a general application to all members of a broadly
       identifiable class’ while, ‘an adjudication, on the other
       hand, applies to specific individuals or situations’. But,
       this is only a broad distinction, not necessarily always
       true. Administration and administrative adjudication may
       also be of general application and there may be
       legislation of particular application only. That is not ruled
       out. Again, adjudication determines past and present
       facts and declares rights and liabilities while legislation
       indicates the future course of action. Adjudication is
       determinative of the past and the present while
       legislation is indicative of the future.……”

In K.I. Shephard (supra), this Court dealt with a scheme for

amalgamation of three private banks with Punjab National Bank,

Canara Bank, and State Bank of India, in terms of separate schemes

drawn, merging each private bank with state banks under <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_116">Section 45</a>

of the Banking Regulation Act. It was urged that the order passed by

the Reserve Bank of India amalgamating these banks was legislative

in nature, as a result of which the principle of natural justice will not

apply. In turning down this contention, this Court held:

justice under the protective umbrella whereof the need to
put the excluded employees to notice or enquiry arose. It
is well settled that natural justice will not be employed in
the exercise of legislative power and Mr Salve has rightly
relied upon a recent decision of this Court being <a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_118">Union
of India v. Cynamide India Ltd</a>. [(1987) 2 SCC 720] in
support of such a position. But is the scheme-making
process legislative? Power has been conferred on the
RBI in certain situations to take steps for applying to the
Central Government for an order of moratorium and
during the period of moratorium to propose either
reconstruction or amalgamation of the banking company.
</blockquote><p id="p_67">A scheme for the purposes contemplated has to be
framed by RBI and placed before the Central
Government for sanction. Power has been vested in the
Central Government in terms of what is ordinarily known
as a Henry VIII clause for making orders for removal of
difficulties. <a href="/doc/1300771/" id="a_119">Section 45(11)</a> requires that copies of the
schemes as also such orders made by the Central
Government are to be placed before both Houses of
Parliament. We do not think this requirement makes the
exercise in regard to schemes a legislative process. It is
not necessary to go to any other authority as the very
decision relied upon by Mr Salve in the case of
Cynamide India Ltd. [(1987) 2 SCC 720] lays down the
test. In para 7 of the judgment it has been indicated:
(SCC pp. 735-36)
          “Any attempt to draw a distinct line between
      legislative and administrative functions, it has
      been said, is ‘difficult in theory and impossible
      in practice’. Though difficult, it is necessary that
      the line must sometimes be drawn as different
      legal rights and consequences may ensue. The
      distinction between the two has usually been
      expressed as ‘one between the general and the
      particular’. ‘A legislative act is the creation and
      promulgation of a general rule of conduct
      without reference to particular cases; an
      administrative act is the making and issue of a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                               40</span>
            specific direction or the application of a general
            rule to a particular case in accordance with the
            requirements of policy’. ‘Legislation is the
            process of formulating a general rule of conduct
            without reference to particular cases and
            usually operating in future; administration is the
            process of performing particular acts, of issuing
            particular orders or of making decisions which
            apply general rules to particular cases.’ It has
            also been said: ‘Rule-making is normally
            directed     towards      the    formulation     of
            requirements having a general application to all
            members of a broadly identifiable class’ while,
            ‘an adjudication, on the other hand, applies to
            specific individuals or situations’. But, this is
            only a broad distinction, not necessarily always
            true.”
       Applying these tests it is difficult to accept Mr Salve’s
       contention that the framing of the scheme under <a href="/doc/1300771/" id="a_120">Section
       45</a> involves a legislative process. There are similar
       statutory provisions which require placing of material
       before the two Houses of Parliament yet not involving
       any legislative activity. The fact that orders made by the
       Central Government for removing difficulties as
       contemplated under sub-clause (10) are also to be
       placed before the two Houses of Parliament makes it
       abundantly clear that the placing of the scheme before
       the two Houses is not a relevant test for making the
       scheme-framing process legislative. We accordingly hold
       that there is no force in the contention of Mr Salve that
       the process being legislative, rules of natural justice
       were not applicable.”

The fact that, under <a href="/doc/23818/" id="a_121">Section 396(5)</a>, the Central Government order has

to be laid before the Houses of Parliament also does not detract from

the fact that this order is administrative and not legislative in character.

Applying these judgments to the Central Government’s order passed



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                                         41</span>
under <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_122">Section 396</a>, it is clear that the order directly impacts the rights

and liabilities of the companies, their shareholders and creditors,

sought to be amalgamated under the order. Such order is not an order

in general which applies to all such companies, but only to the

particular companies sought to be amalgamated. There is no general

rule of conduct, without reference to the particular case that is laid

down by such an order. The Central Government order, ultimately,

makes a specific direction qua two specific companies which are to be

amalgamated. It is clear that such an order is not in the nature of

legislation or delegated legislation.

judgment of K.I. Shephard (supra) thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      “32. The only other question which remains for
      consideration is whether the conclusion of the High
      Court that the scheme-making process under <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_129">Section 9</a>
      of the Acquisition Act is not legislative is correct in law. In
      view of our conclusions on the four questions
      formulated, this question is not of much relevance but
      since the High Court has recorded a conclusion and the
      learned Additional Solicitor General and Shri Salve
      advanced the argument we think it appropriate to answer
      this question also. The High Court relied upon the
      decision in Shephard case [(1987) 4 SCC 431 : 1987
      SCC (L&amp;S) 438 : (1988) 1 SCR 188] and came to hold

      been held by this Court to be not legislative, the scheme
      framed under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_134">Acquisition Act</a> as in the present case,
      must also be held to be not a legislative one. It is
      undisputed that in Shephard case [(1987) 4 SCC 431 :</blockquote><p id="p_70">
</p><p id="p_71">      1987 SCC (L&amp;S) 438 : (1988) 1 SCR 188] the

      bank and the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_135">Banking Regulation Act</a>,
      1949 applied. This Court in Shephard case [(1987) 4
      SCC 431 : 1987 SCC (L&amp;S) 438 : (1988) 1 SCR 188] on
      examining <a href="/doc/601446/" id="a_136">Section 45(11)</a> of the Banking Regulation Act,
      1949 came to hold that merely because a scheme
      framed is required to be laid before both the Houses of
      Parliament after the same has been sanctioned by the
      Central Government the scheme cannot be held to be
      legislative in nature. But in our considered opinion the
      High Court has failed to notice the fundamental
      distinction between the provisions of <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_137">Section 45</a> of the
      Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and <a href="/doc/1990166/" id="a_138">Section 9</a> of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                                                        43</span>
       framed, every scheme framed by the Central
       Government has to be laid before each House of
       Parliament for a total period of 30 days and Parliament
       has the power to agree to the scheme and making any
       modification or in giving to a decision that the scheme
       should not be made and it is only thereafter the scheme
       has the effect either in the modified form or does not
       agree (sic). The essential distinction between the two
       provisions therefore, is that whereas under the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_140">Banking
       Regulation Act</a>, 1949 the scheme framed has merely to
       be placed before Parliament and nothing further but
       under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_141">Acquisition Act</a> the scheme becomes effective
       only after the same is placed before both the Houses of
       Parliament and after Parliament makes such
       modification and agrees to the scheme. In this view of
       the matter the decision of this Court in Shephard case
       [(1987) 4 SCC 431 : 1987 SCC (L&amp;S) 438 : (1988) 1
       SCR 188] has no application to a scheme framed under
       the provisions of the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_142">Acquisition Act</a> and in our
       considered opinion, a scheme framed under <a href="/doc/242356/" id="a_143">Section 9</a> of
       the Banking Companies Acquisition and <a href="/doc/1232997/" id="a_144">Transfer of
       Undertakings Act</a>, 1980, is a legislative one. The High
       Court was in error in holding the scheme not to be a
       legislative one.”

Since <a href="/doc/23818/" id="a_145">Section 396(5)</a> of the Companies Act is a provision akin to the

provision considered in the case of K.I. Shephard (supra), the ratio of

K.I. Shephard (supra) squarely applies. The judgment in New Bank of

India Employees’ Union (supra), therefore, is of no assistance, given

the statutory provision in the present case.

Constitution of India. This Court has held in a catena of decisions that

it is the substance of what is effected that counts when it comes to

infraction of a fundamental right, and not the form. Thus, in <a href="/doc/1790076/" id="a_152">Thomas

       as void. The law therefore must be carefully scrutinized
       to ascertain whether a fundamental right is infringed. It is
       not the form but the substance that matters. If the
       legislature in effect constitutes a judicial tribunal, but
       calls it an authority, the tribunal does not become any
       the less a judicial tribunal. Therefore, the correct
       approach is first to ascertain with exactitude the content
       and scope of the fundamental right and then to scrutinize
       the provisions of the Act to decide whether in effect and

      service to deal with these new problems came to be

      instrumentality or administrative device for handling
      these new problems. It was in these circumstances and
      with a view to supplying this administrative need that the
      corporation came into being as the third arm of the

      made in the writ petition and these issues could not be
      said to arise on the writ petition. Mr Divan conceded that
      the escape of oleum gas took place subsequent to the
      filing of the writ petition but his argument was that the
      petitioner could have applied for amendment of the writ
      petition so as to include a claim for compensation for the
      victims of oleum gas but no such application for
      amendment was made and hence on the writ petition as
      it stood, these constitutional issues did not arise for
      consideration. We do not think this preliminary objection
      raised by Mr Divan is sustainable. It is undoubtedly true
      that the petitioner could have applied for amendment of
      the writ petition so as to include a claim for
      compensation but merely because he did not do so, the

       applications for compensation made by the Delhi Legal
       Aid and Advice Board and the Delhi Bar Association
       cannot be thrown out. These applications for
       compensation are for enforcement of the fundamental
       right to life enshrined in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_168">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and
       while dealing with such applications, we cannot adopt a
       hyper-technical approach which would defeat the ends
       of justice. This Court has on numerous occasions
       pointed out that where there is a violation of a
       fundamental or other legal right of a person or class of
       persons who by reason of poverty or disability or socially
       or economically disadvantaged position cannot approach
       a court of law for justice, it would be open to any public
       spirited individual or social action group to bring an
       action for vindication of the fundamental or other legal
       right of such individual or class of individuals and this
       can be done not only by filing a regular writ petition but
       also by addressing a letter to the court. If this Court is
       prepared to accept a letter complaining of violation of the
       fundamental right of an individual or a class of
       individuals who cannot approach the court for justice,
       there is no reason why these applications for
       compensation which have been made for enforcement of
       the fundamental right of the persons affected by the
       oleum gas leak under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_169">Article 21</a> should not be
       entertained. The court while dealing with an application
       for enforcement of a fundamental right must look at the
       substance and not the form. We cannot therefore sustain
       the preliminary objection raised by Mr Divan.”

satisfied before the Section can be said to operate. First and foremost,

the Central Government has to be “satisfied”, meaning thereby, that it

must, on certain objective facts, come to a conclusion that

amalgamation between two or more companies is necessary. This can

only be done if the Central Government finds it “essential”, i.e.,

Section originally contained the expression “national interest”. <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_170">By

Amendment Act</a> 65 of 1960, “national interest” was substituted by

“public interest”).

<p id="p_81">35.   The Notes on Clauses relating to the original <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_171">Section 396</a> reads

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">       “Clause 366—This is a new provision and it is intended
       to provide, at the instance of the Government, for the
       amalgamation of two or more companies in the national
       interest. Occasionally, cases arise where such an
       amalgamation in the national interest is clearly a
       necessity. The observance of the usual procedure
       prescribed by the existing Act in such cases will lead to
       prolonged delays which will be detrimental to the
       national interest. It has been made clear that any order
       made by the Government should provide for the old
       shareholders, and the old debenture holders and other
       creditors, having the same interest in the company
       resulting from the amalgamation as they had in the
       original companies. Any order made by the Government
       under this clause will be laid on the table of both Houses
       of Parliament and will therefore be subject to the
       Parliamentary scrutiny.”

What is important from the Notes on Clauses is the fact that it is only

“occasionally” that cases arise where an amalgamation in national

interest is “clearly a necessity”. It is made clear that the reason for

<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_172">Section 396</a> is that the observance of the usual procedure prescribed

by the existing Act (namely, that contained in <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_173">Sections 391</a> to <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_174">394</a>) in

such cases will lead to prolonged delays, which will be detrimental to

national interest. The fact that the procedure contained in <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_175">Sections 394</a>

precedent to the passing of an order by the Central Government under

this Section is that every member or creditor of each of the companies

before amalgamation shall have, as nearly as may be, the same

interest in or rights against the company resulting from the

amalgamation as he had in the erstwhile company either as a member

or a creditor, and if this is not so, such member or creditor shall be

entitled to compensation which is to be assessed by such authority as

may be prescribed. From the order of such assessment, an appeal is

provided by sub-section (3A). What is important is the mandatory

language contained in sub-section (4), which states that no order shall

be made under the Section unless the time for preferring an appeal

under sub-section (3A) has expired, or where any such appeal has

been preferred, the appeal has been finally disposed of. This makes it

clear that unless an order of compensation is first made under sub-

been disposed of, no order of amalgamation can be made. Another

condition precedent is an inbuilt provision for natural justice, namely,

that a proposed draft order has first been sent to each of the

companies concerned. The companies may then send suggestions or

objections to the Central Government, which the Central Government

must first consider before passing the final order. Such objections and

suggestions can also be sent from any class of shareholders of either

of the companies, or from any creditors or class of creditors of either of

the companies.

company or towards any of its members.</blockquote><p id="p_85">
    From the facts placed before us, it is clear that the
Government had not bestowed sufficient attention to the
material before it before passing the impugned order. It
seems to have been oppressed by the opinion that it had
formed about Shri S.P. Jain. From the arguments
advanced by Mr Attorney, it is clear that but for the
association of Mr S.P. Jain with the appellant-company,
the investigation in question, in all probabilities would not
have been ordered. Hence, it is clear that in making the
impugned order irrelevant considerations have played an
important part.

conferred on the Central Government on the faith that it
will be exercised in a reasonable manner. The
department of the Central Government which deals with
companies is presumed to be an expert body in
company law matters. Therefore, the standard that is
prescribed under <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_184">Section 237(b)</a> is not the standard
required of an ordinary citizen but that of an expert. The
learned Attorney did not dispute the position that if we
come to the conclusion that no reasonable authority
would have passed the impugned order on the material
before it, then the same is liable to be struck down. This
position is also clear from the decision of this Court in

    The decision of this Court in Barium Chemicals case
which considered the scope of <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_186">Section 237(b)</a> illustrates
that difficulty. In that case Hidayatullah, J. (our present
Chief Justice) and Shelat, J. came to the conclusion that
though the power under <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_187">Section 237(b)</a> is a discretionary
power the first requirement for its exercise is the honest
formation of an opinion that the investigation is
necessary and the further requirement is that “there are
circumstances suggesting” the inference set out in the
section; an action not based on circumstances
suggesting an inference of the enumerated kind will not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                                                 54</span>
be valid; the formation of the opinion is subjective but the
existence of the circumstances relevant to the inference
as the sine qua non for action must be demonstratable; if
their existence is questioned, it has to be proved at least
prime facie; it is not sufficient to assert that those
circumstances exist and give no clue to what they are,
because the circumstances must be such as to lead to
conclusions of certain definiteness; the conclusions must
relate to an intent to defraud, a fraudulent or unlawful
purpose, fraud or misconduct. In other words they held
that although the formation of opinion by the Central
Government is a purely subjective process and such an
opinion cannot be challenged in a court on the ground of
propriety, reasonableness or sufficiency, the authority
concerned is nevertheless required to arrive at such an
opinion from circumstances suggesting the conclusion
set out in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_188">Section 237(b)</a>
and the expression “circumstances suggesting” cannot
support the construction that even the existence of
circumstances is a matter of subjective opinion. Shelat,
J. further observed that it is hard to contemplate that the
Legislature could have left to the subjective process both
the formation of opinion and also the existence of
circumstances on which it is to be founded; it is also not
reasonable to say that the clause permitted the Authority
to say that it has formed the opinion on circumstances
which in its opinion exist and which in its opinion suggest
an intent to defraud or a fraudulent or unlawful purpose.
    On the other hand Sarkar, C.J. and Mudholkar, J. held
that the power conferred on the Central Government
under <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_189">Section 237(b)</a> is a discretionary power and no
facet of that power is open to judicial review. Our Brother
Bachawat, J., the other learned Judge in that Bench did
not express any opinion on this aspect of the case.
Under these circumstances it has become necessary for
us to sort out the requirements of <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_190">Section 237(b)</a> and to
see which of the two contradictory conclusions reached
in Barium Chemicals case is in our judgment, according
to law. But before proceeding to analyse <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_191">Section 237(b)</a>
we should like to refer to certain decisions cited at the
bar bearing on the question under consideration.

   “Coming back to <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_192">Section 237(b)</a>, in finding out its true
scope we have to bear in mind that that section is a part
of the scheme referred to earlier and therefore the said
provision takes its colour from <a href="/doc/1613691/" id="a_193">Sections 235</a> and <a href="/doc/964266/" id="a_194">236</a>. In
finding out the legislative intent we cannot ignore the
requirements of those sections. In interpreting <a href="/doc/516930/" id="a_195">Section
237(b)</a> we cannot ignore the adverse effect of the
investigation on the company. Finally we must also
remember that the section in question is an inroad on
the powers of the company to carry on its trade or
business and thereby an infraction of the fundamental
right guaranteed to its shareholders under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_196">Article 19(1)</a>
</p><p id="p_88">(g) and its validity cannot be upheld unless it is
considered that the power in question is a reasonable
restriction in the interest of the general public. In fact the
vires of that provision was upheld by majority of the
Judges constituting the Bench in Barium Chemicals case
principally on the ground that the power conferred on the
Central Government is not an arbitrary power and the
same has to be exercised in accordance with the
restraints imposed by law. For the reasons stated earlier
we agree with the conclusion reached by Hidayatullah, J.
and Shelat, JJ. in Barium Chemicals case that the
existence of circumstances suggesting that the
company’s business was being conducted as laid down
in sub-clause(1) or the persons mentioned in sub-clause
(2) were guilty of fraud or misfeasance or other
misconduct towards the company or towards any of its
members is a condition precedent for the Government to
form the required opinion and if the existence of those
conditions is challenged, the courts are entitled to
examine whether those circumstances were existing
when the order was made. In other words, the existence
of the circumstances in question are open to judicial
review though the opinion formed by the Government is
not amenable to review by the courts. As held earlier the
required circumstances did not exist in this case.”

licence shall not, in any way, hinder or restrict the supply of energy by

the State Government or the State Electricity Board within the same

area where the State Government deems such supply “necessary in

public interest”. In that case, the High Court had observed that the

State Government was the sole judge of whether the direct supply of

energy was or was not in public interest, the nature of the power being

subjective. This Court, in upsetting the High Court’s view, held:

       Government deeming it necessary in public interest to
       make such supply. If challenged, the Government must
       show that exercise of the power was necessary in public

       the statute are fulfilled. Normally a licensee of electrical
       energy, though he has no monopoly, is the person
       through whom electrical energy would be distributed

       confers power upon the Government subject to the
       restrictions imposed by clauses (a), (b) and (c), to refuse
       to accord approval. Sub-section (2) imposes upon the

          The Courts, however, are not concerned with the

      of the power conferred on the Executive, the Court can
      always examine whether the requisite satisfaction is
      arrived at by the authority : if it is not, the condition
      precedent to the exercise of the power would not be
      fulfilled and the exercise of the power would be bad.
      There are several grounds evolved by judicial decisions
      for saying that no subjective satisfaction is arrived at by
      the authority as required under the statute. The simplest
      case is whether the authority has not applied its mind at
      all; in such a case the authority could not possibly be
      satisfied as regards the fact in respect of which it is
      required to be satisfied. Emperor v. Shibnath Bannerji
      [AIR 1943 FC 75 : 1944 FCR 1 : 45 Cri LJ 341] is a case
      in point. Then there may be a case where the power is
      exercised dishonestly or for an improper purpose : such
      a case would also negative the existence of satisfaction
      on the part of the authority. The existence of “improper
      purpose”, that is, a purpose not contemplated by the
      statute, has been recognised as an independent ground
      of control in several decided cases. The satisfaction,
      moreover, must be a satisfaction of the authority itself,
      and therefore, if, in exercising the power, the authority
      has acted under the dictation of another body as the
      Commissioner of Police did in Commissioner of Police v.</blockquote>

      exercise of the power would be bad and so also would
      the exercise of the power be vitiated where the authority
      has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts of
      each individual case by self-created rules of policy or in
      any other manner. The satisfaction said to have been
      arrived at by the authority would also be bad where it is
      based on the application of a wrong test or the
      misconstruction of a statute. Where this happens, the
      satisfaction of the authority would not be in respect of
      the thing in regard to which it is required to be satisfied.
      Then again, the satisfaction must be grounded “on
      materials which are of rationally probative value”.

</p><p id="p_94">      1949 FCR 827]. The grounds on which the satisfaction is
      based must be such as a rational human being can
      consider connected with the fact in respect of which the
      satisfaction is to be reached. They must be relevant to
      the subject-matter of the inquiry and must not be
      extraneous to the scope and purpose of the statute. If
      the authority has taken into account, it may even be with
      the best of intention, as a relevant factor something
      which it could not properly take into account in deciding
      whether or not to exercise the power or the manner or
      extent to which it should be exercised, the exercise of
      the power would be bad. <a href="/doc/802267/" id="a_208">Pratap Singh v. State of Punjab</a>

      found in the statute expressly or by implication matters
      which the authority ought to have regard to, then, in
      exercising the power, the authority must have regard to
      those matters. The authority must call its attention to the
      matters which it is bound to consider.”

      The extent of the duty to act fairly will vary from case to

       are necessary” is of crucial importance. Is there any
       material available on record which enabled the State
       Government to form its opinion that substantial
       modifications in the draft development plan were

       substantial modifications in the draft development plan is
       intertwined with the formation of its opinion that such
       substantial modifications are necessary in the draft
       development plan. The State Government without
       forming any such opinion cannot publish the
       modifications considered necessary along with notice
       inviting suggestions or objections. We have already

</blockquote><p id="p_104">22. Any opinion of the Government to be formed is not
subject to objective test. The language leaves no room
for the relevance of a judicial examination as to the
sufficiency of the grounds on which the Government
acted in forming its opinion. But there must be material
based on which alone the State Government could form
its opinion that it has become necessary to make
substantial modification in the draft development plan.
</p><p id="p_105">23. The power conferred by <a href="/doc/15554/" id="a_213">Section 17(1)(a)(ii)</a> read with
proviso is a conditional power. It is not an absolute
power to be exercised in the discretion of the State
Government. The condition is formation of opinion—
subjective, no doubt—that it had become necessary to
make substantial modifications in the draft development
plan. This opinion may be formed on the basis of
material sent along with the draft development plan or on
the basis of relevant information that may be available
with the State Government. The existence of relevant
material is a precondition to the formation of opinion.
The use of word “may” indicates not only a discretion but
an obligation to consider that a necessity has arisen to
make substantial modifications in the draft development
plan. It also involves an obligation to consider which of
the several steps specified in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
should be taken.
</p><p id="p_106">24. The proviso opens with the words “where the State
Government is of opinion that substantial modifications
in the draft development plan and regulations are
necessary, …”. These words are indicative of the
satisfaction being subjective one but there must exist
circumstances stated in the proviso which are conditions
precedent for the formation of the opinion. Opinion to be
formed by the State Government cannot be on imaginary
grounds, wishful thinking, however laudable that may be.
Such a course is impermissible in law. The formation of
the opinion, though subjective, must be based on the
material disclosing that a necessity had arisen to make
substantial modifications in the draft development plan.

       necessary” is again of crucial importance. The term
       “consider” means to think over; it connotes that there
       should be active application of the mind. In other words,
       the term “consider” postulates consideration of all the
       relevant aspects of the matter. A plain reading of the
       relevant provision suggests that the State Government
       may publish the modifications only after consideration
       that such modifications have become necessary. The
       word “necessary” means indispensable, requisite,
       indispensably requisite, useful, incidental or conducive,
       essential, unavoidable, impossible to be otherwise, not
       to be avoided, inevitable. The word “necessary” must be
       construed in the connection in which it is used. (See

      the term “public interest”? In the context of the Act, it
      takes within its fold several factors such as, the
      maximum number of permits that may be issued on a

      convenience of the travelling public, the non-availability
      of sufficient number of stage carriage services in other

service is an activity which involves use of scarce or
limited productive resources. Motor transport involves a
huge capital investment on motor vehicles, training of
competent drivers and mechanics, establishment of
workshops, construction of safe roads and bridges,
deployment of sufficient number of policemen to
preserve law and order and several other matters. To
say that larger the number of stage carriages in any

problem with myriad facets affecting the general public.

to which the motor vehicles should conform, coordination
of road and rail transport, prevention of deterioration of
the road system, prevention of uneconomic competition
among motor vehicles, fixation of reasonable fare,

It is an expression of wide amplitude. It may have
different connotation and understanding when used in
service law and a yet different meaning in criminal law
than civil law and its shade may be entirely different in
company law. Its perspective may change when merger
is of two Indian companies. But when it is with subsidiary
of foreign company the consideration may be entirely
different. It is not the interest of shareholders or the
employees only but the interest of society which may
have to be examined. And a scheme valid and good may
yet be bad if it is against public interest.

satisfied that the scheme for amalgamation or merger
was not contrary to public interest. The basic principle of
such satisfaction is none other than the broad and
general principles inherent in any compromise or
settlement entered between parties that it should not be
unfair or contrary to public policy or unconscionable. In
amalgamation of companies, the courts have evolved,
the principle of “prudent business management test” or
that the scheme should not be a device to evade law.
</blockquote><p id="p_126">But when the court is concerned with a scheme of
merger with a subsidiary of a foreign company then the
test is not only whether the scheme shall result in
maximising profits of the shareholders or whether the
interest of employees was protected but it has to ensure
that merger shall not result in impeding promotion of
industry or shall obstruct growth of national economy.
Liberalised economic policy is to achieve this goal. The

</blockquote><p id="p_129">54.   In the context of compulsory amalgamation of two or more

companies, the expression “public interest” would mean the welfare of

the public or the interest of society as a whole, as contrasted with the

“selfish” interest of a group of private individuals. Thus, “public interest”

may have regard to the interest of production of goods or services

essential to the nation so that they may contribute to the nation’s

welfare and progress, and in so doing, may also provide much needed

employment. “Public interest” in this context would, therefore, mean

the combining of resources of two or more companies so as to impact

production and consumption of goods and services and employment of

persons relatable thereto for the general benefit of the community.

Conversely, any action that impedes promotion of industry or obstructs

growth which is in national or public interest would run counter to

public interest as mentioned in this Section.

member who does not have sufficient collateral/monies

trade further. This rule was overridden on a recurring

       example, on 28 March, 2013, Rs. 236.5 crore was
       withdrawn from the Settlement Fund in order to fund
       NSEL’s own business overdraft account.
</p><p id="p_156">       There was a running deficit in the client
       monies/settlement fund balance from April 2012 to June
       2013. The finance team of FTIL had raised this as an
       area of concern on several occasions.
</p><p id="p_157">       Misrepresentations to the Regulator
       1.13 Regulatory Contraventions:
</p><p id="p_158">       As per a Gazette Notification issued on 5 June 2007 by
       the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Government of
       India under <a href="/doc/726507/" id="a_240">Section 27</a> of the Forward Contracts
       (Regulation) Act, 1952 (“FCRA”) exempted all forward
       contracts of one day duration for the sale and purchase
       of commodities traded on NSEL from the operations of
       the said Act. Grant Thornton’s review of the type of
       trades executed on the NSEL exchange indicates
       contravention to the exemption conditions granted.
       During the period January 2011 to July 2013, FMC
       sought several clarifications from NSEL on a number of
       complaints received from the public alleging forward
       trading and running a financing scheme. All these
       allegations were refuted by NSEL. Our analysis of such
       trades indicates misrepresentation by NSEL to FMC on
       several occasions.”

The report then goes on to say that there was no documentation in

relation to warehouse activities for long term trades indicating that

such contracts were not secured by warehouse stocks. The

warehouses were customer managed warehouses and the underlying

collateral were not in custody of NSEL. NSEL did not have control over

these warehouses and Grant Thornton was denied access to number

of   warehouses. The   Warehouse     Development     and   Regulatory



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                                                   82</span>
Authority had in fact rejected NSEL’s application for registration of its

warehouses way back on 16.05.2011. Notwithstanding such rejection,

NSEL’s website represented that its warehouses were registered with

the Authority. No verification or due diligence was ever undertaken by

NSEL to ensure compliance by its members of the conditions outlined

in its rules and byelaws even though in terms of NSEL byelaws,

warehouse receipt issued by NSEL were meant to evidence a

commodity being held in an approved warehouse. NSEL did not insist

upon deposit of commodities in the warehouses prior to executing sale

transactions. Instead NSEL resorted to issuing Delivery Allocation

Reports (DAR) representing to genuine investors that each transaction

was delivery based and backed at the time of sale by the required

quantity of commodities in its warehouses.

17.12.2013, based largely on this expert report, read as follows:

       having accorded due consideration to all the objections
       and arguments raised by the noticees vide their written
       submission as well as oral presentations through their
       counsel, we now proceed to conclude our observations
       by taking a final view on the status of the four noticees

</p><p id="p_161">       15.1. Noticee No. 1:- Financial Technologies (India)

pointed out that Shri Jignesh Shah, Chairman-cum-
Managing Director of FTIL has been a Director on the
Board and also functioning as Vice-Chairman and a key
management person of NSEL since its inception.
Similarly, Shri Joseph Massey and Shri Shreekant
Javalgekar have been Directors of the said company
from its very beginning till the settlement crisis at NSEL
first came to light in July, 2013. The facts establishing
the fraud involving a settlement default over Rs. 5,500
crores at NSEL have been discussed at length in the
SCNs issued to the noticees as well as reiterated, albeit
illustratively by us at Para No. 14.7 of this Order. The
responsibility of FTIL as the holding company
possessing absolute control over the governance of
NSEL has also been highlighted. The control of FTIL
over NSEL becomes further crystallized from the
responses given by M/s. Grant Thornton before the
Commission on 03.12.2013 stating that Shri Jignesh
Shah, Mr. Joseph Massey and a host of other officials of
FTIL reviewed the forensic audit report and it was only
after obtaining their clearance, the forensic auditor
finalised its report.
</p><p id="p_162">15.1.1. The violation of conditions prescribed in the
exemption notification, trading in paired contracts to
generate assured financial returns under the garb of
commodity trading, admission of members who were
thinly capitalised having poor net worth and giving
margin exemptions to those who were repeatedly
defaulting in settling their dues, poor warehousing
facilities with no or inadequate stocks, no risk
management practices followed, non-provision of funds
in SGF, consciously appointing Shri Mukesh P. Shah as
statutory auditors for F.Y. 2012-13 who was related to
Shri Jignesh Shah, and apparent complicity with the
defaulters to defraud the investors, etc., lead to an
inescapable conclusion that a huge fraud was
perpetrated by NSEL while having the presence of two
Board members of FTIL on the Board of NSEL, one of
whom was the Vice-Chairman of the company.
</p><p id="p_163">15.1.2. The facts of the case and the manner in which
the business affairs of NSEL were conducted leaves no


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                                             84</span>
doubt in our minds that FTIL, notwithstanding its
contentions that it was ignorant of the affairs and
conduct of NSEL, exerted a dominant influence on the
management, and directed, controlled and supervised
the governance of NSEL. In the face of a fraud of such a
magnitude involving settlement crises of Rs. 5,500
crores owed to over 13,000 sellers/investors on the
trading platform of NSEL, FTIL, cannot seek to take
refuge behind the corporate veil so as to unjustifiably
isolate itself from the fraudulent actions that took place
at NSEL resulting in such a huge payment crisis.
15.1.3. FTIL has its principal business of development
of software which has become the technology platform
for almost the entire industry engaged in broking in
shares and securities, commodities, foreign exchange
etc. As has been demonstrated by FTIL in their written
submission, FTIL has floated a number of regulated
exchanges – both for securities and commodities
derivatives – in India as well as abroad. NSEL was
incorporated to provide a trading platform of commodity
spot exchange on a pan-India basis for the purpose of
which apparently it sought and was granted exemption
from the operation of the FCRA, 1952. Since the
objective of the NSEL was promoting spot trading in
commodities on an electronic platform, its business
model did not contemplate venturing into trading in
forward contracts. FTIL had already promoted MCX, a
regulated exchange under FCRA, 1952, for the purpose
of trading in forward contracts. Therefore, having
secured an exemption from the purview of FCRA, 1952
on the ground that it was intended to promote spot
trading, NSEL was not authorised to allow trading in
forward contracts through the scheme of paired
contracts, thereby defying conditions stipulated in the
exemption notification granted to it. The motive behind
allowing trading in forward contracts on the NSEL
platform in a circuitous manner on NSEL which was
neither recognized nor registered under FCRA, 1952
indicates mala fide intention on the part of the promoter
of FTIL to use the trading platform of its subsidiary
company for illicit gains away from the eyes of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                                             85</span>
      Regulator. The fact that FTIL promoted NSEL sought
      exemption from FCRA, 1952 provisions even before they
      had started any trading or operation, points to their
      intention from the outset. In this manner, it
      misinterpreted the conditions stipulated in the exemption
      notification in collusion with a handful of members, which
      ultimately culminated in a massive fraud involving Rs.
      5,500 crores, which has the potential effect of eroding
      trust and confidence in exchanges and financial markets.
      15.1.4. Keeping in view the foregoing observations and
      the facts which reveal misconduct, lack of integrity and
      unfair practices on the part of FTIL in planning, directing
      and controlling the activities of its subsidiary company,
      NSEL, we conclude that FTIL, as the anchor investor in
      the Multi-Commodity Exchange Ltd. (MCX) does not
      carry a good reputation and character, record of fairness,
      integrity or honesty to continue to be a shareholder of
      the aforesaid regulated exchange. Therefore, in the
      public interest and in the interest of the
      Commodities Derivatives Market which is regulated
      under FCRA, 1952, the Commission holds that
      Financial Technologies (India) Ltd. (FTIL) is not a ‘fit
      and proper person’ to continue to be a shareholder
      of 2% or more of the paid-up equity capital of MCX
      as prescribed under the guidelines issued by the
      Government of India for capital structure of
      commodity exchanges post 5-years of operation. It is
      further ordered that neither FTIL, nor any company/entity
      controlled by it, either directly or indirectly, shall hold any
      shares in any association/Exchange recognised by the
      Government or registered by the FMC in excess of the
      threshold limit of the total paid-up equity capital of such
      Association/Exchange as prescribed under the
      commodity exchange guidelines and post 5-year
      guidelines.”
                                              (emphasis in original)

Based on the Grant Thornton report and the FMC order, the draft

amalgamation order dated 21.10.2014 then relied on the same facts,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                                                        86</span>
as did the final assessment order. The final amalgamation order also

refers to an investigation under <a href="/doc/1421843/" id="a_241">Section 209A</a> into the affairs of NSEL

which led to infractions of <a href="/doc/330130/" id="a_242">Sections 211</a>, <a href="/doc/1441737/" id="a_243">217</a> and <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_244">292A</a> of the

Companies Act. These are compoundable offences which have, in

fact, been compounded by orders dated 03.03.2016 and 31.05.2016

by the concerned authority.
</p>
<p id="p_164">
55.3. We have seen that neither FTIL nor NSEL has denied the fact

that paired contracts in commodities were going on, and by April to

July, 2013, 99% (and excluding E-series contracts), at least 46% of the

turnover of NSEL was made up of such paired contracts. There is no

doubt that such paired contracts were, in fact, financing transactions

which were distinct from sale and purchase transactions in

commodities and were, thus, in breach of both the exemptions granted

to NSEL, and the FCRA. We have also seen that NSEL throughout

kept representing that it was, in fact, a commodity exchange dealing

with spot deliveries. Apart from the Grant Thornton report and the FMC

order, we have also seen that Shri Jignesh Shah, on 10.07.2013,

made representations to the DCA and the FMC, in which he stated that

NSEL had full stock as collateral; 10-20% of open position as margin

money; and that the stock currently held in NSEL’s 120 warehouses

was valued at INR 6000 crore, all of which turned out to be incorrect.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                                                    87</span>
Further, there is no doubt whatsoever that in July, 2013, as a result of

NSEL stopping trading on its exchange, a payment crisis of

approximately INR 5600 crore arose. The further question that remains

is whether, given these facts, the conditions precedent for the

applicability of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_245">Section 396</a> were followed.


</p><p id="p_165">56.   When it comes to whether the Central Government’s satisfaction

as to whether it was “essential” to amalgamate the aforesaid

companies, what must be borne in mind is that NSEL had itself offered

a settlement scheme to pay back the persons who have allegedly

been duped. It was found that this scheme could not really take off, as

a result of which, large amounts continued to be owed to such

persons. That this was the real concern of the FMC is clear from a

letter dated 18.08.2014 addressed by the FMC to the Secretary,

Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This letter states:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_60">       “xxx xxx xxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_61">       2. As apprised earlier, consequent to the suspension
       of trading and a huge settlement default that took place
       at NSEL on 31.07.2007, the Government of India,
       Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food &amp; Public Distribution,
       Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) vide its
       notification dated 6th August, 2013 (copy enclosed as
       Annexure II) inter-alia provided that settlement of all
       outstanding one day forward contract at NSEL shall be
       done under the supervision of FMC. In exercise of this
       supervisory role, the Commission has been continuously
       taking all possible steps and has been regularly pursuing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                                                                     88</span>
with NSEL to expedite the recovery proceedings against
the defaulters at its platform. To ensure better monitoring
of NSEL’s compliance the Commission had vide No.
8/1/2013 (1)-MD-1(1)(C)/Settlement (Vol.-IV) dated 29 th
November, 2013 (copy enclosed as Annexure III)
constituted a Monitoring &amp; Auction Committee (MAC)
comprising the representatives of various members
associations and investors bodies to assist and advise
the Commission on matters pertaining to the
Commission’s supervisory role over the settlement of
outstanding contracts at NSEL.
</blockquote><p id="p_166">3. It is observed that even after one year’s incessant
efforts and in spite of FMC’s active role in supervising
the settlement of contracts, the settlement plan could not
result in making any substantial payment to the investors
as the process of recovery of dues by NSEL from the
defaulting members is very slow. It is submitted that, it is
only the NSEL, which has the responsibility to take all
possible coercive measures as per their rules/bye-laws
and other laws of the land, to ensure that the
outstanding dues of all investors are settled. However as
on date, NSEL has been able to make a payment of only
Rs. 538.56 crores to its members as against the
payment dues of approximately Rs. 5500 crores. This
amount also includes an amount of Rs. 179.26 crores
borrowed by NSEL from its holding company, FTIL which
was distributed to small participants. The representatives
of members associations and investor bodies on the
MAC in their meeting with the Commission have
represented the NSEL has lost its credibility as an
institution. Further the employee attrition in NSEL in the
recent months has been extremely high and it is learnt
that the staff strength of NSEL has come down
considerably, adversely affecting the recovery process.
As per the information received from NSEL, the total
employee count on NSEL rolls was 193 as on
31.07.2013 (when NSEL had suspended trading in one
day forward contracts) which came down to 33 on
31.07.2014. The morale of the employees at NSEL is
also very low. NSEL is also confronted with a number of
cases against it, which are pending in the High Courts


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">                                                               89</span>
and MPID Court relating to its failure to make payment to
the investors. The company is hardly left with any
financial resources to meet even legal expenses apart
from meeting staff salaries and other expenses related
to recovery process. The members of the Monitoring &amp;
Auction Committee have expressed their views that with
the loss of credibility, weak Organizational structure,
depletion of man-power strength and lack of financial
resources, NSEL has become totally ineffective in
pursuing the recovery of the defaulted amounts from the
defaulter members.
</p><p id="p_167">4. It may be noted that NSEL is a subsidiary of
Financial Technologies India Ltd. (FTIL) which holds
99.99% of the shares of NSEL. Hence, for all practical
purposes NSEL is a wholly owned subsidiary of FTIL
and therefore it is the primary responsibility of the parent
company, i.e. FTIL to own complete responsibility for the
affairs of its subsidiary company. In this regard attention
is drawn to the order of the Commission No. 4/5/2013-
MKT-I/B dated 17th December, 2013 (copy enclosed as
Annexure IV) in the matter of “Fit and Proper Person”
status of M/s FTIL (another shareholder and promoter of
MCX) and in the matter of Shri Jignesh Shah &amp; Shri
Joseph Massey ex-Directors &amp; Shri Shreekant
Javalgekar ex-MD and CEO of MCX. Some of the
important highlights of the said order pertaining to FTIL
are as below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_62">     (i)     In para 14.2.1 of the order it is inter-alia
     mentioned that NSEL by virtue of being a
     separate legal entity cannot be said to be

     holding/parent company i.e. FTIL which holds
     99.99% of its share capital.</blockquote><p id="p_168">
</p><p id="p_169">     (ii) In para 14.5.2 it is inter-alia mentioned
     that since FTIL is effectively the only
     shareholder of NSEL, the constitution of the
     Board of Directors of NSEL is entirely under its
     control. FTIL through the Board of Directors of
     NSEL constituted by it possesses effectual and
     absolute control over its subsidiary company
     i.e. NSEL. Such control is further amplified and

</p><p id="p_170">Managing Director of FTIL has been on the
Board of NSEL and functioning as Vice-
</p><p id="p_171">Chairman of the Company since its inception.
Shri Joseph Massey was also a common
Director both on the Board of FTIL and NSEL,
while Shri Shreekant Javalgekar continued to
be a Director of NSEL till he resigned from the
post in July 2013;
</p><p id="p_172">(iii) In para 14.5.3 of the order it is inter-alia
mentioned that it is on record that all the
minutes of Board meetings of NSEL were
regularly tabled at the Board meetings of FTIL.
FTIL kept itself apprised about the affairs of
NSEL and also approved/ratified the actions of
NSEL in its Board meetings on a regular basis;
</p><p id="p_173">(iv) In para 14.9.1 of the order it is inter-alia
mentioned that it is undisputed that NSEL was
an Exchange in which FTIL had ownership
interest to the extent of 99.9998% leaving a
negligible 0.0002% stake to NAFED. The
Articles of Association of NSEL confers
authority to its shareholders to appoint
Directors. As the single largest shareholder, it is
FTIL which has nominated all the directors on
the NSEL board. As a wholly-owned subsidiary,
NSEL is completely under the control of FTIL,
including financial control over the affairs of
NSEL. FTIL, which had the responsibility of
managing the affairs of NSEL, cannot claim to
be unaware of the wrong-doing and fraud
committed by the management of NSEL.
</p><p id="p_174">(v) In para 14.10.06 of the order it is inter-

its role and duty as a parent company to take

     explanation as to what steps have been taken
     by NSEL or by it as a parent company to
     honour the commitment of assuring safety and
     risk-free trading to the members and clients
     who have traded on their platform purely on the
     basis of an explicit assurance that the
     Exchange shall step into the shoes of counter
     parties should there be any default by any
     participant.
</p><p id="p_177">     (vii) In para 15.1.3 of the order it is inter-alia
     mentioned that FTIL has its principal business
     of development of software which has become
     the technology platform for almost the entire
     industry engaged in broking in shares and
     securities, commodities, foreign exchange etc.
     The motive behind allowing trading in forward
     contracts on the NSEL platform in a circuitous
     manner on NSEL which was neither recognized
     nor registered under FCRA, 1952 indicates
     mala fide intention on the part of the promoter
     of FTIL to use the trading platform of its
     subsidiary company for illicit gains away from
     the eyes of Regulator.
</p><p id="p_178">5. The aforesaid facts would clearly establish that the
Board of FTIL and its promoters under the leadership of
Shri Jignesh Shah have been actively controlling and
directing the affairs of NSEL and it is due to the poor
governance and irregularities perpetrated in to the affairs
of NSEL by FTIL and its promoters that the defaulting
members defrauded the exchange to the extent of Rs.
5,500 crores thereby causing huge financial loss to more
than 13,000 investors. It is submitted that the aforesaid
order dated 17th December, 2013 passed by the
Commission is based on tangible facts on the role of
FTIL in the affairs of NSEL, mustered by the
Commission on its own and also the facts revealed by
the forensic auditor M/s. Grant Thornton who were
engaged by NSEL to conduct a forensic audit into the
affairs of NSEL post the settlement crisis. It may be
noted the Hon’ble Bombay High Court has also refused
to grant any interim relief to FTIL and three other

individuals in respect of the aforesaid order dated 17 th
December, 2013 passed by the Commission declaring
FTIL, Shri Jignesh Shah, Shri Joseph Massey and Shri
Shreekant Javalgekar as not fit and proper persons to be
shareholders or a Director in any of the recognized
commodity exchanges. FTIL and other three individuals
have so far not challenged the above interim order of the
Hon’ble High Court.
</p><p id="p_179">6. It is also submitted that the Working Group
constituted by the Central Government under the
Chairmanship of Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of
India to examine into the systematic risk arising in
consequence of the NSEL settlement debacle, have inter
alia recommended that the ownership, governance and
management structure at FTIL and the exchanges
promoted by FTIL need to be assessed and the
possibility of bringing in an institutionalized framework
and approach to these aspects explored.
</p><p id="p_180">7. It may also be noted here that pursuant to the
criminal proceedings and arrest of Shri Jignesh Shah,
Chairman-cum-Managing Director of FTIL who was also
the Vice-Chairman of NSEL, the EOW of Mumbai Police,
has since filed a chargesheet against Shri Jignesh Shah
under various sections<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_246"> of Indian Penal Code</a> and also
the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors
(MPID) Act, 1999, before the Hon’ble Sessions Judge,
Special Court under MPID Act, Mumbai which vindicates
the stand already taken by the Commission in its order
dated 17th December, 2013 pertaining to the role and
responsibility of FTIL as a parent company in the affairs
of its wholly owned subsidiary i.e. NSEL.
</p><p id="p_181">8. The aforesaid submissions would make it clear that
NSEL as a corporate entity has now been rendered
bereft of any credibility and now seems financially and
physically incapable of effecting any substantial recovery
from the defaulting members, notwithstanding all the
legal and other measures taken by it against them under
the instructions/supervision of the Commission. Similarly,
the Board and management of FTIL, by their very
conduct in managing the affairs of NSEL and continuous
effort to distance themselves from their responsibility

      their credibility as a responsive and responsible holding

This letter would show that the immediate reason for amalgamation,

according to the FMC, and which was faithfully carried out by

Government, is that NSEL, as a corporate entity, seems financially and

physically incapable of effecting any substantial recovery from

defaulting members. This was the “emergency situation” according to

the FMC, which should lead to an order of amalgamation of the

holding and subsidiary companies so that the holding company’s

financial resources could be used to pursue proceedings by which

56.2. What concerned the FMC in August 2014 has, by the date of the

final   amalgamation    order,   been   largely   redressed   without

amalgamation. The “emergency situation” of 2013 which, even

according to the Central Government, required the emergent step of

compulsory amalgamation has, by the time of the passing of the

Central Government order, disappeared. Thus, the raison d’être for

applying <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_247">Section 396</a> of the Companies Act has, by the passage of

time, itself disappeared. In fact, as on today, decrees/awards worth

INR 3365 crore have been obtained against the defaulters, with INR

835.88 crore crystallised by the committee set up by the High Court,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                                                  96</span>
pending acceptance by the High Court, even without using the

financial resources of FTIL as an amalgamated company. What is,

therefore, important to note is that what was emergent, and therefore,

essential, even according to the FMC and the Government in 2013-

2014, has been largely redressed in 2016, by the time the

amalgamation order was made. Also, the Central Government order

does not apply its mind to the essentiality aspect of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_248">Section 396</a> at all.

In fact, in several places, it refers to “essential public interest” as if

“essential” goes with “public interest” instead of being a separate and

distinct condition precedent to the exercise of power under Section

</p><p id="p_193">396. On facts, therefore, it is clear that the essentiality test, which is

the condition precedent to the applicable to <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_249">Section 396</a>, cannot be

said to have been satisfied.

<p id="p_194">
</p><p id="p_195">57.   During the course of proceedings before the Division Bench of

the Bombay High Court, FTIL tendered an affidavit dated 04.07.2017,

to place on record its resolution dated 28.03.2016 to infuse a sum of

upto INR 50 crore for each of the financial years 2016-2017 to 2018-

2019 to support NSEL to recover dues from defaulters, defend various

cases, and continue taking necessary legal action against various

parties to recover amounts from defaulters. The Division Bench refers

to this affidavit as follows:

<p id="p_196"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">                                                                       97</span>
“293] At the stage, when the final hearing in these
petitions had considerably advanced, FTIL, tendered an
affidavit dated 4th July 2017 to place on record its
resolution dated 28th March 2016 to infuse a sum up to
Rs. 50 crores for each of the financial years, i.e., FY
2016-17 to FY 2018-19, to support NSEL to recover
dues from defaulters; to defend various legal cases; to
continue taking necessary legal actions against various
parties to recover amounts from defaulters; and for
working capital. The affidavit states that such resolution
was passed and such finances are proposed to be
infused at the request of NSEL.
</p><p id="p_197">294] The affidavit dated 4th July 2017 also confirms that
the activities of NSEL have come to a grinding halt,
though, the affidavit purports to blame the FMC for such
a situation. The affidavit also states that up to now FTIL
has infused approximately Rs. 109 crores with NSEL,
mainly to prosecute and defend legal proceedings.
There is reference to NSEL having obtained decrees
worth more than Rs. 1200 crores and injunctions against
assets of defaulters valued at Rs. 5444.31 crores. The
affidavit further states that FTIL is committed to funding
NSEL for purposes of recovery from defaulters since the
occurrence of payment crisis on the exchange platform
of NSEL.
</p><p id="p_198">295] If the contention of Mr. Chinoy to the effect that
there is absolutely no problem in the functioning of NSEL
or that NSEL has the necessary wherewithal, both
financial as well as infrastructural, to effect recoveries
from the defaulters, is to be accepted, then, there was
no reason to rely upon contribution from FTIL, made or
proposed to be made at a belated stage. The FTIL
resolution dated 28th March 2016, far from affording any
cause to interfere with the impugned order, in fact, lends
support to the reasoning in the impugned order that the
NSEL, on its own, lacks financial as well as
infrastructural capacity to affect any recoveries from the
defaulters. The affidavit dated 4th July 2017 and the
resolution dated 28th March 2016 is also indicative of
the business realities of the situation, which is
incidentally yet another ground in the impugned order.”

</p><p id="p_199">58.   The High Court comment on the aforesaid affidavit is not correct.

The affidavit proceeds on the footing that since the activities of NSEL

have come to a grinding halt, FTIL would help NSEL to effect

recoveries from defaulters. The affidavit nowhere states that there is

no problem in the functioning of NSEL, or that NSEL has or does not

have the necessary wherewithal to effect recovery from defaulters.

Even in the hearing before us, FTIL has submitted an affidavit-cum-

undertaking dated 11.04.2019, stating that it will continue to infuse

funds into NSEL so that recovery of dues from defaulters does not, in

any manner, get stymied. We take this affidavit and undertaking on

record, and hold FTIL to this undertaking made before this Court.


</p><p id="p_200">59.   When it comes to “public interest” as opposed to the “private

interest”   of   investors/traders,   who   have   not   been   paid,   the

amalgamation order dated 12.02.2016 makes interesting reading. The

satisfaction as to public interest is stated in the very beginning of the

order as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">       “Whereas the Central Government is satisfied that to
       leverage combined assets, capital and reserves, achieve
       economy of scale, efficient administration, gainful
       settlement of rights and liabilities of stakeholders and
       creditors and to consolidate businesses, ensure
       coordination in policy, it is essential in the public
       interest…….”

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                                                                        99</span>
What is stated in the opening is repeated in paragraph 2.14.2 as

follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">       “2.14.2 The Central Government also carefully
       considered the proposal received from FMC and
       DEA and was of the considered opinion that to
       leverage combined assets, capital and reserves for
       efficient administration and satisfactory settlement of
       rights and liabilities of stakeholders and creditors of
       NSEL, it would be in essential public interest to
       amalgamate NSEL with FTIL.”

It will be seen that all the expressions used in relation to “public

interest” have relation only to the businesses of the two companies

that are sought to be amalgamated. What is important to note is that

there is no interest of the general public as opposed to the businesses

of the two companies that are referred to. It is important to notice that

the leveraging of combined assets, capital, and reserves is only to

settle liabilities of certain stakeholders and creditors when the order is

read as a whole, and given the fact that the businesses of the two

companies were completely different. So far as achieving economy of

scale and efficient administration is concerned, it is difficult to see how

this would apply to the fact situation in this case where NSEL is

admittedly a company         which has stopped        functioning as a

commodities exchange at least with effect from July, 2013 with no

hope of any revival. Thus, the consolidation of businesses spoken


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                                                       100</span>
about does not exist as a matter of fact, as NSEL’s business has come

to a grinding halt, as has been observed by the FMC and the Central

Government itself. Each one of these expressions, when read with the

rest of the order, therefore, only shows that the sole object of the

amalgamation order is very far from the high-sounding phrases used in

the opening, and is really only to effect speedy recovery of dues of INR

5600 crore, which has been referred to in the letter of the FMC to the

Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, dated 18.08.2014. This would

be clear from a reading, in particular, of two paragraphs of the order,

namely, paragraphs 2.13.2 and 2.13.3, which read as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_75">      “2.13.2. Thus, it would be observed from above that
      NSEL is not having the resources, financial or
      human, or the organizational capability to
      successfully recover the dues to the investors
      pending for over a year. Further, NSEL is not left with
      any viable, sustainable business while FTIL has the
      necessary resources to facilitate speedy recovery of
      dues.

      been received from FMC, vide letter dated 18-08-</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_77">      2014, proposing the merger of NSEL with FTIL by the

      to resolve the payment crisis at NSEL at the earliest.”

59.1. However, the Central Government supported this order on the

ground that it is made in public interest essentially on three grounds,

which are repeatedly referred to by the impugned judgment. The three

grounds as stated by the impugned judgment are as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">      “269. …… (a) Restoring/safeguarding public confidence
      in forward contracts and exchanges which are an
      integral and essential part of Indian economy and
      financial system, by consolidating the businesses of
      NSEL and FTIL; (b) Giving effect to business realities of
      the case by consolidating the businesses of FTIL and
      NSEL and preventing FTIL from distancing itself from
      NSEL, which is, even otherwise, its alter ego; and (c)
      Facilitating NSEL in recovering dues from defaulters by
      pooling human and financial resources of FTIL and
      NSEL. Further, we are also satisfied that each of these
      three grounds constitute a facet of public interest in the
      context of the provisions in <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_251">Section 396</a>. ……”

59.2. It is important to note that the first and second grounds

mentioned by the High Court are not contained in the draft order of

amalgamation.    Had they been so contained,          objections and

suggestions would have been made by all stakeholders, which the

Central Government would then have been bound to consider before

passing the final order. However, it was argued on behalf of the

respondents that the first and second grounds are, in reality,

inferences drawn from facts which are already stated in the order and

these inferences do not need to be stated in the draft order. We are



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                                                                   102</span>
afraid that this argument is incorrect inasmuch as grounds contained in

reasons (a) and (b) are important grounds which have a vital bearing

on the amalgamation in question. If these grounds were contained in

the draft order, there is no doubt that the shareholders and creditors of

FTIL, and FTIL itself would have had an opportunity to comment on the

same. For example, the “business realities” of the case are facts

known to FTIL; and NSEL, being FTIL’s alter ego, is the subject matter

of dispute in various suits that have been filed and are pending

adjudication. FTIL could have responded giving reasons as to why

NSEL is not its alter ego. Also, whether the amalgamation is, in fact, to

restore or safeguard public confidence in forward contracts and

exchanges is a subject matter on which FTIL, its shareholders and

creditors, could have commented. Equally, whether NSEL’s exchange

was an essential and integral part of the Indian economy and financial

system, and whether this defunct business could be consolidated so

as to impact the economy are all matters for comment by FTIL and its

shareholders and creditors. For all these reasons, we cannot accede

to the respondents’ arguments on this score. On this ground alone,

even assuming that these two grounds obtained and can be culled out

from the final order, not being contained in the draft order, the said




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                                                                     103</span>
grounds would be in breach of <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_252">Section 396(3)</a> and (4), and therefore,

cannot be looked at to support the order.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_79">59.3. It is important to note that grounds (a) and (b) are both culled out

in answer to objections raised by FTIL. The precise objection raised

and the answer given are quoted hereinbelow:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">       “7.2.1. FTIL has challenged the background and
       reasons for the amalgamation as the power under
       <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_253">section 396</a> of the Act has been used only in case of
       Government companies alone. This argument does
       not derogate from the scope of the statutory
       provisions. The statutory provisions of <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_254">section 396</a> of
       the Act are being invoked in essential public interest
       to safeguard the interest of all stakeholders in the
       captioned company. The present status and
       composition of the Boards of FTIL and NSEL have
       been noted. However, the fact that the Boards had
       not acted with an independent mind to collect
       information and put the system under a robust
       technology is borne out of the simple fact that the
       Show Cause Notice dated 27-04-2012 issued by the
       Department of Consumer Affairs based on analysis of
       trade data by the then Forward Market Commission
       had given an alarming picture of the state of affairs of
       NSEL. The public interest driving the merger are set
       out in the business realities of the case, it is noted
       from the facts of the case and the recommendations
       of FMC as well as its order dated 17-12-2013 which
       throw ample light to the grave shattering of the public
       confidence and the purpose of establishing
       commodity exchange has been defeated.”
       xxx xxx xxx
       “7.2.6. FTIL and NSEL have distinct and separate
       objects and nature of operations and completely
       disparate and unconnected objects, and hence there
       is no synergy, efficient administration, consolidation

      of business or co-ordination in policy to be gained
      by the forced amalgamation; the argument runs
      contrary to the concept of merger which essentially
      means that two or more separate entities are getting
      merged to achieve the objectives of amalgamation. In
      the instant case, amalgamation is targeted to achieve its
      stated objects, essentially in public interest. By all
      intents and purposes, the way both the companies were
      being managed, owned and controlled, NSEL is the alter
      ego of FTIL and thus, the two companies have been
      practically one entity. All stakeholders were also looking
      at them as one entity. The amalgamation u/s. 396 of the
      Act only formalizes this practical reality in essential
      public interest.”
      xxx xxx xxx
      “7.2.8. The FTIL has questioned the jurisdiction of
      the Central Government to decide on the question of
      fraud and claimed that it has to be proved beyond
      reasonable        doubt     by    adducing      necessary
      particulars; the Central Government is invoking <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_255">section
      396</a> of the Act in essential public interest for the merger
      of NSEL, which is an almost wholly-owned subsidiary of
      FTIL. The merger is not an adjudication on the alleged
      fraud. The merger is targeted to achieve its stated
      objectives for long term sustainability in the best interest
      of the stakeholders.”
                                           (emphasis in original)

It will be noticed that the objection raised in paragraph 7.2.1 is that

<a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_256">Section 396</a> can be used in the case of Government companies alone,

whereas the answer given is that this cannot be so, given the business

realities of the case and the FMC order of 17.12.2013 “which throw

ample light to the grave shattering of public confidence and the

purpose of establishing Commodity Exchange has been defeated”.

realities” of the case are what is contained in “the recommendations of

the FMC”. We have seen that these recommendations are in the form

of a letter dated 18.08.2014, in which the “business reality” is the fact

that dues of INR 5600 crore have to be paid, and that NSEL does not

have the wherewithal to do so. Thus, its parent company’s financial

resources ought to be used to effect such payment. This “business

reality”, therefore, speaks only of the private interest of the

investors/traders who have been allegedly duped (which fact will only

be established in suits filed by them in 2014), and nothing beyond

(which would show some vestige of public interest). Equally, the grave

shattering of public confidence and purpose of establishing commodity

exchanges      having   been        defeated,        according   to   the    Central

Government, is a gloss on the FMC order dated 17.12.2013. If this

were so, one would have expected a resuscitation or revival of the

commodities exchange of NSEL, which could have been achieved by

takeover of its management. It is difficult to imagine that grave

shattering of public confidence by the permanent shutting down of the

commodities exchange of the NSEL would be remedied only by

facilitating   the   paying    of     dues      to     certain   allegedly   duped

investors/traders, which fact will be proved or disproved in suits filed

by them which are pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court. In

any case, this reason is wholly irrelevant as an answer to the objection

raised by FTIL which, as we have seen, is an objection stating that the

Section applies to Government companies alone. Also, had FTIL made

no such objection, no such answer would have been forthcoming. As

far as paragraphs 7.2.6 and 7.2.8 of the order are concerned, what is

admitted in the order itself, is that there is no “adjudication” on the

“fraud” in the facts of the present case, and thus, not an exercise of

lifting of the corporate veil of the pre-amalgamation companies. The

amalgamation order contradicts itself by then stating that NSEL is the

alter ego of FTIL, and thus, the two companies are practically one

entity. In any event, these paragraphs do not indicate as to how the

‘alter ego’ argument impacts public interest. For all these reasons,

therefore, neither reason (a) nor reason (b) ought to detain us any

further. Reason (c) is, therefore, the only reason that really remains, as

is contained in the letter of 18.08.2014 by the FMC to the Central

Government. We have already seen that this reason, by itself, is the

protection of the private interest of a group of investors/traders, as

distinct from public interest.

<p id="p_201">59.4. It is important to note that under <a href="/doc/1951527/" id="a_257">Section 396(4)(b)</a>, the Central

may seem to it desirable in the light of such suggestions and

objections. No modification has been made in the body of the Central

Government order as finally made. If the Central Government had

actually considered that each of these three reasons impact public

interest, it would have explicitly said so after suggestions and

objections were made by the various stakeholders. The fact that the

Central Government has not amended the body of the final order is of

great significance – it is only the original reasons given in the draft

order that continue as such in the final order which, as we have seen,

are not in furtherance of public interest at all. Reasons (a) and (b), part

of which is culled out from answers to objections and suggestions

given in the final order, is only given separately by the Central

Government after the amalgamation order to show that the principles

of natural justice as laid down by sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_258">Section 396</a> have,

in fact, been followed. This becomes clear from paragraphs 6.3 and 7

of the final order, which read as follows:

      submissions (physically and electronically) received by
      the Central Government on various dates. The said
      objections, suggestions and submissions made by each
      of the parties are dealt in the manner herein under.”

59.5. So far, we have gone by the Central Government order as it

stands. The Bombay High Court, in stating reasons (a), (b), and (c) as

grounds of public interest, has gone much further than even the

answer given to the objections that are contained in the order itself.

“Restoring/safeguarding public confidence in forward contracts and

exchanges, which are an integral and essential part of the Indian

economy and financial system, by consolidating the businesses of

NSEL and FTIL,” is not contained in the answer given to objections in

the order. First and foremost, restoring public confidence is no part of

the order. What is mentioned is only the fact that public confidence has

been shattered, as is reflected by the FMC order dated 17.12.2013.

Secondly, the entire expression, “which are an integral and essential

part of Indian economy and financial system, by consolidating the

businesses of NSEL and FTIL” is no part even of this answer given,

but a gloss given by the High Court itself relatable to this answer.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">                                                                    109</span>
Similarly, when it comes to reason (b), “giving effect to business

realities of the case” contained in the answer to objections does not

contain “by consolidating the businesses of FTIL and NSEL”, nor does

it contain “and preventing FTIL from distancing itself from NSEL, which

is, even otherwise, its alter ego”. On the contrary, the High Court itself

mentions, in paragraph 355, that “this is also not a case where the

Central Government has, in fact, lifted the corporate veil, despite the

alleged non-existence of the circumstances justifying lifting of such

corporate veil”, and further, “this is not a case where the Central

Government has lifted the corporate veil and sought to apportion any

liability upon either NSEL or FTIL”. For all these reasons, we find that

no reasonable body of persons properly instructed in law could

possibly arrive at the conclusion that the impugned order has been

made in public interest.

It is important to note that unlike <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_261">Section 396</a> of the Companies Act,

the satisfaction of the Reserve Bank of India can be on any one of four

grounds. Such satisfaction may be in the public interest or in the

interest of depositors. This point is, in fact, highlighted in paragraph 34

of the judgment as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_84">       “34. The phrase “good reasons” in sub-section (1) of
       <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_262">Section 45</a> is a term of wide amplitude and it will not be
       correct to restrict it only to the actions mentioned under
       sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_263">Section 45</a> of the Act as is contended
       by the appellants. The provision is concerned with
       preparing a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation
       which would become necessary where RBI is satisfied
       about the existence of any of the four grounds
       mentioned in <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_264">Section 45(4)</a>. Apart from public interest
       and the interest of the banking system, which are
       provided in clauses (a) and (d) thereof, <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_265">Section 45(4)</a>
       provides for the necessary action in the interest of the
       depositors or with a view to secure proper management
       of the Bank which are clauses (b) and (c) in that sub-
       section. Precursor to the framing of the scheme is the

       be one of the good reasons to impose moratorium, but
       that certainly cannot be the only one. Considering that
       object of the Act is protection of the interest of the
       depositors, such an interpretation of the concept of
       “good reasons” will have to be adopted, and not a
       narrow one.”

The judgment then goes on to state:
</p>
      “39. Now, as far as the first two questions of non-<p id="p_219">
</p><p id="p_220">      consideration of reconstruction and proposing merger
      with Federal Bank are concerned, RBI has noted that the
      Bank was in difficulties from 1990 and particularly from
      December 2003 when it was placed under monthly
      monitoring. RBI in its application for moratorium to the
      Central Government dated 4-1-2006 had clearly stated
      that during the discussion with the appellant Bank, major
      shareholders and Directors had shown total reluctance
      to merge into the stronger bank. In view thereof, it was
      imperative that immediate arrangement to protect the
      interest of the depositors was to be made through its
      merger with a bank under <a href="/doc/1300771/" id="a_268">Section 45</a> of the Act. RBI
      had, therefore, made an effort and called upon the
      appellant Bank, that if possible, to explore the possibility
      of merger with another stronger bank. It had also made
      an effort to impress that there should be infusion of fresh
      capital. That was not coming. There could be a
      reconstruction by bringing in more money or by
      narrowing the size of the appellant Bank which did not
      appear to be feasible. The only option left was that of
      amalgamation.”

Thus, two features of Ganesh Bank (supra) distinguish the said case

from the facts of the present case. First, that under <a href="/doc/1829498/" id="a_269">Section 45</a> of the

Banking Regulation Act, the interest of the depositors is to be looked

at; and it was this reason that led to the amalgamation. Secondly, this

Court found that after exploring other options, the only option left was

that of amalgamation.

<p id="p_221">

becomes important. Under <a href="/doc/1300771/" id="a_272">Section 45(4)(b)</a> and (c) of the <a href="/doc/1129081/" id="a_273">Banking

Regulation Act</a>, the satisfaction of the Reserve Bank of India for

preparing a scheme of amalgamation can be in the interest of the

depositors of a particular bank or in order to secure the proper

management of a particular banking company. This must be

contrasted with clauses (a) and (d) of <a href="/doc/1300771/" id="a_274">Section 45(4)</a>, which speak of

public interest and the interest of the banking system of the country as

a whole. This judgment, on facts, merged a financially weak bank with

a financially strong bank in the interest of the depositors of the

financially weak bank. It is important to note that the business of the

two merged entities is the same, as also Federal Bank’s (i.e., the

strong bank’s) willingness to merge, being an unconditional offer to

merge because it felt that post merger, it could have a significant

presence in western Maharashtra and the Belgaum area of Karnataka,

and could augment its credit disbursal to the agricultural sector. Also,

since the interest of depositors is a separate head, based upon which

the Reserve Bank of India may amalgamate two banking companies, it

is clear that this reason alone will not go to public interest, which is a

separate head contained in <a href="/doc/1300771/" id="a_275">Section 45(4)</a>. It is in this context that the

observation contained in paragraph 44 is made, namely:




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">                                                                      114</span>
      “44. Under <a href="/doc/1300771/" id="a_276">Section 45</a> of the Act, the primary
      consideration is public interest. There is an underlying
      object of acting swiftly and decisively to protect the
      interests of depositors and ensure public confidence in
      the banking system. The emergent situation which
      warrants action with expedition cannot be lost sight of
      while deciding the legality of the action.”

As we have already seen, the “emergent situation” which obtained in

2013 was no longer there in 2016 when the final order of

amalgamation was passed in the present case.


</p><p id="p_223">63.   Valiant attempts have been made by counsel in the High Court

as well as counsel in this Court to support the order on grounds which

are outside the order, stating that such grounds make it clear that in

any case, the Government order has been made in public interest. The

celebrated passage in Mohinder Singh Gill (supra) states that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_85">      “8. The second equally relevant matter is that when a
      statutory functionary makes an order based on certain
      grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons so
      mentioned and cannot be supplemented by fresh
      reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise. Otherwise,
      an order bad in the beginning may, by the time it comes
      to Court on account of a challenge, get validated by
      additional grounds later brought out. We may here draw
      attention to the observations of Bose, J. in <a href="/doc/1008845/" id="a_277">Gordhandas

           language used in the order itself.”
       Orders are not like old wine becoming better as they
       grow older.”

We are of the view that it is the Central Government that has to be

“satisfied” that its order is in public interest and such “satisfaction”

must, therefore, be of the Central Government itself and must,

therefore, appear from the order itself. All these valiant attempts made

to sustain such order must be rejected.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_89">       45. We are of the view that the decision-maker can
       always rely upon subsequent materials to support the
       decision already taken when larger public interest is

       M.P. v. Abhilash Shiksha Prasar Samiti</a> [(1998) 9 SCC

       subsequent report to sustain the cancellation of the
       examination conducted where there were serious
       allegations of mass copying. The principle laid down
       in Mohinder Singh Gill case [(1978) 1 SCC 405] is not
       applicable where larger public interest is involved and in
       such situations, additional grounds can be looked into to
       examine the validity of an order. The finding recorded by
       the High Court that the report of CBI cannot be looked
       into to examine the validity of the order dated 4-6-2004,
       cannot be sustained.”

It will be seen that there is no broad proposition that the case of

Mohinder Singh Gill (supra) will not apply where larger public interest

is involved. It is only subsequent materials, i.e., materials in the form of

facts that have taken place after the order in question is passed, that

can be looked at in the larger public interest, in order to support an

administrative order. To the same effect is the judgment in <a href="/doc/140540038/" id="a_281">PRP

Exports and Ors. v. Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu

and Ors</a>., (2014) 13 SCC 692 [at paragraph 8]. It is nobody’s case that

there are any materials or facts subsequent to the passing of the final

order of the Central Government that have impacted the public

interest, and which, therefore, need to be looked at. On facts,

therefore, the two judgments cited on behalf of the respondents have

in or rights against the company resulting from an amalgamation order.

Such “interest in” or “rights against” obviously refers to real and

substantive rights, as opposed to rights that are only in form. A

shareholder or creditor gets effected by an amalgamation order if the

value of his share gets depleted as a result of the amalgamation and if

dividends that have been paid to him are likely to come down as a

result of the amalgamation. Likewise, a creditor of a solvent company

is directly effected by an amalgamation by which the amount loaned by

such creditor becomes, as a result of the amalgamation, less likely to

be paid back in time, than if the amalgamation did not take place. Such

rights and interests of members and creditors are substantive rights

which, when effected by the amalgamation, lead to compensation

having to be paid. Every shareholder of a company and indeed, every

creditor of a company, is concerned only with the “economic value” of

his share or the loan granted to a company, as the case may be. The

(aa) that every member or creditor of each of the companies before

amalgamation shall have, as nearly as may be, the same interest in or

rights against the company resulting from the amalgamation as he had

in the original company. To the extent to which the interest or rights of

such member or creditor are less than his interest or rights against the

original company, post amalgamation, he shall be entitled to

compensation which is to be assessed. Post assessment, if such

member or creditor is aggrieved, he may prefer an appeal to the

appellate authority under sub-section (3A). Under sub-section (4)(aa),

an appeal under sub-section (3A) has expired, or where any such

appeal has been preferred, the appeal has been finally disposed of.


</p><p id="p_226">67.   The learned counsel on behalf of the appellant has argued that

the assessment order dated 01.04.2015, passed by the Joint Director

(Accounts), does not reflect any compensation in favour of the

shareholders or creditors of FTIL. According to the learned counsel, it

is clear that if a company with low net worth (NSEL) is amalgamated

with a company with high positive net worth (FTIL), both the

shareholders and the creditors of FTIL will be directly impacted as the

economic value of the shares will plummet, and the creditors of FTIL,

which is a positive net worth company, may have to wait for a long time

before recovery of debts owed to them once the company is

amalgamated with the negative net worth company. In short, the

creditors of FTIL will be put on par with the creditors of NSEL, which

will result in the creditors of FTIL either being paid back their debts

much later in point of time, or not at all. To this argument, the answer

of the Union of India, which has found favour with the Division Bench

of the Bombay High Court, is that “economic value” forms no part of

<a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_286">Section 396</a>. So long as the shareholders of FTIL continued to have

plummet post amalgamation.

shareholder acquires no right in the assets of a company as the

has the right to dividends and the right to participate in the assets of

the company which would be left over after winding up. The Court

held:

        subject to the Articles of Association, that the profits or

amalgamation will obviously come down, and dividends payable to

shareholders will consequently either come down or be wiped out if the

low net worth of NSEL is taken into account post amalgamation,

together with potential liabilities of the amalgamated company, which

may have to be paid in the near future. Secondly, if the amalgamated

company is wound up, the amount that is payable to the shareholders

post-amalgamation will be much less, if at all anything is to be paid,

than pre-amalgamation.

This Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_93">       “40. …… It must at once be stated that valuation of
       shares is a technical and complex problem which can be
       appropriately left to the consideration of experts in the
       field of accountancy. Pennington in his Principles of
       Company Law mentions four factors which had to be
       kept in mind in the valuation of shares:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_94">            “(1) Capital Cover,
            (2) Yield,
            (3) Earning Capacity, and
            (4) Marketability.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_95">       For arriving at the fair value of share, three well-known
       methods are applied:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_96">            (1) The manageable profit-basis method (the

            (2) The networth method or the break value
            method, and
            (3) The market value method.”

What is clear from the various methods of valuation of shares, when it

comes to such valuation qua the transferor and transferee company, is

that the market value method is one method in which shares can be

valued so that their equivalent can then be provided for in the

amalgamated company. This would be nothing other than what those

shares were worth in the market on a particular day or an average

taken within a certain period. What is important to note is that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                                                                   123</span>
market value of shares is market value of shares reflective of their

economic value, being an interest measured by a sum of money, is not

something that is completely alien to determining the rights of or

interest of a shareholder in the transferor or transferee company, as

the case may be.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_97">72.   In fact, the Government order dated 12.02.2016 itself reflects the

net worth of NSEL as INR 8.86 crore from its balance sheet dated

31.03.2015, despite its capital being INR 60 crore, inasmuch as the

total reserve and surplus is a negative figure of INR 51.54 crore. As

against this, FTIL’s balance sheet, as on 31.03.2015, discloses that for

the same year, FTIL’s net worth is INR 2779.94 crore. Also, FTIL has

been paying dividends to its shareholders ranging from 1000% to

250% for the years 2007-2008 till 2015-2016. On the other hand,

NSEL has never paid a single dividend ever since its inception. Post

amalgamation, therefore, dividend payable to the shareholders of FTIL

is bound to come down. Correspondingly, the ‘marketable value’ of

such shares will also fall.

<p id="p_236">73.   The impugned Division Bench judgment has incorrectly held that

the economic value of shares cannot be taken into account. In fact,

       also sub judice before various forums including the
       Hon’ble Mumbai High Court. The Company may be

From the Director’s Report and consolidated financial statements of

NSEL, it becomes clear that the company may be exposed to liabilities

in case of any adverse outcome in any of the proceedings that may be

pending, as a result of which, it may have to pay back the whole or

some part of the INR 5600 crore owed to the alleged investors/traders

by the 24 defaulters who are members of NSEL. This would certainly

impact the ‘economic value’ of shares held in FTIL as this is one factor

that would, post amalgamation, depress the market value of shares

held by such shareholder, and would also impact the dividend payable

on such shares post amalgamation.
</p>
<p id="p_241">74.   The impugned judgment has also held that no material was

produced before the Court to show that share prices would in fact

plummet post-amalgamation. This is despite the fact that the

impugned judgment itself refers to the fact that since the publication of

the draft order on 21.10.2014, the share value which was INR 211.10,

dropped to INR 174.55 ten days later. The Division Bench then goes

on to state that it is not possible to hold that any case of serious

erosion in economic value has at all been made out, inasmuch as by

21.10.2014, when the draft order of amalgamation was made available

to companies, the news of collapse of NSEL’s exchange was already



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                                                                     126</span>
in public domain. This is wholly incorrect for the reason that the news

of collapse took place in July, 2014, i.e., over two months before the

publication of the draft order. It is well known that the stock market is

extremely sensitive to the slightest event that may render a company

less profitable. Over two months is too long a period to relate a share

value of INR 211.10 drastically falling to INR 174.55. On the other

hand, it is obvious that the publication of the draft order on 21.10.2014

had the impact of the share price reducing by a substantial amount,

ten days later. In fact, a reference to the share prices of NSEL

furnished by the learned Additional Solicitor General makes it clear

that the moment the final amalgamation order dated 12.02.2016 was

publicised, the share price fell from INR 89.90 on 12.02.2016 to INR

73.90 on 24.02.2016 and further to INR 73.10 on 29.02.2016.

Incidentally, the High Court realised this, and finally incorrectly

concludes, “there is thus substantial compliance with the provisions of

<a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_292">Section 396(3)</a>.” Given the fact that the assessment order dated

01.04.2015 did not provide any compensation to either the

shareholders or creditors of FTIL for the economic loss caused by the

amalgamation in breach of <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_293">Section 396(3)</a>, it is clear that an important

condition precedent to the passing of the final amalgamation order was

not met. On this ground also, therefore, the final amalgamation order


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                                                                     127</span>
has to be held to be ultra vires <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_294">Section 396</a> of the Companies Act, and,

being arbitrary and unreasonable, violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_295">Article 14</a> of the

Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_242">75.   However, the learned Senior Advocates for the respondents

have argued that an order of nil compensation is equally an order that

is passed under <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_296">Section 396(3)</a> which could have been appealed

against but was not appealed against. For this reason, therefore, it is

not correct to state that the condition precedent mentioned in <a href="/doc/1723156/" id="a_297">Section

396(4)(aa)</a> has not been fulfilled. It will be noticed that the language

used in the appeal provision, i.e. <a href="/doc/1304441/" id="a_298">Section 396(3A)</a>, is “any person

aggrieved by any assessment of compensation made by the

prescribed authority under sub-section (3) may…… appeal to the

Tribunal, and thereupon the assessment of the compensation shall be

made by the Tribunal.” The pre-requisites for the application of sub-

section (3A) are that a person first be aggrieved by an “assessment of

compensation” “made” by the prescribed authority. Where no

assessment of compensation whatsoever is made by the prescribed

authority (and on the facts here, the prescribed authority has not, in

fact, stated that for the reasons given by it, compensation awarded to

FTIL, its shareholders and creditors is nil), no person can be aggrieved

by an order which does not assess any compensation, which may be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">                                                                    128</span>
interfered with by the Appellate Tribunal which must then assess the

compensation for itself. The statute clearly entitles such shareholders

and creditors to have compensation assessed first by the prescribed

authority and then by the appellate authority. This Court, in <a href="/doc/84226/" id="a_299">Institute of

Chartered Accountants of India v. L.K. Ratna and Ors</a>., [1986] 3

in the trial administrative body cannot be cured by observing such

rules of natural justice in the appellate body. It was held:

       insufficiency in the original proceeding before the

Builders [(1971) 1 Ch. 34, 49]. Treating with another
aspect of the point, that learned Judge said:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_103">     “If one accepts the contention that a defect of
     natural justice in the trial body can be cured
     by the presence of natural justice in the

     the member of his right of appeal from the
     expelling body. If the rules and the law
     combine to give the member the right to a fair
     trial and the right of appeal, why should he be
     told that he ought to be satisfied with an
     unjust trial and a fair appeal? Even if the
     appeal is treated as a hearing de novo, the
     member is being stripped of his right to
     appeal to another body from the effective
     decision to expel him. I cannot think that
     natural justice is satisfied by a process
     whereby an unfair trial, though not resulting in
     a valid expulsion, will nevertheless have the
     effect of depriving the member of his right of
     appeal when a valid decision to expel him is
     subsequently made. Such a deprivation would
     be a powerful result to be achieved by what in
     law is a mere nullity; and it is no mere triviality
     that might be justified on the ground that
     natural justice does not mean perfect justice.</blockquote>

Ontario High Court in Canada in Re Cardinal and

who shall be entitled to an assessment of compensation, first by the

prescribed authority and then, a right of appeal to the Appellate

Tribunal. In such cases, therefore, the orders of “non-assessment” by

the prescribed authority can more appropriately be challenged in

judicial review proceedings, in which the High Court, acting under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_305">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India can, if an infraction of <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_306">Section

396(3)</a> is found, send the matter back to the prescribed authority to

determine compensation after which the right of appeal under sub-

section (3A) of <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_307">Section 396</a> would then follow. In fact, in Writ Petition

2743 of 2014, which challenged both the draft order and the final order

of amalgamation, the appellant took out a chamber summons for

amendment of its writ petition to challenge the order of assessment of

compensation, dated 01.04.2015, which amendment was allowed vide

order   dated    16.02.2016.    The    order   of   “non-assessment”    of

compensation has thus been challenged by FTIL in proceedings under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_308">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. Even otherwise, this is a case

where there is complete non-application of mind by the authority

assessing compensation to the rights and interests which the

shareholders and creditors of FTIL have and which are referred to in

<a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_309">Section 396(3)</a> of the Act. This being the case, it is clear that <a href="/doc/90641/" id="a_310">Section

396(3)</a> has not been followed either in letter or in spirit.

with respect to the validity of the Central Government amalgamation

order, we have not addressed the same as we have held that the order

dated 12.02.2016 is ultra vires <a href="/doc/1386720/" id="a_311">Section 396</a> of the Companies Act, and

violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_312">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India for the reasons stated

by us hereinabove. The appeals are accordingly allowed, and the

impugned judgment of the Bombay High Court is set aside. The writ

petition is disposed of in light of this judgment.
