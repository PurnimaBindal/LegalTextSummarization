<p id="p_3">3.     Shorn of unnecessary details, the facts of the case of the
parties are as follows. Petitioner and respondent/claimant signed
a Technology Formulation and Transfer Agreement termed as
Memorandum of Agreement (in short MoA) on 08/07/2005
where under the claimant/respondent agreed to provide the
Technology/Formulation developed by them alongwith related
knowhow owned and possessed by them to the present petitioner
against payment of one time Licence Fee of Rs. 27 Lakhs and
royalty payment @ 1.5% on all the sale proceeds of the Product
(cationic bitumen emulsion produced by use of claimant&#x27;s
Technology formulation and know-how). The contract was
initially for a period of six (6) years with effect from 08/07/2005
till 07/07/2011. The contract also inter alia provided that the
parties may review the conditions of agreement one year before
expiry of agreement and enter into fresh Agreement if they so
mutually agreed. One of the conditions expressly provided and
agreed between the parties under clause 11.3 of the MoA was that
expiry of the MoA shall not affect the rights, obligations and
liabilities of the parties described in <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_5">Article 4.0 (Ownership</a>),
<a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_6">Article 5.0 (confidentiality of Technical Information)</a> and <a href="/doc/531094/" id="a_7">Article
6.2 (Royalty)</a> of the MoA. However, the parties were free to

expiry of the MoA. Under said MoA, royalty was to be paid by

 the petitioner to the claimant/respondent twice a year i.e., on 1 st
April and 1st September each for the previous six months period.
While making payment of royalty for previous six months,
petitioner       was     under        obligation           to      provide     to      the
claimant/respondent a statement of royalty accruing and due
during the six months period to which the statement relates and
was to be supported by all information necessary to verify the
correctness of the royalty statement. For the six years period of
MoA dated 08/07/2005, terms were complied by the parties and
no dispute of any kind arose between them about performance of
their respective obligations. Aforesaid MoA dated 08/07/2005
also contained the following relevant clauses:-

08/07/2011 to 07/07/2016. The petitioner was represented by
their two Managing Partners. A royalty at the rate of 2% of Ex-

time was finally agreed between the Parties to be paid by the
respondent during next five years period. It was expressly agreed
that the new rate of 2% would be effective from 08/07/2011 and

              which started @ Rs. 205/- per MT in 2005 and the same has
              gone to Rs. 417/- Per MT as on date i.e., increase of almost

              keeping in view the market competition, credit facilities to
              clients and thin margins on the sales. Despite our best
              persuasion they were not at all agreeing for increase in royalty

              the Royalty Rate of 2% of Ex-Factory Basic Price + Service-tax
              as applicable from time to time. The new rate of royalty will be

Sole Arbitrator is proper and has been reached fairly upon having
followed due procedure and after having given adequate
opportunities to the parties to place their grievances during the
arbitration proceedings and overall approach of Ld. Sole
Arbitrator is neither capricious nor arbitrary and that petition has
been filed without having issued the pre-requisite notice which
the petitioner is required to issue to the respondent prior to

 from 08/07/2011, there was no agreement in existence between
the parties qua the usage by the petitioner of the technology or
formulation and knowhow owned by the respondent and qua the
maintenance of confidentiality in respect thereof. It was further
averred that the dispute between the parties is well within the
purview of the arbitration clause embodied in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_43">Article 12.0</a> in the
said MoA. It was further averred that Ld. Sole Arbitrator had
rightly concluded that the dispute between the parties pertained
to the subject matter of the said MoA and that the said MoA had
been in existence and had continued to operate beyond the said
initial period of the said MoA. It was further averred that
petitioner vide letter dated 29/12/2016 had impliedly accepted his
liability to pay the royalty pursuant to the expiry of the said
initial period of the said MoA but @ 0.5% and up to 31/03/2016
and had quantified therein the same on that basis to a sum of Rs.
19,28,802/-. The said letter of the petitioner had been received by
the respondent after the respondent had submitted its Statement
of Claim to the SFCA and after the Ld. Sole Arbitrator had
entered upon his reference. In the said letter dated 29/12/2016,
petitioner had not indicated as to whether the said amount
mentioned therein qua outstanding royalty amount is merely the
royalty amount or it includes the tax amount as well. As such the
respondent made its claims qua the same in two parts. It was
further averred that arbitral award passed by Ld. Sole Arbitrator
is neither erroneous nor improper and that the same had been
reached fairly upon having followed due procedure and after
having given adequate opportunities to the parties to place their
grievances during the arbitral proceedings and same had been
awarded after having well considered the facts and circumstances

 of the case. It was further averred that <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_45">Section 34</a> of the Act

<p id="p_11">12. Ld. Counsel for petitioner argued in terms of the grounds of
the petition. It was also argued the that the award was without
jurisdiction since there was no concluded and enforceable
Contract as the Minutes of Meeting (MoM) dated 22/06/2011 at
the highest was merely an Agreement to enter into an Agreement
and does not create a binding obligation. Reliance was placed
upon the case of Speech And Software Technologies (India)
Private Limited vs NEOS Interactive Limited, (2009) 1 SCC
</p><p id="p_12">475. It was also argued that there was no arbitration agreement
between the parties in terms of <a href="/doc/1737370/" id="a_48">Section 7</a> of the Act as Minutes of
Meeting (MoM) dated 22/06/2011 did not have arbitration clause
and even had no reference to original agreement dated
08/07/2005 whereas the MoA in survival clause, 2nd part of
Clause 11.3 does not provide for arbitration clause as one of the
Clauses which remains unaffected upon the expiry of MoA.
Reliance was placed upon the case of <a href="/doc/151593616/" id="a_49">INOX Wind Limited vs
Thermocables Limited</a>, (2018) 2 SCC 519. Also was argued that
as per Rule 18 of the SFCA Rules, 2003, five names were
suggested for Sole Arbitrator by SFCA vide communication
dated 22/02/2017 and petitioner vide letter dated 06/03/2017 in
response to said letter suggested the name of Sh. S.K Sinha,
Former ED (Law), HUDCO. However, SFCA appointed present
Sole Arbitrator, who was not even in those five names suggested

 as Arbitrators. It was argued that constitution of Arbitral Tribunal
was in the teeth of <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_51">Section 34(2)(a)</a> (iii) of the Act. It was further
argued that there was no evidence of turnover adduced by the
respondent in the Statement of Claim, yet relying upon the letter
dated 29/12/2016 of petitioner, the Arbitral Tribunal passed the
award, whereas said letter was inadmissible in law as it was in
effect the &quot;without prejudice&quot; letter. Reliance was placed upon
the cases of (i) Peacock Plywood (P) Ltd. Vs Oriential
Insurance Co. Ltd., (2006) 12 SCC 673 and (ii) Chairman And
MD, NTPC Ltd. Vs Reshmi Constructions, Builders &amp;
Contractors, (2004) 2 SCC 663. Also was argued that the Award
of Interest was in teeth of <a href="/doc/1882318/" id="a_52">Section 31</a> (3) of the Act in as much as
the Award of Interest is de hors any reasons and therefore
vitiated. It was argued that first notice was issued only on
11/05/2015, which clearly waived for pre-reference interest and
thus the period of interest can only start                                running from
11/05/2015. It was argued that the impugned arbitral award is
liable to be set aside.

<p id="p_13">13. Ld. Counsel for respondent argued that seeking re-
examination and re-evaluating of the merits of the award is not
allowed. It was also argued that requisite prior notice under
<a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_53">Section 34</a> (5) of the Act was not issued by petitioner before
filing the petition. Also was argued that Clause 11.1 of MoA
provided that the term of the contract may be renewed and
extended beyond the initial term of six years of the contract,
upon mutual consent and that the parties may review the
conditions of the said MoA one year before the expiry of said
MoA and enter into fresh agreement, if they mutually agree. Also

 was argued that Clause 11.3 of MoA also stated that the expiry of
said MoA shall not affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of
the parties as described in <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_55">Article 4 (Ownership</a><a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_56">), 5
(Confidentiality of Technical Information)</a> and <a href="/doc/531094/" id="a_57">6.2 (Royalty)</a> of
MoA. However, the parties were free to review articles one year
before the expiry of the MoA and enter into a fresh agreement, if
they mutually agree. It was also argued that the Minutes of
Meeting (MoM) dated 22/06/2011 bearing subject &quot;Renewal of
Licence for manufacturing Cationic Bitumen Emulsion by KCM
Petrotech Hyderabad&quot; records the signatures and consent of the
parties of the extension of the MoA for a further period of five
years on the same terms and conditions but with revised royalty
rate from earlier 1.5% of ex-factory basic price to the revised rate
@ 2% of ex-factory basic price plus applicable service tax. It
was argued that        the nature of Clause 11.1 has been
misrepresented, alleging it has nothing to do with the renewal of
the contract. The contract is a long term contract and due to
passage of time the conditions sometimes have to be
reconsidered to make the contract equitable due to rise in cost,
inflation etc. It was argued that MoM clearly records that both
the parties agree to the renewal of the MoA for the further period
of five years , more so on the insistence of the petitioner. It was
argued that therefore, that amounts as sufficient consent on the
part of the petitioner for renewal of the MoA and accordingly the
MoA was further renewed for five years and both the parties
acted in furtherance of the said renewal. Also was argued that the
presence of the word &quot;may&quot; was in the clause, which indicated
renewal of term of the contract was on discretion of the parties
and the parties exercised the discretion to renew the MoA. Also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">ARBTN No. 5300/<a href="/doc/116756533/" id="a_58">2018   KCM Petrotech vs. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.   Page</a> 19 of 43</span>
 was argued that by conduct the petitioner expressed its
unconditional consent for the agreement as the petitioner
continued to carry out its obligations as per the MoA from
08/07/2011 and made the payment of the royalty for the first six
months of FY 2011-12 at the said new rate as well. Also was
argued that for the period upto 31/03/2013 the petitioner had
submitted the six monthly royalty statements to the respondent
as it had done so during the initial period of six years as per the
obligations of petitioner under Clause 6.2(ii) of the MoA. Also
was argued that in paragraph 3 of the letter dated 16/11/2005 to
respondent, petitioner admitted the MoA had been extended
from 08/07/2011 to 07/07/2016. Reliance was placed upon the
case of <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_59">Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. vs The Great
Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>., MANU/SC/8036/2007. It was argued
that even if there was no consensus about arbitration clause in
the renewal agreement, a legal relationship was established
between the parties in the MoA that was signed by both the
parties which is a legally binding agreement dictating their legal
relationship. It was argued that by virtue of the conduct of
petitioner, petitioner should be estopped from negating the
validity of the Minutes of Meeting (MoM) dated 22/06/2011.
Reliance was placed upon the cases of (i) <a href="/doc/134832456/" id="a_60">Ashapura Mine-Chem

<p id="p_16">16. Normally, the general principles are that Arbitrator is a
Judge of the choice of the parties and his decision, unless there is
an error apparent on the face of the award which makes it
unsustainable, is not to be set aside even by the Court as a Court
of law could come to a different conclusion on the same facts.
The Court cannot reappraise the evidence and it is not open to the
Court to sit in appeal over the conclusion of the Arbitrator. It is
not open to the Court to set aside a finding of fact arrived at by
the Arbitrator and only grounds on which the award can be set
aside are those mentioned in the <a href="/doc/1052228/" id="a_71">Arbitration Act</a>. Where the
Arbitrator assigns cogent grounds and sufficient reasons and no
error of law or misconduct is cited, the award will not call for
interference by the Court in exercise of the power vested in it.

<p id="p_17"> Where the Arbitrator is a qualified technical person and expert,
who is competent to make assessment by taking into
consideration the technical aspects of the matter, the Court would
generally not interfere with the award passed by the Arbitrator.

Development Authority</a>, (2015) 3 SCC 49 has held that the
interference with an arbitral award is permissible only when the
findings of the arbitrator are arbitrary, capricious or perverse or
when conscience of the Court is shocked or when illegality is not
trivial but goes to the root of the matter. It is held that once it is
found that the arbitrator&#x27;s approach is neither arbitrary nor
capricious, no interference is called for on facts. The arbitrator is
ultimately a master of the quantity and quality of evidence while
drawing the arbitral award. Patent illegality must go to the root of
the matter and cannot be of trivial nature.

face of the award. A finding based on the documents taken
behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify
as a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is
not based on evidence led by the parties and therefore would also
have to be characterized as perverse. It is held that a finding

no reason in the award, question of interference of the court

the interference would still be not available within the

perversity in the award or the judgment                     is based on wrong

<p id="p_24">23. The text of letter dated 05/01/2011 of petitioner to

renewal of agreement viz. MoA and it is incorporated there the
wish of petitioner to get extended MoA for another five years
for which they sought confirmation of respondent as well as their

 acceptance to go ahead and complete the formalities. Aforesaid
letter dated 05/01/2011 laid the foundation for the deliberations,
discussions concluding with the Minutes of Meeting dated
22/06/2011 having the subject of renewal of licence for
manufacturing Cationic Bitumen Emulsion by petitioner which
was expiring on 07/07/2011 and the agreed terms have been
made vivid in preceding paras. Said Minutes of Meeting dated
22/06/2011 accordingly records the new rate of royalty of 2% of
Ex-Factory Basic Price + Service-tax as applicable from time to
time and to remain valid for five years i.e., upto 07.07.2016. If
these Minutes of Meeting dated 22/06/2011 are not considered
along with MoA and considered in isolation then one cannot
reach any logical conclusion with respect to any claim of
claimant/respondent. Further more, Minutes of Meeting dated
22/06/2011 were only brought into existence pursuant to meeting
held between the parties on the request for renewal of agreement
made vide letter dated 05/01/2011 of petitioner to respondent
elicited in detail herein above. Term 11.1 of MoA records that
MoA shall remain valid for initial period of six years and
conditions were subject to review one year before expiry of
agreement. The entire tone and tenor of MoA reflects clearly of
the intent of parties for bringing into existence long term
relationship. As elicited herein above, the term 11.3 of MoA
records that even the expiry of the agreement does not affect the
rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties inter alia
including for <a href="/doc/531094/" id="a_87">Article 6.2 (Royalty)</a> of the MoA. It also records
that parties may review <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_88">Article 4.0</a><a href="/doc/1937835/" id="a_89">, 5.0</a> and <a href="/doc/531094/" id="a_90">6.2</a> of the agreement

 prohibitory clause for the parties to the agreement making
condition precedent of entering fresh agreement after expiry of
initial period of six years of MoA, for continuing the relationship
between the parties to the agreement and renewal/extension of
the agreement.

<p id="p_25">24. Ld. Sole Arbitrator dealt with the facet of the matter
succinctly in the impugned arbitral award. He was of the opinion
that the essence and the spirit with which the process of renewal
was started and MoM dated 22/06/2011 was signed in whatever
form the parties chose makes it clear that in the given
circumstances, in absence of any other change in the terms and
conditions            of   MoA,       which          permits           use   of     same
Technology/knowhow and grant of licence thereof for extended
period of five years after 07/07/2011, natural conclusion that can
be drawn by any prudent person is that other terms and
conditions that were to govern their legal and contractual
relation post 07/07/2011 would remain unchanged. Also Ld. Sole
Arbitrator appreciated the evidence in the form of letters of
petitioner placed before him whereby the petitioner itself related
on other terms and conditions of MoA and conducted accordingly
well beyond the initial period of six years of MoA. Ld. Sole
Arbitrator also appreciated the fact that the petitioner furnished
the royalty statements for three successive six monthly periods of
01/10/2011 to 31/03/2012, 01/04/2012 to 30/09/2012 and
01/10/2012 to 31/03/2013 in addition to the part period of
08/07/2011 to 30/09/2011 after expiry of initial period of MoA.

               between the parties (other than rate of royalty) as to how to
              govern their legal relationship and conduct of performance
              under the second leg of agreement. I am of the firm view that
              all terms and conditions of the agreement (other than rate of
              royalty) post 07.07.2011, in the given situation remained the
              unaltered as was contained in the MOA dated 08/07/2005.
              This also includes Arbitration Clause under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_93">article-12.0</a> of the
              MOA as well. It would be incongruous and incomprehensible
              to accept that the Respondent continued to use and apply the

              of any agreement other than the rate of royalty. If this
              argument of the Respondent is accepted then it would lead to
              a conclusion that during the extended period there was no
              agreement on use of the Technology/Know-how owned by the
              Claimant, to maintain confidentiality thereof and when there
              is any dispute or difference between the Parties, the aggrieved
              party has to move a Civil Court and not to Arbitral Institution
              named in the MOA for resolution of such dispute. Had it been
              so, then Respondent was under no obligation to provide
              royalty statement, nor to purchase Bitumen from the Claimant
              which they did.&quot;

<p id="p_28">27. In the fact of the matter, before expiry of the initial six years
period of term of MoA, vide above referred letter dated
05/01/2011, petitioner had requested for extension of agreement
for another five years and deliberations, discussions ended with
Minutes of Meeting dated 22/06/2011, all afore elicited, before
expiry of the initial six years period of MoA, whereby the
purpose was to renew the MoA and the varied terms were made
vivid in MoM dated 22/06/2011 and it was only with respect to
the rate of royalty and nothing else and the request of petitioner
for extension of agreement period of five years was accepted.
Hyper technical approach had been adopted by the petitioner to
shirk from its responsibility of agreed terms to provide                                 to
respondent            royalty statements           after 31/03/2013 as well as
payments of royalty. After compliance of all terms of MoA and
MoM for considerable period after six years initial terms of
MoA, interpretation and view of Ld Sole Arbitrator qua
applicability of all terms of MoA excepting the varied term of
rate of royalty agreed vide MoM dated 22/06/2011, is plausible,
based on evidence led by parties and cannot be termed as
perverse or suffering from patent illegality.

<p id="p_29">28. Rule 18 of the SCFA Rules, 2003 has been reproduced in
the petition and it incorporates that the Secretary shall notify in
writing to the parties of the dispute five names from the panel

 and ask for nomination of one common name as Sole Arbitrator
within thirty days and when parties fail to nominate a common
name from the panel within the specified period from the date of
receipt of the communication from the Secretary, then Sole
Arbitrator from the panel will be appointed by the Secretary in
consultation with Vice President. True that five names from the
panel were communicated to the parties by SCFA. It is also true
that petitioner had suggested the name of Sh. S.K Sinha, Former
ED (Law), HUDCO as Sole Arbitrator vide letter dated
22/02/2017. There is no material on record that the respondent
had also asked for nomination of Sh. S.K Sinha, Former ED
(Law), HUDCO as Sole Arbitrator. So it cannot be said that the
parties to the lis nominated the common name from five names
suggested from the panel of arbitrators by SCFA. In the fact of
the matter, there was nothing wrong in appointment of Sh. A.K
Shahi as Ld. Sole Arbitrator accordingly as parties failed to
nominate a common name from five names out of the panel
suggested by SCFA. No plea was raised by the petitioner before
Ld. Sole Arbitrator, objecting of conducting of arbitral
proceedings by him. Only plea raised before Arbitral Tribunal
was with respect to existence of the arbitration clause or
applicability of MoA. In this fact of the matter, the plea of
petitioner raised for the constitution of Arbitral Tribunal in the
teeth of <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_99">Section 34(2)(a)(iii)</a> of the Act does not hold water and
is without substance.

<p id="p_31">30. Clause 6.2(v) of MoA inter alia provided of duty of
petitioner to maintain true and proper accounts with respect to
the production and sale of product in question, and the sale price
and/or royalty(ies) and such accounts were to be open for
scrutiny by any authorized representatives or auditors appointed
by respondent. Such duty cast upon petitioner was not discharged
by petitioner in the extended period, as per MoM after
31/03/2013, as the royalty statements as well as royalty payments
were not given to respondent by petitioner despite various letters
of demand of respondent. Petitioner was pestering with his
request for reduction of Royalty from 2% on basic to 0.5% OR
Rs.200/- per MT under the pretext to sustain in the competition
market and did not provide to the respondent the agreed upon
royalty statements for period after 31/03/2013 and outstanding

circumstances in which the words are used but the document
does not attract without prejudice privilege as the said letter
simply proceeds further with the pestering of petitioner of earlier
put forth request for re-consideration downward revision of
Royalty from 2% on basic to 0.5% of basic or Rs.200/- per MT
and not a genuine attempt in the negotiations to settle the dispute.
So in this fact of the matter, the pronouncement in the case of
Peacock Plywood (P) Ltd. Vs Oriential Insurance Co. Ltd.,

present case are different and distinguishable from the facts and
circumstances of the case of Chairman And MD, NTPC Ltd. Vs

<blockquote id="blockquote_77">                      (a) A Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in the
                      case of <a href="/doc/654172/" id="a_117">Secretary, Irrigation Department, Government of
                      Orissa vs G.C. Roy</a> exhaustively dealt with this very
                      issue, namely, power of the arbitral tribunal to grant pre-
                      reference and pendente lite interest. The Constitution
                      Bench, of course, construed the provision of the 1940
                      Act which Act was in vogue at that time. At the same
                      time, the Constitution Bench also considered the
                      principle for grant of interest applying the common law
                      principles. It held that under the general law, the
                      arbitrator is empowered to award interest for the pre-
                      reference, pendente lite or post award period. This
                      proposition was culled out with the following reasoning:
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_78">                           &quot;43 The question still remains whether arbitrator
                           has the power to award interest pendente lite, and
                           if so on what principle. We must reiterate that we
                           are dealing with the situation where the agreement
                           does not provide for grant of such interest nor does
                           it prohibit such grant. In other words, we are
                           dealing with a case where the agreement is silent
                           as to award of interest. On a conspectus of
                           aforementioned decisions, the following principles
                           emerge:

                           damages. This basic consideration is as valid for
                           the period the dispute is pending before the

                       arbitrator as it is for the period prior to the
                      arbitrator entering upon the reference. This is the
                      principle of <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_119">Section 34</a>, Civil Procedure Code and
                      there is no reason or principle to hold otherwise in
                      the case of arbitrator.

<blockquote id="blockquote_80">                      (ii)    An arbitrator is an alternative form (sic
                      forum) for resolution of disputes arising between
                      the parties. If so, he must have the power to decide
                      all the disputes or differences arising between the
                      parties. If the arbitrator has no power to award
                      interest pendente lite, the party claiming it would
                      have to approach the court for that purpose, even
                      though he may have obtained satisfaction in
                      respect of other claims from the arbitrator. This
                      would lead to multiplicity of proceedings.

                      him such powers and prescribe such procedure for
                      him to follow, as they think fit, so long as they are
                      not opposed to law. (The proviso to <a href="/doc/28932/" id="a_120">Section 41</a> and

                      All the same, the agreement must be in conformity
                      with law. The arbitrator must also act and make
                      his award in accordance with the general law of

                      reference makes a claim for interest, the arbitrator

                      the arbitrator to award interest pendente lite.
                      Continuity and certainty is a highly desirable
                      feature of law.

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_84">                 It is clear from the above that the Court decided to fall
                 back on general principle that a person who is deprived of
                 the use of money to which he is legitimately entitled to, has
                 a right to be compensated for the deprivation and,
                 therefore, such compensation may be called interest

<blockquote id="blockquote_85">                 (b)     As a sequitur, the arbitrator would be within his
                 jurisdiction to award pre-reference or pendente lite interest
                 even if agreement between the parties was silent as to
                 whether interest is to be awarded or not.

<blockquote id="blockquote_86">                 (c)     Conversely, if the agreement between the parties
                 specifically prohibits grant of interest, the arbitrator cannot
                 award pendente lite interest in such cases. This proposition
                 is predicated on the principles that an arbitrator is the
                 creature of an agreement and he is supposed to act and
                 make his award in accordance with the general law of the
                 land and the agreement. This position was made amply
                 clear in G.C Roy case in the discussion thereafter:

<blockquote id="blockquote_87">                      &quot;44. Having regard to the above consideration, we think
                      that the following is the correct principle which should
                      be followed in this behalf:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_88">                      Where the agreement between the parties does not
                      prohibit grant of interest and where a party claims
                      interest and that dispute (along with the claim for
                      principal amount or independently) is referred to the
                      arbitrator, he shall have the power to award interest
                      pendente lite. This is for the reason that in such a case it
                      must be presumed that interest was an implied term of
                      the agreement between the parties and therefore when
                      the parties refer all their disputes or refer the dispute as
                      to interest as such to the arbitrator, he shall have the
                      power to award interest. This does not mean that in
                      every case the arbitrator should necessarily award
                      interest pendente lite. It is a matter within his discretion
                      to be exercised in the light of all the facts and
                      circumstances of the case, keeping the ends of justice in

                 interest. However, there is a significant departure on this

interest or award of interest. Per contra, Clause 6.2 (v) of MoA
inter alia embodied the entitlement of respondent for interest
from petitioner on under payments of royalty on detection in
scrutiny, at the then current rate of interest applied by the State
Bank of India on unsecured overdraft. This is a case of non-
payment of Royalty by petitioner to respondent and not a case of
under payment of royalty, on detection in scrutiny by auditors or
authorized representatives. Also petitioner has not placed on

 record any material reflecting that the interest awarded for pre-
award period @10% was excessive of the then current rate of
interest applied by the State Bank of India on unsecured
overdraft or it was in any manner exhorbitant. In view of law laid
by Supreme Court in the cases including Jaiprakash Associates
Ltd. (supra), Reliance Cellulose Products Ltd. (supra), Sree
Kamatchi Amman Constructions (supra), <a href="/doc/17301163/" id="a_133">Union of India vs
Bright Power Projects (India) (P) Ltd</a>. (supra), <a href="/doc/1257671/" id="a_134">State of
Haryana v. S.L Arora &amp; Co</a>. (supra) and the law laid in the case
of <a href="/doc/132594/" id="a_135">Ashi Limited vs Union of India</a> (supra) by Delhi High
Court, since there was no express bar for grant of interest by Ld.
Sole Arbitrator, the impugned arbitral award does not suffer
from any illegality or perversity, as the respondent was deprived
of the use of money to which it was legitimately entitled and has
a right to be compensated for the deprivation, on the premise of
which interest was awarded in the impugned arbitral award.

<p id="p_40">38. This Court cannot substitute own evaluation of conclusion
of fact or even law to come to the conclusion other than that of
the Arbitrator. Sufficient cogent, sound reasons have been
assigned by the Ld. Sole Arbitrator in reaching his conclusion on
due appreciation of evidence and no misconduct is apparent on
the face of the record. This Court cannot re-appraise the evidence
and it is not open to this Court to sit in the appeal over the
conclusion/findings of facts arrived at by Ld. Sole Arbitrator. The
award is not against any public policy nor against the terms of
contract of the parties nor is perverse nor any patent illegality is
apparent on the face of award. None of the grounds raised by the
petitioner attract <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_136">Section 34</a> of the Act. No ground for
