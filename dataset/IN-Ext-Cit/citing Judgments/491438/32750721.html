<p id="p_2">
</p><p id="p_3">1.     Acid attack, especially on women, has seen an alarming growth in

India. Acid attack or „vitriolage‟ is often referred to as a „crime of passion‟

fuelled by jealousy and revenge. Acid throwing is the easiest way to hurt a

woman and often used as a form of revenge on refusal of sexual advances,

proposal of marriage and demands of dowry. Perpetrators of acid attacks

intend to disfigure and cause extreme physical and mental suffering to

 victims. The present appeal deals with one such unfortunate and ghastly

incident where a girl at tender age of 16 years was brutally attacked by acid.


</p><p id="p_4">2.     By way of the present appeal, the accused Naeem Khan @ Guddu

impugns the judgment dated 24.08.2009 passed in Sessions Case No. 28/09

arising out of FIR No. 74/2005 whereby the appellant along with co-accused

Rakhi has been convicted under Section 307 read with <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_1">Section 120B</a> of the

Indian Penal Code, 1860(<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_2">IPC</a>). By an order on sentence dated 15.09.2009,

for offence under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_3">Section 307</a> IPC the appellant has been sentenced to

undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine of Rs 75,000/-. In

default of payment of fine, he has to undergo simple imprisonment for one

year. For offence under <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_4">Section 120B</a> IPC, the appellant is to undergo

rigorous imprisonment for seven years and fine of Rs 5000/-. In default of

payment of fine, he has to undergo simple imprisonment for three months.


</p><p id="p_5">3.     At the outset, it is noted that co-accused Rakhi who had been

convicted by the impugned judgment has accepted her conviction on merits

before this court and the same is recorded by the Ld. Single Judge (A.K

Pathak,J.) in order the dated 26.05.2011.

                 recorded as on the said date she was suffering from intense

                 pain. However, on 25.04.2005, statement of injured Laxmi was

                 she was going towards Khan Market from her house, a

                 motorcycle stopped near her at Hanuman Road. The driver of

                 the motorcycle was wearing black coloured helmet and had a

                 lean body which was similar to that of the appellant. Laxmi

                 Laxmi‟s effort to save her by raising her hands, the acid burnt

                 her hands as well. She described the complexion of the

                 aforesaid woman to be wheatish, having a flat nose and an old

                 injury mark on the left side of the face. Laxmi stated that she

                 well with Imran, the brother of the appellant and her name was

                 either Rakhi or Rekha. On raising alarm, she fled from the scene

                 after sitting on the motorcycle driven by the appellant. On

<p id="p_9">5.     It is not in dispute that injured Laxmi was attacked by acid on the

fateful morning of 24th May, 2005. The same stands proved by medical

evidence. PW-20 Dr. Santosh Kumar proved the MLC (Ex PW-20/A) of

Laxmi. He deposed that MLC of Laxmi was prepared by Dr.Shyam Gopal

and as per the MLC she had received approximately 25% acid burns over the

face, eyes, front of chest and forearm. Laxmi was immediately referred to a

burn specialist for a surgical emergency. The nature of injures were opined

to be burn and plastic surgery.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><p id="p_11">6.     The counsel for the appellant has questioned the validity of the

impugned judgment firstly, on the ground that the name of accused-appellant

did not find mention in the initial information received by the police as

recorded in DD No. 10A (Ex PW-19/A). The name of the appellant only

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CRL.A.980/2009                                                         Page 8 of 42</span>
 cropped up once the statement of PW-1 injured Laxmi was recorded by the

police under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_10">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C on 25.04.2005, nearly three days after the

incident. In this regard, it has been urged that MLC (Ex PW-20/A) postulates

that the victim Laxmi was declared fit to tender a statement on 24.04.2005 at

about 5:00 pm but she did not deliver a statement on the said date and

instead a statement was recorded on the 25.04.2005 and therefore, there is an

enormous possibility that the name of the appellant was imputed as an

afterthought and version given by the injured Laxmi was concocted and

fabricated.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">7.      It is further submitted that statement of PW-3 Munna Lal, father of

victim Laxmi was recorded by the police on the date on which the incident

occurred but the appellant was not implicated in the same.


</p><p id="p_14">8.     I do not find any substance in the said contention raised on behalf of

the appellant. It was PW-1 Laxmi who was attacked by mysterious assailants

by pouring acid and she was best person who could have disclosed to the

police about the identity or the name of the perpetrators of the crime. PW-1

Laxmi did so on the very first opportunity which came her way when her

statement was recorded by the police on 25.04.2005 in which the appellant

and co-accused Rakhi were implicated as the authors of the gory act. It may


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CRL.A.980/2009                                                     Page 9 of 42</span>
 be true that PW-1 Laxmi refused to give her statement on 24.04.2005 when

she was declared fit by the doctor as recorded in her MLC(Ex PW-20/A).

The reason for declining to make a statement on the said date was that she

was in terrible pain because of the acid burn injuries suffered by her on her

face and chest. On perusal of the MLC, it is ostensible that Laxmi had

suffered from approximately 25% burn injuries and the part of her body

which suffered most of the brunt was her face and hands. It is believable and

in fact merits acceptance that Laxmi must have been in immense pain on

24.04.2005, just two days after the incident and was therefore, not in a

position to give her statement because of pain. In the circumstances, plight

and agony of a victim who was brutalised by an acid attack causing severe

injuries on her face and upper part of the body cannot be lost sight of. In my

opinion, reasonable explanation has been furnished by the prosecution for

not being able to record the statement of Laxmi on the date she was first

declared medically fit do so.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">9.     As regards initial statement of PW-3 Munna Lal, recorded by the

police official on 22.04.2005, it is sufficient to note that he could not have

possibly implicated the appellant at the first call as he merely recited what

was told to him by his daughter Laxmi, when he met her at the hospital in an



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CRL.A.980/2009                                                      Page 10 of 42</span>
 injured condition. From the contents of his statement, which have been noted

above, it is apparent that injured Laxmi while enumerating her story fell

unconscious mid-way and was not able to narrate about the incident in its

entirety. It is probable that the condition of Laxmi (PW-1), keeping in mind

the injuries suffered by her, soon after the incident was not sound enough so

as to enable her to narrate the entire incident in detail before her father.

accused-appellant, PW-1 Laxmi admitted that the she knew the appellant

from about two and a half years prior to the incident and he was on visiting

terms in her house. She admitted that the appellant and his family were

invited to her house for her birthday function on 1.06.2004. She denied

attending the birthday function of appellant‟s bhanja. PW-1 further admitted

that her mother before marriage practiced Muslim faith but at present she is

Hindu. PW-1 denied that her mother wanted her to marry in a muslim

family. She stated that as no proposal from her side for marriage was

extended to the appellant‟s family and hence there was no question of denial

from appellant‟s family. PW-1 admitted that at the time of the incident she

was having a love affair with Raj Kamal (PW-4) and she knew Raj Kamal

from her school days as both of them were studying in the same school.

taking place between the appellant and PW-4 Raj Kamal or that PW-4 had

beaten the appellant on any occasion. She further denied that PW-4 had

threatened to spoil her face with acid in case she keeps any contact with the

appellant. PW-1 denied that any money transaction took place between her

and PW-4 Raj Kamal. She never threatened PW-4 for any kind of pecuniary

gains.

she left her house at 10:30 am but did not remember the time when she

reached Humayun Road. She stated that the incident took place at about

10:45 am near the bus stand, Khan Market. She admitted that at the site of

the incident, the appellant and co-accused Rakhi were standing. She admitted

stating before the police officials that Rakhi put hand on her face and pushed

her on the road. PW-1 further stated that the acid was carried by co-accused

in a glass and after throwing the acid, the said glass was thrown on the road.

She stated that the motorcycle came near to her but could not remember the

exact distance. She denied the suggestion about not having seen the face of

the motor driver. PW-1 clarified that she saw the face of the appellant while

he was talking to co-accused Rakhi and the appellant was wearing a helmet

 without a visor. She admitted that said fact was not told by her to the police

as she was in a serious condition having suffered major burn injuries and

was being stated by her for the first time in cross examination. She could not

disclose the said fact to the police even thereafter as the she remained under

medical treatment for approximately 21/2 years.

statement was recorded by police. Her statement was recorded in the hospital

but she did not remember whether her family members were present at the

time of recording her statement. PW-1 admitted telling her father that acid

was thrown on her by the appellant and co-accused Rakhi. She denied that

the appellant and Rakhi were not standing and talking at the place of the

incident. She was unconscious when she reached the hospital. She admitted

that the appellant visited her at the hospital but did not remember if he had

brought food for her. She categorically denied that acid was not thrown on

her by the appellant and co-accused Rakhi.

<p id="p_24">15.    With respect to the deposition of the PW-1, it is contended on behalf

of the appellant that there are glaring and major contradictions in the

testimony of PW-1 Laxmi before the court and her statement, Ex PW1/A,

recorded by the police in the hospital. It is further submitted that the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CRL.A.980/2009                                                      Page 14 of 42</span>
 statement made by injured PW-1 before court comprises of embellishments

and an entirely new version has been introduced in the same which was not

stated by her before the police. It is pointed out that PW-1 in her statement

under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_11">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C did not mention that co-accused Rakhi had poured

acid from the glass and the same has been deposed by her in court.

Therefore, the trial court erred in placing reliance upon the testimony of sole

injured eye witness PW-1 Laxmi whose statement is shaky and unworthy of

credence.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
</p><p id="p_26">16.    With respect to identification of the appellant, it has been contended

that PW-1 Laxmi had not even seen the face of the appellant at the time of

incident as she in her statement recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_12">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C has stated

that the motorbike was driven by a person wearing a black helmet. However,

in her testimony before the court she deposed that the person driving the

motorbike was wearing a helmet but without the visor. According the

counsel for the appellant, there is marked improvement in the testimony of

PW-1 Laxmi before the court in comparison to what was stated by her soon

after the incident and hence her entire testimony is liable to be rejected on

the said premise as this shakes the core prosecution case.

with PW-1 was also not interrogated by the police.

certain that the author of the crime was the appellant. She stuck to her

statement before the court as well with conviction. Despite being subjected

to lengthy cross examination, I do not find that any major contradiction or

material improvement in her testimony before the court to what was deposed

by her before the police official has been elicited by the appellant. She

narrated the incident vividly before the police and categorically implicated

the appellant. It is probable that PW-1 might have missed to narrate finer

details as regards co-accused carrying a glass etc., before the police but the

same is acceptable as she was cruelly injured by splashing of acid and must

have been in a state of shock soon after the incident. I find her testimony

                 in material particulars can be used to discredit the

                 statement by itself would not necessarily render the
                 testimony of witness unreliable. When the version given
                 by the witness in the court is different in material
                 particulars from that disclosed in his earlier statements,
                 the case of the prosecution becomes doubtful and not
                 otherwise. Minor contradictions are bound to appear in
                 the statements of truthful witnesses as memory
                 sometimes plays false and the sense of observation differ
                 from person to person. The omissions in the earlier
                 statement if found to be of trivial details, as in the present
                 case, the same would not cause any dent in the testimony
                 of PW 2. Even if there is contradiction of statement of a

                 may render credential to the depositions. Parrot-
                 like statements are disfavoured by the courts. In
                 order to ascertain as to whether the discrepancy
                 pointed out was minor or not or the same
                 amounted to contradiction, regard is required to be
                 had to the circumstances of the case by keeping in
                 view the social status of the witnesses and
                 environment in which such witness was making
                 the statement. This Court in <a href="/doc/1969692/" id="a_33">Ousu Varghese v.

                 accounts of the witnesses are often the hallmark of
                 the truth of their testimony. <a href="/doc/1673826/" id="a_34">In Jagdish v. State of

                 this Court held that when the discrepancies were
                 comparatively of a minor character and did not go
                 to the root of the prosecution story, they need not
                 be given undue importance. Mere congruity or
                 consistency is not the sole test of truth in the
                 depositions. This Court again in <a href="/doc/1064706/" id="a_35">State of Rajasthan

                 held that in the depositions of witnesses there are
                 always normal discrepancies, however, honest and
                 truthful they may be. Such discrepancies are due to
                 normal errors of observation, normal errors of
                 memory due to lapse of time, due to mental
                 disposition such as shock and horror at the time of
                 occurrence, and the like. Material discrepancies are
                 those which are not normal, and not expected of a
                 normal person.

stated the person driving the bike looked familiar and had a lean body. She

also stated that the said driver was wearing a helmet and assuredly it was the

the first time that the driver of the bike was wearing a helmet without a visor

and therefore, she was able to see his face. When confronted with her

statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_46">Section 161</a> Cr. P. C where it was not so mentioned, PW-1

voluntarily clarified that she could not mention the said detail before the

police as she was in a serious condition and admitted stating about the same

for the first time in court as after the incident she had been under intensive

treatment for 21/2 years. In my opinion reasonable explanation has been

furnished by PW-1 for not mentioning about the visor of the helmet. It is

natural and believable that PW-1 Laxmi was in an appalling condition soon

 after the incident having received significant acid burn injuries on her face,

chest and arms and therefore, while deposing before the police she was not

able to mention all the finer details. Even if for the sake of argument, I

accept the said contention of the appellant and take into consideration only

what was deposed by PW-1 in her statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_47">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C, I find

that PW-1 had identified the appellant from the lean structure of his body as

the appellant was not a stranger to her and was continually harassing her on

account of being a dejected lover. It is worthwhile to mention that she had

seen the appellant on numerous occasions before the attack. In this regard,

the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/779495/" id="a_48">Kedar Singh and Others vs. State of Bihar</a>

the Appellants could have very well been identified by their voice, gait,

clothes, manner of speaking, etc. I find no reason to disbelieve or reject the

entire testimony of PW-1 Laxmi only on this ground as being an injured

witness it is highly unlikely that she would be spare her real culprits to

falsely implicate the appellant. Even otherwise, nothing significant has

securing their presence at the trial, I note that PW-19 SI Shiv Shanker, the

Investigating Officer, has testified in court that the road on which the

incident took place had moving traffic and about 10-20 persons were

gathered at the spot. He made enquires with the persons present but none of

them were aware about the facts barring that they had heard cries of the

victim Laxmi. However, I am not impressed with the argument by the

appellant‟s counsel. Though it is true that the incident having taken place

near the market around 10:30 am, the prosecution should have attempted to

secure public witnesses who had witnessed the incident, but at the same time

one cannot lose sight of the ground realities that members of the public are

generally insensitive and reluctant to come forward to report and depose

about a crime even though it is committed in their presence. In my opinion,

even otherwise it will be erroneous to hold that non-examination of a public

witness by itself gives rise to an adverse inference against the prosecution or

that the testimony of an injured victim, which is otherwise creditworthy,

cannot be relied upon unless corroborated by public witnesses. Furthermore,

RECOVERY AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT (Ex PW 7/C) OF
THE APPELLANT


</p><p id="p_35">24.    It is the case of the prosecution that pursuant to the arrest, the

appellant made a disclosure statement (Ex PW 7/C). Consequent thereupon,

a beer bottle (Ex P10) having stains of acid was recovered by PW-19 SI Shiv

Shanker from the bushes near children‟s park at Pandara Road. The said beer

bottle was seized vide Ex PW- 8/A and forensic examination of the same

revealed presence of Hydrochloric acid on it.
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><p id="p_37">25.    It is contended by the Counsel for the appellant that false evidence in

form of beer bottle has been planted on the appellant. It is submitted that the

appellant was arrested nearly three days after the incident i.e., on 26.04.2005

and it is highly improbable and unnatural that the appellant would not have

destroyed the same before his arrest. It is further alleged that in her statement

before police, PW-1 has not mentioned any beer bottle.


</p><p id="p_38">26.    In this regard Ld. Public Prosecutor has urged that CFSL report (Ex

PW-19/M) pertaining to beer bottle Ex P-10 clearly exposes presence of acid




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CRL.A.980/2009                                                        Page 28 of 42</span>
 traces on the same and there has been no challenge to the said FSL report by

the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><p id="p_40">27.    In my opinion, recovery of beer bottle (Ex P-10) pursuant to the

disclosure statement of the appellant is doubtful. The appellant had ample

opportunity before his arrest to destroy the bottle. It is highly suspicious that

the appellant after committing the wicked act of throwing the acid on a girl

would drop off the beer bottle at a place reasonably near the crime spot. I

take note of the fact that as per the forensic examination acid was detected

on the beer bottle but that in itself is not sufficient to establish that recovery

of beer bottle was made pursuant to the disclosure statement of the

appellant.In these circumstances, the possibility of beer bottle with acid

stains being implanted cannot be ruled out completely and hence the

recovery of the same at the instance of the appellant is disbelieved and

rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_41">
MOTIVE

</p><p id="p_42">28.    The motive behind the ghastly act is stated be spurned love and feeling

of revenge. As per the prosecution, PW-1 Laxmi was the love interest of the

appellant and when she refused the establish any kind of love relationship

with the appellant, in order to seek vengeance the appellant through co-


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CRL.A.980/2009                                                         Page 29 of 42</span>
 accused Rakhi, who was the wife of appellant‟s brother Imran, got acid

splashed on her. In a nutshell, the appellant was the architect behind the

attack on PW-1 Laxmi as he was not able to handle the refusal of his love by

her.
</p>
<p id="p_43">
</p><p id="p_44">29.    In order to establish motive, testimony of PW-I Laxmi and PW-4 Raj

Kamal is pertinent. PW-1 in her statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_50">Section 161</a> CrPC while

implicating the appellant clearly stated that acid was thrown on her by Rakhi

who acted in connivance with the appellant as PW-1 liked PW-4 Raj Kamal

and refused the marriage proposal of the appellant. A similar stand was

reiterated by her before court and therefore it emerges that repudiation by

PW-1 to marry the appellant irked him and became the motive behind the

commission of this offence.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">30.    PW- 4 Raj Kamal is stated to be the love interest of victim Laxmi. In

his testimony he admitted knowing Laxmi since 2003 as both of them were

studying in the same school. He also admitted the factum of love relation

between them however, he denied knowing the appellant. He stated that PW-

1 Laxmi had told him that the appellant also loves her. PW-4 further stated

that he had never met the appellant and he was never threatened by the

appellant. PW-4 was declared hostile as he resiled from his earlier statement.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CRL.A.980/2009                                                      Page 30 of 42</span>
</p><p id="p_47"> 31.    It has been urged by the Counsel for the appellant that PW-4 Raj

Kamal denied having been threatened by the appellant and therefore, there is

an apparent contradiction between the testimony of PW-4 Raj Kamal and

PW-1 Laxmi.
</p>
<p id="p_48">
</p><p id="p_49">32.    Though PW-4 turned hostile, his testimony corroborates the fact that

PW-1Laxmi was in love with him and both of them shared a relationship.

This lends credence to the testimony of PW-1 Laxmi that she rebuffed the

marriage proposal of the appellant for the reason that PW-4 was her romantic

interest.In view of the above, it is established beyond doubt that the appellant

bore a grudge against PW-1 Laxmi on account of rejection of his proposal

for marriage.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
CONDUCT OF THE ACCUSED



</p><p id="p_51">33.    The Learned Counsel for the Appellant has urged that conduct of the

appellant subsequent to the acid attack was inconsistent with the conduct of

an accused. It is submitted that PW-1 Laxmi has herself admitted that the

appellant came to visit her at the hospital after the incident took place and

hence if the appellant was the culprit of the crime, he would have escaped

instead of paying a visit to PW-1 Laxmi.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CRL.A.980/2009                                                       Page 31 of 42</span>
</p><p id="p_53"> 34.    I am not impressed by the said submission. It is plausible that the

appellant after committing the heinous act wanted to have a look at the

victim in order to assess the damage caused to her and whether she was in a

position to implicate him. It is a settled proposition that human behaviour

differs from person to person and it cannot be stated with certainty that a

STATEMENT OF THE APPELLANT UNDER SECTION 313 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_51">Cr.P.C</a>

</p><p id="p_55">35.    On being confronted with the incriminating circumstances, the only

explanation furnished by the appellant was that he was not involved in the

crime and was falsely implicated by PW-1 Laxmi at behest of PW-4 Raj

Kamal with whom Laxmi had developed an affair for which reason the

appellant refused to marry her. The appellant further stated PW-4 Raj Kamal

was arrested by the police on this account.
</p>
<p id="p_56">36.    PW-4 Raj Kamal in his testimony before the Court admitted the fact

the he was arrested by the police soon after the incident and was kept in

police custody for 3 days. It is clear from the testimony of PW-4 that soon

after the incident the police suspected him to be author of the crime and

therefore, he was taken in to custody. However, when the statement of PW-1


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CRL.A.980/2009                                                   Page 32 of 42</span>
 Laxmi was recorded by the police a different story emerged and it was

revealed that the appellant was behind the gruesome attack on her.

Therefore, it can safely be concluded that PW-4 was not given a clean chit

till statement of PW-1 Laxmi was recorded. Furthermore, co-accused Rakhi,

as noted above, has accepted her conviction and no evidence has appeared on

record to show that she had any link with PW-4 Raj Kamal. On the contrary,

there is substantial evidence to indicate that Rakhi was the wife of the

brother of the appellant and was connected with him. Also, nothing has

emerged in the cross examination of PW-1 Laxmi which proves that the

appellant was being falsely implicated. It is, in my opinion, extremely

difficult to believe that PW-1 Laxmi would spare her real assailant and

falsely implicate the name of the appellant as the person who had thrown

acid on her. It also does not appeal to reason that PW-4 Raj Kamal would

throw acid on his love interest Laxmi so as to disfigure her face in such an

inhuman manner.
</p>
<p id="p_57">
</p><p id="p_58">37.    In view of the aforesaid discussion, on the basis of cogent and reliable

testimony of injured eye-witness Laxmi, I find that the appellant in

conspiracy with co-accused Rakhi is guilty of throwing acid on victim

Laxmi and thereby causing her grievous injuries.

</p><p id="p_60"> 38.    The only question which remains to be answered is whether the

conviction of the appellant under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_52">Section 307</a> IPC can be sustained.

Furthermore, depending upon the finding of offence committed, quantum of

sentence imposed upon the petitioner also needs to be considered.


</p><p id="p_61">39.    The Counsel for the appellant has urged that the appellant did not have

either the intention or knowledge to cause death of victim Laxmi and hence

charge under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_53">Section 307</a> IPC for attempt to murder cannot be sustained

against the appellant. It is contended that in the absence of medical evidence

showing that throwing acid on face and eyes of the injured would have

caused death, proper conviction would be under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_54">Section 326</a> of IPC and not

under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_55">Section 307</a> of IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_62">
</p><p id="p_63">40.    On the aspect of sentencing, it is alternatively submitted that even if

the conviction of the appellant is upheld under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_56">Section 307</a> IPC, the trial

court erred in imposing 10 year of rigorous imprisonment on the appellant as

it was co-accused Rakhi who poured acid on the victim and not the

appellant. The appellant is a young offender and the possibility of

reformation cannot be ignored and therefore, leniency may be shown on the

quantum of sentence.

acid was thrown on a person observed:-

<blockquote id="blockquote_42">                 "To justify a conviction under this section it is not
                 essential that bodily injury capable of causing death
                 should have been inflicted. Although the nature of injury
                 actually caused may often give considerable assistance in
                 coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused,
                 such intention may also be deduced from other
                 circumstances, and may even, in some cases, be
                 ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds.
                 The section makes a distinction between an act of the
                 accused and its result, if any. Such an act may not be
                 attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is
                 concerned, but still there may be cases in which the
                 culprit would be liable under this section. It is not
                 necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of
                 the assault should be sufficient under ordinary
                 circumstances to cause the death of the person assaulted.
                 What the Court has to see is whether the act, irrespective
                 of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge
                 and under circumstances mentioned in this section. An

                  penultimate act. It is sufficient in law, if there is present

all the ingredients of offence of murder are present, except the death of the

victim, As such, where the ingredients of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_60">Section 300</a> of IPC are lacking in

the case, accused cannot be convicted under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_61">Section 307</a> of IPC. It is also

injury capable of causing death should have been acutely inflicted. <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_63">Section

and whether or not by his act, he intended to cause death which would

amount to murder as defined in <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_64">Section 300</a> IPC. It depends upon the facts

and circumstances of each case whether the accused had the intention to

cause death or knew in the circumstances that his act was going to cause

death. The nature of weapon used, the intention expressed by the accused at

the time of the act, the motive, the nature and size of the injuries, the parts of

the body of the victim where injuries were caused and the severity of the

blow or blows are also relevant factors to find out intention/ knowledge.

<p id="p_66"> 43.    In the instant case, the appellant was frustrated and anguished on

refusal of his love by victim Laxmi and had through his close associate got

hydrochloric acid poured mercilessly on the face and chest of the victim. The

act was a calculated and pre-planned one as he had roped in Rakhi to do the

job. That the consequence of pouring Hydrochloric acid on the head is likely

to cause death must be known to him or can be inferred and as such in my

view, the offence clearly falls under the category of attempt to murder

punishable under <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_65">Section 307</a> of IPC and not under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_66">Section 326</a> of IPC. Even

otherwise, this Court cannot shut its eyes to obnoxious and growing

tendency of young persons like accused resorting to the use of corrosive

substances like acid for throwing on girls, causing not only severe physical

damage but also mental trauma to young girls and such practices have to be

curbed with heavy hands. In most of the cases the victim dies because of

severe burns or even septicemia or even if luckily survives, it will only be a

grotesque disfigured person.
</p>
<p id="p_67">44.    In view of the above discussion, the appellant is guilty of an offence

punishable under<a href="/doc/1439698/" id="a_67"> s. 307IPC</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_68">45.     Adverting to the question of quantum of punishment, it is worthwhile

to state that justice demands that the Courts should impose punishment

befitting the crime so that the Courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">CRL.A.980/2009                                                      Page 37 of 42</span>
 The Court must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal but also the

rights of the victim of the crime and the society at large while considering

the imposition of appropriate punishment.
</p>
<p id="p_69">46.    The victim Laxmi, in the instant case, was at a very tender age of 16

years when one rash and dreadful act of the appellant disrupted her entire

normal life causing her and her family immense physical and mental trauma.

By one stroke the appellant has made her face hideous and victim Laxmi has

to live with this physical and mental injury all her life for no fault of hers.

One has to consider the plight of the poor parents who would have been

broken seeing the mangled face of their beloved daughter. It is high time that

such acts are rewarded with commensurate punishment.

</p><p id="p_70">47.    In the facts of present case, I feel that that the punishment imposed by

the trial court is appropriate and there is no scope for any leniency to be

shown towards the dastardly act committed at the behest of the appellant.

COMPENSATION

</p><p id="p_71">48.    The learned Counsel for the appellant has submitted that at the stage

of seeking interim bail compensation to the tune of Rs.1 lakh was offered to

the victim from the side of the appellant on account of medical expenses and

surgeries. However, the same had been rejected by the victim.

</p><p id="p_72"> 49.    While hearing the final arguments, another effort was made by me to

compensate the victim from the side of the appellant. The learned Counsel

appearing on behalf of the victim Laxmi has again refused to the same. She

has submitted that the victim does not want to receive any money from the

appellant. She further submitted that on account of the acid attack, the entire

face of the victim has been badly distorted and she has been subjected to

repeated medical treatment/ plastic surgeries on which huge sum of money

has been spent.

                 disclosed by recording reasons for awarding/refusing

                  involving application of mind, the Court ought to have
                 the necessary material which it would evaluate to arrive
                 at a fair and reasonable conclusion. It is also beyond
                 dispute that the occasion to consider the question of
                 award of compensation would logically arise only after
                 the court records a conviction of the accused. Capacity of
                 the accused to pay which constitutes an important aspect
                 of any order under <a href="/doc/1705664/" id="a_71">Section 357</a> CrPC would involve a
                 certain enquiry albeit summary unless of course the facts
                 as emerging in the course of the trial are so clear that the
                 court considers it unnecessary to do so. Such an enquiry
                 can precede an order on sentence to enable the court to
                 take a view, both on the question of sentence and
                 compensation that it may in its wisdom decide to award
