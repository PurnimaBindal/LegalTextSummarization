            456 meters in length in the year 2000. The length of the

            jetty was subsequently increased by further 592 meters in

            the year 2009. These jetties were shallow draft, i.e. for the

            movement of barges and mini bulk carriers. In the year

            2005, as there was no facility for direct berthing of vessel,

            the said Company decided to undertake dredging of the

            channel so as to enable the direct berthing for larger

            vessels, leading to larger inflow of ships and raw materials.

            To develop the new port facility, including construction of

            deep draft jetty of 550 mts, dredging of new approach

            channel, storage and handling facilities etc., the Company

            set up a new organization/SPV by the name of Essar Bulk

            Terminal Limited ("EBTL" for short), i.e. the 1st petitioner

            herein, and the said organization/SPV was incorporated on

            21.11.2006.

            Development of Green Field Site Port Facilities in the State

            of Gujarat, through the process of competitive bidding. In

            the said process of competitive bidding, it has selected a

            consortium led by Shell Gas BV to develop, operate and

            maintain the port on a Boot basis, and a letter of intent

            dated 12.11.1999 was issued in favour of Shell Gas BV. Shell

            Gas BV formed two subsidiary companies in Gujarat,

            namely, Hazira Port Private Limited ("HPPL") and Hazira LNG

            Private Limited for the aforesaid purpose. Subsequently, a

            Concession Agreement dated 22.4.2002 was entered into

            operation and maintenance of certain facilities by the HPPL

            in Hazira Port. Subsequently, an addendum                        to the said

            Concession Agreement was made on 22.6.2004, wherein, it

            was agreed that the State Government would issue a

            notification   defining the limits of Hazira Port under the

            provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_5">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908. Pursuant to such

            with Sub Concessionaire, i.e. the 4th respondent company,

            has been developing various facilities in the area given to

            them in the limits of Hazira Port. It is the case of the

            petitioner that the operations of the 3rd respondent company

            for Bulk Cargo are fully functional from the year 2012.

         3.5.   After the formation of the 1st petitioner company as

            Special Purpose Vehicle for the purpose of Essar Steel and

            after its decision to construct deep draft captive jetty of 550

            meters and the dredging of new approach channel, etc., an

            by 400 meters for direct berthing of deep draft vessels along

            with      allotment of backup land. By further letter dated

            26.5.2006, the 1st petitioner company sought an extension

            of 550 meters of waterfront instead of 400 meters. Pursuant

            to such request, the State of Gujarat, by letter dated

            11.10.2006,       addressed       to      the     2nd     respondent-Gujarat

            meters of waterfront and                28 Hectares of backup land in

            favour of the 1st petitioner company. Further, by letter dated

            13.10.2006, the 1st petitioner reiterated its request for 550

            Gujarat Summit, between the 1st petitioner and the State

            Government for the development of deep water port and

            allied activities. The request of the 1st petitioner-EBTL for

            additional 150 meters of waterfront in addition to 400

            meters already allotted, was approved by the State

            Government vide letter 24.7.2007 which was addressed to

            the 2nd respondent-Board. Accordingly, the 2nd respondent-

            Board informed the 1st petitioner company about the

            allotment vide letter dated 6.9.2007. On 11.10.2007, the

<p id="p_19">         3.6.     On 29.8.2007, the promoter of the Essar Group wrote to

            the 2nd respondent-Board for allotment of 1800 meters of

            waterfront and 350 Hectares of backup area for extension of

            captive jetty. It was their case               that out of 1800 meters

            waterfront as proposed, 700 meters area was to be utilized

            for development of 350 meters of common user dry cargo

            port and 350 meters of Ro-Ro jetty to be created through a

            Joint Venture between the EBTL and the 2nd respondent-

            another letter to the 2nd respondent, requesting to grant in-

            principle approval for allotment of 1100 meters of waterfront

            for extension of captive jetty. It also appears that there was

            Vibrant Gujarat Summit, 2011. The said request dated

            26.2.2008 was            also considered and finally, the 2nd

            respondent granted in-principle approval to the 1st petitioner

            for construction of 1100 meters of                    waterfront. The final

            approval for construction of 1100 meters of waterfront was

         3.7.   On 15.11.2012, the 1st petitioner-EBTL sought permission

            from the 2nd respondent for further allotment of 3700 meters

            of waterfront, reclamation of 334 Hectares and dredging of

            channel to 16 meters' depth. There was also another MOU

            during the Vibrant Gujarat Summit on 11th January 2013

            executed between the EBTL and the State Government for

            development of a waterfront of 3000 meters. On 2.3.2007,

            the EBTL wrote a letter to the 2nd respondent-Board, seeking

            No Objection Certificate for dumping                dredged material in

            350 hectares of mudflat area. The said No Objection

            Certificate was granted by the 2nd respondent to the EBTL

</p>
<p id="p_21">         3.8.   Thereafter, the    1st petitioner company also seems to

            have addressed a letter to the Collector, Surat, to permit it

            to dump the dredged material in the mudflat area of 350

            Hectares. It is the case of the petitioners that they could

            Hectares for which No Objection Certificate was granted by

            2.7.2007 was addressed by the Essar Group for allotment of

            350 Hectares (186 + 164 Hectares) of mudflat land in favour

            of the petitioners. It further appears that on 10.11.2009, a

            meeting was held under the Chairmanship of the Chief

            Secretary to the State Government and the Government has

            approved the allotment of 170 Hectares of backup land in

            favour of the 1st petitioner company. Further, on 25.2.2010,

            Essar Group wrote a letter to the 2nd respondent, seeking

            allotment of 186 Hectares of land already reclaimed by the

            EBTL pursuant to No Objection Certificate issued by the 2nd

            respondent. Letter dated 5.5.2010 was also addressed by

            allot 319 Hectares of reclaimed land on a token lease rent

            basis, since the 1st petitioner company had undertaken to

            invest a colossal sum of Rs. 1500 Crores. It is the case of

            reminders for allotment of additional land for dredging and

            reclamation, the State Government has not allotted the land

            with corresponding backup area of 567 Hectares (233

            Hectares + 334 Hectares) has remained pending. Precisely,

            it is the case of the petitioners that though there were

            requests for allotment of 3700 meters of waterfront and

            backup area of 567 Hectares, the same have remained

            pending for the last several years though various assurances

            were given by the authorities of the State Government and

            the 2nd respondent, and the Memorandums of Understanding

            were entered into by the petitioners with the State

            Government, and in spite of making investment of about Rs.

            1500 Crores by the petitioners, no steps were taken by the

            respondents. It is the further case of the petitioners that the

            3rd respondent-HPPL, vide letter dated 21.7.2014, by citing

            navigational issues, requested for amendment/extension of

            the limits of Hazira Port. It was stated therein that such

            proposal did not encroach upon                 the areas where the

            petitioners were reclaiming the land and developing the

            waterfront in the limits of the Magdalla Port. On 14.3.2015,

            another letter was written to the 2nd respondent by the 3rd

            respondent-HPPL, revising the request for amending the port

            limits by citing the need for additional backup area for

            meeting with the additional cargo arrival at the port on

            account of extension of berthing facilities. Such revised

            petitioners were reclaiming the land and developing the

            the request of the petitioners for extension of the waterfront

            and reclaiming the land was pending, the 2nd respondent has

            passed         a   Resolution    dated       19.3.2005,         approving         the

            proposal for extension of Hazira Port limits. It is the further

            grievance of the petitioners that though the application of

            the     petitioners     for     extension        of    the     waterfront        and

            reclamation of land was pending for the last several years,

            which are earlier in point of time to that of 3rd respondent, in

            utter disregard to the request of the petitioners and in

            arbitrary and illegal manner, the proposal of the 3rd

            respondent-HPPL was approved. Immediately after the

            approval was granted by the 2nd respondent in favour of the

            the grievance of the petitioners in the representation dated

            7.5.2015, that new proposal for extension of the port limits

            would encroach upon the entire waterfront and the backup

            land for which the petitioners were patiently waiting for the

            approvals and had invested more than Rs. 1500 crores,

            based on the assurances given by the State Government

            and the 2nd respondent. It is the case of the petitioners that

            vide Resolution No. 3091 dated 28.9.2015, the earlier

            Resolution was amended and it was resolved to send a

            proposal to the Government to extend the port limits, and in

            spite of the same, based on a convoluted note circulated by

            the higher authorities of the State Government on the

            proposal dated 14.3.2015, the State Government has issued

            the impugned Notification, extending the port limits of the

            HPPL, 3rd respondent, in a manner infringing upon the

            Magdalla       Port limits and encroaching upon the land

<p id="p_23">         3.10. According to the petitioners, the impugned Notification,

            extending the limits of Hazira Port, infringing upon the

            Magdalla Port limits,       has encroached upon the land

            reclaimed and the waterfront created by the 1st petitioner-

            petitioners at Magdalla Port by investing substantial time

            and resources, which includes colossal investment of more

            than Rs. 1500 Crores. Such investment was made by the 1st

            petitioner-EBTL on the basis of various assurances given by

            the      State Government/2nd respondent-Gujarat Maritime

            Board from time to time, which led the EBTL to believe that

            necessary approvals of allotment would be sanctioned in its

            favour sooner or later. It is the case of the petitioners that

            the impugned Notification, if it is allowed to stand, would

            amount to usurping the development made by the 1st

            petitioner-EBTL with regard to the reclamation of land and

            development of the waterfront. It is the further case of the

            petitioners that the impugned Notification for extension of

            the port limits of Hazira would result in indirectly allowing

            the HPPL to extend its activities in the extended port area

            without bidding and therefore, the State cannot distribute

            public largess as it amounts to unduly favouring 3rd and 4th

            respondents. According to the petitioners, the impugned

            Notification amounts to allowing 3rd and 4th respondents to

            enjoy all infrastructure created and developed by the

            petitioners thereon, contrary to the assurances given by the

            State Government and the 2nd respondent for extension of

            the waterfront of the petitioners, and also the land for

            reclamation.     Such impugned Notification was issued

            arbitrarily and in violation of principles of natural justice, as

            the same is not based on any notice of opportunity of

            hearing to the petitioners or the stakeholders in Magdalla

            Port, who will be gravely prejudiced by the extension of the

            port limits under the impugned Notification. It is also the

            case of the petitioners that the impugned Notification was

            issued in gross violation of statutory powers, inasmuch as

            there is no power under the Act to amend the port limits in a

            manner which encroaches upon the limits of another Port. In

            the instant case, the amended limits of Hazira Port coincide

            with the limits of the Magdalla Port. It is also the case of the

            petitioners that the proposal made by the 3rd and the 4th

            respondents was approved in a short span of time and in

            undue haste.     As    stated in the petition, though                         the

            Government has got statutory powers to alter the port

            limits, the same cannot be done in utter disregard to the

            principles of fairness, reasonableness and transparency. It is

            the case of the petitioners that in view of the No Objection

            Certificate issued by the 2nd respondent for reclaiming and

            dumping the dredged material in 319 Hectares of land, and

            in view of the necessary clearances of the CRZ authority as

            well as Ministry of Environment and Forests, for dredging of

            around 334 Hectares of land, which includes the area now

            covered by Hazira Port limits, if the impugned Notification is

            allowed to stand, it will cause irreparable loss to the

            petitioners. Finally, it is averred that the 2nd respondent has

</p><p id="p_24">         4. On behalf of the 1st respondent-State of Gujarat, affidavit in

           reply is filed by the Under Secretary, Ports and Transport

           Department. Before adverting to the allegations made by the

           petitioners in the petition, the objects of the Port Policy of 1995

           formulated by the State are highlighted by the deponent.

           4.1.   It is stated that the State Government has proposed the

              private investment in the existing            minor and intermediate

              ports, including the Port at Hazira. As stated in the reply, it

              was envisaged that Hazira Port would be privatized through

              a global tendering process and the 2nd respondent-Board

              was interested in doing           a preliminary techno-economic

              feasibility report of all the locations, including Hazira Port.

              The Port Policy also provides that to ensure that the new

              port projects are financially viable, permissions for captive

              jetties would be given only in exceptional cases, looking to

              the quantum of investment and the need for specialized

              facilities. Reference is also made to the BOOT Policy (Build-

              Own-Operate-Transfer Policy) of the Government of Gujarat.

              It is stated that the said Policy provides that the Government

              is vested with the sovereign rights as owner, overseer and

              conservator of the waterfront and the licensor to the

              contract. The BOOT Policy             provides for expansion of the

            facilities and it also provides that the developers would be

            encouraged to add capacity contracted in the Concession

            Agreement. The BOOT Policy also provides that at the time

            of signing of the Concession Agreement, the developer will

            submit and get approved by the 2nd respondent, a broad

            perspective plan for the development of the port in the next

            15    to       20   years.     It   further      provides        that     the     State

            Government will not place restrictions on any expansion and

            further development of the port, within the envisaged

            perspective plan, subject to statutory clearances and the

            expansion outside the scope of the plan would be subject to

            the approval of the 2nd respondent-Board. This Policy further

            provides that permission to set up captive jetties would not

            be granted, save in exceptional circumstances.

         4.2.    Pursuant to such Policy, in August 1997, the 2nd

            respondent-Board issued Global Notice for Expression of

            Intention of Interest for Development of Green-Field Site Port

            Facilities, which, inter alia, includes the development of

            Hazira Port. Pursuant to a consortium led by M/s. Shell Gas

            BV, 3rd respondent-HPPL was elected as a successful bidder

            and a Concession Agreement was signed between the State

            of Gujarat, the 2nd respondent-Board and Hazira Port Private

            Limited on 22.4.2002, and the said Concession Agreement

            provides for development of port facilities in the initial Phase

            1A i.e LNG terminal and Phase 1B for non-LNG Cargo meant

            for Bulk General Cargo Terminal and also in the subsequent

            phases, as may be approved in the detailed Project Report

            by the 2nd respondent-Board. Under the provisions of the

            <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_6">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908, the Government is vested with the

            powers to define and/or alter the port limits within its

            jurisdiction. It is stated that when the tender was floated by

            the 2nd respondent-Board, or at the time of signing of the

            Concession Agreement on 22.4.2002, the limits of Hazira

            Port were not notified and the area was part of the adjoining

            Magdalla        Port    limits.        In     October,       2004,        the     State

            Government carved out from Magdalla Port, the limits of

            Hazira Port and issued a Notification, notifying the limits of

            Hazira Port. Thereafter, the limits of Hazira Port were revised

            in March, 2010 and the request of 3rd respondent, to have

            the 4th respondent, i.e. Adani Hazira Port Private Limited as a

            Concessionaire for non-LNG cargo, came to be                               accepted.

            Subsequently, the 3rd respondent                         vide its letter dated

            21.7.2014 requested for extension of the limits of Hazira

            Port only on seaward side,                     and the said proposal was

            revised by the letter dated 14.3.2015, inter alia, requesting

            for extension of the port limits for backup area also, while

            stating        that    the      issues         pertaining        to     navigational

            requirements would still continue, besides other issues being

            faced by the sub-concessionaire, i.e. the 4th respondent. It

            commissioned 5 berths of the Bulk General Cargo Terminal

            (BGCT) at Hazira Port and the current capacity of the Port

            stood at 35 MMTPA with a backup area of approximately 250

            Hectares of reclaimed land. It was also declared that

            presently, the Port is receiving about 55 vessels a month

            and the number of vessels calling are increasing at a rapid

            rate. It is stated that in view of the advantages of

            navigational safety and security, and taking into account the

            change         for   business    need       and      additional        scope         of

            requested for revision in limits of Hazira Port as proposed on

            14.3.2015. It is stated that the said revised proposal dated

            14.3.2015 by the 3rd respondent was considered by the 2nd

            respondent-Board in its 240th meeting held on 19.3.2015 and

            respondent as tendered on 14.3.2015, was submitted to the

            thereafter, apropos the meeting of the officers of the 1st

            petitioner,     reiterating       the      grievance         raised       in     the

            representation dated 7.4.2015, the 1st respondent State,

            vide its letter dated 26.8,2015, addressed to the 2nd

            respondent, once again              directed to take up the matter

            relating to extension of the limits of Hazira Port in the Board

            meeting of the 2nd respondent, and after discussing the

            same, to send its opinion to the State government and again

            the proposal for extension of port limits was placed in 243rd

            Board meeting held on 28.9.2015. Referring to the Agenda

            be passed in the said meeting something different from the

            Agenda, i.e. the approval of earlier proposal dated 21.7.2014

            for extension of the port limits only for seaward side, though

            the 2nd respondent-Board already approved the revised

            proposal dated 14.3.2015 of 3rd respondent in its 240th

            meeting held on 19.3.2015. After considering the said

            Resolution, the 1st respondent-State, vide letter dated

            11.12.2015,     addressed         to     the     2nd    respondent-Board,

            conveyed that it has been decided to approve the extension

            of the limits of Hazira Port. It is further stated in the affidavit

            in reply that decision was taken to approve the extension of

            limits of Hazira Port in such a manner that it does not impact

            the     waterfront   area    of    1100        meters        and     the      land

            admeasuring 140 Hectares came to be resolved to be

            allotted to the 1st petitioner. It is stated that if the aforesaid

            two elements are excluded from the revision in the port

            limits proposed by the 3rd respondent in the proposal dated

            14.3.2015, there would not be any encroachment or

            overlapping over the area proposed to be allotted to the 1st

            petitioner. At the same time, it is pleaded that it is not out of

            place to mention that the State Government is empowered

            under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_7">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908, to take a

            decision notifying/altering the limits of any Port within the

            and all agreements executed thereunder, it is pleaded that

            the 3rd and 4th respondents are entitled to seek expansion of

            the Port facilities.
</p>
<p id="p_26">         4.4.   Without prejudice to the aforesaid contentions as pleaded

            in the affidavit in reply, it is the case of the 1st respondent

            that there was no private commercial port near Hazira in

            Surat, and the limits of Magdalla Port was notified, which,

            inter alia, included a port run by the 2nd respondent-Board at

            Magdalla and the captive jetties in the surrounding area. The

            State Government is well within its power to alter the port

            limits and is statutorily empowered to extend the limits of

            Hazira Port, and to reduce the limits of Magdalla Port

            accordingly. So far as the 1st petitioner is concerned, it was

            permitted to set up a captive jetty, which is a part of larger

            limits of Magdalla Port. The captive jetty, developed and

            operated by the 1st petitioner is not a commercial port set up

            pursuant to competitive bidding and the 1st petitioner has no

            right to question the action of the 1st respondent-State as

            none of the rights of the petitioners is violated. It is stated

            that the petitioners have no vested right in the limits of

            Magdalla Port and they are concerned with their captive

            jetty only. The 1st petitioner is not running a private

            commercial     multi-user       port,     set     up     pursuant        to    the

            competitive bidding and no separate port limits are even

            notified for this purpose and, therefore, it is pleaded that the

            petitioners have no right to question the power of the State

            Government of altering the limits of Hazira and Magdalla

            ports.
</p>
<p id="p_27">         4.5. The petitioners have claimed that the 1st petitioner was

            allocated 3700 meters of waterfront additionally for setting

            up     various   captive   and         commercial        cargo      terminals,

            including the containers. With reference to the same, it is

            stated that pursuant to international competitive bidding,

            the 2nd respondent-Board, 3rd respondent-Hazira Port

            Private Limited and the 1st respondent-State of Gujarat

            entered into an agreement on 22.4.2002, for development of

            LNG terminal and Bulk General Cargo facilities at Hazira,

            and such agreement prohibits the construction of captive

            jetty for LNG or container handling or related activities along

            150 kms coast along Hazira Port. Therefore, the application

            of the 1st petitioner, requesting for 3700 meters of

            waterfront and the land for the purpose of LNG terminal has

            no merit and cannot be entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_28">         4.6. It is stated that the petitioners are trying to create

            confusion by mixing up their application for 3700 meters of

            waterfront for development of other facilities with their

            requirement of captive jetty as originally granted. By

            referring to such condition in the Port Policy of 1995, it is

            categorically stated that permission for setting up of captive

            jetty or expansion thereof cannot be granted as a matter of

            course. The 1st petitioner has been granted permission to

            set up a captive jetty for extension thereof from time to time

            for exclusive use by the 1st petitioner. Reference is made to

            the provision under section 8 of the Gujarat Infrastructure

            Development Act, 1999, which provides that a Concession

            Agreement can be entered into with a person who is

            selected through a competitive bidding as provided under

            <a href="/doc/308494/" id="a_8">section 9</a> of the Act, or by negotiations as provided under

            <a href="/doc/1649350/" id="a_9">section 10</a> thereof. As the 1st petitioner is not a competitive

            bidder, it is not entitled for 3700 meters of waterfront and

            adjacent land as claimed by it. Therefore, it is stated that

            the 1st petitioner cannot seek extension of captive jetty for

            third party use beyond the petitioners' own cargo, and

            therefore, the request of the petitioners for                 allotment of

            3700 meters of waterfront cannot be accepted.

         4.7.   The petitioners have based their case entirely on the

            assumption that by permitting the 1st petitioner to dump

            the dredged material on 319 Hectares of land except 67

            Hectares of land allotted to 3rd respondent and pursuant to

            deepening of the channel, a right is created in favour of the

            1st petitioner and therefore, no one can be allotted such

            land. With reference to the said allegation, it is submitted

            by the 1st respondent that the 2nd respondent-Board, in its

            letter dated 14.6.2007, has categorically stated that, "the

            ownership of reclaimed land shall vest with the Government

            of Gujarat/Gujarat Maritime Board". Thus, the 1st petitioner

            cannot claim any right over the said land.
</p>
<p id="p_29">         4.8.   Though the 1st petitioner was given No Objection

            Certificate to reclaim 319.86 Hectares of land at a particular

            location except 67 Hectares of land allotted to 3rd

            respondent, the 1st petitioner actually reclaimed only 195

            Hectares of land pursuant to No Objection Certificate issued

            by the 2nd respondent-Board on 14.6.2007. Any reclamation

            carried out by the 1st petitioner at any location other than

            195 Hectares of land was not permitted by the 2nd

            respondent-Board    at     any       time.     Even      otherwise,         the

            petitioners cannot assume any right in respect of the land

            reclaimed by the 1st petitioner, other than 195 Hectares of

            land. In respect of 195 Hectares of land, the 2nd respondent-

            Board has resolved to allot about 140 Hectares of land to the

            1st petitioner and reserve about 55 Hectares of land for the

            2nd respondent-Board for future projects and, therefore, out

            of 195 Hectares of land, 140 Hectares of land was already

            allotted to the 1st petitioner and about 55 Hectares of land

            was reserved for the 2nd respondent for future projects.

            Therefore, the claim of the petitioners that, the land

            reclaimed by the 1st petitioner is allotted to someone else is

            frivolous and without any basis. With the aforesaid pleas, it

            is prayed that in the absence of any right in favour of the

            petitioners, the petition may be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_30">         5. Separate affidavit in reply is filed on behalf of the 2nd

           respondent-Gujarat Maritime Board. In the affidavit in reply, the

           case as pleaded by the 2nd respondent is as under:

           5.1. In the affidavit in reply filed on behalf of the 2nd

              respondent-Board, preliminary objection is raised with

              regard to the maintainability of the petition itself. What is

              challenged in the petition is the Notification dated 18th

              January 2016 issued by the State Government, by which the

              limits of Hazira Port were altered, which has nothing to do

              with the approval granted by the State Government

              authorities to the request of the petitioners to consider and

              grant necessary approval for allotment of 3700 meters of

              waterfront and      the land admeasuring 567 Hectares

              reclaimed and sought to be reclaimed by the petitioners for

              allotment of the land and the waterfront for LNG facilities.

              The application of the 1st petitioner, which is filed under the

              Captive Jetty Policy, and the one submitted by 3rd and 4th

              respondents under the Port Policy, operate in different realm

              and in the absence of any merits, the petition is not

              maintainable. As per section 2(r) of the Gujarat Maritime

              Board Act, 1981, "port" means any minor port to which the

              Act applies within such limits as may from time to time be

              defined by the State Government under the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_10">Indian Ports Act</a>,

              1908. The petitioners are operating captive jetty, which is

              not a commercial port and the captive jetty                            of the

            petitioners is a part of Magdalla Port, which is not owned or

            operated by the petitioners. Referring to the Port Policy of

            1995 and the BOOT Policy of 1997 of the Government,

            various provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_11">Indian Ports Act</a> and the Gujarat

            Maritime Board Act, 1981, it is stated that the limits of Ports

            are changed at different times, and therefore, it is not

            necessary to refer in detail such contention which relates to

            BOOT Policy, Port Policy and the rights given to the

            petitioners under the captive jetty for the purpose of starting

            captive jetty. It is averred that both the applications, one for

            expansion of captive jetty and the other of the 3rd and the 4th

            respondents for the port development plan, operate in

            different realm and they are not comparable. What is

            granted to the petitioners is a captive jetty for handling of

            their raw material for captive consumption for their steel

            plant under the captive jetty policy; whereas the project of

            development of the port granted to 3rd respondent                                is

            pertaining to the Port Policy announced by the Government

            of Gujarat in the year 1995 and the BOOT Policy announced

            in the year 1997 to develop the Greenfield                     Port through

            private participation of the private entrepreneurs in the

            State of Gujarat. In the circumstances, the whole foundation

            sought to be laid by the petitioners is absolutely without any

            substance and there is no comparison between the two

            applications. By referring to the global tender floated by the

            2nd respondent, it is stated that pursuant to such tender

            notice, 3rd respondent became successful bidder at the end

            of the tender procedure and a Concession Agreement for

            Port was executed by and between the parties for a period

            of 30 years wherein it is specifically provided that there

            would be amendments to the port limits as and when the

            need arises and thus,          the contract executed by and

            between the parties, cannot be said to be violative of the

            rights of the petitioners under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> of the Constitution

            of India. It is stated that any successful bidder could have

            got the contract on the same terms on which 3rd respondent

            was granted at the relevant time.
</p>
<p id="p_31">         5.2.   The 1st petitioner company was granted permission for

            the construction of captive jetty for its steel plant and for

            dumping the dredged material in the nearby area only with

            a view that it will have the dual benefits, i.e. the Essar may

            save its costs to dump the dredged material at a distant

            place and consequently, the waterfront over which the

            material is allowed to be dumped will be incidentally

            reclaimed, and thus, keeping this dual benefits in mind, the

            2nd respondent having found the request of the petitioners

            in mutual benefit, granted such permission and the present

            extended port limits include a portion thereof. When such

            to have been heard before issuance of the impugned

            Notification and passing of the Resolution by the Board, it is

            averred that the 1st petitioner has no locus and therefore, it

            cannot be termed as a stakeholder by any stretch of

            imagination, and no right is created in favour of the

            petitioners and, therefore, it cannot be termed as an

            aggrieved party so as to pray for grant of opportunity. With

            reference to the allegation of the                    petitioners that the

            impugned Notification was issued without conducting any

            inquiry and giving an opportunity of hearing, it is stated that

            the documents produced by the petitioners themselves

            clearly demonstrate that the Government has considered

            the aspects related to extension vis-a-vis the interest of the

            petitioners who are already having captive jetty in Magdalla

            Port area and the balance has been struck by providing

            ample backup land to the petitioners to cater to their own

            requirements to run the captive jetty, and the Government

            has also considered the development of Hazira Port for

            which Concession Agreement has been executed by and

              between the parties. The 1st petitioner company herein is

              operating its captive jetty in Magdalla Port and the said

              captive jetty and its cargo are not commercial in nature and

              the 1st petitioner (EBTL) has been awarded the construction

              of 1100 meters of berth on 23.9.2015 and 140 Hectares of

              reclaimed land out of       195 Hectares of the land. The 2nd

              respondent never permitted the petitioners to reclaim any

              area on the southern side of the existing mangroves. The

              area, which is reclaimed by the petitioners, is contrary to the

              No Objection Certificate dated 14.6.2007. Therefore, the 1st

              petitioner has encroached upon the area of the 2nd

              respondent-Board without any permission, and the status of

              the petitioners is nothing more than a trespasser. The 1st

              petitioner company is handling the cargo at 30% of total

              capacity of the cargo sought to be projected since the year

              2011-12 and the same is mentioned in a tabular form in the

              affidavit.

<p id="p_33">           5.4.   By referring to the said figures, it is averred that the 1st

              petitioner could not run the captive jetty at its full capacity

              on one hand and at the same time, the 1st petitioner wants

              to come up with an expansion plan without any basis. It is

              averred that the Government is suffering revenue loss since

              the plant is not running at its full capacity. With the

              aforesaid pleas, it is prayed for dismissal of the petition.

         pursuant to tender floated by the 2nd respondent for

         3rd respondent is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_35">         6.1.   The petitioners own a captive jetty at Magdalla Port.

            Apart from the petitioners, 9 other industrial units are

            having captive jetties at Magdalla Port. The said captive

            jetty is established by industrial undertakings to import raw

            material and export finished products.                      The petitioner

            company is catering to the needs of its parent company that

            owns sponge iron plant at Hazira, i.e. captive jetty owned by

            the petitioners is used to import raw materials for sponge

            iron ore, and the finished goods of the said plant are

            exported by using the said jetty. The 3rd respondent has

            entered into a Concession Agreement with the 1st and 2nd

            respondents    for   development           of   the     port      at    Hazira.

            Development of the port with respect to the LNG terminal

            and other facilities were carried out by the 3rd respondent,

            whereas the development of the port with respect to non-

            LNG cargo is looked after by the 4th respondent, who has

            entered into a Bulk and General Cargo Agreement, i.e. Sub-

            Concession Agreement with the 2nd and 3rd respondents.

            Therefore, the activities of the petitioners at Magdalla Port

            and the activities of the 3rd and 4th respondents at the port of

            Hazira         are   completely     different       with      respect       to    the

            objectives and the scope. While the use of captive jetty by

            the 1st petitioner is for its own requirements and limited for

            importing and exporting products for sponge iron plant, the

            activities of the 3rd respondent and the 4th respondent are

            with respect to the development of the port that are wider in

            scale and scope, and also for the public purpose as against

            the use of captive jetty for private purpose of the

            petitioners.

<p id="p_36">         6.2. The petitioners have made allegations in the petition and

            created an impression that it is developing the port facilities

            at Magdalla Port which is incorrect, inasmuch as                                  the

            expansion of its captive jetty is different from developing the

            admeasuring 567 Hectares (233 Hectares reclaimed and 334

            file the petition challenging the impugned Notification dated

            18th January 2016 as unreasonable and arbitrary. The

            impugned Notification was issued under the sovereign

            powers of the 1st respondent and the statutory powers

            conferred under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_13">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908.

            Thus, it is pleaded that unless it is demonstrated that the

            exercise of powers is in colourable exercise of powers, ultra

            vires to the parent statute and ultra vires to the provisions

            of the Constitution of India, the challenge to the Notification

            shall fail. The petitioners have failed to point out as to how

            the impugned Notification is beyond the powers conferred

            on the 1st respondent under <a href="/doc/315990/" id="a_14">section 5</a> of the Act. Perusal of

            <a href="/doc/315990/" id="a_15">section 5</a> reveals that subject to private property, the

            Government is empowered to alter the limits of any port. As

            the petitioners have not set out in the petition that the

            impugned       Notification    prejudicially        affects       the    private

            property of anybody, including that of the petitioners, there

            above, it is the case of the 3rd respondent that extension of

            the Port of Hazira does not prejudice any pre-existing

            interest of the petitioners with respect to its captive jetty at

            Magdalla Port. It is stated that due to the extension of limits

            of Hazira Port, there is going to be no prejudice whatsoever

            to the interests of the petitioners, as claimed in the petition

            and therefore, the petition is required to be dismissed on the

            ground that it is lacking specificity with respect to the moot

            question involved in the petition with regard to the manner

            and the quantum of prejudice suffered by the petitioners

            due to extension of the limits of Hazira Port.

         6.5.   It is the case of the 3rd respondent that the present

            petition is an abuse of process of law, inasmuch as it is an

            arm twisting device with an aim to exert pressure on the 1st

            and the 2nd respondents so that they come to terms with

            the     petitioners.   While     denying         the    allegation        of    the

            petitioners that the 3rd respondent is a public limited

            company, it is stated that the 3rd respondent is a Private

            Limited Company. It is denied by the 3rd respondent that the

            Notification issued for extension of the limits of Hazira Port

            would confer       undue benefit            to the 3rd           and the            4th

            respondents. It is also denied that the 1st petitioner company

            was incorporated to develop new port facilities.

         6.6.   With reference to the allegation of the petitioners that

            the petitioners have undertaken large-scale development in

            the port of Magdalla, it is stated that the development work

            done by the petitioners is on its captive jetty and not on the

            Port of Magdalla. It is the specific say of the 3rd respondent

            that the reclamation of land, if any, by the petitioners is due

            to the permission granted by the 2nd respondent to allow it

            to dump the dredged material while constructing/operating

            its captive jetty. By referring to the reply of the 2nd

            respondent, it is stated that the petitioners have no right

            either to reclaim the land, if any, and unless the petitioners

            demonstrate their legal title over the alleged reclaimed land,

            they cannot seek invalidation of the impugned Notification.

         6.7.   With respect to the alleged investment of Rs.1500 Crores

            by the petitioners, it is stated that the same pertains to the

            development of waterfront of 550 meters. Therefore, it is

            incorrect to say that based on the assurances and the MOUs

            executed with the State Government, investment of Rs.1500

            Crores was made by the petitioners for any development. It

            is stated that the alteration of the port limits of the 3rd

            respondent company cannot be termed as encroachment

            upon the limits of Magdalla Port, inasmuch as, altering the

            port limits is a separate function of the 1st and the 2nd

            respondents, circumscribed by the provisions of the Act.

            With reference to the allegation of the petitioners that since

            the executives of the 3rd respondents are conservatory body

            of Hazira Port, they are likely to favour the 4th respondent

            over the 1st petitioner in relation to grant of various

            permissions and approval, it is stated that such averments

            are out of place and not germane to lis involved in the

            petition. The conservatory body at the Port of Hazira is

              powers of the conservatory body pertain to safety and

              navigation of the port as prescribed under Chapter III of the

              Indian Ports Act. The powers of the conservatory body are

              subject to the overall control of the 2nd respondent. In view

              of the statutory powers conferred on the conservatory body,

              its decisions are subject to the provisions of the Act.

              Therefore, it is impermissible for a conservatory body to

              exercise the powers arbitrarily and illegally. Therefore, the

              allegations made by the petitioners are without any basis.

<p id="p_40">           7.1.   It is stated that the petition be dismissed in limine on the

              have violated the provisions of law in order to create illegal

                     "a) It is the claim of the petitioner that in respect of
                           waterfront development of 550 mts. along with
                           dredging, it required 319.86 ha (or 350 ha) for
                           dumping of the dredged material towards the north
                           of the mangrove area. It is the further case of the
                           petitioner that in respect of the aforesaid, it could
                           reclaim only 186 ha (or 195 ha) out of the total
                           area of 319.86 ha for which NOC (dated 14.6.2007)
                           was granted by the Respondent No.2 (hereinafter
                           referred   to as 'GMB').            The reason that the
                           petitioner could reclaim only 186 ha (or 195 ha) is
                           that the area (319.86 ha) for which permission was
                           granted by GMB to dump the dredged material in
                           fact turned out to be 186 ha (or 195 ha) and not
                           319.86 ha. It is also the claim of the petitioner that
                           construction of 550 mts. waterfront was completed
                           on 11.2.2010. I state and submit that if the
                           petitioner required 319.86 ha for dumping of the
                           dredged material to develop the waterfront of 550
                           mts., it is not known as to how the                       petitioner
                           completed the waterfront of 550 mts along with
                           dredging, when as per the petitioner it could dump
                           the dredged material only on 186 ha (or 195 ha)
                           area and no other area was available to it for
                           dumping the dredged material. From the aforesaid,
                           it is evident that the claim made by the petitioner
                           for 319.86 ha area was merely an eyewash and the
                           objective was to grab more area under the garb of
                           so called reclamation.

                           only 186 ha and therefore the petitioner started

                           (GPCB). it is noted that the existing cargo handling
                           capacity of the petitioner at its aforesaid captive

                           handled cargo of 10.6 million tonnes at its captive
                           jetty. For the financial year 2015-16, the petitioner
                           projected that it would be handling the cargo in the
                           region of 17 million tonnes. The same would be
                           evident from the letter dated 29.5.2015 (pages
                           270-271    of    the        petition)     addressed          by     the

                           the aforesaid petition, filed its affidavit in reply
                           dated 8.6.2016. At page 361 of the petition, GMB
                           has provided the details of the actual cargo
                           handled by the petitioner from the financial year
                           2011-12 to 2015-16. On perusal of the said details,
                           it is evident that the actual cargo handled by the
                           petitioner is much below its existing handling
                           capacity at 550 mts. captive jetty project. Further,

                           www.essarports.com            also      provides       the     details
                           about the cargo handled by the petitioner at its
                           existing jetty at Hazira for the financial year 2011-
                           12, 2012-13 and financial year 2013-14. As per the
                           figures   mentioned          therein,       the     actual      cargo

                           mts. or 3700 mts. Even otherwise, the waterfront
                           development area of 3700 mts. was essentially for
                           commercial operations. From the aforesaid, it also
                           becomes evident that the whole exercise carried
                           out by the petitioner to increase the waterfront
                           area was to grab the entire channel so as to
                           strangulate the future growth of the multi-user port
                           at Hazira and in the process enable the petitioner
                           to handle commercial cargo by way of back door
                           entry, though the petitioner is not entitled to carry
                           out the commercial operations in light of the Port
                           Policy, December 1995, and the BOOT Principles

         7.2.   While stating as referred above, with regard to the

            allegations made by the petitioners in respect of the

            challenge to the Notification dated 18th January 2016, it is

            pleaded that the Government of Gujarat has announced the

            Port Policy in December 1995. Under the said Policy, one of

            the ports identified for exclusive investment of private

            sector         was     Hazira.   The         port   identified       for    exclusive

            investment by private sector was to be carried out through a

            global tender under the said Policy. It was envisaged in the

            said Policy that to ensure that new projects are financially

            viable, permission for captive jetty would be given only in

            exceptional cases, looking to the quantum of investment

            and the need for specialized facilities. It was further

            envisaged that all the industrial units will be encouraged to

            make use of the new Port facilities, being set up there.

            Subsequently, the Government                of Gujarat has            issued a

            Resolution     dated     29.7.1997,           announcing           Build-Own-

            Operate-Transfer (BOOT) principles under the Port Policy-

            1995. As per the BOOT Policy notified by the Government,

            the new ports be operated at international standard of

            performance and efficiency and that the waterfront is

            optimally utilized. To facilitate this, the developer would be

            provided with a high degree of operational freedom. One of

            the options in the BOOT Policy is that the Government will

            not allow any development on the land in the vicinity of the

            land earmarked for development of the port (say, within 500

            mts distance of the port limits), and the developer would be

            encouraged to add capacity over and above the capacity

            contracted in the Concession Agreement. As per the terms

            of the Policy, at the time of signing of the Concession

            Agreement, the developer will submit and get approved by

            the Gujarat Maritime Board, a broad perspective plan for the

            development of the port in the next fifteen to twenty years,

            and the Government will not place restrictions on any

            expansion and further development of the port, which is

            within the envisaged perspective plan, subject to the

            Intention of Interest for Development of Green Field Site Port

            Facilities in Gujarat State, came to be issued. Under the said

            global notice, for Hazira, the total berth requirement in 2001

            was estimated to be 11 and in 2011 for 16 berths. In the

            said global notice, it was clearly noted that there remained

            several perceived risks in the eyes of the potential investors

            Shell Gas BV to develop, operate and maintain a port of

            Hazira and the 3rd respondent also believed that one of the

            of Hazira and reduced/redefined the port limits of Magdalla

            in a manner so as to exclude the limits of Hazira Port.

            Thereafter, the Government of Gujarat issued a notification

            dated 19.3.2010, extending the limits of Hazira Port. On

            and the Government, and as per the said addendum, it was

            noted that the Gujarat Maritime Board had conveyed its

            approval for the 4th respondent to be appointed as the

            Bulk/General Cargo Operator as a sub-concessionaire, in

            accordance       with    the      provisions         of     the     Concession

            maintain the Bulk/General Cargo Terminal. Pursuant to

            execution of the aforesaid Bulk/General Cargo Terminal

            Agreement, the 4th respondent submitted DPR in respect of

            development of 3 berths at Hazira Port in its first phase.

            Such DPR included a master plan which was in respect of

            the development of total 13 berths, in a phased manner,

            which would require about 1000 Hectares                            of area as

            backup. Based on the DPR submitted by the 4th respondent,

            the 2nd respondent-Gujarat Maritime Board, vide letter dated

            11.2.2011, approved the DPR for Bulk/General Cargo

            Terminal. It is stated that as on the date, the 4th respondent

            is already operating 5 berths at Hazira Port in addition to the

            LNG terminal being operated by the 3rd respondent.

            Referring to the BOOT Policy, it is stated that the

            Government desired that the new ports be operated at the

            international standards of performance and efficiency and

            that the waterfront is optimally utilized and in this regard,

            the developer was required to be provided with a high

            degree of operational freedom. During the operation of the

            terminals by the 3rd respondent and the 4th respondent

            respectively, it was experienced that number of vessels

            calling at Hazira Port was gradually increasing. Further, the

            existing port limits of Hazira was working out insufficient to

            provide anchorage to the increased number of vessels at the

            Hazira Port. It is a fact that Hazira Port limits have been

            carved out from Magdalla Port limits. If the vessels are

            anchored at     Magdalla Port, the said vessels would be

            required to pay anchorage charges to Magdalla Port and

            once the said vessels are brought within Hazira Port, the

            said vessels once again would be required to pay anchorage

            charges at Hazira port. To avoid such double payments, the

            said vessels used to anchor outside the Magdalla Port limits.

            When the vessels were to be called for to Hazira Port, lot of

            time was being wasted and that Hazira Port was not able to

            work optimally. To arrest such problem, the 3rd respondent,

            vide letter dated 21.7.2014 requested for amendment to the

            port limits of Hazira. Subsequent to the aforesaid letter

            dated      21.7.2014,      the     3rd      and      the     4th     respondents

            experienced further increase in number of vessels. As per

            the master plan submitted to the Gujarat Maritime Board, as

            part of DPR, it was clearly envisaged development of total

            13 berths. The development of additional berths would

            require the backup area of 680 Hectares. It is further stated

            that the 4th respondent, somewhere in the year 2011,

            submitted its proposal for allotment of forest land (situated

            to the north of Bulk/General Cargo Terminal of the 4th

            respondent) from the Forest Department, to meet with the

            requirement of backup area partially. No permission till date

            has been given by the Forest Department for allotment of

            the forest land. In the absence of availability of the land and

            to meet with the development of total 13 berths as

            envisaged under the master plan amongst others, options

            were being looked towards the south of the Bulk/General

            Cargo Terminal for backup area as that was the only viable

            solution       on   the various       grounds as             envisaged         while

            addressing the letter dated 14.3.2015 to the Gujarat

            DPR to the 2nd respondent to grant it in-principle approval in

            respect of the proposed expansion in the form of outer

            harbor development, and accordingly, the 2nd respondent-

            respect of the revised proposal dated 14.3.2015 and after

            due deliberations, rightly came to the conclusion that the

            decision taken by the 2nd respondent-Board in its meeting

            proposed LNG facility was adjacent to 1100 meters of

            waterfront allotted by the 2nd respondent-Board. The said

            towards the south of the mangrove area in order to illegally

            grab the entire channel, and to achieve the same, the

            petitioner company had also proposed the waterfront of

            3700 meters. Realizing that the petitioner company would

            stand exposed, the same was corrected by the Essar Group

            industries and export-oriented units and failure to approve

            the captive jetty will threaten the very existence of the

            petitioners' steel plant at Hazira. It is the case of the

            petitioners in the rejoinder that the Policy nowhere provides

            that Concessionaire under a Concession Agreement can add

            to its contracted capacity by extending its operations in the

            areas beyond the port limits as originally envisaged. The

            only reason for the 3rd and 4th respondents in changing the

            perspective plan of Hazira             was to usurp and annex the

            waterfront and the reclaimed land created by Essar at

            significant expense. It is further pleaded in the rejoinder that

            the 1st petitioner company has created the enabling

            infrastructure   at    great           expense,       effort,      and       after

            considerable innovation. The 7 kilometers long navigation

            channel created by the 1st petitioner company after dredging

            it from an initial depth of -3 meters to the existing -12

            meters was created at the significant expense. Furthermore,

            reclamation of the land had posed its own challenges which

            were overcome over a period of time. It is pleaded that at

            present, the petitioner company incurs an expense of

            approximately Rs.100 crores per annum to maintain the

            channel depth and thus, it would be completely unjust and

            unreasonable if the 3rd and 4th respondents are allowed to

            take advantage of the facilities and developments made by

            the petitioner company in the Port.

         9.2.   Referring to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_18">Indian Ports Act</a>, it is

            pleaded that the powers conferred on the State Government

            for altering the Port limits are not unfettered, and the State

            Government had exercised such power with fairness and

            reasonableness. It is pleaded that the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_19">Indian Ports Act</a> does

            not give powers to the Government to bifurcate the ports, as

            was sought to be done vide notification dated 20.10.2004.

            Referring to various notifications issued by the State

            Government, it is pleaded that the State Government had

            exercised the powers under <a href="/doc/1179015/" id="a_20">sections 4</a> and <a href="/doc/315990/" id="a_21">5</a> of the Indian

            Ports Act in a completely ad hoc and arbitrary manner,

            without having any regard for the due process of law.

            Further, it is pleaded that Essar Ports Limited, Adani Ports

            and Special Economic Zone Ltd had entered into an MOU on

            27.2.2015      for   the     purpose         of     exploring         business

            opportunities and technical collaboration opportunities in

            various ports. The said MOU had envisaged sharing of

            certain confidential information. The 3rd and 4th respondents

            had illegally utilized the confidential information obtained by

            them pursuant to the aforesaid MOU by seeking to usurp the

            developments undertaken by the petitioners after making

            substantial investments for the same. It is pleaded that the

            request of the 4th respondent for additional space for

            berthing its vessels cannot be met by depriving the

            petitioner company of its rights in the land reclaimed and

            developed by it. It is stated that presently, the petitioner

            company receives approximately 30 vessels per month at its

            captive jetty and, therefore, birthing space is necessary for

            the petitioner company as well. It is pleaded that while

            applications of the petitioner company for allotment of land

            and waterfront remained pending before the authorities for

            years together, the application of the 3rd respondent for

            extension of the port limits was considered in a short span of

            time. It is the case of the petitioners in the rejoinder that the

            letter dated 16.7.2015, written by the Board to the State

            Government, does not set out the facts accurately and seeks

            to prejudice and victimize the petitioners by doing undue

            favour to the 3rd and 4th respondents. It is stated that the

            said letter brushes aside the MOUs executed by the

            petitioners with the 2nd respondent for development of 3700

            meters of waterfront and the assurances given for allotment

            of the land, pursuant thereto. It is stated in the rejoinder

            that in the formal meetings with the State authorities, the

            petitioner company had been assured of the allotment of

            land being reclaimed by it. Thus, the respondent State

            authorities are discriminating between the petitioners and

            the 3rd and 4th respondents.

            the 2nd respondent dated 16.7.2015, by completely ignoring

            the subsequent Resolution dated 28.9.2015. It is pleaded

            that the State Government had deliberately suppressed the

            material facts.
</p>
<p id="p_62">         9.4.   It is further pleaded that the State Government cannot

            exercise power of alteration of port limits under the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_22">Indian

            Ports Act</a>, 1908 arbitrarily and illegally in unfettered terms,

            without regard to the impact it has upon the stakeholders in

            the port. It is pleaded that the petitioners are not claiming

            any rights over the entire Magdalla Port, but only the area

            reclaimed by them pursuant to the assurances and promises

            of the allotment given by the State authorities. The

            petitioners' rights do not become subservient to the alleged

            rights of the 3rd and 4th respondents, merely because the

            petitioner company operates a captive jetty as opposed to a

            commercial multi-user port. In any case, the 1st petitioner

            company,       not   being    a        party    to    Hazira       Concession

            Agreement, is not bound by the terms of the same in any

            manner whatsoever, and the captive jetty agreement dated

            25.3.2010 between the 1st petitioner company and the 2nd

            respondent does not impose any restrictions upon the

            construction of LNG or cargo handling facilities for the

            captive use of the petitioners. The alleged commercial

            operations sought to be undertaken by the 1st petitioner

            entitled to allotment of 3700 meters of waterfront on the

            ground that the procedure contemplated under sections 8

            and 9 of the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act, 1999 is

            not followed.
</p>
<p id="p_63">         9.5.   It is the further case of the petitioners in the rejoinder

            that the 1st petitioner company was granted permission for

            dumping the dredged material in 319.86 Hectares of land in

            the mud-flat area, and the area of mud-flat was only an

            estimate, as it was not possible to precisely identify how

            much of the submerged area could be reclaimed. It is further

            pleaded that it was not possible to identify precisely the

            area of the land available to the north of the mangroves and

            the one which is available on the south of the mangroves,

            and subsequently after undertaking the reclamation,                          the

            petitioners could only reclaim 186 Hectares of land from the

            area towards the north of the mangroves, and for the

            balance area for which the NOC was granted, the 1st

           petitioners, in response to the affidavit in reply filed on behalf

           of the 2nd respondent herein. The case as pleaded in the

           affidavit in rejoinder by the petitioners is as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">               10.1. The impugned Notification is not maintainable in law, as

                  the same was issued arbitrarily and hastily without regard to

                  the stakeholders, inasmuch as the interest of the 1st

                  petitioner company is severely prejudiced on account of the

                  issuance of the impugned Notification. The executive powers

                  cannot be exercised arbitrarily in violation of the principles

                  of natural justice and if the power is exercised in such a

                  manner, the same is amenable to judicial review. The

                  expansion of the port limits was the first step towards

                  usurping the waterfront and the reclaimed land created by

                  the petitioners, which is evident from the fact that the

                  application of the 4th respondent for approval of its revised

                  DPR for the activities in the area reclaimed by the 1st

                  petitioner company was made on 19.1.2016, immediately

                  after the impugned Notification. The State Government has

                  no power to alter the port limits arbitrarily and illegally

            chart relied on by the 2nd respondent does not reflect the

            correct position of the port area as on date, and if the port

            limits are to be altered, it is obligatory on the part of the 2 nd

            respondent to give an opportunity to the stakeholders who

            are affected by such alteration of port limits. In the instant

            case,     without   hearing     the     petitioners,        the     impugned

            Notification is issued, which has severely prejudiced the

            case of the petitioners.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_65">         10.2. There is no delay on the part of the petitioners in

            approaching this Court, as pleaded. The 2nd respondent was

            time and again assuring that the port limits would not be

            altered in a manner which would affect the petitioners' right.

            However, after issuance of the impugned Notification, a

            protest letter dated 29th January 2016 was addressed by the

            1st petitioner company to the State Government, objecting

            against the impugned Notification and thereafter, the 1st

            petitioner company was under genuine belief that the

            matter would be sorted out at the administrative level.

         10.3. The 2nd respondent is trying to misguide the Court by

            contending that the applications of the 1st petitioner

            company and that of the 3rd and 4th respondents operate in

            different realm and the same cannot be compared. Both the

            applications, i.e., the application of the 1st petitioner

            company and that of the 3rd and 4th respondents require

            prior approval of the 2nd respondent-Board and merely

            because the application of the petitioner company is for

            expansion of captive jetty, as opposed to development of

            the port, the petitioner company's application cannot be

            treated as inferior with the application of the 3rd and the 4th

            respondents. Though both the applications are pending

            before the 2nd respondent-Board, the said authority has

            considered and granted in-principle approval to the 4th

            respondent     without    even        considering         the      petitioner

            company's application. The said action on the part of the 2nd

            respondent-Board is vindictive and malafide, and the said

            application was approved only to favour the 3rd and 4th

            respondents. By referring to the provisions under sections 8

            and 9 of the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act, 1999

            read with Entry 3 of Schedule I, it is stated that a person

            may be selected for development of a port on the basis of

            the competitive bidding and a Concession Agreement can be

            entered into with such               selected person. Thus, the

            Concession Agreement forms the basis of a selected

            bidder's right to develop a port. The said bidder cannot seek

            to develop the areas beyond those which are earmarked

            under the Concession Agreement. Thus, it is pleaded that

            the 3rd and 4th respondents are entitled to undertake the

            activities only in the specified areas as earmarked in the

            Concession Agreement, and the 2nd respondent-Board has

            no right to arbitrarily allot the concerned areas to the 4th

            Sub-Concession Agreements as well as the provisions of the

            Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act, 1999. The 1st

            petitioner company is not undertaking the dredging activity

            free of cost but is paying significant scooping charges to the

            2nd respondent-Board for the same. The 1st petitioner

            company is reclaiming the land for its use and the State

            Government had granted in-principle approval for allotment

            of 170 Hectares of land to the 1st petitioner company in the

            year 2009, and ultimately, final approval for allotment of

            140 Hectares was granted on 11.5.2016, i.e. more than 7

            years after the in-principle approval, and the application of

            the 1st petitioner company for allotment of 334 Hectares of

            land on the south of the mangroves, is pending since the

            year 2012. As the 1st petitioner company has already spent

            over Rs.1500 Crores for reclaiming the land and in view of

            the pendency of the application of the 1st petitioner

            company, the approval granted to the 4th respondent is

            illegal and arbitrary.      The petitioners have denied the

            allegation of the 2nd respondent that the applications of the

            1st petitioner company for allotment of land are contrary to

            the provisions of the Gujarat Infrastructure Development

            Group has invested more than Rs. 40000 Crores in Hazira

            dependent on the port facilities which need to be extended

            at any time with increasing production in the steel plant. In

            view of the same, the 1st petitioner company has developed

            around 550 meters of waterfront and commenced the

            construction on 1100 meters of waterfront. Further, the 1st

            petitioner company has also reclaimed 186 Hectares of land

            to the area on the north of the mangroves. The 1st petitioner

            company also proposes to develop further 3700 meters of

            waterfront and is presently reclaiming around 337 Hectares

            of land in the area on the south of the mangroves to cater to

            the increasing raw material requirements of its steel plant

            and the respondent State authorities are aware of the same.

            The 1st petitioner company had entered into the MOUs with

            the State Government for development of 3700 meters of

            waterfront, out of which, 700 meters were to be utilized for

            public purpose.

            Board, by Resolution dated 28.9.2015 resolved to expand

            the limits of Hazira Port in a manner which would not affect

            the rights of the 1st petitioner company in Magdalla Port.

            However,       the State Government, without any cogent

            reasons and without conducting any physical/hydrographic

            survey of the area, had conveniently brushed aside the said

            Resolution dated 28.9.2015 and passed the impugned

            Notification in accordance with the                   previous Resolution

            dated 19.3.2015 of the 2nd respondent-Board. In view of the

            same, it is alleged that the State Government had acted

            arbitrarily, which shows non-application of mind. The 2nd

            respondent-Board had completely ignored the MOUs entered

            into between the 1st petitioner company and the State

            Government for development of 3700 meters of waterfront,

            and the environmental clearance granted for 334 Hectares

            of backup land in the south reclamation area. Therefore,

            there is no question of violation of the provisions of the

            Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act, 1999. The 2nd

            respondent-Board had granted approval for 319.86 Hectares

            area of the reclaimed land, by virtue of No Objection

            Certificate dated 14.6.2007. However, after the completion

            of the reclamation of approximately 186 Hectares, a

            mangrove       patch   was      found       to    obstruct        the     further

            Forests was of the opinion that the mangrove patch needs to

            be preserved and the 1st petitioner company initiated the

            reclamation of the balance area in the south reclamation

            area. Further, by letter dated 15.11.2012, the 1st petitioner

            company had applied for reclamation of additional 334

            Hectares reclaimed land in the south reclamation area,

            wherein it was clearly stated that since there was no

            possibility of further reclamation in the area on the north of

            the mangroves, the 1st petitioner company was reclaiming

            the land from the south reclamation area. The proposal of

            the 1st petitioner company for 334 Hectares in south

            reclamation    area    was      recommended              by     the     coastal

            regulatory authority, and permission was granted by the

            Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests as well as by the Gujarat

            contributing up to Rs. 45 Crores per annum towards various

            port charges to the State Government. The steel industry

            has been passing through a recessionary phase which has

            resulted in lesser cargo handling at the captive port. The

            petitioner company is taking steps for revival, which will

            result in enhanced cargo handling, which in turn, will result

            in    increased   contribution        of   revenue         to     the     State

            Government as well as the 2nd respondent-Board. As the

            proposal of the 1st petitioner company for grant of waterfront

            and reclamation area is earlier in point of time to the

            proposal of the 3rd and 4th respondents, the 2nd respondent-

            Gujarat at the cost of other GMB port operators such as the

            petitioners. The development of a private port cannot occur

            at the detriment of an existing Government port and its

            constituents such as the 1st petitioner company. Expansion

            of the captive jetty of the 1st petitioner company would

            substantially increase the revenues of the State exchequer.

            Moreover, 700 meters out of 3700 meters of waterfront

            sought for by the petitioner company are to be utilized for

            setting up Ro-Ro jetty and common user dry cargo facility

            for public purposes at the cost of the 1st petitioner company.

            Therefore, the expansion of the captive jetty of the 1st

            petitioner company will not only benefit it but also the State

            exchequer as well as the public at large. The 1st petitioner

            company, being an important stakeholder, was never heard

            prior to issuance of the impugned Notification.                            The

            Notification extending the port limits of Hazira, without any

            corresponding change in the port limits of Magdalla, leads to

            anomalous situation, where the port limits of Magdalla and

            Hazira are overlapping each other. The request of the 1st

            petitioner company for 3700 meters of waterfront is pending

            since 2012, in spite of several parameters and follow-ups

            made by the 1st petitioner company. Moreover, the 1st

         11.2. The 1st petitioner company is gravely prejudiced on

            account of the extension of the port limits by the impugned

            Notification. Since 1989, the Essar Group has been operating

            in Hazira region and has invested more than Rs. 40,000

            Crores for development of Hazira Complex. The EBTL (the 1st

            petitioner company) has developed the navigation channel

            from negligible depths to 14 meters draft to cater to deep

            draft ships and invested more than Rs. 2500 Crores for

            development of the port facilities to service the captive

            requirements of the Hazira Complex. Essar Steel Limited

            had set up gas based iron making units at Hazira in early

            90s due to availability of natural gas (NG) in the region. With

            the increase in the demand of gas and reduction in domestic

            gas production, the Essar Steel Ltd. is not getting sufficient

            domestic gas for operation of its gas based units, which has

            resulted into operation of gas based iron making units at 20-

            30% of its capacity and overall capacity utilization of the

            steel plant to only 50%. The 1st petitioner company has been

            operating the Deep Draft Terminal at Hazira under Magdalla

            Port of the Gujarat Maritime Board since May 2010. The

            EBTL provides port related services to Essar Steel Limited for

            granted, from the area south of the mangroves, since the

            were protected in terms of the MoEF permission of the

            Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests dated 20.12.2007. The

            MW power plant supplying power predominantly to Essar

            Steel had to shut down the operations since the last 2 years,

            which in turn, has further affected the productivity of the

            steel plant. Even at the production level of less than 4 Million

            Tonnes per annum of steel, the petitioners are contributing

            upto Rs. 45 Crores per annum towards various port charges

            to the State Government. The Central Government has

            recently declared a Minimum Import Price (MIP) on the

            imported steel so as to protect the domestic steel industry

            from the recession in the industry. The cargo projections of

            the Company before commissioning of the port were based

            on certain assumptions which have changed as follows:

</p><p id="p_76">             a) The cargo mix has changed on account of the need to

                handle coal, other light cargo (high volume - less

                tonnage cargo), various by-products and higher quantity

                of finished goods resulting in slower discharge rates.

</p><p id="p_77">             b) The channel and current dynamics of Hazira channel

                require continuous maintenance dredging which hampers

                vessel movement and at times necessitates simultaneous

                operation of lighterage and direct berthing operations

                resulting in lesser discharge rate of cargo.

                captive port were brought to the notice of GMB vide

         12.3. Mere fact that the petitioner company is not                       able to

            utilize its plant capacity to the optimum at present, does

            not disentitle the 1st petitioner company of its right to have

            the waterfront and backup area allotted to it in accordance

            with the assurances given by the Government. The 1st

            petitioner company       made applications for allotment of

            waterfront and backup land, based on its foresight regarding

            the requirement of additional cargo handling capacity. With

            the increased capacity utilization of Steel Plant, the cargo

            handling requirement is expected to increase by four times

            from the existing traffic, i.e. in excess of 40 MMT cargo

            encompassing variety of cargo like dry bulk (iron ore, coal,

            coke, limestone, dolomite, flux). To support these dedicated

            facilities, 370 meters waterfront and backup area sought for

            will be a necessity. The letter dated 18.1.2016 written by the

            petitioner company to the Gujarat Maritime Board clearly

            sets out the reasons and the purpose behind the 1st

            petitioner company's need for approval for expansion of its

            captive jetty facilities and establishment of the LNG

            terminal. Moreover, neither the State government nor the

            2nd respondent-Board has ever raised any objection against

            the petitioners' proposal for extension of its captive jetty

            and allotment of backup area on the ground                          that the

            completely dependent on the captive jetty facilities for

            sourcing of raw material necessary for production and for

            movement of the finished goods, and the by-product either

            for export or domestic movement through coastal shipping.

            It is pertinent to note that the answering respondent has

            wrongly sought to highlight the fact that the Government

            will not allow any development on the land in the vicinity of

            the land earmarked for development of the port. It is stated

            by the answering respondent that the said condition is not

            absolute and unqualified and is subject to exceptions,

            including a limited time period of exclusivity of 10 years,

            which is conferred upon under a Concession Agreement to

            the qualified bidder.

<p id="p_80">         12.5. It is pertinent to mention that out of 13 berths proposed

            to be developed by the answering respondent in terms of

            the approval granted to it on 11.2.2011, it has managed to

            commission only 5 berths till date. Therefore, there is no

            basis for the answering respondent to seek extension of the

            port limits for additional space for development of new

            berths. By virtue of extension of the port limits in terms of

            the impugned Notification, a majority                  of the area in the

            extended portion is covered with the land and not sea.

            Therefore, the purpose of            anchorage of vessels is not

            served at all, which clearly goes to show that the extension

            of port limits has been done without any rationale or

            it is a known fact that not all the vessels calling on the ports

            can be accommodated immediately at the berths and they

            are required to wait at the anchorage area. Even the vessels

            calling at the petitioners' jetty have to wait at the anchorage

            and a lot of time is wasted as a consequence of the same. It

            is reiterated by the petitioners that the 1st petitioner

            company has no objection against the                     alteration of the

            limits of Hazira Port so long as such extension does not

            overlap the area being reclaimed and developed by the 1st

            petitioner company.

<p id="p_81">         12.6. It is wrongly averred that the area towards the south of

            the Bulk Cargo Terminal (i.e. the same area to the south of

            mangroves) of the answering respondent, where the 1st

            petitioner company is reclaiming the land of about 334

            Hectares, was only viable solution for the respondents to

            meet with the availability of land for development of the

            berths. For the forest land referred to by the answering

            respondent in its reply, there were overlapping demands on

            the said land from both the 1st petitioner company and the

            4th respondent. Subsequently, by joint representation dated

            4.5.2015, the parties came to a consensus regarding

            distribution of the    said land and it was agreed that 210

            requirements of its steel and power plants at Hazira

            complex. Non-filing of the objections by other captive jetties

            execution of the MOUs for allotment of land and waterfront.

            The 1st petitioner company is only seeking to expand its

            waterfront and 334 Hectares of backup land is rendered

            completely redundant. Therefore, under no circumstances,

            can it be said that the 1st petitioner company is not the

            stakeholder or has no locus standi on the issue pertaining to

            extension of Hazira port limits as the respondent State

            authorities had given the assurances for facilitating the

            the petitioners. There is no provision under the law barring

            the petitioners from setting up the LNG terminal facility for

            their own captive use. The very purpose of investing such a

            significant amount of time and money for development of

            respondent-Board has not granted any                      approval to the

            reclamation of 350 Hectares of land by letter dated

            14.6.2007 and the approval was granted only to reclaim the

            area of about 252 Hectares. The petitioners were well aware

            that there was no measurement of the land while granting

            the approval and there was no assurance to provide

            additional     area   for    such       purpose.         Therefore,         such

            unauthorized reclamation made by the petitioners cannot

            create any vested right in favour of the petitioners. Grant of

            approval by other authorities does not, by itself, entitles the

            1st petitioner for allotment of 3700 meters of waterfront and

            334 Hectares of backup land, and the same is not of any

            consequence so far as the State authorities are concerned,

            for the purpose of allotment of the waterfront and any area

            alongside the waterfront.

            petitioner for allotment of 3700 meters of waterfront and

            334 Hectares of backup land, as alleged. The allegation of

            the 1st petitioner company that allotment of 3700 meters of

            waterfront is necessary to cater to its increasing raw

            material       requirements and the requirement of cargo

            handling facilities etc., is not supported by any valid

            documents. The 1st petitioner company is having license for

            captive jetty and not for commercial port.
</p>
<p id="p_90">         13.3. The MOUs executed with the State Government for

            development of 3000 meters of waterfront for its captive

            Ro-Ro facility for public utility in joint venture with the

            Government, do not create any right in favour of the parties.

            Additionally, the said MOUs have expired and not renewed

            thereafter. In the MOUs itself, it is clearly stated that such

            MOUs shall not be construed as a permission to allot and use

            the waterfront. Therefore, the petitioners cannot base their

            case only on the MOUs.

            port facilities as envisaged in the BOOT Policy. The project

            awarded to the 3rd respondent is for the development of the

            port and not restricted to any number of berths and the area

            for backup. It is up to the 3rd and 4th respondents to expand

            their port facilities within the framework of the BOOT Policy,

            and every request made by the petitioners, unless the same

            is in accordance with the Port Policy, BOOT Policy and the

            about 6.5 kms and dredging up to 8 meters in its letter

            dated 14.6.2007 and has stated that beyond this, no

            approval is produced by the petitioners. The 1st petitioner

            has not produced any letter permitting the petitioners to

            deepen the channel for the reclaimed area of 334 Hectares

            on the south of the mangroves. Therefore, the petitioners

            cannot compel the authorities to allot the waterfront and/or

            its 243rd meeting held on 28.9.2015, and with reference to

            the note dated 5.12.2015 submitted by the Chief Principal

            Secretary to the Hon'ble Chief Minister, it rectifies the

            interest of the 1st petitioner to the extent of 140 Hectares of

            the reclaimed land along with 1100 meters of waterfront as

            demanded by the 1st petitioner vide its letter dated

            8.2.2013. Therefore, it is neither fair nor proper on the part

            of the petitioners to allege that the 1st respondent-State has

            completely ignored the Resolution No. 3091 passed by the

            2nd respondent-Board on 28.9.2015. It is stated that the

            petitioners are trying to achieve something indirectly, which

            they are not entitled to get directly. It is stated that there is

            no policy as on date which allows the captive jetty to

            become a commercial multi-user port. The prayers made by

            the petitioners clearly amount to converting the captive jetty

            into a commercial port.
</p>
<p id="p_94">         13.7. In respect of the captive jetty of the 1st petitioner, it had

            entered into an agreement with the 2nd respondent-Board in

            the year 2000, and therefore, it is not correct on the part of

            the 1st petitioner to claim that its captive jetty is of the year

            1994, and therefore, the provisions of the Port Policy of 1995

            and the BOOT Policy of 1997 are not applicable to the

            captive jetty of the petitioners. All the provisions of the Port

            Policy, 1995 and the BOOT Policy 1997 are applicable to the

            captive jetty of the petitioners. The Government has, time

            and again, granted extension to the captive jetty of the

            petitioners. However, the same cannot, by itself, become a

            right of the petitioners to seek indefinite extension of their

            captive jetty. It is stated that the 1st petitioner company is

            viewing the cooperation of the Government as a matter of

            right by seeking the directions in the present petition. The

            Concession Agreement entered into by the 2nd respondent is

            the result of the implementation of the Port Policy and the

            BOOT Policy, and the same are guiding documents,

            governing the principles in question. The said Policies

            envisage the development of ports and the same are never

            restricted to any area identified for initial development. The

            limits of any port cannot remain static and require

            modification from time to time. In any case, alteration of the

            port limits is the prerogative of the State Government and in

            the absence of any legal right to any area, the petitioners

            have no basis to question the right of the Government in this

            regard.

            therefore, it is now not open for them to question the same.

            The conduct of the petitioners shows that the petitioners will

            make       wild and bald allegations against the Government

            whenever their demands for extension of their captive jetty

            are not accepted by the Government, irrespective of the fact

            that the same deserve consideration or not.

            revised         vide     proposal        dated        14.3.2015.           Therefore,

            technically the proposal dated 21.7.2014 was no longer

            pending for consideration as the same was modified by 3rd

            respondent on 14.3.2015. It is stated that in the fitness of

            things and after duly considering the case of the petitioners,

            and the explanation given by the 2nd respondent-Board vide

            letter dated 16.7.2015, the Government had decided to

            accord         the     approval     to       the   revised       proposal        dated

            14.3.2015. While doing so, the Government has also taken

            care of the interest of the 1st petitioner that its demand for

            1100 meters was approved in principle and would require

            backup area for the same. The MOU entered into by the 1 st

            petitioner with the 4th respondent is not germane to the

            facts of the present case.

                  their unauthorized act of deepening and reclamation under

                  the garb of environment approvals. In the absence of any

                  approval by the competent authorities, the work done by the

                  petitioners is clearly unauthorized and illegal. It is stated

            considered in the meeting of the Board on 31.5.2016, and it

            was decided to recommend to the Government to grant in-

            principle approval to the master plan of the AHPPL-4th

            established by the 3rd respondent which has been allotted to

            it in a public auction, and also as per the Concession

            Agreement executed with the 3rd respondent. The expansion

            proposed by the 3rd respondent pursuant to the Concession

            Agreement was considered in priority over the so-called

            expansion project proposed by the 1st petitioner company

            for its captive jetty and ultimately the 2nd respondent had

            decided to place the proposal of the 3rd and 4th respondents

            for approval in its meeting on 19.5.2016. As there were 53

            Agenda items in the meeting of 19.5.2016, the proposal of

            the 3rd respondent was not taken into consideration.

            Therefore, had the intention of the 2nd respondent Board

            been to extend undue favour to the proposal of the 3rd and

            4th respondents, it would have considered the same in the

            scenario, the allegation of the 1st petitioner company of

            favouritism and undue haste, is absolutely far from truth and

            there is no substance in such allegation. At the same time,

            the 2nd respondent has denied the                   allegation of the 1st

            undertake the reclamation work and create storage facilities

            in the area of 334 Hectares of land to the south of the

            mangroves, and this aspect was well within the knowledge

            of the 2nd respondent, since the representatives of the 2nd

            respondent-Board     are     on       the   Board       of   GCZMA,         and

            therefore, there is no question of granting approval to any

            third party, including that of the 4th respondent-AHPPL for

            development work in the said area, as alleged or otherwise.

            In fact, originally, No Objection Certificate was issued for

            reclamation in respect of 319 Hectares in the north of the

            mangrove area and while issuing the said No Objection

            Certificate, it was clearly mentioned that by grant of such

            permission, the petitioners would not get any right over the

            said area. Condition No. 7 of the said No Objection

            Certificate specifically states as under:

            "The ownership of the reclaimed land shall vest with the

                Government of Gujarat/Gujarat Maritime Board".

         14.3. In the said No Objection Certificate, it is made clear that

            the 1st petitioner company will not get any right of

            reimbursement towards such reclamation and                           such No

            Objection Certificate was issued purely by keeping in mind

            the dual benefits to both, the 1st petitioner company as well

            as the 2nd respondent-Board. However, that by itself would

            not create any right in favour of the 1st petitioner company.

            contention that since No Objection Certificate was issued for

            reclamation by the Gujarat Maritime Board, and the Ministry

            of    Environment       &amp;     Forests         has     granted        environment

            clearance, it is the right of the 1st petitioner company and

            not of any other party to make any proposal in respect of

            the land reclaimed by the 1st petitioner company under the

            permission. In fact, No Objection Certificate was granted to

            reclaim 319 Hectares of land on the north of the mangroves,

            but subsequently, having found that 186 Hectares of land

            could be reclaimed on the north of the mangrove area, a

            letter was written to the 2nd respondent to permit the

            remaining 164 Hectares of land for reclamation to the south

            of the mangrove area to which no specific clearance was

            granted by the 2nd respondent. On the basis of No Objection

            Certificate issued in respect of 319 Hectares, the 1st

            petitioner company obtained environmental clearance from

            the     Ministry   of   Environment              &amp;    Forests        and     started

            reclamation, and thereafter, now, it is claiming right over

            the said land. Thus, this act of the 1st petitioner company is

            without any permission from the respondent authority.

            Therefore, the ground raised by the 1st petitioner company

            has no substance either in law or on facts.

            by the petitioners looking to its overall performance and the

            documents executed for its captive jetty, additional area of

            1100 meters jetty was approved and backup land of 140

            Hectares       was granted in-principle to the 1st petitioner

            company. On the other hand, in-principle approval was

            granted to the 3rd and 4th respondents vide Resolution dated

            31.5.2016 to the extent of their claims. The said proposals

            were approved, having been found that the demand of the

            1st petitioner company for 3700 meters of additional land for

            waterfront and 334 Hectares of backup area, was not in

            consonance with the Port Policy as well as the BOOT Policy.

         14.6. The allegation of the petitioners that the approval

            granted in favour of the 4th respondent-AHPPL amounts to

            colourable exercise of power by the State authorities and

            would adversely affect the public at large, is denied. It is

            stated that on the contrary, looking to the performance of

            the 1st petitioner company, it has not handled the cargo as

            per the target given in its initial proposal for handling the

            captive cargo at the waterfront for captive jetty granted to it

            and has handled only 30% of the target at cargo. Moreover,

            the so-called 3700 meters additional waterfront demanded

            by the 1st petitioner company is also absolutely against the

            Port Policy and the BOOT Policy, and it is absolutely vague

            and unreasonable. If the breakup of the proposal of

            additional requirement of 3700 meters is carefully perused,

            several irrelevant demands have been made, which prima

            facie and clearly indicate that on the contrary, the said

            demands are malicious and are made to create monopoly in

            the area. It is stated that out of 37 meters waterfront

            demanded by the 1st petitioner company, 700 meters have

            been sought to be claimed towards Ro-Ro berth; 500 meters

            have been claimed towards bulk cargo (for blast furnace);

            600 meters have been claimed towards trestle berth for

            parking tug etc; 1000 meters have been claimed towards

            container berth for non-captive cargo and towards dry dock;

            400 meters have been claimed towards oil business and 500

            meters have been claimed towards liquid berth for handling

            oil cargo for its Essar Oil Refinery, which is situated at a

            distant place at Vadinar Port. Thus, on overall evaluation of

            the proposal of the 1st petitioner company, it was found that

            the demand of the 1st petitioner company was not genuine

            and not in consonance with the Port Policy, and the said

            claim of the 1st petitioner company cannot be considered,

            and therefore, the same was not granted though on

            objective analysis of the same having been found that

            granting of additional 1100 meters waterfront would be

            more than sufficient to meet with the so-called expansion

            sought by the petitioners. Accordingly, the same was

            granted by taking overall view of the matter.

            perused, it does not create any right by itself in favour of the

            1st petitioner company and that the same was valid for a

            period of one year from the date of its execution, which had

            expired way back in the year 2014. Therefore, the

            contention     of   legitimate         expectation       and       promissory

<p id="p_101">         14.8. The allegation of the 1st petitioner company that,

            development activities at Hazira port are restricted to the

            area solely earmarked for it in the Concession Agreement, is

            denied by the 2nd respondent. The allegation of the 1st

            petitioner company that, in-principle approval granted in

            favour of the 4th respondent by the 2nd respondent-Board

            subverts the Concession Agreement by conferring upon

            AHPPL the right to expand the activities in the area not

            covered, is denied. In fact, the Concession Agreement itself

            provides and enables the concessionaire to expand its

            activities in future depending on the requirement, and in

            fact, such enabling provisions are already provided in the

            Port/BOOT Policy. While extracting the relevant portion of

            Clause-6 of the BOOT Policy, it is stated that from such

            provision in the Policy, it is clear that expansion is inherent

            in the Policy and part of the Concession Agreement, and

            that the same is improper in law, as sought to be alleged.

         14.9. While denying the allegation made in ground (S7), it is

            the case of the 2nd respondent that, while it is true that

            allotment of waterfront is to be upgraded on allotment of

            backup area, however, converse is not true as sought to be

            contended by the 1st petitioner company and thus, because

            No Objection Certificate for reclamation of land was issued,

            corresponding length of waterfront should be granted, is

            nothing but an imagination of the 1st petitioner company,

            and is absolutely ill-founded. No Objection Certificate relied

            on by the 1st petitioner company was issued with clear

            understanding that it will create no right in favour of the

            petitioners and the same was issued only for dual benefits,

            where the petitioners can save huge land; otherwise in the

            ordinary course, as per the applicable norms, the 1st

            petitioner company has to dump the dredged material at a

            distant site in the mid-sea. Instead, the 2nd respondent,

            considering that dual benefits of the 1st petitioner company

            can save transportation cost to carry the dredged material

            at a distant place, and if the same is allowed at nearby

            place, it would incidentally reclaim the land falling within

            the jurisdiction of the 2nd respondent which could be better

            utilized for such port development purpose by the 2nd

            respondent, had granted No Objection Certificate. However,

                  the year 2012. To the best of the knowledge of the 1st

                  petitioner company, as per the policy of the Gujarat

                  Maritime Board, the procedure for reclamation and allotment

                  of reclaimed land is a two-stage process, where permission

            for reclamation under section 35(1) of the Gujarat Maritime

            Board Act is preceded by necessary GPCB NOC, CRZ

            Clearance and environmental clearance. In the instant case,

            the petitioner company has already obtained necessary

            GPCB NOC, CRZ clearance and environmental clearance for

            the backup area of 334 Hectares of land towards the south

            of mangroves in the year 2013-14 itself, and in-principle

            approval was granted on 31.5.2016 for the DPR submitted

            by the respondent no.4 for the same area, notwithstanding

            the clearance already in favour of the petitioners. Therefore,

            it is clear that the petitioners' application for allotment of

            the said land was prior in point of time to that of the 3rd

            respondent. Group companies of Essar have been utilizing

            the captive jetty facilities in Magdalla port since 1994, even

            prior to the Port Policy and the BOOT Policy. Therefore, no

            provisions of the said policies can prejudice the rights of the

            1st petitioner company in relation to the construction and

            operation of the captive jetty. In any case, the 2nd

            respondent has its representative in the GCZMA, who has

            recommended the 1st petitioner's proposal for allotment of

            3700 meters of land and backup area of 334 Hectares. Till

            the date of filing of the petition, the 2nd respondent has

            never raised any objection to the proposal made by the 1st

            petitioner company for allotment of 3700 meters of land and

            backup area of 334 Hectares. Therefore, the respondent

            indulge in favouritism and nepotism with respect to

            allotment of the said land. The map which was based on the

            hydrographic survey of the area carried out in the year

            2001, does not reflect the correct geographical position.

<p id="p_107">            Expansion of the captive jetty facilities and backup area is

            not only necessary for catering to the expansion plans of the

            1st petitioner company, but even at the present level of

            production of the steel plant, the captive jetty facilities are

            insufficient to cater to the plant's raw material requirements

            and therefore, the 1st petitioner company has been seeking

            the extension of the same time and again. The petitioners

            are denying the allegation of the 2nd respondent that

            dumping of the dredged material in the deep sea would

            have been more expensive for the petitioners. Moreover, the

            Gujarat Maritime Board should acknowledge that the land

            reclaimed by the petitioners serves as a protection to the

            navigation channel on one side. The 1st petitioner company

            is only seeking to expand its captive jetty facilities and

            reclaim the backup area for the purpose of catering to the

            requirements of its own steel plant and power plant. The

            approach of the 2nd respondent is casual and the 2nd

            respondent-Board    has          wrongly         informed         the     State

           4th respondent-AHPPL, to the affidavit in rejoinder dated

           21.6.2016 filed by the petitioners. In the said affidavit, while

           denying the allegations made by the petitioners in the rejoinder

           dated 21.6.2016, the case of the 4th respondent is as under:

           19.1. The         petitioners     are     having        the     copies       of    all   the

               documents and that the petitioners have selectively placed

               the documents in their petition. Various averments made by

               the petitioners in their petition will clearly show that the

               petitioners are having complete records of the State files.

               The petitioners' modus operandi is to grab the entire stretch

               of channel by illegitimate means, based on unrealistic

               demands. In the NOC dated 14.6.2007, there is no reference

               to any permission being granted to the petitioners to reclaim

               any portion of the area towards the south of the mangroves.

               The petitioners have no permission to reclaim any area

               towards the south of the mangroves out of 350 Hectares. If

               any reclamation is carried out towards the south of

            of the NOC dated 14.6.2007 granted by the Gujarat Maritime

            Board. For reclamation of 350 Hectares of land towards the

            south of the mangroves, no permission has been granted by

            the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests. The petitioners have

            not placed on record any document either from the GPCB or

            from the GCZMA, granting permission to the petitioners to

            reclaim any land out of the alleged 350 Hectares for which

            NOC was issued by the Gujarat Maritime Board on the south

            of the mangroves. The claim made by the petitioners for

            319.86 Hectares was merely an eyewash and the objective

            was to grab more area under the garb of the so-called

            reclamation. The permission granted by the GPCB or GCZMA

            for 1100 meters and/or 3700 meters waterfront would not

            make any reclamation towards the south of the mangroves

            legal or in compliance with the provisions of law. The

            petitioners have violated the provisions of law by dumping

            the dredged material in the area towards the south of the

            mangroves. The letters annexed at RD-1 (Colly) to the

            affidavit in rejoinder are not permissions for deepening or

            widening of the channel as sought to be claimed by the

            petitioners.   The   said    letters       are      in    respect       of    the

            navigational safety and piloting capability of the pilots. No

            letters addressed by the 1st respondent or 2nd respondent,

            giving alleged assurances to the petitioners, are placed on

            record by the petitioners. The MOUs entered into by the

            petitioners would not create any right in support of their

            claim.         The proposal for 3700 meters of waterfront                            is

            essentially for commercial purposes. The letter dated

            18.1.2016 addressed by the petitioners is an afterthought.

            Even otherwise, the claim made by the petitioners vide their

            letter     dated     18.1.2016      is     for     commercial          purposes.

            Respondent no.4            has denied the allegation of the

            petitioners that parent company of the petitioners had

            entered into an agreement for usage of the captive jetty in

            the year 1994 itself. The petitioners are well aware that,

            during the period of the Concession Agreement, no captive

            jetty will be permitted to carry out the activities of LNG or

            container handling or related activities. The petitioners are

            further aware that the period of 10 years does not apply in

            respect of the aforesaid. Neither the Concession Agreement

            nor the Sub-Concession Agreement is under challenge

            before this Court. The petitioners, by the present petition,

            cannot carry out fishing and roving inquiry. The petitioners

            have failed completely to show any vested right and

            therefore, the petition is liable to be rejected on this ground

            alone. It is the say of the petitioners that they have no

            objection to the alteration of the limits of Hazira Port so long

            as such extension does not overlap the area being claimed

            to be reclaimed and developed by the petitioners. Therefore,

            it is the claim of the petitioners that they have a right over

            regard, it is stated that no permission has been obtained by

            the    petitioners   from    the        Gujarat     Maritime        Board          for

            reclamation of the area towards the south of the mangroves,

            and the petitioners have illegally reclaimed the area towards

            the south of the mangroves. The petitioners, in their

            proposal for further deepening and widening of the channel,

            had declared before the Gujarat Maritime Board that the

            area which is being reclaimed towards the south of the

            mangroves pursuant to further deepening and widening of

            the channel would be available to the Board for whatever

            purpose as it may like. It is stated that deepening and

            widening of the channel including the reclamation made by

            the petitioners had been made illegally and wrongfully.

            Assuming that such permissions are granted by the Gujarat

            Maritime Board, the petitioners cannot claim any right over

            the reclaimed land and therefore, the petitioners have no

            right over the illegally reclaimed land.

            being looked towards the south of the Bulk/General Cargo

            solution on various grounds as envisaged while addressing

            the letter dated 14.3.2015 to the Gujarat Maritime Board.

            achieve the objectives as mentioned in the BOOT Policy,

            entitled for any extension plans or that they have suffered

            loss on account of the Notification dated 18.1.2016, it is

            stated that no other    owners of           the captive jetty in the

            Magdalla Port have been treated in the manner in which the

            petitioners are treated. It is stated that no other owners of

            created by execution of the MOUs or any promises have

            been made by the State Government under the said MOUs.

            The said MOUs were entered into by the 1st respondent, only

            to facilitate necessary approvals/permissions in accordance

            with law, in         particular industries, which are set up in the

            State     of Gujarat. The MOUs entered into between the 1st

            petitioner company and the Government of Gujarat do not

            entitle        the   1st   petitioner          company          to     make         any

            wrongful/illegal claim or permit any activity in violation of

            the provisions of law. The application of the 1st petitioner

            company          for allotment of 3700 meters of waterfront is

            essentially for commercial purpose and the same is evident

            rejoinder, it is stated that the 1st petitioner company is

            reclaiming or has reclaimed the land including deepening

            and widening of the channel illegally, without seeking any

            prior permission of the 2nd respondent Board. Though there

            is no vested right created in favour of the petitioners, the

            petitioners have challenged the Notification dated 18th

            January 2016 on the ground that the said Notification

            encroaches upon the land reclaimed by the petitioners. In

            such circumstances, the 4th respondent is justified in

            bringing it to the notice of this Court that no permission is

            obtained by the 1st petitioner company for deepening and

            widening of the channel and it has also not obtained any

            permission for reclamation area towards the south of the

            mangroves. The reclamation carried out by the petitioners is

            illegal and in violation of the statutory provisions. The

            petitioners have not claimed any right over the illegally

            reclaimed area and the said illegal reclamation made by the

            petitioners will not confer any right upon the petitioners and

            in the absence of the said right, the petitioners have no

            respondent is based on the rights available under the BOOT

            Policy, Concession Agreement and Bulk/General Cargo

            the 4th respondent vide letter dated 14.3.2015 is not

            accurate. The story put up by the petitioners on the alleged

            assurances is not reflected in any of the letters addressed by

            the 2nd respondent-Board and/or the 1st respondent to the

            petitioners. The petitioners are not entitled to take any

            commercial operation in their captive jetty. The order

            passed by the National Green Tribunal is neither germane

            nor relevant to the issues raised in the petition. If the order

            passed by the National Green Tribunal is the relevant

            consideration as sought to be alleged by the petitioners,

            then, in that case, the petition filed by the petitioners would

            not be maintainable in view of several orders passed by

            different forums against the Essar Group of Companies.

            rejoinder, while denying the statements made therein, which

            are contrary to the case of the 4th respondent, it is stated

            that the said averments are false and completely an

            afterthought. In the letter dated 19.4.2016, addressed by

            the 1st petitioner to the 2nd respondent Board, it is, inter alia,

            stated that based on              the review by the technology

            providers of the 1st petitioner, it was found that                              the

            proposed FSRU facility of the 1st petitioner could be most

            rapidly implemented in the vicinity of the north reclamation

            area where both, the navigational channel and reclamation

            are     well   stabilized   and      therefore,             geared        up        for

                  north      reclamation     area       on      the     advice       of    technical

                  addressed by the Essar Group to the 1st respondent, it was

                  proposed that the LNG facility would be located at the

                  southern reclamation. In the said letter, there is no

                  reference to the letter dated 19.4.2016 addressed by the 1st

                  petitioner to the 2nd respondent-Board. Further, there is no

                  changed based on any advice of the technical consultants.

                  In the circumstances, the averments made in the said

                  paragraph are false and completely an afterthought. Even

                  otherwise, the alleged report annexed with the affidavit in

                  rejoinder is dated 19.5.2016, that is, much after the

                  aforesaid letter dated 13.5.2016. From the correspondence

                  annexed with the petition, it is clear that the proposed LNG

                  terminal is also for commercial purpose. The petitioners are

                  very well aware that they cannot set up any LNG terminal

                  facility during the term of the Concession Agreement.

         petitioners, through various promises/MOUs entered into by the

         1st and 2nd respondent with the petitioners. It is the case of the

         petitioners that having regard to the MOUs entered into and the

         NOC issued by the 2nd respondent, the petitioners have made

         huge investment and the respondents cannot resile from the

         promise, and therefore, the petitioners are entitled to the

         benefit     of    doctrine    of     legitimate         expectation          and      the

         respondents        are   estopped         from        issuing       the     impugned

         Notification. It is submitted that the impugned Notification is

         issued in violation of fundamental rights of the petitioners

         guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_27">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India by

         extending the limits of Hazira Port, which would give the 3rd and

         developed by the petitioners.

<p id="p_115">         22.1. It is submitted that increase in the allotment of

            waterfront and the backup area allotted under the original

            Concession Agreement after the bidding process, in fact,

            constitutes changing/altering the terms and conditions of

            the bid. Therefore, extension of the limits of Hazira Port

            would result in indirectly granting the HPPL to expand its

            activities in the extended port area without bidding. It is

            submitted that it is settled law that the State cannot seek to

            do indirectly what it cannot do directly and the State

            competitive bidding. It is further contended that pursuant to

            various permissions and the MOUs entered into between the

            petitioners and the respondent authorities, the 1st petitioner

            company is permitted to deepen and widen the channel and

            large area is reclaimed on the mudflat area. Though the 1st

            petitioner company is           entitled for allotment of additional

            waterfront and the reclaimed area, which                           caused huge

            expenditure to the petitioners running into                           more than

            Rs.1500        Crores,   the     respondents            have       illegally     and

            arbitrarily issued the impugned order altering the limits of

            Hazira Port, which infringes the rights of the petitioners with

            regard to their claim for allotment of additional waterfront

            and the reclaimed area.
</p>
<p id="p_116">         22.2. Based on the promises given and the understanding

            arrived at, the 1st petitioner company had changed its

            position by spending huge amounts, and it was legitimately

            expecting the allotment of such area in its favour. But

            abruptly and illegally, the impugned Notification was issued

            altering the limits of Hazira Port. It is submitted that though

            the application of the 1st petitioner company for allotment of

            additional waterfront area of 3700 meters and allotment of

            the reclaimed area was earlier in point of time, without

            conducting any inquiry and without giving an opportunity of

            hearing, the application of the 3rd and 4th respondents was

            considered in haste and the impugned Notification was

            issued. Though the rights of the petitioners company are

            seriously affected by the impugned Notification, the 1st

            petitioner company was not given any opportunity of

            hearing before such decision was taken by the respondents.

         22.3. It is further contended that the proposal, at the first

            instance, submitted by the 3rd respondent on 21.7.2014 to

            the 2nd respondent for extension of limits of Hazira port due

            to the navigation reasons on the seaward side, did not in

            any manner affect the rights of the 1st petitioner company as

            there was no overlapping of the area. But subsequently, the

            3rd respondent had revised its request for extension of port

            limits     on   14.3.2015          and       such      proposal         completely

            overlapped the area developed by the 1st petitioner

            company. After submission of the                       application of the 3rd

            respondent for revision of port limits, the 2nd respondent has

            readily approved the revised proposal of the 3rd respondent

            on 19.3.2015. On coming to know of the approval granted

            by the Gujarat Maritime Board as per the revised proposal

            submitted       by   the     3rd    respondent           on     14.3.2015,         the

            petitioners have submitted detailed representation to the

            State. Thereafter, the State Government called upon the

            Gujarat Maritime Board by letter dated 21.6.15 to respond

            to the objections of the petitioners. However, the 2nd

            respondent, vide letter dated 16.7.2015, indicated that none

            of the concerns/objections raised by the petitioners were

            valid. However, based on the further representation made

            by the 1st petitioner company to the State, the State

            Government requested the Gujarat Maritime Board vide

            letter dated 26th August 2015 to consider the issue of

            extension of the port limits of Hazira in its Board meeting

            and send the same to the Government. It is submitted that

            after the letter dated 26th August 2015, addressed by the 1st

            respondent State to the 2nd respondent, the 2nd respondent

            approved the original proposal dated 21.7.2014, which did

            not overlap the area developed by the petitioners and such

            Resolution passed on 28.9.2015 was forwarded to the State

            Government. Surprisingly, on 5th December 2015, the Chief

            Principal Secretary prepared a Note ignoring the Resolution

            passed by the 2nd respondent on 28.9.2015 and based on

            such Note, the 1st respondent-State, contrary to the

            Resolution of the 2nd respondent, issued the impugned

            Notification illegally and arbitrarily. It is submitted that such

            impugned Notification was issued only to favour the 3rd and

            4th respondents under the garb of extension of port limits,

            which is nothing but colourable exercise of power. It is

            therefore, submitted that for the aforesaid reasons, the

            impugned Notification is fit to be quashed and set aside.

         22.4. In support of his contentions and submissions, learned

         State of Gujarat, the State Government invited private

         investments in existing minor and intermediate ports, and in

         the new port locations, which also included the Port of Hazira.

         It was envisaged that the Port of Hazira would be privatized

         through       global tendering process and ultimately, it was

         allotted to the 3rd respondent for development. The 2nd

         respondent-Board had conducted techno-economic feasibility

         report of all the locations, including Hazira. Under the Port

         Policy, it is provided that to ensure that the new port projects

         are financially viable, permissions for captive jetties would be

         given only in exceptional cases, looking to the quantum of

         investment and the need for specialized facilities. As per the

         Policy, all the industrial units would be encouraged to make use

         of new port facilities.
</p>
<p id="p_126">         23.1. On 29th July 1997, the Government of Gujarat also

            announced Build, Own, Operate &amp; Transfer (BOOT) Policy,

            which provides a framework for involvement of private

            sector in the construction and operation of new ports. BOOT

            Policy also provides for expansion of facilities. Pursuant to a

            global tender, a Concession Agreement was entered into

            with the 3rd respondent, and the 4th respondent is Sub-

            Concessionaire. It is contended by the learned Advocate

            General that at the time of signing of the Concession

            Agreement, the developer will submit, and get approved by

            the 2nd respondent-Board, a broad perspective plan for the

            development of the port in the next fifteen to twenty years.

            It further provides that the State Government will not place

            restrictions on any expansion and further development of

            the port, which is within the envisaged perspective plan,

            subject to statutory clearances. The BOOT Policy also

            provides that expansion outside the scope of this plan would

            be subject to the approval of the 2nd respondent-Gujarat

            Maritime Board.

<p id="p_127">         23.2. It is further contended that as per the provisions of the

            <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_33">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908, read with the Port Policy and the

            BOOT Policy notified by the State of Gujarat, powers for

            extension of port limits are statutorily conferred upon the 1st

            respondent-Government. The 1st petitioner company, which

            is permitted to construct captive jetty for transportation of

            raw materials to the Steel Plants set up by the Essar Group

            and to export the finished products, cannot be compared

            with the 3rd respondent, which is a concessionaire and which

            entered into the Concession Agreement, pursuant to the

            global tender floated by the respondents. It is submitted that

            the power to extend the limits of port is within the domain of

            the 1st respondent and the 1st respondent exercised the said

            power by extending the limits by the impugned Notification

            for valid reasons, in view of the proposal made by the 3rd

            respondent initially on 21.7.2014, as revised on 14.3.2015.

            there was never clear and unequivocal promise either by the

            State Government or by the 2nd respondent-Board for

            allotting 3700 meters            of waterfront and 334 Hectares of

            backup area claimed to have been reclaimed or sought to be

            reclaimed by the petitioners, in addition to 2698 meters of

            waterfront and 178 Hectares of reclaimed land, which is

            already        allotted   in    favour         of    the      petitioners.        The

            right/promise as claimed by the petitioners, cannot be

            inferred either from the No Objection Certificate issued by

            the 2nd respondent-Board on 14.6.2007, or from the MOUs

            dated 30.9.2007, 13.1.2011 and 11.1.2013. In spite of the

            same, the petitioners, in the absence of any right conferred

            upon them, are claiming right contrary to the conditions

            mentioned in the NOC dated 14.6.2007, which is issued by

            the 2nd respondent-Board and also the terms of the MOU,

            and are thus illegally and unauthorizedly trying to convert

            the captive jetty for commercial purpose. There is absolutely

            no basis for extension of waterfront or additional area and

            under the guise of claiming rights under the so-called MOU,

            without any right, the petitioners have filed this petition. The

            plea of development of the waterfront and reclaimed area at

            huge cost is without any basis for claiming the waterfront

            and reclaimed area, as a matter of right. Such rights are

            sovereign rights, which are conferred by the State for valid

            reasons. In the absence of any legal right accrued to the

            petitioners, this petition is filed challenging the validity of

            the impugned Notification dated 18.1.2016, which is in

            accordance with     the terms of the Port Policy and BOOT

            Policy of the Government.                Even assuming that the

            application of the 1st petitioner company was earlier in point

            of time, that by itself would not            confer any right on the

            petitioners. In any event, having regard to the claim of the

            petitioners, out of the reclaimed area, the area to the extent

            of 140 Hectares was already allotted in favour of the

            petitioners, in addition to 38 Hectares which was earlier

            allotted. In the absence of any legal right or claim, merely on

            the ground that its application was earlier in point of time,

            the 1st petitioner company cannot seek any relief contrary to

            the statutory provisions and the Policies of the Government.

            As no rights of the petitioners are affected, the petitioners

            are not entitled for hearing before the decision was taken by

            the respondent authorities. The allegation of the petitioners

            that decision taken by the 1st respondent is contrary to the

            proposal approved by the 2nd respondent-Board is also

            without any basis. In any event, the 1st respondent-

            Government is the authority to consider the proposal of the

            3rd and 4th respondents, and the note prepared by the Chief

            Principal Secretary also cannot be said to be contrary to the

            proposals approved by the 2nd respondent-Board. In absence

            of any right conferred on the petitioners, it is not open to the

            petitioners to challenge the impugned Notification on the

            ground that the altered limits are overlapping the area

            developed by them. In fact, the 2nd respondent-Board had

            granted No Objection Certificate for deepening and widening

            of the channel and dredging of the channel for dumping the

            dredged material in the mudflat area, which would cut the

            cost of transportation of the petitioners. In spite of the same,

            by making false plea of huge expenditure, the petitioners

            are trying to lay claim, to which the petitioners, otherwise,

            are not entitled to. In any event, the petitioners' private

            interest has always to remain subservient to the interest of

            public at large involved in commercial port of Hazira.

         petitioners have not claimed any right to property, so as to

         challenge the validity of the impugned Notification. It is

         submitted that the waterfront is sovereign right of the

         Government and ownership of captive jetty vests with the

         Gujarat Maritime Board. The petitioners have no right, title or

         interest or other property right in respect of the structure of

         captive jetty. The petitioners have only right to use the captive

         jetty, which is permitted to be constructed by                           the 2nd

         respondent-Board and no other right flows therefrom.

         24.1. While granting No Objection Certificate dated 14.6.2007,

            it is clearly mentioned that the ownership of the reclaimed

            land vests with the 2nd respondent - Gujarat Maritime Board,

            expenditure incurred by it for reclamation. It is further

            of the waterfront and reclaimed area for captive use,

            pursuant to letter dated 15.11.2012, was not acceded to and

            the impugned Notification is issued for alteration of port

            limits, and therefore, the petitioners have not acquired any

            right to seek validation of the impugned Notification by way

            of writ of mandamus. It is submitted that the Memoranda of

            Understanding (MOUs) are non-committal documents and

            they will not confer any right on the petitioners to claim

            either by legitimate expectation or promissory estoppal. At

            common user port facility and makes optimum use of

            industrial resources. The petitioners were permitted to

            construct the captive jetty at the port of Magdalla and it is

            specific industry based. The captive jetty was permitted to

            basis, subject to maximum of 50% of captive cargo out of

            total     cargo.   The     petitioners           were      granted        one-time

            and the backup area is for commercial purpose.                                  It is

           Shri Sandeep Singhi and Mr. Ishan Joshi for Singhi &amp; Co.,

           Advocates, for the 4th respondent, has submitted that to create

           port facilities, the State of Gujarat has notified the Policy to

           have the participation of private sector in the development of

           port infrastructure. Hazira Port is one of the ports notified for

           such development, through global tender. As per the Port

           Policy, to ensure that the new port projects are financially

           viable, permission for captive jetties is restricted to exceptional

           circumstances, looking to the quantum of investment and the

           need for specialized facilities. The Policy provides that all

           industrial units would be encouraged to make use of new port

           facilities being set up. Because of high capital cost of

           constructing a port, various facilities are provided in the Policy

           and the Concession Agreements were entered into, in line with

           the provisions of the Port Policy and the BOOT Policy. The

         envisaged development of 13 berths but only 5 berths were

         developed. Development of further berths requires further land.

         The 3rd and the 4th respondents requested for expansion of port

         limits to the south of the Hazira Port to create more berths. The

         area to the south of Hazira Port was vacant and the same was

         not part of the backup or storage for Magdalla Port and,

         therefore, there is no encroachment over the area of Magdalla

         Port. The petitioners, by entering into an agreement had

         constructed captive jetty, wherein, it is stipulated that Essar

         shall abide by all Rules, Regulations and Notifications framed

         under the Gujarat Maritime Board Act, 1981 and the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_58">Indian

         Ports Act</a>, as may be in force from time to time. Therefore, the

         petitioners are bound by the impugned Notification dated 18th

         January 2016. It is submitted that having regard to the nature

         of construction permitted to the petitioners for captive jetty,

         which is an industry based, there are no competing claims

         between the petitioners and the 3rd and the 4th respondents.

         When the claim of the 3rd and the 4th respondents is within the

         framework of the Port Policy, BOOT Policy and the provisions of

         the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_59">Indian Ports Act</a>, the petitioners have no legal right to seek

         repeated extensions to convert the captive jetty into a

         commercial port. The claim of the petitioners is also in violation

         of the provisions of the Gujarat Infrastructure Development Act,

         1999. It is submitted that no rights are created in favour of the

         petitioners of whatsoever nature and the claim of the

                facilities like roads and railways in the hinterland. It is
                estimated that around 3 billion Dollars (Rs. 10,000
                crores) would be required to create new port facilities
                along with necessary infrastructure in the coming 5
                years. In view of the fact that ships of large sizes are
                used in the transportation, the economies of scale in
                international trade, ports would be developed with direct
                berthing facilities and speedy mechanical handling
                facilities, so as to reduce waiting period of the ships and
                saving in the cargo expenses. To expedite creation of
                port facilities by 2000 AD, it is proposed to have the
                participation of private enterprise in the development of
                port infrastructure.

         of their claim is No Objection Certificate dated 14.6.2007 issued

         by the 2nd respondent Board, and the MOUs entered into by it

         of existing captive jetty for Essar Steel Limited) at Hazira in Port

         of Magdalla. Under Clause 1(c) of the License Agreement

         entered into by the petitioners with the 2nd respondent-Gujarat

         Maritime Board, deep water captive jetty would mean, 550

         meters deep water berth developed by the licensee as second

               of the Constitution of India. Further, perusing various clauses

               which are mentioned in the above-referred MOUs, relied on

               by the petitioners, it is clear that no rights are granted to the

               petitioners under the said MOUs and the said MOUs are

               entered into with a broad-based understanding by the

               petitioners for future projects. In that view of the matter and

               having considered the conditions/clauses contained in the

               said MOUs, it is abundantly clear that no rights are assigned

               to the petitioners by the said MOUs and the petitioners are

               not entitled to claim any right under the said MOUs or NOC

               granted by the 2nd respondent on 14.6.2007, nor any right

               will flow from the said MOUs and the NOC granted by the 2nd

               respondent in favour of the petitioners. In any event, having

               obtained the NOC dated 14.6.2007, subject to certain

               conditions, the petitioners cannot claim any reimbursement

               of the expenditure incurred by them for deepening of the

               channel, and the reclaimed area will be at the disposal of

               the 2nd respondent-Board. The petitioners cannot turn

               around and plead that they are entitled for waterfront and

               reclaimed area, on the ground of doctrine of legitimate

               expectation or under the guise of promissory estoppel.

         treat the citizens with full personal consideration without any

         iota of abuse of discretion. Policy statements cannot be

         disregarded unfairly or applied selectively. The said doctrine

         can be applied in cases where a person had been given a

         permit by the decision-maker and subsequent change in the

         policy contrary to the expectation in furtherance of such permit

         is either express or implied.

<p id="p_211">         31.1. In the instant case, at no point of time, any right was

            conferred or any promise was given to the petitioners so as

            to accept the claim of the petitioners on the ground of

            principle of legitimate expectation. Equally, theory of

            promissory estoppel put forth by the petitioners also cannot

            be accepted. The principle of promissory estoppel provides

            that if a promise is made in an expectation that it would be

            acted upon, and it was in fact acted upon by the promisee,

            who alters his position in reliance of the promise. In such

            cases, the promisor will not be allowed to back out of it

            when it would be inequitable to do so. In the instant case, no

            material is placed by the petitioners to show that at any

            point of time the 1st and the 2nd respondents had given any

            promise to accept the claim of the petitioners that in

            expectation of permission for extension of waterfront and

           reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

           Court Cases 71, in support of                his argument of legitimate

           expectation. In the aforesaid judgment, while considering the

           scope of legitimate expectation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

           paras-7 and 8 has held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">                  "7. In contractual sphere as in all other State actions, the
                  State and all its instrumentalities have to conform to
                  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_94">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of which non-arbitrariness is
                  a significant facet. There is no unfettered discretion in
                  public law: A public authority possesses powers only to
                  use them for public good. This impose the duty to act
                  fairly and to adopt a procedure which is 'fair play in
                  action'. Due observance of this obligation as a part of
                  good administration raises a reasonable or legitimate
                  expectation in every citizen to be treated fairly in his
                  interaction with the State and its instrumentalities, with
                  this element forming a necessary component of the
                  decision making process in all State actions. To satisfy
                  this requirement of non arbitrariness in a State action, it
                  is, therefore, necessary to consider and give due weight
                  to the reasonable or legitimate expectations of the
                  persons likely to be affected by the decision or else that
                  unfairness in the exercise of the power may amount to
                  an abuse or excess of power apart from affecting the
                  bona fides of the decision in a given case. The decision
                  so made would be exposed to challenge on the ground of
                  arbitrariness. Rule of law does not completely eliminate
                  discretion in the exercise of power, as it is unrealistic, but
                  providers for control of its exercise by judicial review.

                citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct
                enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due
                weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is
                how the requirement of due consideration of a Legitimate
                expectation forms part of the principle of non
                arbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law.
                Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring
                due consideration a fair decision making process.
                Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable or
                legitimate in the context is a question of fact in each
                case. Whenever the question arises, it is to be
                determined not according to the claimant's perception
                but in larger public interest wherein other more
                important considerations may outweigh what would
                otherwise have been the legitimate expectation of the
                claimant. A bona fide decision of the public authority
                reached in this manner would satisfy the requirement of
                non-arbitrariness and withstand judicial scrutiny. The
                doctrine of legitimate expectation gets assimilated in the
                rule of law and operates in our legal system in this

                  "8. A person may have a 'legitimate expectation' of being
                  treated in a certain way by an administrative authority
                  even though he has no legal right in private law to
                  receive such treatment. The expectation may arise either
                  from a representation or promise made by the authority,
                  including an implied representation, or from consistent
                  past practice. The doctrine of legitimate expectation has
                  an important place in the developing law of judicial
                  review. It is, however, not necessary to explore the
                  doctrine in this case, it is enough merely to note that a
                  legitimate expectation can provide a sufficient interest to
                  enable one who cannot point to the existence of a
                  substantive right to obtain the leave of the court to apply
                  for judicial review. It is generally agreed that 'legitimate
                  expectation' gives the applicant sufficient locus standi for
                  judicial review and that the doctrine of legitimate
                  expectation to be confined mostly to right to a fair
                  hearing before a decision which results in negativing a
                  promise or withdrawing an undertaking is taken. The
                  doctrine does not give scope to claim relief straightway
                  from the administrative authorities as no crystallized
                  right as such involved. The protection of such legitimate
                  expectation does not require the fulfillment of the
                  expectation where an overriding public interest requires
                  otherwise. In other words, where a person's legitimate
                  expectation is not fulfilled by taking a particular decision
                  then decision maker should justify the denial of such
                  expectation by showing some overriding public interest.

           promissory        estoppel,      it    depends              on     the      facts     and

           and the policies of the Government, etc. When the petitioners

           they cannot claim contrary to the terms and conditions of the

           NOC granted by the 2nd respondent as well as the clauses

           contained in the various MOUs. It is to be noticed that what is

           granted to the petitioners is the permission for captive jetty,

           which itself is industry based one, for which facility is provided

           for transportation of raw materials and finished products.

           Without satisfying the authorities of their claim for requirement

           of additional area of waterfront or backup land, by merely

           asking by way of representation, the petitioners cannot expect

           that such extension should be granted and complain about the

           impugned Notification, which is issued by the 1st respondent in

           exercise of statutory power under <a href="/doc/1264783/" id="a_96">section 5(1)</a> of the Indian

           Ports Act. The claim of the petitioners by way of representation

           has absolutely no relevance and is not comparable to the

           application of the 3rd respondent for extending the port limits

           for the reasons mentioned in the application. Consideration of

           such application is exclusively within the domain of the

           Government and when the same is considered as per the Port

           Policy and the BOOT Policy, it cannot be said that extension of

           port limits on the application of 3rd respondent is made in

           violation         of   the   provisions          under        the      Infrastructure

           clauses are incorporated to encourage the private developers

           for developing the ports for expansion etc. When such

           expansion is permissible as per the Policy notified by the

           respondents, which is in conformity with the provisions under

           the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_97">Indian Ports Act</a>, 1908, it is not open for the petitioners to

           plead that the impugned Notification, altering the port limits,

           will confer undue benefits on the 3rd and the 4th respondents

           without inviting the global bid. On the other hand, by obtaining

           jetty license for captive purpose, the petitioners cannot make

           the port as commercial port. The right which is conferred on the

           petitioners is the right limited for operating the jetty, which is

           owned by the 2nd respondent-Board, for the purpose of

           transportation of raw material and finished products. As a one

           time facility, commercial cargo is also permitted, but subject to

           the condition of 50% cargo for captive purpose. By claiming

           repeated extensions for the purpose of captive jetty, in fact, the

           petitioners seek to convert the captive jetty into commercial

           port. Such claim of the petitioners cannot be granted in view of

           the provisions under the Gujarat Infrastructure Development

           Act, 1999 and the same would be in violation of the provisions

           under sections 8,9 and 10 of the Gujarat Infrastructure

                writs for enforcement of fundamental rights as well as
                non-fundamental or ordinary legal rights, which may
                come within the expression 'for any other purpose'. The

                discretionary and no limits can be placed upon their
                discretion, it must be exercised along recognized lines
                and subject to certain self-imposed limitations. The
                expression 'for any other purpose' in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_101">Article 226</a>, makes
                the jurisdiction of the High Courts more extensive but yet
                the Court must exercise the same with certain restraints
                and within some parameters. One of the conditions for
                exercising power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_102">Article 226</a> for issuance of a
                mandamus is that the Court must come to the conclusion
                that the aggrieved person has a legal right, which
                entitles him to any of the rights and that such right has
                been infringed. In other words, existence of a legal right
                of a citizen and performance of any corresponding legal
                duty by the State or any public authority, could be

                  imposed by the Constitution, a statute, common law or

                  aforesaid principle are applied to the case in hand, the
                  so-called right of the respondents, depending upon the
                  conclusion that the amendment Act is constitutionally
                  invalid and, therefore, the right to get interim payment
                  will continue till the final decision of the Board of
                  Revenue cannot be sustained when the Supreme Court
                  itself has upheld the constitutional validity of the
                  amendment Act in Venkatagiri's case on 4th of February,

                  declared in the said appeal that interim payments are
                  payable till determination is made by the Director under
                  <a href="/doc/1390738/" id="a_104">Section 39(1)</a>. The High Court in exercise of power of
                  issuance of mandamus could not have said anything
                  contrary to that on the ground that the earlier judgment
                  in favour of the respondents became final, not being
                  challenged. The impugned mandamus issued by the
                  Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the
                  teeth of the declaration made by the Supreme Court as
                  to the constitutionality of the amendment Act would be
                  an exercise of power and jurisdiction when the
                  respondents did not have the subsisting legally
                  enforceable right under the very Act itself. In the
                  aforesaid circumstances, we have no hesitation to come
                  to the conclusion that the High Court committed serious
                  error in issuing the mandamus in question for
                  enforcement of the so-called right which never subsisted
                  on the date, the Court issued the mandamus in view of
                  the decision of this Court in Venkatagiri's case. In our
                  view, therefore, the said conclusion of the High Court

         General in the case of <a href="/doc/79317857/" id="a_105">P.T.R. Exports (Madras) Pvt. Ltd and

         others vs. Union of India and others</a>, reported in (1996) 5

         Supreme Court Cases 268, wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme

         Court has held that the doctrine of legitimate expectation plays

         no role when the appropriate authority is empowered to take a

         decision by executive policy or under the law. Paras 3, 4 and 5

         of the said judgment read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">                "3.    In the light of the above policy question emerges
                whether the Government is bound by the previous policy
                or whether it can revise its policy in view of the changed
                potential foreign markets and the need for earning
                foreign exchange? It is true that in a given set of facts,
                the Government may in the appropriate case be bound
                by the doctrine of promissory estoppel evolved in Union
                of India Vs. Indo- Afghan Agencies [(1968) 2 SCR 366].
                But the question revolves upon the validity of the
                withdrawal of the previous policy and introduction of the
                new policy. The doctrine of legitimate expectations again
                requires to be angulated thus: whether it was revised by
                a policy in the public interest or the decision is based
                upon any abuse of the power? The power to lay policy by
                executive decision or by legislation includes power to
                withdraw the same unless in the former case, it is by
                malafide exercise of power or the decision or action
                taken is in abuse of power. The doctrine of legitimate
                expectation plays no role when the appropriate authority
                is empowered to take a decision by an executive policy or
                under law. The Court leaves the authority to decide its
                full range of choice within the executive or legislative
                power. In matters of economic policy, it is a settled law
                that the Court gives the large leeway to the executive
                and the legislature. Granting licences for import or export
                is by executive or legislative policy. Government would
                take diverse factors for formulating the policy for import
                or export of the goods granting relatively greater
                priorities to various items in the overall larger interest of
                the economy of the country. It is, therefore, by exercise
                of the power given to the executive or as the case may
                be, the legislature is at liberty to evolve such policies.</blockquote><p id="p_227">

                  date of his making application. For obvious reasons,
                  granting of licences depends upon the policy prevailing
                  on the date of the grant of the licence or permit. The
                  authority concerned may be in a better position to have
                  the overall picture of diverse factors to grant permit or
                  refuse to grant permission to import or export goods. The
                  decision, therefore, would be taken from diverse
                  economic perspectives which the executive is in a better
                  informed position unless, as we have stated earlier, the
                  refusal is mala fide or is an abuse of the power in which
                  event it is for the applicant to plead and prove to the
                  satisfaction of the Court that the refusal was vitiated by
                  the above factors.
</p>
<p id="p_229">                  5.     It would, therefore, be clear that grant of licence
                  depends upon the policy prevailing as on the date of the
                  grant of the licence. The Court, therefore, would not bind
                  the Government with a policy which was existing on the
                  date of application as per previous policy. A prior decision
                  would not bind the Government for all times to come.
                  When the Government are satisfied that change in the
                  policy was necessary in the public interest, it would be
                  entitled to revise the policy and lay down new policy. The
                  Court, therefore, would prefer to allow free play to the
                  Government to evolve fiscal policy in the public interest
                  and to act upon the same. Equally, the Government is left
                  free to determine priorities in the matters of allocations
                  or allotments or utilisation of its finances in the public
                  interest. It is equally entitled, therefore, to issue or
                  withdraw or modify the export or import policy in
                  accordance with the scheme evolved. We, therefore, hold
                  that the petitioners have no vested or accrued right for
                  the issuance of permits on the MEE or NQE, nor the
                  Government is bound by its previous policy. It would be
                  open to the Government to evolve the new schemes and
                  the petitioners would get their legitimate expectations
                  accomplished in accordance with either of the two
                  schemes subject to their satisfying the conditions
                  required in the scheme. The High Court, therefore, was
                  right in its conclusion that the Government are not barred
                  by the promises or legitimate expectations from evolving
                  new policy in the impugned notification."

                not require the fulfillment of the expectation where an
                overriding public interest requires otherwise. In other

                promise, and on that basis the party concerned must
                have acted to its prejudice. In the instant case it was only
                a proposal, and it was very much made clear that it was
                to be approved by the Central Government, prior whereto
                it could not be construed as containing a promise.
                Besides, equity cannot be used against a statutory
                provision or notification.

<p id="p_238">                290.         What the appellants are seeking is in a way
                some kind of a specific performance when there is no
                concluded contract between the parties. An MOU is not a
                contract, and not in any case within the meaning of
                <a href="/doc/1084525/" id="a_109">Article 299</a> of the Constitution of India. Barring one party
                (Adhunik) other parties do not appear to have taken
                further steps. In any case, in the absence of any promise,
                the appellants including Aadhunik cannot claim
                promissory estoppel in the teeth of the notifications
                issued under the relevant statutory powers. Alternatively,
                the appellants are trying to make a case under the
                doctrine of legitimate expectations. The basis of this
                doctrine is in reasonableness and fairness. However, it
                can also not be invoked where the decision of the public
                authority is founded in a provision of law, and is in
                consonance with public interest. As recently reiterated by
                this Court in the context of <a href="/doc/25127/" id="a_110">MMDR Act</a>, in Para 83 of
                Sandur Manganese (supra) 'it is a well settled principle
                that equity stands excluded when a matter if governed
                by statute'. We cannot entertain the submission of
                unjustified discrimination in favour of Bihar Sponge and
                Iron Ltd. As well for the reason that it was not pressed
                before the High Court nor was any material placed before

           2011 Supreme Court 1175, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has

           held that rule of promissory estoppel being equitable doctrine,

           it has to be moulded to suit the particular situation. It is held

           that where public interest warrants, the principle of promissory

           estoppel, cannot be invoked.

<p id="p_243">         44.          By applying the above principles enunciated in the

           judgments referred above, which are relied on by the learned

           counsel for the respondents, we are of the considered view that

           in the absence of any rights assigned to the petitioners either

           under the NOC dated 14.6.2007 issued by the 2nd respondent-

           Board or by the MOUs entered into by the petitioners with the

           respondent State and its authorities, and the clearances

           granted by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, Ministry of

           Environment &amp; Forests and Gujarat Coastal Zone Management

           Authority, the petitioners are not entitled to invoke either the

           doctrine of legitimate expectation or challenge the impugned

           Notification on the ground of promissory estoppel. What is

           granted to the petitioners is permission to dump the dredged

           material in the mudflat area. In the NOC dated 14.6.2007 itself,

           it is made clear that the petitioners will not have any claim over

           the reclaimed area. In view of such condition in the NOC dated

           14.6.2007, by merely relying on the MOUs in which also there

           are clear conditions that such MOUs will not confer any rights

         Notification, which is issued by the 2nd respondent in exercise of

         statutory power under <a href="/doc/1264783/" id="a_113">section 5(1)</a> of the Indian Ports Act,

         1908. Similarly, we reject the contention of the petitioners that,

         by extending the limits of Hazira by the impugned Notification,

         the 1st respondent is conferring the rights for the additional

         area in favour of the 3rd and the 4th respondents without inviting

         the bids and it amounts to distribution of public largess by

         violating the equality clause guaranteed under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_114">Article 14</a> of the

         Constitution of India. Having regard to               various affidavits in

         reply and further affidavits in reply filed on behalf of the

         respondents, coupled with the provisions under <a href="/doc/1179015/" id="a_115">sections 4</a> and

         <a href="/doc/315990/" id="a_116">5</a> of the Indian Ports Act, 1908, and the various clauses of the

         Port Policy of 1995 and BOOT Policy of 1997, it is clear that

         extension of port limits is permissible. It is evident from the

         affidavits in reply filed on behalf of the respondents that                         a

         Concession Agreement was entered into by the 2nd respondent

         with the 3rd respondent, pursuant to acceptance of the bid after

         issuance of a global tender and at that time, broad perspective

         for development of port was prepared. It was also agreed in the

         said Concession Agreement that the State Government will not

         place any restriction on any expansion and any further

         development of port, which is within the envisaged perspective

         plan, subject to statutory clearances. It was also made clear

         that expansion within the scope of the plan would be subject to

         approval by the 2nd respondent-Board. It is also the case of the

         2nd respondent in the affidavit in reply that when the global

         tender was floated by it or at the time of signing of the

         Concession Agreement dated 22.4.2002, the port limits of

         Hazira were not notified and the area was part of adjoining

         Magdalla Port. In October 2004 only, the State Government

         carved out of Magdalla Port, the limits of Hazira Port and had

         issued the Notification, notifying the limits of Hazira Port.

         Thereafter, the port limits of Hazira were revised in March 2010

         and thereafter, the request of the 3rd respondent to have the

         4th respondent as sub-concessionaire for non-LNG cargo, came

         to be accepted. In that view of the matter, it is clear that even

         the Concession Agreement contains such provision of extension

         of port limits, which is in conformity with the Policy notified by

         the Government. Having regard to the plea taken by the 1st

         respondent as referred above, coupled with the Port Policy and

         the statutory power conferred under <a href="/doc/315990/" id="a_117">section 5</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/150113/" id="a_118">Indian

         Ports Act</a>, 1908, it cannot be said that alteration of port limits

         by the impugned Notification, amounts to distributing public

         largess without inviting the bids. In fact, the Concession

         Agreement entered into with the 3rd respondent is pursuant to

         the global tender, which itself is in accordance with the Port

         Policy and the BOOT Policy. When the Concession Agreement

         was entered into with the 3rd respondent by the 1st and the 2nd

         respondents, based on such notified clause, pursuant to global

         tender and when the Concession Agreement has become final,

           the plea of the petitioners that the impugned Notification

           application of the petitioners was earlier in point of time and

           the same was kept pending for several years, on the other

           hand, when the 3rd respondent submitted the proposal on

           14.3.2015, the same was readily approved by the 2nd

           respondent-Board on 19.3.2015 within a few days. It is

           submitted that the said action of the                      2nd respondent in

           considering the proposal submitted by the 3rd respondent in

           haste, is nothing but colourable exercise of power in favour of

           the 3rd and the 4th respondents, without considering the

           application of the petitioners which was earlier in point of time

           for allotment of 3700 meters of waterfront and 334 Hectares of

           backup area. In support of the said contention, Shri Mihir Joshi,

           (2009) 10 Supreme Court Cases 388. In the judgment in the

           of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Procedure, Terms

           and Conditions for Grant of Trading Licence and Other Related

           Matters) Regulations, 2004, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held

           that by merely filing an application, one cannot acquire any

           vested right. The said case relates to an application for license

           under the Regulations framed under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_122">Electricity Act</a>, 2003. In

           the said judgment, it was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court

           that consideration of such grant must be based on a legal and

           valid statute. When the application is made for grant of a

           license under a particular regulation, which empowers the

           licensing authority to consider such application, the licensing

           authority is obliged to consider the same, and it is held to be so

           by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. When the application of the 1st

           petitioner company is not traceable to any Statute, Policy or

           Regulation, merely because the 1st petitioner had made claim

           by filing an application, that by itself is no ground to consider

           considering the pending application of the 1st petitioner, which

           was earlier in point of time. It is true that the application of the

         transportation of raw materials of Essar Group of companies'

         steel industry and for finished products. After initial grant, the

         1st petitioner company went on applying from time to time for

         extending the waterfront and backup area. Several times, the

         said application was considered for extending of waterfront.

         However, merely because an application is filed, it is not

         obligatory on the part of the respondents to consider the same

         for extension of waterfront and backup area whenever it was

         asked for.        From the various applications filed by the 1st

         petitioner company, which are placed on record, it is clear that

         the very claim of the 1st petitioner company for extending

         waterfront and backup area is for commercial operations, and

         the 1st petitioner has not justified the need for requirement of

         its captive purpose. In the absence of any justification and the

         material placed on record, the petitioners cannot make claim as

         a matter of right. Further, the claim of the petitioners is not

         comparable with the application of the 3rd and the 4th

         respondents, which is for the purpose of altering the port limits

         to have additional berths. In the absence of any basis for the

         claim of the petitioners, only because application of the

         petitioners was prior in point of time, is no ground for seeking

         invalidation of the impugned Notification, which was issued by

         the 1st respondent in exercise of its statutory power under

         <a href="/doc/1264783/" id="a_126">Section 5(1)</a> of the Indian Ports Act, 1908. At the same time, it

         also cannot be said that the application of the 3rd and the 4th

           respondent was considered in haste. The proposal                                           of

           respondents           dated   14.3.2015          was       revised       proposal          in

           continuation of the earlier proposal of the 3rd respondent

           submitted on 21.7.2014, wherein, the 3rd respondent sought

           extension of limits of Hazira Port due to navigation reasons on

           the seaward. In that view of the matter, it cannot be said that

           the 2nd respondent had considered the proposal of the 3rd and

           the 4th respondents in haste. There is no legal basis for the

           petitioners to claim consideration of their application as a

           matter of right, inasmuch as the application of the 3rd

           respondent dated 14.3.2015 was in continuation of the original

           proposal dated 21.7.2014. The judgment relied upon by the

           learned counsel for the petitioners would not support their

           case, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case

           on hand. Accordingly, we reject the contention of the

           petitioners that the application of the 3rd and the 4th

           respondents was considered in haste and the said decision is a

           colourable exercise of power to favour the 4th respondent.

</p><p id="p_248">         49.          At this stage, it is also relevant to note that after the

           approval of the revised proposals by the 2nd respondent-Board

           on 19.3.2015, the petitioners approached the 1st respondent by

           way of representation raising objections and upon raising of

           objections in the said representation, the 1st respondent -State

           had called for the remarks from the 2nd respondent and had

           requested the 2nd respondent-Board to send the remarks only

         their representation. It appears that the 2nd respondent-Board,

         vide letter dated 16.7.2015 sent the remarks, communicating

         that the objections raised by the petitioners were                         not valid.

         Further representation was also filed by the petitioners to the

         1st respondent and the 1st respondent requested the 2nd

         respondent-Board vide letter dated 26th August 2015 to

         consider the issue of extension of limits of Hazira Port in its

         Board meeting and then to send the remarks to the

         Government. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent-Board had taken a

         decision in its Board meeting and passed a resolution on

         28.9.2015, which was forwarded by it to the 1st respondent-

         State. Thereafter, the same was considered by the Government

         and the Government had approved the Resolution passed by

         the 2nd respondent-Board, whereby it has approved the revised

         proposal dated 15.3.2015 submitted by the 3rd respondent. In

         that view of the matter, it cannot be said that the 1st

         respondent        has   taken    steps        in    issuing       the     impugned

         Notification in haste and therefore, the impugned Notification

         suffers from colourable exercise of power. Even with reference

         to the allegation of the petitioners that the Principal Chief

         Secretary had prepared a Note contrary to the Resolution

         passed by the 2nd respondent-Board, the same also cannot be

         accepted as explained in the affidavit in reply and additional

         affidavit in reply filed by the 1st respondent. In any event, the

         regard, it is profitable to quote the observations made by the

         Kripalu Shankar</a> etc. etc., reported in AIR 1987 Supreme

<p id="p_249">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_64">                "It cannot be disputed that the appeal raises an
                important question of law bearing upon the proper
                functioning of a democratic Government. A Government
                functions by taking decisions on the strength of views
                and suggestions expressed by the various officers at
                different levels, ultimately getting finality at the hands of
                the Minister concerned. Till then, conflicting opinions,
                views and suggestions would have emanated from
                various officers at the lower level. There should not be
                any fetter on the fearless and independent expression of
                opinions by officers on matters coming before them
                through the files. This is so even when they consider
                orders of courts. Officers of the Government are often
                times confronted with orders of courts, impossible of
                immediate compliance for various reasons. They may
                find it difficult to meekly submit to such orders. On such
                occasions they will necessarily have to note in the files,
                the reasons why the orders cannot be complied with and
                also indicate that the courts would not have passed these
                orders if full facts were placed before them. The
                expression of opinion by the officers in the internal files
                are for the use of the department and not for outside
                exposure or for publicity. To find the officers guilty for
                expressing their independent opinion, even against
                orders of courts in deserving cases, would cause
                impediments in the smooth working and functioning of
                the Government. These internal notings, in fact, are
                privileged documents. Notings made by the officers in
                the files cannot, in our view, be made the basis of

                      contempt action against each such officer who makes the
                      notings. If the ultimate action does not constitute
                      contempt, the intermediary suggestions and views
                      expressed in the notings, which may sometimes even
                      amount ex-facie disobedience of the courts orders, will

<blockquote id="blockquote_65">               49.1. Thus, in the above judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court

                  held that expression of opinions by the officers on the office

                  files are for the use of the departments and not for outside

                  exposure. The said judgment relied on by the 2nd respondent

                  also supports the case of the respondents. In view of the

                  above observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred

                  above and having regard to the fact that power to extend

                  the port limits is expressly conferred only on the 1st

                  respondent-Government, the 1st respondent has rightly

                  exercised its statutory power. However, the plea of the

                  petitioners that, in view of the subsequent Resolution dated

                  28.9.2015, the 1st respondent ought not to have considered

                  the approval granted by the 2nd respondent on the earlier
