                 This application for quashing has been filed against order

   dated 01.08.2013, passed by Special Judge, Vigilance-II, Patna in

   Special Case No.42 of 2009, arising out of Vigilance P.S. Case

   No.115 of 2009 whereby he has taken cognizance of the offence under

   <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_1">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_2">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_3">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_4">471</a>, <a href="/doc/722115/" id="a_5">477(A)</a>, <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_6">109</a> and <a href="/doc/1128948/" id="a_7">120(B)</a> of IPC as well

<p id="p_6">                 2. The present FIR in Vigilance Case No.115 of 2009,

   dated 09.11.2009 was lodged by a Police Inspector of Vigilance

   Investigation Bureau, Saharsa Division on the direction of the D.S.P.

   of Vigilance Investigation Bureau after finding in preliminary enquiry

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                            2/7</span>




        corrupt practices being adopted by public servant and Contractors in

        purchase of cements for construction of Indira Awas in the year 1993.

</p><p id="p_7">                       3. Allegation in brief is that Rural Development

        Department, Government of Bihar by various letters had given

        direction for purchase of cements and other materials for

        developmental work under Jawahar Rojgar Yojana and for execution

        of projects under Indira Awas Scheme. It is alleged that the Purchase

        Committee did not follow those directions rather violating directions

        neither tenders were invited by the petitioner-District Magistrate at the

        relevant point of time nor financial rules were followed. It is alleged

        that 50,000 bags of cements was purchased and Rs.49,00,000/- was

        given in advance to his favourite supplier. There is no signature of

        members in the proceeding of meetings of the Price Fixation

        Committee or Purchase Committee and without inviting tenders, order

        was placed to M/s Scampher Agency, Bhagalpur for supplying

        cement so it is alleged that the then District Magistrate, Govind

        Kumar Sinha and In-charge Deputy Collector Chandrashekhar Prasad

        in connivance with supplier avoiding the directions of the Department

        misused their authority for giving maximum benefit to the supplier.

</p><p id="p_8">                       4. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner

        submits that the petitioner was District Magistrate in the year 1993 for

        a short period of nine months, i.e., 24.06.1993 to 08.04.1994. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            3/7</span>




        petitioner being the District Magistrate followed the direction

        contained in Letter No.11030, dated 21st November, 1989, Letter

        No.4428, dated 10th May, 1991 and Letter No.7448, dated 10th

        August, 1990 issued by Rural Development Department, Government

        of Bihar. In view of the directions in the said letters, the Price Fixation

        Committee was constituted at the district level, the District Magistrate

        being the Chairman of the Committee, D.D.C. and Executive

        Engineer as members and as per requirement, fixing price of cement

        was purchased for developmental schemes under Jawahar Rojgar

        Yojana and for construction of house under Indira Awas Yojana. The

        other members of the said Committee were Deputy Development

        Commissioner and Executive Engineer of Rashtriya Gramin Niyojan,

        accordingly, the prices were fixed by the Committee and purchase

        was made. Further submission is that this petitioner retired in the year

        2000 and after nine years of his superannuation, the present FIR was

        lodged and cognizance has been taken in this case without obtaining

        sanction from the Government, which is mandatory in view of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_10">Section

        19</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act though sanction is only taken

        under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_11">Section 197</a> Cr.P.C. It is also submitted that without any

        preliminary enquiry, this case has been lodged.

</p><p id="p_9">                       5. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Vigilance

        Department submits that the directions issued by the Rural
 4   Patna High Court Cr.Misc. No.38292 of 2013 dt.18-07-2017

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            4/7</span>




        Development Department were not followed intentionally to give

        benefit to supplier. As per directions, contained in letters referred by

        the learned counsel for the petitioner, tender was to be issued and

        preference was to be given to the manufacturers of the cement

        company and if manufacturers do not participate then to wholesalers

        dealers of cement but in the present case only three shopkeepers

        submitted their quotation without any notice of tender published by

        the concerned rather favoured one was given the order for supplying

        the cement in order to get benefited himself and the petitioner at the

        relevant point of time was the Chairman of the Price Fixation

        Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                       6. Having considered rival submissions and on perusal of

        the records, this Court is of the view that supply order was given for

        purchase of 50,000 bags of cement, to Canpher Sales Agency,

        Bhagalpur. There is a detailed direction contained in Letter No.11030,

        dated 21st November, 1989 issued by Rural Development Department,

        Government of Bihar for purchasing cement, iron and brick to be used

        in developmental work under Jawahar Rojgar Yojana and under

        schmes of Indira Awas Yojana. In the Chairmanship of District

        Magistrate a Price Fixation Committee was constituted, other two

        members were Deputy Development Commissioner and Executive

        Engineer of Rashtriya Gramin Niyojan Karyakarm. This Committee

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                            5/7</span>




        requires to make assessment of the requirement of cement and other

        materials block wise and they are also required to invite tenders and

        first preference be given to manufacturers and if they show any

        inability in supplying then to wholesalers. Moreover, in general in the

        matters relating to purchase by the Government Departments, the

        purchase is done according to Bihar Financial Rules. Under these

        Rules the Government purchases are made and for purchasing such

        items more than of Rs.1,00,000/-, Purchase Committee requires to

        invite open tenders and thereafter lower bidder is selected considering

        other factors also. In the present case, there is allegation that without

        verifying tender a particular supplier was selected and order was

        placed to that firm. It is a settled proposition of law that no sanction

        under <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_12">Section 19</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is

        required against a retired public servant. This issue was decided a way

        back by a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_13">K.

        Veeraswamy vs. Union of India</a>, reported in (1977) 3 SCC 440. In

        recent past in the case of <a href="/doc/1556629/" id="a_14">State of Punjab vs. Labh Singh</a>, reported in

        2015 (1) PLJR 373 (SC), again the same principle has been reiterated.

                                 POC Act, this court held that no sanction was necessary in
                                 the case of a person who had ceased to be the public
                                 servant at the time the court was asked to take cognizance.
                                 The view taken in S.A. Venkataraman (supra) was
                                 adopted by this court in <a href="/doc/1107477/" id="a_17">C.R. Bansi vs. State of

                                 Special Judge insofar as charge under the POC Act was
                                 concerned.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                                8. However, as regards charges for the

                                 Court was absolutely right in setting aside the order of the
                                 Special Judge. Unlike Section 19 of the POC Act, the
                                 protection under <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_21">Section 197</a> of Cr.P.C. is available to the
                                 concerned public servant even after retirement. Therefore,
                                 if the matter was considered by the sanctioning authority
                                 and the sanction to prosecute was rejected first on
                                 13.9.2000 and secondly on 24.9.2003, the court could not
                                 have taken cognizance insofar as the offences punishable
                                 under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_22"> the Indian Penal Code</a> are concerned. As laid down

                servant on the date of taking cognizance. The allegations levelled in

                the First Information Report do make out a prima facie case against

                the petitioner under <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_38">Sections 420</a>, <a href="/doc/1985627/" id="a_39">467</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_40">468</a>, <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_41">471</a>, <a href="/doc/722115/" id="a_42">477(A)</a>, <a href="/doc/513074/" id="a_43">109</a> and
