    of the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding this petition are as
    under :-
</p>



                                                                               
                                                       
<p id="p_4">    2.           Sometimes in the year 2002, the petitioner invited tenders
    for the work of re-surfacing of main runway 09/27 at C.S. International
    Airport, Mumbai at an approximate estimate of Rs.14.00 crores. The




                                                      
    petitioner submitted its tender on 15th November, 2002.                   The
    respondent accepted the petitioner's tender on 6th January, 2003 and
    issued Detailed Acceptance Letter on 8th January, 2003. under the
    said agreement, the time for completion was to be 150 days reckoned




                                            
    from 6th January, 2003. The stipulated date of completion of the work
                                   
    was 4th June, 2003. The value of the work as per accepted tender
    was Rs.9,79,44,000/-.

<p id="p_5">    3.           The respondent granted extension of time to the petitioner
    upto and including 25th June, 2003. It is the case of the petitioner that
           

    the petitioner completed the said work on or before the extended
    period and executed more than double the original accepted value of
        



    work, including various extra items, extra quantities, substituted items
    etc. as ordered by the respondent from time to time.
</p>




<p id="p_6">    4.           The dispute arose between the parties. The respondent
    appointed the learned arbitrator. Pursuant to the liberty granted by
    the learned arbitrator, the petitioner submitted the statement of claim





    and made about 27 claims before the learned arbitrator. The claims
    made by the petitioner were opposed by the respondent by filing the
    written statement. None of the parties led any oral evidence before
    the learned arbitrator.

    an arbitral award and allowed few claims made by the petitioner and

    impugned any part of the award allowing some of the claims made by
    the petitioner.

<p id="p_8">    6.           Learned counsel appearing for both the parties have
    addressed this court on some of the claims, which were pressed by
    the petitioner across the bar and were forming part of the grounds
    raised in the petition. I will deal with those claims which are rejected




                                             
    by the learned arbitrator and which are pressed by the petitioner and
                                   
    submissions are made thereon claim-wise.

<p id="p_9">    7.           It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that
    though the written arguments were filed by the petitioner on 18 th April,
    2007 before the learned arbitrator, the impugned award has been
           

    rendered on 24th September, 2009, which is after more than 29
    months and on the ground of this gross delay committed by the
        



    learned arbitrator, the award rendered by the learned arbitrator
    deserves to be set aside. He submits that the learned arbitrator ought
    to have delivered speedy justice to the parties, whereas the award





    has been rendered after gross delay. He submits that though this
    ground is not raised by the petitioner in arbitration petition, in the
    interest of justice the petitioner should be allowed to urge this ground





    across the bar. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on
    the following judgments of the Supreme Court :-

    respondent submits that the petitioner cannot be allowed to urge this
    ground across the bar in view of the petitioner not having raised the




                                             
    same in the arbitration petition. He submits that in any event, no
                                   
    prejudice is caused to the petitioner due to the alleged gross delay on
    the part of the learned arbitrator in rendering the arbitral award. In
                                  
    support of this submission, learned senior counsel for the respondent
    placed reliance on the following judgments :-

<p id="p_16">    9.           It is not in dispute that the petitioner has not raised this

    arbitrator, the petitioner thus cannot be allowed to urge this ground

<p id="p_18">    10.          The petitioner had made this claim due to the difference in
    rate on the ground that the petitioner had used different quality of

    rate. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that though the
                                   
    petitioner had used different quality of bitumen, the learned arbitrator
    has rejected this claim and has rendered a perverse finding of fact
    and thus this part of the award is contrary to the terms of the contract
                                  
    and deserves to be set aside.

    He submits that the petitioner had made this claim for the price





    difference only after eight months of completion of work and the same
    was afterthought. It is submitted that the finding of fact rendered by

</p><p id="p_23">    12.          A perusal of the award indicates that the difference in price
    of bitumen as per the actual area laid at site was already paid by the

    petitioner without any protest. As per provisions of the contract, the
    petitioner did not produce any documents in respect of this claim for
    the quantity of 487 Cum of BM laid with CRMB 55 bitumen, despite




                                                        
    the direction of the learned arbitrator. On the contrary the respondent
    had produced the document in support of the actual qualities of
    bitumen laid with CRMB 55.

<p id="p_24">    13.          The learned arbitrator has also considered the minutes of
                                   
    various meetings and the correspondence between the parties, in
    which it was clarified to the petitioner that the cost difference of
                                  
    CRMB and the ordinary bitumen would be paid. The petitioner never
    objected to the same either in the meetings or in any other manner
    while carrying out the work or even till the expiry of eight months from
        

    completion of work. The petitioner had demanded only the difference
    in price of bitumen.
</p>     



<p id="p_25">    14.          Insofar as the rates demanded by the petitioner is
    concerned, the learned arbitrator has rendered a finding that the





    analysis of rates submitted by the petitioner was not based on any
    basis in respect of the material and labour component, market rate of
    CRMB 55, higher charges of machines and mix design charges etc.





    and all were on higher side.          The learned arbitrator had also
    considered the fact that the claim was made after expiry of eight
    months of completion of such work and accordingly rightly rejected
    the claim of the petitioner.

<p id="p_27">    16.          In my view the learned arbitrator has referred to all the
    relevant correspondence between the parties and has rendered a
    finding of fact that the petitioner was not eligible to make this claim in
    accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract and the




                                            
    claim was made after expiry of eight months from the date of
                                   
    completion of work. The learned arbitrator has also interpreted the
    contract of work on page no.529, footnote para 2, while rejecting this
                                  
    claim made by the petitioner. In my view the finding of fact rendered
    by the learned arbitrator is not perverse.        The interpretation of
    contract by the learned arbitrator is a possible interpretation and
        

    cannot be substituted by another interpretation by this court. In my
    view the claim of the petitioner was afterthought and has been rightly
     



    rejected by the learned arbitrator for various reasons recorded by the
    learned arbitrator. In my view, the challenge to this claim by the
    petitioner is devoid of merits and thus this part of award is upheld.

    Head of Str. Engineering Department, VJTI and GM (Engineering) as

    did not agree to the contention of the petitioner that rock drilling was
    done actually at site and did not recommend revision of the rate due
    to various reasons recorded in the said report. The learned arbitrator
        

    has recorded that the petitioner had admitted that strata below run
    way, was of varying nature.          The respondent released a sum of
     



    Rs.68,80,378/- which was inclusive of extra rate over the agreement
    item no.7 in the final bill. The learned arbitrator has found that the
    said payment was in order and rightly rejected the larger claim. In my





    view the finding rendered by the learned arbitrator is based on the
    pleadings and documents filed by both the parties and the same
    being not perverse, this court cannot interfere with such finding of





    fact. A perusal of the record indicates that though the Committee did
    not recommend any revision of rate, the respondent still considered
    the extra rate over the schedule rate. The learned arbitrator has
    accepted the said payment as reasonable. In my view, there is thus
    no merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner
    and the award in respect of this claim is upheld.

    completion of work.          The finding of the learned arbitrator that the
                                  
    petitioner should have submitted report for additional two lanes along
    with the reports submitted for five lanes, is a correct and not a

    prepared seven running account bills and five advance bills and had

    petitioner. The learned arbitrator has rendered a finding that the
    petitioner was not clear in its mind about the claim made by the

    delay in payment of four running account bills i.e. RA Bill Nos. 8 to 11
                                   
    and thus the learned arbitrator ought to have awarded interest on
    delayed payment of running account bills.         He submits that the
    payment under the final bill was released on 19th April, 2004. The
                                  
    respondent was liable to make payment within six months. There
    was however gross delay in making payment and thus the respondent
    was liable to pay interest.

    the respondent was required to prepare those bills and had made
    payment to the petitioner from time to time. It is submitted that the

    the obligation to prepare the running account bills as well as final bill
    was of the petitioner. It was not the case of the petitioner that the

    the case of the respondent that the petitioner had submitted
    computation of quantities of bituminous only on 17 th November, 2003

    full respect only on 17th November, 2003 which resulted in delay in
    release of payments. It is held that the delay in making payment in
    respect of extra items was in view of the report of the Committee. A





    perusal of the award indicates that the learned arbitrator has also
    rendered a finding that the petitioner had never made this claim
    during the currency of the contract and had made only for the first





    time after the appointment of the learned arbitrator. This claim was
    not even demanded in the notice invoking the arbitration or in any
    other correspondence prior to the date of appointment of the learned
