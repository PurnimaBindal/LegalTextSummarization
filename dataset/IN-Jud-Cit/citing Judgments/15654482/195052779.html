CPC)


</p><p id="p_2">1.     Vide this application, the defendant No.3 has challenged the

territorial jurisdiction of this Court. The present suit was initially filed by

the plaintiff for infringement of its trade mark and passing off.

Subsequently, by way of amendment of the plaint, the plaintiff deleted its

relief for infringement of its trade mark which fact is clear from the order of




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                        Page 1
 this Court dated 18.11.2013. The suit of the plaintiff now remains for that

of passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.     In the application, the applicant has alleged that this Court has no

territorial jurisdiction on the ground that for a suit for passing off, the

territorial jurisdiction of the Court has to be determined under Section 20 of

Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter referred to as „CPC‟). It is alleged that

the defendants are neither residing nor carrying on the business in Delhi as

per the averments in the plaint itself. It is further submitted that no cause of

action has also arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. The

benefit of Section 134 of Trademark Act is not available in a suit of passing

off action . It is submitted that the plaintiff had initially filed a suit on the

basis of a single invoice issued in Jind, Haryana in support of his contention

that cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court and no

other document was filed along with the original plaint to prima facie show

that the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of this Court.

Subsequently, however, the plaintiff filed on record three invoices of one

„Baxi Medical Stores‟ in Delhi on 16th November, 2013 along with the

amended plaint. These invoices are dated October 29/30, 2013 i.e. obtained

after the filing of the present suit. These invoices purported to be issued not




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                         Page 2
 to the plaintiff but to the third parties i.e. Yadav Research &amp; Breeding Farm,

S.K. Breeding Farm and Kegg Farms (P) Ltd and there is no pleading or

document to establish any connection of these three entities to the plaintiff

or to the defendants and there is no explanation as to how the plaintiff had

obtained any of these three invoices. It is further contented that the Local

Commissioner, appointed by the Court vide its order dated 18.11.2013, to

ascertain the source from where Baxi Medical Stores obtained the stock of

medicines which it sold under these three invoices.                The Local

Commissioner in its report dated 26th November, 2013 has clearly stated

that Baxi Medical Stores sourced the stock from Karnal, Haryana and that

the proprietor of the said store had also admitted that he is not a distributor

of defendants and had merely procured the three vials of product

INNOVAX from outside Delhi. It is submitted that these facts clearly show

that these three invoices had been filed by the plaintiff to set up the

territorial jurisdiction in Delhi and thus the plaintiff is engaging in forum

shopping. It is submitted that these three invoices which were neither issued

by defendants nor by any of their authorized representative/ dealer are not

sufficient to give territorial jurisdiction to the Delhi Courts. It is further

contended that admittedly the defendants are neither residing nor carrying




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                       Page 3
 on its business nor have any manufacturing unit within the jurisdiction of

this Court. This Court therefore lacks territorial jurisdiction and the plaint is

liable to be returned.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.     The application is contested by the plaintiff. It is contended that this

Court has the territorial jurisdiction since the defendant‟s vaccines under the

impugned trademark is available for sale in Delhi and also that the

defendants through their agents are peddling their vaccines in Delhi. In the

unamended suit, the plaintiff had relied on an invoice dated 05.10.2013

which shows that the defendants are passing off their goods through

Balvindra Medical Hall. The plaintiff‟s client namely Chaudhary Poultry

Farm, Najafgarh, New Delhi had purchased the goods of the defendants

from Chaudhary Poultry Farm and this fact is sufficient to give jurisdiction

to the Court. The plaintiff in an amended plaint has explained that when the

suit came up for hearing before the Court on 25.10.2013, in order to satisfy

the judicial conscience of the Court on the issue of territorial jurisdiction

sought permission to produce more invoices to show the sale of the

defendant‟s vaccines in Delhi. It, thereafter, conducted investigations and

learned that Baxi Medical Stores located in Khanna Market, Tis Hazari,

possess the defendant‟s vaccines for sale and after sustained investigation




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                         Page 4
 learnt on 29.10.2013 and 30.10.2013 that defendant‟s goods under the

impugned trademark INNOVAX were sold by Baxi Medical Store to three

different persons in Delhi. The plaintiff thereafter requested Kegg Farms (P)

Ltd (one of the three buyers) to provide copy of the invoices issued by Baxi

Medical Store and thereafter obtained the invoices of other two sales from

Baxi Medical Store. As soon as the plaintiff got the invoices, it moved an

application under Order 6 Rule 17 of CPC whereby it deleted its prayer for

infringement of its trademark by the defendants and also included these

invoices in the amended plaint. It is further contended that the Court was

satisfied that it had territorial jurisdiction and that is why the Court allowed

the amendment and issued the notice to the defendants. It is not disputed

that the Local Commissioner visited Baxi Medical Store and recorded the

statement of the proprietor. The proceedings conducted by the Local

Commissioner were filed by him in the Court. It has been contended that

the defendants have nowhere denied that Dev Enterprises is not the

defendant‟s authorized distributor or agent. It is further contended that the

question of jurisdiction is a mixed question of law and fact. It is submitted

that the report of the Local Commissioner clearly establishes the fact that

the defendant‟s medicines are available for sale in Delhi. It is submitted




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                        Page 5
 that sale through consignee or the distributor is sufficient for this Court to

have territorial jurisdiction. It is further submitted that defendants have

filed an application for registration of trademark INNOVAX in Delhi and

this would give rise to a threat perception in the mind of public that the

goods of defendants are to be sold in Delhi and that would be sufficient to

give the jurisdiction to this Court. On these contentions, it is prayed that the

application has no merit and the same is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_5">6.     The contention of the defendants is that neither they nor any of their

representatives is selling the vaccine in Delhi nor they have authorized

dealers within the territorial jurisdiction of Delhi and hence this Court has

no jurisdiction and the suit is liable to be dismissed.

</p><p id="p_6">7.     It is argued by learned counsel for the plaintiff that while determining

the question of jurisdiction upon an application under Order 7 Rule 11, the

Court has to rely only on the averments of the plaint and accept it as a

gospel truth.         Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/35593357/" id="a_1">Exphar S.A. vs. Eupharma

Laboratories Ltd</a>, AIR 2004 SC 1682, <a href="/doc/95360177/" id="a_2">LT Foods Limited vs. Heritage

Foods (India) Ltd</a>, 210 (2014) DLT 721, <a href="/doc/661632/" id="a_3">Saleem Bhai &amp; Ors vs. State of

Maharashtra &amp; Ors</a>, (2003) 1 SCC 557 and <a href="/doc/904832/" id="a_4">Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd. vs.

Mahavir Steels &amp; Others</a> , 47 (1992) DLT 412. It is further argued that




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                        Page 6
 actual sale of the product within the jurisdiction of a Court is not essential

for an act of passing off where there is an intention to sell and the plaintiff

makes out a prima facie case of such intention, this Court has the territorial

jurisdiction. Reliance is also placed in the case of <a href="/doc/1674695/" id="a_5">Pfizer Products, Inc. vs.

Rajesh Chopra &amp; Ors</a>, 2006 (32) PTC 301. In this case, the defendants

have already applied for registration of its trade mark within Delhi, the

plaintiff has a substantial threat against the defendants from selling the

goods in Delhi and thus this Court held that it has the jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_7">9.     Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also relied on the findings in the

case of <a href="/doc/950572/" id="a_6">L.G. Corporation &amp; Anr. vs. Intermaket Electropasters (P) Ltd. &amp;

Anr</a>, 2006 (32) PTC 429 (Delhi) and argued that in this case also, this Court

gave findings that the Courts in Delhi have territorial jurisdiction on the

ground that the infringing goods were being sold in Delhi.

</p><p id="p_8">10.    Learned counsel for plaintiff has also relied on the findings in the

case of <a href="/doc/15654482/" id="a_7">Novartis A.G. vs. Crest Pharma Pvt. Ltd &amp; Anr</a>, 2009 (41) PTC 57

(Del.) and argues that in this case, this Court has categorically held that

mere averments in the plaint is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the

Court and where the defendants‟ products are available in Delhi through

their agents and if such averments are made in the plaint, then such




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                       Page 7
 averments are sufficient to prove the factum of goods being available in

Delhi. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also argued that the plaintiff‟s

goods have adopted a distinctiveness in the market and any goods carrying a

trade name which is deceptively similar to that of plaintiffs, is likely to

cause confusion in the mind of public and the public would think that they

were buying the goods belonging to the plaintiff. It is argued that the

defendant‟s trademark INNOVAX is deceptively similar to that of

plaintiff‟s trademark INDOVAX and the public buying the vaccine would

be buying it under the confusion that it is buying the product of plaintiff

while, in reality, they were buying the products of defendants.          It is

submitted that on account of this, the cause of action of passing off has

arisen in favour of the plaintiff and the reliance has been placed on <a href="/doc/535562/" id="a_8">Bharat

Hotels Limited vs. Unison Hotels Ltd</a>, 2004 (28) PTC 404 (DEL). Learned

counsel for the plaintiff has also argued that the sale to distributor amounts

to commercial sale and has relied on the findings of the case <a href="/doc/908016/" id="a_9">Glen Raven

Mills Inc. vs. Vaspar Concepts Pvt. Ltd &amp; Anr</a>, 60(1995) DLT 616. It is

also argued that the adoption of trading style/corporate name also amounts

to infringing the trademark and relied on findings in the case of the

Lakshimkant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhat Shah, AIR 2002 SC 275. It is




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                      Page 8
 further argued that the marks have to be determined as a whole and relied on

the findings in the case of Novartis A.G. (supra). Learned counsel for the

plaintiff has also relied on the findings of Exphar S.A. (supra), LT Foods

Limited (supra), Saleem Bhai (supra) and Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd.

(supra) and put emphasis on the principles which the Court to follow while

considering the issue whether marks were deceptively similar and likely to

cause confusion in the minds of public.          It is further argued that the

fraud/intention to deceive is not a relevant criteria for an act of passing off

and it is sufficient if act of the defendant in selling its goods amounts to

passing off and has relied on the findings of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_10">Cadila Health Care Ltd vs.

Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd</a>, AIR 2001 SC 1952.
</p>
<p id="p_9">11.     Learned counsel for the defendants has argued that there is no sale of

its product by the defendants either by itself or through their authorized

representative or any of their agents or dealers within the jurisdiction of this

Court and the plaintiff has not produced any document on record to prima

facie show the sale of defendant‟s product within the jurisdiction of this

Court    by    the    defendants   or   their   agents/dealers   or   authorized

representatives. It is argued that the jurisdiction has been created by the

plaintiff by procuring the medicine of defendants which are not being sold




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                        Page 9
 within Delhi. It is argued that the plaintiff is involved in forum hunting by

creating evidences. It is submitted that the Local Commissioner‟s report

clearly shows that Baxi Medical store procured the medicine against three

invoices on demand from Jind, Haryana and sold it to them in Delhi. It is

further argued that Baxi store is not distributor/dealer or authorized agent of

the defendants and the proprietor of Baxi store have clearly stated so to the

Local Commissioner. Besides this, he had also informed the Local

Commissioner that he had procured this medicine for supply on specific

demands. It is submitted that a supply of the product of the defendants by an

unauthorized person to any third person cannot be said to be a commercial

sale made by the defendants either by itself or through their agent or

distributors. It is submitted that no cause of action has arisen within the

territorial jurisdiction of this Court and hence the Court has no territorial

jurisdiction. Reliance is placed on the findings in the case of <a href="/doc/1001948/" id="a_11">M/s Dhodha

House vs. S.K. Maingi</a>, 2006 (32) PTC 1 SC.
</p>
<p id="p_10">12.    I have heard the arguments and have given thoughtful consideration

to the rival contentions of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_11">13.    The plaintiff has confined the present suit to the relief of an act of

passing off by the defendants. Under <a href="/doc/731848/" id="a_12">Section 134(1)</a> (c) of the Trade Marks




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                      Page 10
 Act, 1999, the jurisdiction of the civil Court has to be determined under

Section 20 of the CPC. Section 20 of the CPC envisages that a suit can be

filed against the defendants where he is residing or carrying on its business

or where any part of the cause of action has arisen. In this case, admittedly

the defendants are neither residing nor carrying on its business within the

jurisdiction of this Court. The case of the plaintiff is that the products of the

defendants are available within the jurisdiction of this Court and, therefore,

the cause of action has arisen within this Court and this Court has the

territorial jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_12">14.    It is a settled proposition of law that while determining an application

Under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. the Court has to be guided by the averments

made in the application accepting it as a gospel truth and cannot rely on

extraneous facts mentioned in the written statement (<a href="/doc/661632/" id="a_13">Saleem Bhai and Ors

vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors</a>. AIR 2003 SC 759). The Apex Court in

the case <a href="/doc/1903089/" id="a_14">Mayer (H.K) Ltd and Others vs. Owners</a> and Parties, Vessel M.V.

Fortune Express and others: (2006) 3-SCC-100, has enunciated the

principles as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "11. From the aforesaid, it is apparent that the plaint cannot be
       rejected on the basis of the allegations made by the defendant in
       his written statement or in an application for rejection of the
       plaint. The Court has to read the entire plaint as a whole to find




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                         Page 11
        out whether it discloses a cause of action and if it does, then the
       plaint cannot be rejected by the Court exercising the powers
       under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code. Essentially, whether the
       plaint discloses a cause of action, is a question of fact which
       has to be gathered on the basis of the averments made in the
       plaint in its entirety taking those averments to be correct........"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">It is also settled proposition of law that the Court has to confine itself to the

averments made in the plaint and the documents supporting the averments in

the plaint. This Court in <a href="/doc/110499626/" id="a_15">Tilak Raj Bhagat vs. Ranjit Kaur</a> 2012 VAD

(Delhi) 186 had held that the plaint has to be read as a whole together with

the documents filed by the plaintiff. The Supreme Court in the case <a href="/doc/1747770/" id="a_16">T.

Arvindandam vs. T.V. Satyapal and another</a> (1977) 4-SCC-467 had held

that the Courts are required to give "a meaningful not formal reading of the

plaint" and where the Court reaches to the conclusion that the plaint is

"manifestly vexatious and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear

right to sue, he should exercise his power under Order VII Rule 11, CPC

taking care to see that the ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. And, if

clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action, nip it in the bud

at first hearing by examining the party searchingly under Order X, C.P.C.

An activist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits." The same

principles were reiterated in I.T.C. Ltd. Vs. Debts Recovery Appellate

Tribunal and Ors, AIR 1998 SC 634, stating that the Courts have a duty to

 find out whether a real cause of action has been set out in the plaint or

something purely illusory had been stated with a view to get out of Order

VII Rule 11 of CPC.
</p>
<p id="p_14">15.    It is an admitted fact that the trademarks of the plaintiff as well as that

of the defendants are registered trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_15">16.    It is apparent that passing off is a tort under common law and is

mainly used to protect the good will attached with the trademarks. Lord

Halsburg has stated that "nobody has any right to represent his goods as the

goods of somebody else."
</p>
<p id="p_16">       The action of passing off is based on the principle that "A man may

not sell his own goods under the pretence that they are the goods of another

man"(<a href="/doc/850381/" id="a_17">N.R. Dongre vs. Whirlpool Corporation</a>, AIR 1995 Del 300).

<p id="p_22">       There are three main elements of the tort of passing off which were

which gives rise to the territorial jurisdiction to this Court under Section 20

</blockquote><p id="p_35">18.    The averment shows that the jurisdiction of the Court is claimed on

the ground that the medicine of the defendants is available for purchase in

Delhi. In case of Glen Raven Mills (supra) relied upon by the plaintiff, this

Court, in para 10, held that the cause of action in case of passing off has

arisen only when it is proved that the defendant is selling its goods under the

impugned trademark within its jurisdiction. The relevant paragraphs are

reproduced hereunder:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">        "10. .........In a suit for passing off or injunction Or account of
      infringement of trade mark, the cause of action partly or wholly
      can arise in a given jurisdiction only if it is the defendant who is
      proved to have directly made sale of goods under the impugned
      trade mark, within that jurisdiction, not loan individual customer
      but to a distributor, wholesaler or retailer and that such a sale is
      on a commercial scale. In the instance case there was no
      evidence to show any transaction of sale of goods under the
      impugned trade mark, made by the defendant at the place where
      the suit for passing off and in-junction was instituted and so the
      court at that place had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit.</blockquote><p id="p_36">

</p><p id="p_37">      11. .....................In order that the Court at a particular place
      should have jurisdiction to try a passing off action, it is
      necessary to show that the defendants were responsible for
      sending out to that district, goods which were liable to deceive
      intending purchasers into believing that they were goods
      manufactured by the plaintiffs. It would, of course, not be
      sufficient if such goods were supplied by the defendants to
      individual purchaser for use, as in such a case, the probability of

       any members of the public being deceived would be slight. It is
      necessary to show that the supply has been on a commercial
      scale to persons who are likely to offer the goods in question for
      sale."       (emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_38">18.    In Glen (supra) case, this Court has clearly held that one or two

transactions is not sufficient to give jurisdiction to the Court and sale has to

be on a commercial scale. In this case, the Court has also held that mere

supply of the goods to individual purchaser for use is not sufficient to give

jurisdiction to the Court as in such cases; the probability of public being

deceived would not be present. The law laid down by this Court in this case

clearly shows that unless the sale is on the commercial scale, it cannot be

said that the cause of action for passing off has arisen in favour of the

plaintiff within the jurisdiction of this Court. In the case of <a href="/doc/151685239/" id="a_22">Banyan Tree

Holding (P) Limited vs. A. Murali Krishna Reddy &amp; Anr</a>, 2010 (42) PTC

361 (Del), this Court formulated the various questions including question

no.(iii) in para 7 which is " Is it permissible for the plaintiff to establish

such prima facie case through "trap orders" or "trap transactions?" and

proceeded to answer it in the following manner:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       57. Reverting to the present case, the position that emerges
       from the above judicial decisions is that while in trade mark
       and infringement cases, trap orders or trap transactions may be
       used as evidence, the fairness of such transactions is a relevant
       factor to be considered. Other relevant factors would be the




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                        Page 19
        nature of goods or services offered for purchase on the internet.
       If they require the customer to further physically verify their
       quality then the mere purchase of such goods through a trap
       transaction may not be treated as being sufficient evidence of
       infringement. The facts of each case will determine whether the
       trap transaction is a fair one and has resulted in a purchase on
       the internet of goods or services. A lone trap transaction will
       not be sufficient evidence of infringement or passing off. For the
       purposes of establishing that a part of the cause of action arose
       within the jurisdiction of the court, the Plaintiff would have to
       show that the Defendant has purposefully availed of the
       jurisdiction of the forum court by entering into a commercial
       transaction with an internet user located within the jurisdiction
       of the forum court. This cannot possibly be a solitary trap
       transaction since that would not be an instance of "purposeful"
       availment by the Defendant. It would have to be a real
       commercial transaction that the Defendant has with someone
       not set up by the Plaintiff itself. If the only evidence is in the
       form of a series of trap transactions, they have to be shown to
       be obtained using fair means. The Plaintiff seeking to establish
       jurisdiction on the basis of such trap transactions would have to
       aver unambiguously in the plaint, and also place along with it
       supporting material, to prima facie show that the trap
       transactions relied upon satisfy the above test. Question (iii) is
       answered accordingly."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_39">19.    So even if the plaintiff relies on a trap transaction it is required to

show that the defendants are indulging into commercial sale of its product.

The question what constitute a commercial transaction or sale is dealt with

by Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/1397305/" id="a_23">Smithkline French Laboratories Limited and Ors

        "6. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent stated that

       distributor or dealer of the respondent, then alone it can be
       construed as a commercial sale on the part of the respondent,
       so as to give jurisdiction to the court. Nowhere in the plaint it is
       stated that such a commercial sale is carried on in the City of
       Madras by the respondent. Perusal of the cause of action
       paragraph also indicates that no such averment is there to show
       that the respondent had authorised the stockist or distributor or
       dealer in the City of Chennai. Hence, it is stated that the sale of
       the product by any other unauthorised person would not confer
       any jurisdiction in this court. I am of the view that there is some

<p id="p_43">22.    In the plaint, the plaintiff has nowhere alleged that the defendant has

averred "that the Defendants through their small time agents are even

paddling their products in Delhi." Also, in the paragraph where the plaintiff

 has pleaded that this Court has the jurisdiction, it only says that the said

"product is available for purchase in Delhi".
</p>
<p id="p_44">       The plaintiff in para 43 of its amended plaint has alleged that cause of

action arisen in favour of the plaintiff on 05.06.2013 when it asked the

defendants through a notice dated 28.05.2013 to desist from selling its

product and its reply dated 14.06.2013. The plaintiff has also contended

that the cause of action has also arisen in May 2013 when a poultry owner

complained about the sub-standard vaccine manufactured by the defendants,

believing it to that of the plaintiff. There is no document on record to show

that the said poultry farm owner has purchased the vaccine of the defendants

in Delhi from any dealer, authorized representative or agents of the

defendants. The plaintiff has also alleged that the cause of action has arisen

in his favour when the defendants advertised on its website that they are

manufacturing the vaccine and also when they learnt that the defendants

have fraudulently obtained the registration of their trademark. As discussed

above, the defendants are the owner of the registered trademark and the

plaintiff has already dropped his relief of infringement of its trademark. It is

required to prima facie show that the defendants are indulging into

commercial activity of sale of its product which the plaintiff claims is




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                       Page 23
 deceptively similar to its trademark within the jurisdiction of this Court.

One of the contentions is that the defendants have put an advertisement

informing the poultry world about its product in the name of "INNOVAX"

which has been accessed by anyone in Delhi and, therefore, the part of the

cause of action can be said to have arisen within the jurisdiction of this

Court. However, the plaintiff has not produced any sufficient evidence

except the transaction it has relied upon, to show that the defendants are

selling their products in Delhi.     As regards the cause of action dated

08.08.2013, it relates to the cancellation of trademark registration of

defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_45">       In Banyan Tree case (supra), this Court has held that posting of an

advertisement depicting its mark is not sufficient to give cause of action for

passing off unless it enables the defendants to enter into any commercial

transaction with the viewer in the forum state. The Court has held as

under:-
</p>
<p id="p_46">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       45. This court holds that in order to prima facie establish that
       the Defendant purposefully availed of the jurisdiction of this
       court, the Plaintiff would have to show that the Defendant
       engaged in some commercial activity in the forum State by
       targeting its website specifically at customers within that State.</blockquote><p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">       This is consistent with the law laid down in Cybersell and
       reiterated later in Toys R Us. It is also consistent with the




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                         Page 24
        application of the „tighter‟ version of the „effects‟ test which
       is „targeting‟. In any action for passing off or infringement, it
       would have to be shown that the Defendant by using its mark
       intended to pass off its goods as that of the Plaintiff‟s. A mere
       hosting of a website which can be accessible from anyone from
       within the jurisdiction of the court is not sufficient for this
       purpose. Also a mere posting of an advertisement by the
       Defendant depicting its mark on a passive website which does
       not enable the Defendant to enter into any commercial
       transaction with the viewer in the forum state cannot satisfy the
       requirement of giving rise to a cause of action in the forum
       state. Even an interactive website, which is not shown to be
       specifically targeted at viewers in the forum state
       for commercial transactions, will not result in the court of the
       forum state having jurisdiction. In sum, for the purposes
       of <a href="/doc/698400/" id="a_27">Section 20</a> (c) CPC, in order to show that some part of the
       cause of action has arisen in the forum state by the use of the
       internet by the Defendant, the Plaintiff will have to show prima
       facie that the said website, whether euphemistically termed as
       "passive plus" or "interactive", was specifically targeted at
       viewers in the forum state for commercial transactions. The
       Plaintiff would have to plead this and produce material to
       prima facie show that some commercial transaction using the
       website was entered into by the Defendant with a user of its
       website within the forum state and that the specific targeting of
       the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an injury or harm
       to the Plaintiff within the forum state. Question no. (ii) is

       Suit No</a>. 894/2009, decided on a reference to the Division Bench
       on the issue of jurisdiction, on 23.11.2009. The Court held that:

</p><p id="p_51">       38. Having surveyed the law as it has developed in different
       jurisdictions, this Court is of the view that the essential
       principles developed as part of the common law can be adopted
       without difficulty by our courts in determining whether the
       forum court has jurisdiction where the alleged breach is related
       to an activity on the internet. At the outset, this Court does not
       subscribe to the view that the mere accessibility of the
       Defendants website in Delhi would enable this Court to exercise
       jurisdiction. A passive website, with no intention to specifically
       target audiences outside the State where the host of the website
       is located, cannot vest the forum court with jurisdiction. This
       Court is therefore unable to agree with the proposition laid
       down in Casio. The said decision cannot be held to be good law
       and to that extent is overruled.
</p>
<p id="p_52">       39. India TV appears to be somewhat closer to the development
       of law in this regard since the decision in Casio. In India TV,
       the learned single Judge impliedly doubted the correctness of
       the decision in Casio. The learned single Judge in India TV
       acknowledged that a mere accessibility of website may not be
       sufficient to attract jurisdiction of the forum court. This, in the
       considered view of this Court, is the correct position in law.

</p><p id="p_53">       40. There was no occasion for this Court even in India TV to
       examine the finer aspects of the question of jurisdiction based
       on the nature of the website, the intention of the host of the
       website to specifically target viewers outside its jurisdiction,
       and the effect of hosting such website on audiences outside such
       state. It appears to this Court that for the purposes of a passing
       off action or an action for infringement where the plaintiffs is

        not carrying on business within the jurisdiction of the forum
       court, and where there is no long arm statute, the plaintiffs
       would have to show that the Defendant purposefully availed
       itself of the jurisdiction of the forum court. It is not enough
       merely to show that the website hosted by the Defendant is an
       interactive one. It would have to be shown that the nature of the
       activity indulged in by the Defendant by the use of the website
       was with an intention to conclude a commercial transaction
       with the website user.
</p>
<p id="p_54">       41. This Court is not able to accept the submission of the
       learned Counsel for the plaintiffs that the test of "purposeful
       availment" must be replaced by the test of "purposeful
       avoidance". While the Defendant may in his defence show how
       he avoided the forum state, the initial burden is on the plaintiffs
       to show that the Defendant "purposefully availed" itself of the
       jurisdiction of the forum court. The issue of incorporating filters
       to block access to the website by viewers located outside the
       forum state will have to be considered while deciding if the
       Defendant had "purposefully avoided" the forum state.
       However, that question will arise only if the plaintiffs have been
       able to show that the website of the Defendant is interactive and
       permits commercial transactions to be concluded by the
       Defendant with a user of the website.
</p>
<p id="p_55">       42. This Court holds that jurisdiction of the forum court does
       not get attracted merely on the basis of interactivity of the
       website which is accessible in the forum state. The degree of the
       interactivity apart, the nature of the activity permissible and
       whether it results in a commercial transaction has to be
       examined. For the "effects" test to apply, the plaintiffs must
       necessarily plead and show prima facie that the specific
       targeting of the forum state by the Defendant resulted in an
       injury or harm to the plaintiffs within the forum state. For the

       reputation within the forum state as a result of the Defendants
       website being accessed in the forum state would have to be
       shown. Naturally therefore, this would require the presence of
       the plaintiffs in the forum state and not merely the possibility of
       such presence in the future. Secondly, to show that an injurious
       effect has been felt by the plaintiffs it would have to be shown
       that viewers in the forum state were specifically targeted.
       Therefore the "effects" test would have to be applied in
       conjunction with the "sliding scale" test to determine if the
       forum court has jurisdiction to try a suit concerning internet
       based disputes.

<p id="p_56">       In a subsequent judgment, the Karnataka High Court, in
       <a href="/doc/84916/" id="a_30">Presteege Property Developers Ltd. v. Prestige Estates Projects
       Ltd. MFA No</a>. 494 &amp; 13696/2006) applied the rule indicated in
       Banyan Tree, and further held that mere "booking" or placing
       an order through internet is insufficient, to say that any
       transaction takes place, since the contract formation is not at
       the place of booking or ordering the product or service. Thus, it
       is held that the mere existence of a web site, without further
       proof of the effect thereof (Ref. Banyan Tree's formulation that
       the plaintiffs has "to show that an injurious effect has been felt"
       and it "would have to be shown that viewers in the forum state
       were specifically targeted.") does not clothe this Court with
       territorial jurisdiction to entertain the present suit. The Court is
       also satisfied that the solitary sale of a CD, is insufficient to say
       that the defendants "targeted" the Delhi markets. Concededly,
       both parties do not have any business or commercial office
       within the jurisdiction of the Court; the plaintiffs even applied
       to the Registrar of Companies in Chennai, for relief against the
       defendants. On both the factual foundation claiming that this

        Court has jurisdiction, the materials are insufficient to justify
       continuation of the suit."

</p>
<p id="p_60">      "46. As regards the exercise of personal jurisdiction in cases
      involving Internet activities, the position appears to be that mere
      'passive' posting of a website does not give jurisdiction to the
      court within whose jurisdiction, the complainant company is
      present. Thus, personal jurisdiction cannot be exercised over
      non-residents merely because their website is accessible within
      the jurisdiction of the court. There has to be something more to
      indicate purposeful direction of activity to the forum state in a
      substantial way. In Cybersell Inc. case (supra) limited
      interactivity of the website restricted to received browser's name
      and expression of interest but not signing up for the services
      provided was not considered to be sufficient for the exercise of
      jurisdiction."
</p>
<p id="p_61">25.    There is no averment in the plaint to even prima facie show that

through its website the defendants are indulging into any commercial

activity within jurisdiction of this Court. To give jurisdiction to this Court,

it is imperative upon the plaintiff to prima facie show by way of its

averment in the plaint duly supported by the documents that the defendants

are indulging either by itself or through their agents or distributors in the

commercial activity within the jurisdiction of this Court which amounts to

passing off of the goods of the plaintiff. In the present case, in para 44, the

plaintiff only states that the goods of the defendants are available for sale in

Delhi but this averment is not supported by any documentary evidence.

 There is no averment that the defendants are selling their products in Delhi

through their authorized agent, distributors etc. On the other hand, the

events of the case clearly show that the plaintiff is indulging into the forum

hunting.    Initially, when it filed its plaint, it relied on one Invoice of

Balvinder Medical Hall dated October 5, 2013 to prima facie show that the

defendants‟ were selling their goods in Delhi.
</p>
<p id="p_63">26.    Thereafter, the plaintiff moved an application under Order 6 Rule 17

and sought the amendment of the plaint and it was at that time the plaintiff

in its plaint incorporated its averment that the goods of defendants are being

sold within the jurisdiction of this Court through Baxi Medical Stores. The

order of this Court dated 18.11.2013 shows that on that day, the summon of

the suit was issued to the defendants which was accepted by learned counsel

who was present in the Court.        The Court raised the query as to the

jurisdiction of the Court and the plaintiff referred to three invoices dated

15.11.2013, 30.10.2013 and 29.10.2013 issued by Baxi Medical Stores, 100,

Khanna Market, Tis Hazari, Delhi-54. Learned counsel for the defendants

raised the objection that these three invoices have been obtained by the

plaintiff after the filing of the suit and requested that the Baxi Medical Store

be asked to explain from where it sourced the stock of medicine sold under




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                       Page 31
 the three invoices and requested for appointment of the Local

Commissioner.         The Court vide the same order appointed Local

Commissioner and issued certain directions. The relevant paragraphs are

reproduced as under:-

     the source from where Baxi Medical Stores obtained the stock of

     under the aforementioned three invoices. The books and records

</p><p id="p_65">       Local Commissioner filed his report on 26.11.2013. The copy of this

report was supplied to the plaintiff and plaintiff had never raised any

objection as to the correctness of this report. This report clearly shows that

Mr. Shashi Baxi, a proprietor of Baxi Medical Store informed the Local

Commissioner that he had purchased these medicines from M/s Dev

Enterprises (Karnal, Haryana), and also produced the invoice which the




CS(OS) No.2047/2013                                                         Page 32

invoice is dated 29.10.2013 and it gives the description of goods and it also

shows its quantity which is three in number. The Bank statement reflects

the payment made by Baxi Store through its account to M/s Dev Enterprises

from whom the articles were purchased vide invoice annexed as Annexure

D. Mr. Shashi Baxi further told the Local Commissioner that he used to

procure the vaccine from Dev Enterprises whenever there is a demand for

the vaccine. The Local Commissioner recorded the statement of Mr. Shashi

Baxi and annexed it along with its report as Annexure E. In his statement,

Mr. Shashi Baxi has categorically stated that the said vaccine is procured

from Dev Enterprises as the Company was not supplying the same in Delhi.

He has also clearly stated that Baxi Medical Store is not the distributor of

the said vaccine. From the statement of Mr. Shashi Baxi, it is apparent that

Baxi Medical Stores was neither acting as a distributor or agent of the

defendants nor was supplying these medicines on behalf of the defendants.

The report of the Local Commissioner clearly shows that the Baxi Medical

Stores obtained its medicine from Dev Enterprises, Karnal, Haryana, on

specific demands. The plaintiff had, at no stage, challenged the report of the

Local Commissioner nor it is their case that Baxi Medical Store is working

 as a dealer, agent or distributor of defendant‟s company. The plaintiff,

except these three invoices and an invoice allegedly issued by Balvinder

Medical Hall to a third person, has not produced any documentary evidence

to prima facie show that defendants are indulging into any commercial

activity by selling their products within jurisdiction of this Court. Also, in

para 44 of its amended plaint, relating to the averments showing that Court

has jurisdiction, the plaintiff pleads that the vaccine of the defendant "is

available for purchase in New Delhi." It does not say that the defendants

are selling their products within the jurisdicition of this Court. The Local

Commissioner report clearly shows that the defendant‟s vaccine is not

„available' for sale in Delhi but it is „procured‟ from the authorized dealer at

Karnal, Haryana i.e. M/s Dev Enterprises for supply. These facts clearly

show that the invoices have been procured by the plaintiff to give

jurisdiction to this Court and on the basis of these invoices, it cannot be held

that the defendants are doing commercial activities within Delhi.

within the jurisdiction of this Court, it cannot be said that the ordinary

person is likely to buy the goods of the defendants believing that they are
