Hearing concluded on: August 18, 2009.
 Judgment on: August 21, 2009.

      SANJIB BANERJEE, J. : -

      On the menu is a limited diagnosis of the state of health of the public
healthcare in the State. A clutch of petitions challenges a government
memorandum of June 12, 2009 and subsequent notices inviting tender for
supply of cooked diet for indoor patients at State-run hospitals and like
institutions. Most of the petitioners, including the ones in the first petition, are
existing suppliers of cooked diet to Government hospitals; some of the other
petitioners are not existing suppliers but, like the petitioners in the first petition,
intended to put in their bids at the time that the petitions were instituted. The
petitioners challenge the notification and the tender terms on two primary
grounds: that the eligibility criteria set therein are absurd and mala fide and have
no nexus with the work covered thereby; and, that the revised rates for supply of
cooked diet to all Government-run hospitals are irrational and contrary to the
observations found in at least one earlier order of this Court.

      Apart from the State which resists any judicial incursion into the
executive's exclusive fiefdom, a rival group of caterers - some existing suppliers
and some aspiring - are vehement in their opposition. A few of the rival
contractors have applied to be impleaded. The substance of the opposition is that
there is no obligation on the petitioners to offer to supply; if they feel that the
tender terms are unfair or unsuitable or if they are of the opinion that the rates
specified would not permit them to supply the food demanded, they may as well
not participate and go away.

      There is a history to these proceedings. Prior to 2001 the State engaged
contractors for supply of raw materials to Government hospitals and the cooking
thereat was conducted by the State through its employees. By a memorandum of
November 26, 2001 it was decided that contractors would supply cooked diet to
indoor patients at Government hospitals and offers were invited for supply of
 cooked diet to be begun on April 1, 2001. By a circular of May 20, 2002 the
principal rate for supply of cooked diet was fixed at Rs.28.50 per patient per day
and a suggested diet with the break-up of the cost thereof was furnished. A
further circular of July 24, 2002 fixed a daily rate of Rs.28.50 for the standard
diet for any indoor adult patient and Rs.14.25 for patients upto the age of eight
years. Such circular advised bidders to quote either at par or below the rates
indicated which implied that the rates would be the highest to be paid. Paragraph
9 of the lead petition recounts that on August 23, 2002 a clarification was issued
regarding the proposed invitation of offers for supply of cooked diet to
Government hospitals. A subsequent notice inviting tender of June 16, 2005 was
issued by the State. Such tender notice came to be challenged in WP No. 13434
(W) of 2005 on which an interim order was made on July 13, 2005 arresting any
further progress thereunder. The rates fixed in the year 2002 were not reviewed
till 2007. By a Government order of February 20, 2007 it was notified that the
rates fixed in the year 2002 would be applicable for the year 2007-08.

      Three sets of contractors supplying cooked diet to Government hospitals
instituted WP No. 5971 (W) of 2007, WP No. 5976 (W) of 2007 and WP No. 6076
(W) of 2007. They contended that the rates fixed were unreasonable, unfair and
unrealistic as quality diet could not be supplied at such rates. These petitioners
appeared to espouse the patients' cause to obtain higher commercial rates for
themselves. It is irrelevant that some of the petitioners who clamoured for higher
rates in the year 2007 are satisfied with the new rates that have now been
declared; or that some of the contractors who had opposed those petitions in
2007 seek an upward revision of the rates now set. In passing an interim order
on the three petitions on March 29, 2007 the Court concurred with the view
expressed when WP No. 13434 (W) of 2005 had been admitted and observed that
"when a patient is admitted in a hospital for treatment for any disease that is
ailing him, quality diet is as essential for his recovery as drugs and medicines
are." The Court felt that asking the contractors to provide three meals a day and
tea at the rate of Rs.28.50 per adult patient made it "absolutely unrealistic and
 impracticable for anyone engaged in catering business to provide quality food at
such abnormally low rate." The Court wondered whether there was any
machinery for quality control and stayed further progress of the tender process in
respect of some of the Government hospitals where the work orders had not been
finalised or issued.

      On April 16, 2007 a review committee was constituted comprising, inter
alia, the director of medical education, the director of health services and a
representative from the Directorate of Agricultural Marketing for assessing and
recommending the rates of cooked food for indoor patients at Government
hospitals. The relevant memorandum specified that the "quantity of food items
will remain same as specified in (the Government notification) dated 20.5.2002." A
further Government order followed on September 25, 2007 approving revised
rates for cooked diet to be supplied to indoor patients at Government hospitals.
The regular diet for Government hospitals in Kolkata and the Kolkata
Metropolitan Development Authority area was fixed at Rs.37.40 per adult patient
per day and at Rs.36.30 elsewhere per adult patient per day. This memorandum
of September 25, 2007 was challenged in WP No. 23632 (W) of 2007 and the
present petitioners say that in view of the interim order passed on such petition,
the revised rates could not be given effect to.

      However, by a memorandum of June 18, 2008 the tenures of all existing
contractors were extended for three months with effect from July 1, 2008 by
enhancing the respective rates by 19 per cent, subject to the maximum of
Rs.28.50 per adult patient per day and Rs.14.25 per child patient per day. The
cap imposed by the memorandum of June 18, 2008 was lifted by a further
notification of July 25, 2008 by which the respective rates of existing contractors
stood enhanced by 19 per cent without any ceiling limit.

      The rival group that has resisted these proceedings had also applied to be
added as parties to WP No. 23632 (W) of 2007 and be permitted to be heard
therein. The applicants were not added as parties since their applications had
 been taken up at the final hearing of the earlier writ petition and it was also
observed that if the petition succeeded, the applicants would not be prejudiced as
they would also be entitled to supply cooked diet to Government hospitals at
higher rates. WP No. 23632 (W) of 2007 (<a href="/doc/169678787/" id="a_1">Sudipta Dutta &amp; ors. v. The State of West
Bengal &amp; ors</a>.), in which the enhanced rates announced in the year 2007 were
challenged, was disposed of on September 23, 2008 by holding, inter alia, as
follows:

             "When a patient is admitted in a Hospital for treatment of any
      disease, quality of diet is as essential for his recovery as drugs and
      medicines are. Therefore, maintenance of quality of food is one of the
      important criteries for the purpose of taking care of health of an indoor
      patient of any Hospital. This court cannot ignore the fact of rise of prices of
      every commodity and particularly current market prices of food staff
      required to be supplied by the intending suppliers to different Hospitals of
      the State Government. Therefore, taking into consideration the revised
      price fixed by the impugned memo dated September 25, 2007 as also the
      minimum rates thereof taking into consideration the conditions of clause
      7(b) of the above memo this court has no hesitation to hold that, the
      decision making process followed by the respondent authority cannot be
      sustained in law. The intending suppliers will be compelled to enter into an
      unhealthy competition compromising with the quality and quantity of the
      diet to be supplied to the indoor patients of different Hospitals of the State
      Government in response to impugned memo dated September 25, 2007 at
      abnormally low rate.

             Decision making process of the respondent authorities in fixing
      different rates for supply of diet to the indoor patients of different hospitals
      of the State in terms of memo dated September 25, 2007 cannot be
      sustained in law in view of the fact that it is revealed from the records
      produced before the court that the report of the Directorate of Agricultural
      Marketing, Government of West Bengal was not taken into consideration in
      fixing those rates.

            In view of the aforesaid discussion I have no hesitation to say that
      the impugned memo No.HF/O/MS/552/W-45/07 dated September 25,
      2007 is liable to be set aside keeping in mind the interest of the public at
      large and in particular keeping in mind the question of quality of diet to be
      supplied to the indoor patients of the Government Hospitals in the State.
      The impugned memo No. HF/O/MS/552/W-45/07 dated September 25,
      2007 is therefore, quashed and set aside. However, this will not prevent the
      state respondents to issue tender notice afresh inviting the intending
       suppliers to supply cooked diet to the indoor patients of different Hospitals
      of the State Government after determining the prices of different categories
      of such cooked diet keeping in mind the quality and quantity of such diet
      in the greater interest of the indoor patients as also to avoid unhealthy
      competition among the intending suppliers.

            The writ application is thus disposed of."


      WP No. 15125 (W) of 2008 and WP No. 21406 (W) of 2008 were instituted
by persons claiming to be interested to supply cooked diet to Government
hospitals for a mandamus on the Government to invite fresh offers for such
supply and to curb the continuation of the existing suppliers. These petitions
were disposed of on December 18, 2008 upon recording a concession made on
behalf of the State and observing, inter alia, as follows:

      "... Counsel representing the State, on instructions from the Joint
      Secretary to the Government of West Bengal, Department of Health and
      Family Welfare, M.S. Branch who was present in Court, submitted that the
      Government had decided not to prefer any intra court appeal against the
      judgment and order dated 25.9.2008 and would require at least six months
      time revise the rates of diet in compliance with such order.

            ...
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      "However, since it has been submitted on behalf of the State respondents
      that six months time would be required for determining the revised rates,
      this Court would direct them to proceed expeditiously in this respect
      keeping in mind the larger public interest and to determine the rates as
      early as possible but positively within six months from date so that on and
      from the first day of June of the following year, the process of tender for
      selection of agency to supply cooked diet to the indoor patients of the
      Government run hospitals may commence. Till such time tender process is
      finalized, it shall be open to the Government to obtain supply of cooked
      diet through such ad hoc arrangement it considers fit and proper."
</p>

<p id="p_2">      The time limit set by the order of December 18, 2008 has subsequently
been extended for a short duration. Within such enlarged time, a memorandum
of June 12, 2009 has been published, the first page whereof narrates the history
 of the supply of cooked diet to indoor patients at Government-run hospitals and
specifies the rates and diet to be now supplied:

<blockquote id="blockquote_1">             "The suggested schedule of food items for indoor patients of the
      Government Hospitals and the rate of cooked food for contract supply was
      introduced in 2002 vide G.O. No. HF/O/MS/237/5S-1/01 dated
      20.05.2002. Since then the rates have not been revised. A committee had
      been appointed by the Government vide G.O. No. HF/O/MS/160/W-45/07
      dated 16.04.2007 to review the previous rate and schedule of cooked diet.
      The committee reviewed the rate and schedule of cooked diet. The
      recommendations of the committee were accepted by the Government and
      in line with those recommendations a Government Order was issued vide
      No. HF/O/MS/552/W-45-07 dated 25.09.2007 which was challenged in
      the Hon'ble High Court, Calcutta regarding the merit of the
      recommendations. The Hon'ble High Court has directed the Government to
      review the rate and schedule of cooked diet expeditiously. Following the
      directions of the Hon'ble Court, a committee had been appointed vide G.O.
      No. HF/O/MS/870/1C-33/07 dated 30.12.2008 to review the rate
      schedule of cooked diet afresh. The said committee has reviewed the earlier
      schedule and has undertaken a detailed exercise to estimate the rates of
      different categories of cooked food based on the wholesale market prices
      provided by the Directorate of Agriculture Marketing, Government of West
      Bengal and the information collected through market enquiries.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      The rates approved are Rs.43.06 per adult patient full diet per day;
</blockquote><p id="p_3">Rs.21.53 for paediatric full diet upto the age of eight years per day; and, Rs.12.98
per admission diet. The minimum quantum of food is specified in the table (for
regular adult diet) and the competition between bidders now appears to be
restricted to offers for additional quantum to be supplied at the same rate.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      The State submits that there has been a substantive shift in stand
following the reservation expressed in the earlier orders of this Court that the
previous rates fixed did not permit quality diet to be supplied and, if bidders were
permitted to quote at even lower rates, there was bound to be a further
compromise on the quality of food made available to the patients. The State
suggests that reasonable rates have now been fixed and it is up to the bidders to
offer more food than specified in the chart and it is on the basis of the extras
offered that their bids would be assessed. The State insists that there has been
both a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the specified cooked diet and
the rates therefor.
</p><p id="p_5">      The petitioners assert that several of the eligibility criteria set are
meaningless and have been tailored to suit the State's favourites. The petitioners
criticise the eligibility criteria as being extraneous to the purpose of the work and
the quality thereof. The qualifications stipulated are assailed as being irrational,
discriminatory and mala fide. In particular, they question the rationale of the
following qualifications:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "Eligibility Criteria for Participating in the Tender

      "5.   The bidder must have a physical office premise with telephone
      connection in the sub-division of the hospitals for which the bid is being
      made.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "6.  The bidder should be registered with the Tax (PAN/TAN), EPF &amp; ESIC
      Authorities, CEC for Service Tax, Sales/VAT Authorities as may be
       required for providing the services and material to be used for managing
      the work and up to date clearance should be taken from all the statutory
      authorities for the previous three years.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            ...
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "10. The bidder must have at least two years experience in providing
      catering services to at least 250 persons per day (500 persons for Medical
      College Hospitals).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "11. The annual turnover of the bidder should be at least equal to twice
      the amount of the annual diet bills of the hospitals for which the bid is
      being made.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">      "12. The bidder should have a cash reserve equivalent to 4 months of diet
      bills of the hospitals for which the bid is being made.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">      "13. The bidder should be a profit making organization, having made a
      pre-tax profit of not less than 5% of annual turnover for the previous two
      financial years. (A Chartered Accountant certified copy of profit and loss
      statement of balance sheet for last three years is to be attached)"</blockquote>


<p id="p_6">      Some of the same conditions have also been cited by the petitioners in their
challenge to the new rates specified, though for different reasons. In the context
of the attack on such eligibility criteria, the petitioners say that there is no need
for an office premises with a telephone connection to be established in a sub-
division if a bidder has applied for any of the hospitals in such sub-division. The
petitioners say that it is possible that a party may apply for one or two of the six-
bed hospitals within a sub-division and it would be meaningless to maintain an
office with a telephone connection and an attendant in tow manning such office.
As to the sixth clause, the petitioners say that some bidders with less than the
statutory strength of employees would not be required to be registered with the
employees' provident fund authorities and others may not be liable, both on
account of the number of employees and the area of operation, to be registered
with the Employees' State Insurance Corporation. They say that such conditions
are irrational and geared to make room for the big fish and ruthlessly weed out
the smaller players. They argue that in the tenth clause there is discrimination
writ large in bidders for all categories of hospitals other than medical college
 hospitals to have the same extent of experience. The petitioners contend that
neither the annual turnover criterion nor the cash reserve condition, set in the
eleventh and twelfth clauses, respectively, makes any sense or is an influential
guide as to the capability of an intending participant. They assert that it is
irrelevant as to whether a caterer has made a profit over the previous two
financial years, as required by the thirteenth clause, to gauge his competence to
deliver.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      The State and the opposing contractors remind of the scope of judicial
review in assessing tender terms. They say that Courts have traditionally been
reluctant and slow to receive a challenge to the terms set; that the State should
be given sufficient elbow room to contract and be left free to identify the class of
persons that it would like to do business with. The State's submission is liberally
peppered with the now-clichéd expression, "free play in the joints."               The
substance of the submission is that in a matter of such public importance,
concerning the food that patients at Government hospitals would partake of, the
State would be well within its rights to insist that only capable contractors with
proven performance were welcome to apply. The State says that the petitioners
cannot base their claim on <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_2">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. The State
reassures that it is in the patients' interest, which is the paramount concern of
the State, that the eligibility criteria have been set. The State asserts that it is in
public interest that clean and warm food be supplied to indoor patients by able
contractors.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      On the fifth clause of the eligibility criteria, the State submits that there
must be a points-person for a sub-divisional hospital to deal with. A responsible
person should be available on call both to receive instructions and to be informed
of any inadequacy for immediate action and correction. It is submitted that the
tender terms do not require a separate office to be maintained to attend to
matters relating to every sub-divisional hospital where supply is effected or
proposed to be effected by a contractor or aspiring contractor; that if such clause
 had been inserted, then it would have been unreasonable. But in the tender
terms stipulating one office for every sub-division, it is justified, there has been
sufficient consideration shown and the maintenance of an office is vital for
ensuring prompt and quality service.
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Apropos the sixth clause the State clarifies that since the expression "as
may be required" is included in the clause there is no reason to apprehend that
all conditions envisaged by such clause would be made applicable to or binding
on every applicant. On the tenth clause the State submits that it is the
Government's considered view that only persons with established track record
would be sought for supply of cooked diet to Government hospitals and the Court
should not question such a matter of policy which has been deemed expedient.
</p>
<p id="p_10">      The State justifies the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth clauses on the same
ground as the tenth and insists that if it is the Government's considered opinion
that these criteria are essential to assess the capability of an applicant, the Court
should refrain from reassessing what is essentially a policy decision.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      Despite the pages and the sound bytes expended on the challenge to the
eligibility criteria set in the memorandum and reproduced in the tender
documents, the principal challenge is to the rates fixed thereby. The petitioners
say that if the rates set in September, 2007 were found to be inappropriate by the
Court, where the comparable general rate was fixed at Rs.37.40 per regular adult
diet per day, the present rate of Rs.43.06 should not pass muster. The petitioners
say that the tender terms entail various costs to be incurred by contractors other
than for the raw material for supplies and in the State imposing several
additional and expensive conditions on intending contractors, the price has not
been enhanced in real terms. The petitioners suggest that the State has not
determined the price in the light of the judgment rendered on September 23,
2008 on WP No. 23632 (W) 2007. The petitioners argue that if all the cost
components reflected in the tender terms are taken into account, it would be
evident that the quality of food would have to be compromised.
</p><p id="p_12">       The petitioners indicate several counts of challenge to the principal rate of
Rs. 43.06 per adult diet per day at paragraph 26 of the lead petition. The
petitioners question the basis of the rate being pegged to the wholesale market
prices provided by the Directorate of Agricultural Marketing. They say that
overheads do not appear to have been taken into account. They submit that cost
of utensils, labour cost and infrastructure expenses have not been kept sight of.
The petitions complain of substantial additional expenditure being required to be
made by contractors on account of employees' provident fund, employees' state
insurance and service tax. The petition refers to service tax being payable at the
rate of 10.3 per cent which would reduce the effective price of the daily diet to
below Rs.40/- per adult patient per day. The altruism in the petitioners come out
in their averment that such depressed rate would lead to unhealthy competition,
malpractice and jeopardise the interests of the patients. The petition refers to the
Chittaranjan Cancer Institute in Calcutta, which is run as a Government-
financed autonomous body fixing Rs.65/- per adult diet per day for 2007-08. The
petitions seek to make out that the diet chart of the cancer hospital is
comparable to the one now approved for State Government hospitals. The
petitions refer to the special terms and conditions incorporated in the tender
documents and argue that the adherence to the same would have an impact on
the cost at the hand of the contractor. The petitions cite the minimum daily wage
of Rs.122/- required to be paid for unskilled labour. The lead petition suggests,
with the aid of a chart and contemporaneous newspaper figures of rates of
vegetable, fish and chicken, that the approved daily diet would cost Rs.86.03 per
adult per day, inclusive of service tax. The petitioners submit that the raw
material cost, excluding cooking charges, man power and other overheads, for
breakfast would be Rs.10.28; for lunch Rs.19.25; and, for dinner Rs.17.45. The
petitioners claim a further Rs.5/- on account of daily cost of LPG per adult
patient, Rs.7/- daily for cooking oil and spices, Rs.12/- daily on account of
labour, Rs.4/- daily for electricity and water charges and Rs.4/- daily for other
overhead expenses.
</p><p id="p_13">       On the affidavit filed by the State, the petitioners say that only the prices of
uncooked food items have been taken into account in fixing the rates which
would betray an arbitrary exercise and irrational assessment. The petitioners
question the decision in the decision-making process not taking into account
relevant considerations.
</p>
<p id="p_14">      The State's affidavit details both the process and the rationale for arriving
at the figure of Rs.43.06 per adult diet per day. The affidavit speaks of the review
of the rates on the basis of the "rates prevailing at the material time i.e. 2007 and
2008 calendar year(s)." The relevant committee held its first meeting on January
6, 2009, the affidavit informs, and its last on May 14, 2009 when the calculated
rates were discussed and recommended by the committee on the same day. The
concurrence of the finance department was thereafter obtained and the approved
rates published. The affidavit says that at its first meeting, the committee
"resolved that the rates should be obtained on monthly basis from all the
districts for the year 2007 &amp; 2008 with annual average for each commodity." The
State says that the relevant committee required an expert committee of dieticians
from five medical colleges of Calcutta to suggest the diet with specific quantities
upon considering the calorific values thereof. The State's affidavit refers to the
committee having "calculated the median value of each commodity from annual
mean value of each district." The rate charts were supplied by the Directorate of
Agricultural Marketing. The affidavit mentions the median price of milk and the
committee's assessment, based on a national family health survey, that 0.0251
kg of gas is expended per meal per person every day. The affidavit explains the
basis for arriving at a figure of Rs.1.01 per meal per day on account of LPG cost
for cooking. The affidavit clarifies that the rates suggested are net of service tax
which would be reimbursed to the contractor on actuals. The affidavit asserts
that "it will be revealed that the tenderer will earn profit @ 10% of cost, per
patient, which includes cost of deployment of staff and other incidental charges,
while supplying the cooked diet at the rate fixed." According to the State,
 electricity charges work out to four paisa per patient per day which has also been
taken into account in the profit component.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      There is only one further point of note in the State's affidavit. It is averred
that "the present tender is to be submitted sub-division wise for all the hospitals
and Health Centers of Sub-Division to enable the bidder to break even and hence
the condition of 2 years experience of supplying meals to 250 persons per day."
The affidavit proceeds to argue that since "at the lowest level is Primary Health
Centers, the number of beds just a handful, it might be difficult for a contractor
to break even and reap profit, but if he is also supplying to the large hospitals
where he lacks a margin he will make up in numbers. It is thus desirable that
there should be only one supplier for one sub-division." A few sentences later the
affidavit says that "it is not possible for any contractor to supply cooked diet only
to any smaller establishments like Primary Health Center."
</p>
<p id="p_16">      There are two charts appended to the State's affidavit. In the second of
such charts, out of the 18 districts in the State five have been categorised as
large districts with at least five sub-divisions each, nine have been bracketed as
medium-sized districts with three to four sub-divisions and the remaining four
have been clubbed as small districts with upto two sub-divisions. An example of
each category of districts has been displayed in the chart from which it appears
that each sub-division in a large district would have well over 350 beds in all the
Government-run hospitals therein; that each sub-division in a medium-sized
district would also have at least 350 beds; and, a small-sized district would have
in excess of 250 beds in every sub-division.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      In course of submission, the State says that the rate fixation was made
with the interests of patients being supreme and not to assess or ensure the
commercial profit to be made by the contractors. The State submits that since
the indoor patients at Government hospitals have to bear the entirety or a part of
the meal cost, save for free beds and other exemptions, the decision-making
process has also taken into consideration the burden on the patients.
</p><p id="p_18">       The State has appended the recommendations of the committee made on
May 14, 2009. The committee reported that it had "reviewed the rate and
schedule recommended by the previous committee and had undertaken a
detailed exercise to estimate the rates of different categories of cooked food based
on the wholesale market prices." The committee said that it obtained the "average
rate of different commodities district-wise ... calculated for the years 2007 and
2008." The report indicated that the "median rate (had) been calculated from the
average district rates for that particular commodity." It justified the acceptance of
the median rate "to prevent the skewness due to extreme outliners of the district
averages." The individual diet rate was obtained by "multiplying the median rates
of the individual commodities with the requirements of that commodity in the
patient's diet as per the diet scale." After setting out the daily diet chart, which
has been reproduced verbatim in the memorandum of June 12, 2009, the
committee informed that it had assessed fuel cost for cooking at Rs.1.01 per meal
and had included in the rate "profit for contractor (at) 10% of costs which
includes deployment of staff and other incidental charges."
</p>
<p id="p_19">      Upon WP No. 11766 (W) of 2009 being received on July 15, 2009 an order
was made to the following effect, with almost identical orders being passed on the
other petitions at the initial stage:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_12">             "The writ petitioners complain of a notification dated June 12, 2009.
      In the supplementary affidavit that the petitioners have been permitted to
      use the tender terms for supply of cooked diet to government hospitals
      have been challenged on various grounds. The petitioners say that the
      eligibility criteria set are arbitrary and irrational and meant only to favour
      the existing contractors and keep other intending offerers at bay. The
      petitioners say that the maximum price fixed for supply of cooked diet is
      unreasonable and it is impossible for the specified items to be supplied
      within the price indicated.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">            "The matter requires to be considered on affidavits. Affidavit-in-
      opposition be filed by July 27, 2009; reply thereto, if any, by July 29, 2009
      and the matter will appear for final hearing at 2 p.m. on July 29, 2009.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">              "The petitioners will be permitted to participate in the tender process
      without prejudice to the respondents' contention that they may not be
      eligible. The petitioners' participation will not create any equity in favour of

      result of the writ petition.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">             "The applicants in CAN 6072 of 2009 will also be permitted to use an
      affidavit-in-opposition to the petition. A copy of the petition be made over to
      such applicants in course of this day. The petitioners may use an affidavit-
      in-reply.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">            The records relating to the fixing of the price should be produced at
      the hearing."</blockquote>


<p id="p_20">      The records have been produced. The solitary file contains papers relating
to the constitution of the committee, copies of several orders passed in these and
previous proceedings, a set of the papers connected with the memorandum of
June 12, 2009 and the papers presumably submitted by the committee which
form the basis of the committee's recommendations. The minutes of the first
meeting of the committee held on January 6, 2009, a copy whereof has been
appended to the State's affidavit, reveal the initial steps taken for determining the
appropriate rates. The committee resolved that "the rates should be obtained on
monthly basis from all the districts for the year 2007 &amp; 2008 with annual
average for each commodity." The Director of Agricultural Marketing was
requested to obtain the details. It was further resolved that an expert committee
be formed of dietitians to consider the category of diet, quantities and calorific
values thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_21">      The records show that a committee of dietitians was constituted and such
committee had met on January 21, 2009 and February 4, 2009. The minutes of
meeting of the diet committee held on February 4, 2009 show that the existing
diet schedule was found to be appropriate, but certain modifications were
 proposed. Under the heading of "Category of Diet", the dietitians, inter alia,
suggested:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">      "Category of Diet:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      •    It was resolved that Bed Tea in the morning should be supplied in order
           to reduce the gap between previous day's dinner and next day's
           breakfast.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      •    In lunch, the 100gm curd should be supplied in cups taken from some
           Government Dairy supplied regularly.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      •    In the afternoon Tea with Two Biscuits or Tiffin cake of good quality
           should be supplied. This is mainly to reduce the gap between lunch and
           dinner."</blockquote>


<p id="p_22">      Certain measures were proposed by the committee of dietitians on account
of quantity and hygiene. They suggested that raw fish of weight of 100gm be
provided to the adult patients since a 75gm piece would be reduced to less than
50gm after frying. They suggested that to ensure hygienic service, food should be
served in covered containers, preferably in aluminum foil packets as the usual
thalis carry the risk of contamination while cleaning and left over food creates
general waste.
</p>
<p id="p_23">      After observing that the "existing calorific value is optimum" and only
suggesting additional curd and an increased size of the banana for breakfast, the
dietitians recommended as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">      "Recommendations:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      1.      Arrangement of purified filtered drinking water in all wards is
              required for which necessary instruments must be installed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">      2.      Seasonal fruits should be included in lunch.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">      3.      Diet contractor should be visiting MSVP once in every month for any
              sort of feedback clarifications.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">      4.      Each hospital must constitute local diet committee for supervision
              and monitoring.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">       5.    Patient's satisfaction study should be periodically conducted. A
            specimen proforma of RGKMCH is enclosed herewith.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">      6.    The respective instructions should daily supervise that the enlisted
            items in the Diet menu is strictly adhered."</blockquote>


<p id="p_24">      Two other sets of petitioners added to the general submission made on
behalf of the petitioners in WP No. 11766 (W) of 2009. The petitioner in WP No.
12241 (W) of 2009 complains of the respondents not permitting the petitioner to
participate in the process notwithstanding the order dated July 22, 2009 made
when such petition was received. The order recorded the petitioner's submission
that the last date for depositing the bids had been extended till July 28, 2009
and provided that if such was the case the petitioner should be permitted to
participate in the process. The petitioner complains that though the last date for
receipt of bids had been extended, the date for supplying the tender documents
had not been enlarged and this was the excuse used by the respondents for
refusing the tender papers. CAN 6970 of 2009 has been filed to complain of the
respondents' refusal to allow this petitioner to participate in the tender process.
</p>
<p id="p_25">      This petitioner says that if only caterers with experience of having provided
service to at least 250 persons per day are considered eligible, it would imply that
only caterers who had previously supplied to Government hospitals could be
considered, which would be arbitrary and discriminating against new entrants
seeking to supply to Government hospitals. Such condition, according to the
petitioner, would perpetuate the hegemony of the existing contractors and would
amount to bias. The petitioner says that the abstract of the tender terms
published in a local newspaper circulated in Malda, discriminated against
aspiring applicants stationed in Calcutta or elsewhere since the exact conditions
could be assessed only upon obtaining the tender documents. This petitioner
relies on a judgment reported at 2008 (1) CHN 567 (<a href="/doc/185715/" id="a_3">Nicco Corporation Ltd. v.
Cable Corporation of India Ltd</a>.) and another reported at 2009 (2) CHN 699 (Biren
Biswas v. Dipti Narayan Biswas &amp; ors.) for the proposition that a notice inviting
 tender had to be widely publicised and mere the appearance thereof in a notice
board of the issuing office would not amount to meaningful publicity. The
judgments reported at (2008) 2 WBLR 393 (Sandeep Mitra v. Jharua Mitra) and
AIR 1979 SC 1628 (<a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_4">Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of
India</a>) are placed for the well-known principle that the eligibility criteria cannot be
subsequently altered unless express power to relax the same is reserved in the
tender terms.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      The grievance that this petitioner was unfairly excluded from the tender
process cannot be accepted. The notice inviting tender was issued on or about
July 3, 2009 and it indicated that the tender forms would be available till July
21, 2009 and the bids would be opened on July 22, 2009. Though the petition
was filed on July 14, 2009, the matter was mentioned only on July 21, 2009 to
be included in the supplementary list and the matter was directed to appear on
July 22, 2009. There was nothing that prevented this petitioner from either
coming to Court earlier or being diligent in causing the matter to be taken up
well ahead of July 22, 2009 which was the stipulated date for opening the bids.
Since it is found that the petitioner had not proceeded with due despatch in the
matter, there is no special feature to this petition and it has to be assessed on
the general grounds that are common to all the petitions. In other words, if the
memorandum of June 12, 2009 or the tender terms are struck down, this
petitioner will be entitled to the benefit thereof as that would imply that the
process undertaken by the respondent authorities would stand annulled.
However, if the said memorandum is sustained and the tender terms are upheld,
this petitioner would not get a look-in.
</p>
<p id="p_27">      The petitioner in WP No. 12728 (W) of 2009 has applied for supply to the
Mahesh Bhattacharya Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital which has a
bed-strength of 50. It is a stand-alone notice that has been issued by the
homoeopathic hospital for supply of cooked diet. In addition to adopting the
general submission made on behalf of the lead petitioners, this petitioner says
 that the stipulation that a contractor had to obtain registration from the
provident fund authorities and the Employees' State Insurance Corporation is
mala fide and an attempt by the State to shirk its responsibility as principal
employer. The petitioner places <a href="/doc/1235853/" id="a_5">Section 16(1)(b)</a> of the Employees' Provident Fund
and <a href="/doc/269107/" id="a_6">Miscellaneous Provisions Act</a>, 1952 and the definitions of an employee and a
principal employer under such Act to suggest that the State had attempted to
evade its obligation under the Act and fasten the same on the contractors.
Several provisions from the Employees' <a href="/doc/88376/" id="a_7">State Insurance Act</a>, 1948 have been
placed for similar purpose. This petitioner says that even if it be assumed that
the State was within its rights to insist on bidders obtaining registration under
both the 1952 Act and the 1948 Act, there would be a concomitant cost
component thereof which has not been taken into account in fixing the rate. This
petitioner suggests that the general mindlessness on the part of the State would
be apparent from the contradictions and anomalies appearing in the technical
bid form supplied by the homoeopathic hospital. The bid form appears at pages
138-139 of the relevant petition and requires, inter alia, a central excise licence
number to be furnished, a bidder to attach certificates to establish three years'
experience in daily catering to 150 persons and the annual turnover figures for
the last five years. This petitioner says that such conditions are either not
enumerated in the eligibility criteria set out in the tender papers appearing at
page 135 of this petition or are contrary to such conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_28">      There is substantial basis to this petitioner's attack on the apparent
contradictions in the tender documents. Nothing in the eligibility criteria requires
any central excise licence to be obtained. Clause 10 of the conditions at page 135
of this petition stipulates two years' experience in providing catering services to
at least 100 persons per day, but the tender form demands three years'
experience in daily catering to 150 persons. Since clause 9 of the eligibility
criteria demands that a bidder should have at least three years' experience in the
field of catering, the tender form is unquestionably flawed in demanding annual
turnover figures for five years.
</p><p id="p_29">       The rationale of the process is questioned by the petitioners by referring to
clause 20(f) of the terms and conditions for cooked diet tender set by the
Government and appended to the memorandum of June 12, 2009. The relevant
clause provides,

      "20.   Process of selection of successful bidder

             ...
</p>
<p id="p_30">         f. The commercial bids of these identified successful technical bidders
            will be evaluated and based on the criteria of maximum supply of
            diet at fixed rate, the bidder offering to supply the highest amount of
            diet over and above the minimum prescribed diet scale will be
            selected for acceptance of rates."
</p>

<p id="p_31">      The State and the opposing contractors are quick to point out that clause
20(f) of the suggested terms is not as irrational as the petitioners make it out to
be. They say that the relevant clause does not imply that a bid may be received
with an additional banana or an extra egg being offered at the specified rate.
They submit that at the foot of the commercial bid form there is the following that
appears which would imply that an overall percentage of diet in excess of the
minimum stipulated would have to be specified:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">      "Additional percentage of diet over and above minimum of the scale
      proposed by the tenderer at Total allowable cost

      In words _____________
      In figures ____________"</blockquote>

<p id="p_32">      The State says that the bidder who offers the most, in percentage terms,
above the minimum stipulated diet for any particular hospital or in respect of any
particular tender would, ordinarily, be regarded as the highest bidder and
entitled to be awarded the contract. The State suggests that this measure
adopted would ensure that neither the quality nor the quantity of the diet is
 compromised and that patients get more than the minimum stipulated quantum
of diet.
</p>
<p id="p_33">       The State asserts that the very fact that a large number of applications
have been received following the notices inviting tenders, it would be evident that
intending contractors perceive the new rates to be worthy of effecting supply on
such basis. The State insists that there has been a significant upward revision of
the rate. The 2007 general rate was Rs.28.50 per daily adult diet. An ad hoc
increase of 19 per cent has been allowed and contractors now supply at the
general rate of Rs.33.91 per adult patient per day. The figure of Rs.43.06 reflects
a 26 per cent increase in the general rate of Rs.33.91 and a 51 per cent increase
over the 2007 general rate of Rs.28.50 per adult patient per day. It is submitted
that since the State has decided that bids would only be accepted for all
Government hospitals in every sub-division and not individual bids for
Government hospitals within a sub-division, the intending contractors would
make up in volume what they may not be able to achieve by way of margin. A
chart appended to the State's affidavit in the first petition is referred to. The chart
shows that the minimum number of beds in all Government hospitals within a
sub-division is in Islampur, Uttar Dinajpur, having 261 beds and the maximum
is of 848 beds in Birbhum Sadar sub-division in district Birbhum.
</p>
<p id="p_34">       As to the specific complaint of the petitioner in WP No. 12241 (W) of 2009
that the advertisement was in abridged form and did not contain details of the
eligibility criteria for an intending bidder stationed elsewhere to make an
informed decision as to whether he would be eligible or ought to apply, the State
says that the few beds covered by the advertisement did not warrant a bigger,
more expensive advertisement being published.
</p>
<p id="p_35">       In their rejoinder, the petitioners harp on the rates stipulated by the
Chittaranjan Cancer Institute and submit that there is no justification which has
been proffered by the State as to how the general rate at the cancer institute
could be so much higher than the general rate for adult patients stipulated by
 the State Government. The petitioners submit that there is nothing more in the
solitary file of records produced by the State that would throw any further light
on the matter to justify the conduct complained of. They refer to a further
contradiction apparent from the suggested tender terms appended to the
memorandum of June 12, 2009. Though the memorandum indicates only three
rates at clause 6 thereof - Rs.43.06 for adult full diet, Rs.21.53 for paediatric full
diet upto the age of eight years and Rs.12.98 per admission diet - the full fluid
diet works out to Rs.38.94 at Rs.12.98 per meal which is anomalous since the
seven categories of diet, other than paediatric diet are all shown to cost Rs.43.06
at the second page of the memorandum. The petitioners reiterate that neither the
form of the proposed agreement appended as annexure E to the memorandum
nor elsewhere in the memorandum and its other appendices is it mentioned that
bids would have to be for all hospitals within a sub-division and may not be
made in respect of one or some of the hospitals therein. They submit that the
service tax component in the price to be paid to the contractors had not been
considered at all and only upon a challenge on such score in the petition, the
State has responded in its affidavit by suggesting that the service tax would be
reimbursed to the contractors. The petitioners demonstrate that nothing in the
proposed form of agreement would entitle the contractors to claim on account of
service tax which, at over 10 per cent of the applicable rate, makes up a
substantial part of the daily cost that had been completely overlooked both by the
committee commissioned by the State and the State in perfunctorily accepting
the recommendations of the committee.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      Several judicial pronouncements have been brought on behalf of the
parties to remind the Court of the relevant considerations to be taken into
account in this jurisdiction. The petitioners rely on a decision reported at 2009
(2) CHN 122 (West Bengal State Electrical Contractors Association &amp; ors. v. The
Commissioner, Employees' Provident Fund Organisation &amp; others) and refer to the
observation that though the writ court would be slow to interfere with the
eligibility criteria set by the State or any of its instrumentalities, such criteria
 could be undone "only if they were found to be arbitrary, discriminatory, mala
fide or actuated by bias."
</p>
<p id="p_37">      A decision reported at (2007) 8 SCC 1 (Reliance Energy Ltd. &amp; anr. v.
Maharashtra State Road Development Corpn. Ltd. &amp; ors.) is placed on behalf of the
petitioners to demonstrate the expanse of the inquiry that may be made in
judicial review. The appellant before the Supreme Court questioned the rationale
of the consultant engaged by the employer in finding the appellant unworthy to
progress to the commercial stage of bidding for the construction of the Mumbai
Trans Harbour Link between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The consultant found
that the consortium to which the appellant belonged did not meet the net cash
profit floor-limit of Rs.200 crore that the eligibility criteria specified. The
consultant referred to accounting principles in treating the particulars furnished
and upon the appellant crying foul and citing Articles 14, 21 and 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution, the Supreme Court embarked on an exercise of assessing the
figures after sifting through the knotty tools of accounting. The petitioners here
say that the Supreme Court did not buy the lack-of-expertise-of-the-Court line
that is the usual refrain of uncomfortable respondents in this jurisdiction.
Paragraph 39 of the report is placed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">      "39. <a href="/doc/379361/" id="a_8">In Reliance Airport Developers (P) Ltd. v. Airports Authority of India the
      Division Bench</a> of this Court has held that in matters of judicial review the
      basic test is to see whether there is any infirmity in the decision-making
      process and not in the decision itself. This means that the decision-maker
      must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making
      power and he must give effect to it otherwise it may result in illegality. The
      principle of "judicial review" cannot be denied even in contractual matters
      or matters in which the Government exercises its contractual powers, but
      judicial review is intended to prevent arbitrariness and it must be exercised
      in larger public interest. Expression of different views and opinions in
      exercise of contractual powers may be there, however, such difference of
      opinion must be based on specified norms. Those norms may be legal norms
      or accounting norms. As long as the norms are clear and properly
      understood by the decision-maker and the bidders and other stakeholders,
      uncertainty and thereby breach of the rule of law will not arise. The
      grounds upon which administrative action is subjected to control by
       judicial review are classifiable broadly under three heads, namely,
      illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. In the said judgment it
      has been held that all errors of law are jurisdictional errors. One of the
      important principles laid down in the aforesaid judgment is that whenever
      a norm/benchmark is prescribed in the tender process in order to provide
      certainty that norm/standard should be clear. As stated above "certainty"
      is an important aspect of the rule of law. In Reliance Airport Developers the
      scoring system formed part of the evaluation process. The object of that
      system was to provide identification of factors, allocation of marks of each
      of the said factors and giving of marks at different stages. Objectivity was
      thus provided."</blockquote>


<p id="p_38">      The opposing contractors cite a judgment reported at (1990) 3 SCC 223
(<a href="/doc/682224/" id="a_9">Shri Sitaram Sugar Co. Ltd. v. Union of India</a>) on the limitation of the Court's
powers when assessing the price fixed by the State. Paragraphs 49, 57 and 58 of
the report are placed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_30">      "49. Where a question of law is at issue, the court may determine the
      rightness of the impugned decision on its own independent judgment. If
      the decision of the authority does not agree with that which the court
      considers to be the right one, the finding of law by the authority is liable to
      be upset. Where it is a finding of fact, the court examines only the
      reasonableness of the finding. When that finding is found to be rational
      and reasonably based on evidence, in the sense that all relevant material
      has been taken into account and no irrelevant material has influenced the
      decision, and the decision is one which any reasonably minded person,
      acting on such evidence, would have come to, then judicial review is
      exhausted even though the finding may not necessarily be what the court
      would have come to as a trier of fact. Whether an order is characterised as
      legislative or administrative or quasi-judicial, or, whether it is a
      determination of law or fact, the judgment of the expert body, entrusted
      with power, is generally treated as final and the judicial function is
      exhausted when it is found to have "warrant in the record" and a rational
      basis in law: See Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States. See also Associated
      Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_31">      "57. Judicial review is not concerned with matters of economic policy. The
      court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or its
      agents as to matters within the province of either. The court does not
      supplant the "feel of the expert" by its own views. When the legislature acts
      within the sphere of its authority and delegates power to an agent, it may
      empower the agent to make findings of fact which are conclusive provided
      such findings satisfy the test of reasonableness. In all such cases, judicial
       inquiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are
      reasonably based on evidence and whether such findings are consistent
      with the laws of the land. As stated by Jagannatha Shetty, J. in Gupta
      Sugar Works: (SCC p. 479, para 4)

         "... the court does not act like a chartered accountant nor acts like an
         income tax officer. The court is not concerned with any individual case
         or any particular problem. The court only examines whether the price
         determined was with due regard to considerations provided by the
         statute. And whether extraneous matters have been excluded from
         determination."

<blockquote id="blockquote_32">      "58. Price fixation is not within the province of the courts. Judicial
      function in respect of such matters is exhausted when there is found to be
      a rational basis for the conclusions reached by the concerned authority. As
      stated by Justice Cardozo in Mississippi Valley Barge Line Company v.
      United States of America (292 US 282: 78 L ed 1260)

         "The structure of a rate schedule calls in peculiar measure for the use of
         that enlightened judgment which the Commission by training and
         experience is qualified to form.... It is not the province of a court to
         absorb this function to itself.... The judicial function is exhausted when
         there is found to be a rational basis for the conclusions approved by the
         administrative body."</blockquote>


<p id="p_39">      The petitioners before the Supreme Court in such case were owners of
sugar mills who challenged the validity of notifications issued by the Central
Government in exercise of its power under the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_10">Essential Commodities Act</a>. The
petitioners contended that the prices did not reflect the actual manufacturing
cost of sugar incurred by producers or secure to them reasonable returns on the
capital employed. The judgment rests on the principle that when the legislature
acts within the spheres of its authority and delegates power to an agent, the
judicial inquiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are
reasonably based on evidence and are consistent with the laws of the land. There
is, a fortiori, a judicial enquiry permissible to ascertain the reasonableness of the
findings qua their mooring to the evidence on which they are founded.
</p><p id="p_40">       The opposing contractors refer to another judgment reported at (1987) 2
SCC 720 (<a href="/doc/1646640/" id="a_11">Union of India v. Cynamide India Ltd</a>.) to emphasise that price fixation
is not the function of court. Again, the highest judicial forum in the country did
not altogether rule out an inquiry as to whether relevant considerations had been
taken into account in arriving at the price and irrelevant considerations kept out
of the determination. Paragraph 4 of the report summarises the legal position:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      "4.    We start with the observation, "Price fixation is neither the function
      nor the forte of the court". We concern ourselves neither with the policy nor
      with the rates. But we do not totally deny ourselves the jurisdiction to
      enquire into the question, in appropriate proceedings, whether relevant
      considerations have gone in and irrelevant considerations kept out of the
      determination of the price. For example, if the legislature has decreed the
      pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the
      determination of the price, we will, if necessary, enquire into the question
      whether the policy and the factors are present to the mind of the
      authorities specifying the price. But our examination will stop there. We
      will go no further. We will not deluge ourselves with more facts and figures.
      The assembling of the raw materials and the mechanics of price fixation
      are the concern of the executive and we leave it to them. And, we will not
      re-evaluate the considerations even if the prices are demonstrably injurious
      to some manufacturers or producers. The court will, of course, examine if
      there is any hostile discrimination. That is a different "cup of tea"
      altogether."</blockquote>


<p id="p_41">      The Court is reminded of the bounds of its authority in exercise of the
power of judicial review. A judgment reported at (2003) 1 SCC 341 (<a href="/doc/1754001/" id="a_12">Rayalaseema
Paper Mills Ltd. v. Govt. of A.P</a>.) is cited and paragraph 15 thereof placed to
suggest that the power of judicial review is not akin to the jurisdiction exercised
by an appellate authority:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">      "15. This Court was examining the scope of judicial scrutiny in the
      matters of price fixation where it was governed by statutory provisions. The
      scope of judicial scrutiny would be far less where the price fixation is not
      governed by the statute or a statutory order. Where the legislature has
      prescribed the factors which should be taken into consideration and which
      should guide the determination of price, the courts would examine whether
      the considerations for fixing the price mentioned in the statute or the
      statutory order have been kept in mind while fixing the price and whether
       these factors have guided the determination. The courts would not go
      beyond that point. In the present appeals, there is no law, or any statutory
      provision laying down the criteria or the principles which must be followed,
      or which must guide the determination of rates of royalty. No doubt, any
      arbitrary action taken by the State would be subject to scrutiny by the
      courts because arbitrariness is the very antithesis of rule of law. But this
      does not mean that this Court would act as an Appellate Authority over the
      determination of rates of royalty by the Government. The Government is
      the owner of the products. While it had agreed to supply a particular
      quantity every year for specified period, it had never agreed to supply at a
      particular rate; nor did it stipulate with the mill-owners the basis upon
      which it would determine the rates of royalty. It is open to the Government
      to fix such price as it thinks appropriate having regard to public interest,
      which inter alia, may include interest of revenue, environmental, ecology,
      the need of mills and the requirements of other consumers. The price is not
      to be fixed keeping in mind the requirements of the mills alone."</blockquote>


<p id="p_42">      The opposing contractors suggest that once a reasonable margin of profit
has been provided for the contractors in the price fixed, there would be no
arbitrariness or unreasonableness in the determination. A judgment reported at
(1974) 1 SCC 468 (<a href="/doc/1758272/" id="a_13">Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Union of India</a>) is relied on to
bring out the distinction between price and fair price:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">      "65. If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit, there
      is never any question of infringement of fundamental right to carry on
      business by imposing reasonable restrictions. The question of fair price to
      the consumer with reference to the dominant, object and purpose of the
      legislation claiming equitable distribution and availability at fair price is
      completely lost sight of if profit and the producer's return are kept in the
      forefront. The maintenance or increase of supplies of the commodity or the
      equitable distribution and availability at fair prices are the fundamental
      purposes of the Act. If the prices of yarn or cloth are fixed in such a way to
      enable the manufacturer or producer to recover his cost of production and
      secure a reasonable margin of profit, no aspect of infringement of
      fundamental right can be said to arise."</blockquote>


<p id="p_43">      The next case brought is one reported at AIR 1968 Bom 75 (<a href="/doc/902793/" id="a_14">The Wholesale
Grain and Seed Merchants' Association, Nagpur &amp; ors. v. The State of Maharashtra</a>
through Secretary, Food Department, Bombay &amp; anr.) where the low margin of
profit of 3½ per cent of landed cost was considered to be reasonable in a price
 control order. Though the analogy may not hold good as the rates fixed in the
present case are not under any price control order, the relevant passages from
paragraphs 28 and 29 of the report may be noticed in the context of the State's
suggestion that it has been the State's endeavour to keep the rates down to
ensure that the ordinary patient at a Government hospital is able to afford the
meals thereat:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">      "28. ... The Order is made in exercise of powers under Rule 125 of the
      Defence of India Rules and an order made under those Rules is beyond
      challenge, except on the ground that the Order purporting to regulate the
      margin of profit cannot be made in the purported exercise of that power to
      control prices. We shall examine this attack based on this contention later
      on. So far as fixation of margin of profit by the Order is concerned, whether
      1 per cent or 1½ per cent or 5 per cent over and above certain expenses or
      what is called price paid by the dealer for the purchase of a particular
      foodgrain cannot be challenged as an unreasonable restriction on the right
      of the petitioners to carry on their trade. In this connection, in our opinion,
      the decision of the Supreme Court in Narendra Kumar's case, AIR 1960 SC
      430, wherein an overall margin of profit of 3½ per cent of the landed cost
      was fixed in controlling the price, has been sustained even though it may
      result in a few cases in eliminating the middleman, is a complete answer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">      "29. ... Under the proviso, the State Government has reserved to itself the
      right to fix different margins of profit in different areas or in respect of
      different foodgrains or of different varieties of foodgrains, or in respect of
      different consignments of foodgrains received for distribution and sale,
      having regard to the supply position in any area, or availability of different
      varieties of foodgrains or necessity for securing increased supply of any
      varieties of foodgrains. It cannot thus be said that fixation of margin of
      profit is rigid and unchangeable and does not and will not take into
      consideration the legitimate items of expenditure incurred by a dealer for
      the purchase of foodgrains, or, in other words, in determining the cost of
      foodgrains to the dealer and the price at which a dealer is expected to sell
      that commodity at the stated margin of profit, the requirement of the
      condition that a dealer shall not charge in respect of sales a margin of
      profit in excess of that fixed is vague or unreasonable."</blockquote>


<p id="p_44">      The limited scope of inquiry permitted in assessing the reasonableness of
the eligibility criteria set in the tender terms is emphasised by the opposing
contractors. A decision reported at (2009) 6 SCC 171 (<a href="/doc/410137/" id="a_15">Meerut Development
 Authority v. Association of Management Studies</a> &amp; anr.) as to the nature of the
rights of a participant at a tender process is cited. Paragraphs 26 to 29 of the
report capture the contemporary legal position:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">      "26. A tender is an offer. It is something which invites and is
      communicated to notify acceptance. Broadly stated it must be
      unconditional; must be in the proper form, the person by whom tender is
      made must be able to and willing to perform his obligations. The terms of
      the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the
      invitation to tender is in the realm of contract. However, a limited judicial
      review may be available in cases where it is established that the terms of
      the invitation to tender were so tailor-made to suit the convenience of any
      particular person with a view to eliminate all others from participating in
      the bidding process.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">      "27. The bidders participating in the tender process have no other right
      except the right to equality and fair treatment in the matter of evaluation of
      competitive bids offered by interested persons in response to notice inviting
      tenders in a transparent manner and free from hidden agenda. One cannot
      challenge the terms and conditions of the tender except on the abovestated
      ground, the reason being the terms of the invitation to tender are in the
      realm of the contract. No bidder is entitled as a matter of right to insist the
      authority inviting tenders to enter into further negotiations unless the
      terms and conditions of notice so provided for such negotiations.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">      "28. It is so well settled in law and needs no restatement at our hands
      that disposal of the public property by the State or its instrumentalities
      partakes the character of a trust. The methods to be adopted for disposal of
      public property must be fair and transparent providing an opportunity to
      all the interested persons to participate in the process.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">      "29. The Authority has the right not to accept the highest bid and even to
      prefer a tender other than the highest bidder, if there exist good and
      sufficient reasons, such as, the highest bid not representing the market
      price but there cannot be any doubt that the Authority's action in
      accepting or refusing the bid must be free from arbitrariness or
      favouritism."</blockquote>

<p id="p_47">       There is no doubt that a citizen has a fundamental right to carry on trade

the government or any other individual to do business with him. Any government
has the same freedom as any individual or organisation to decide on the person
or class of persons that it prefers to deal with and no restriction will ordinarily be
imposed by a Court to fetter such freedom.

<p id="p_48">      The State contends that the rates reflect an executive decision in a field of
economic activity and, though it may not be perfect, the Court should leave the
government free to experiment and even err in the trial for the government to
subsequently correct itself in course of the experience. In support of such
argument a judgment reported at (2002) 2 SCC 333 (<a href="/doc/1737583/" id="a_22">BALCO Employees' Union
(Regd.) v. Union of India</a>) has been brought. The State relies on the passage at
paragraph 36 of the report that quotes with approval from paragraph 34 of the
judgment reported at (1986) 4 SCC 566 (<a href="/doc/320843/" id="a_23">State of MP v. Nandlal Jaiswal</a>):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_44">      "36. ... What we said in that case in regard to legislation relating to

      placed on as high a pedestal as legislative judgment insofar as judicial
      deference is concerned. We must not forget that in complex economic
      matters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based on
      experimentation or what one may call 'trial and error method' and,
      therefore, its validity cannot be tested on any rigid 'a priori' considerations
      or on the application of any strait-jacket formula. The Court must while
      adjudging the constitutional validity of an executive decision relating to
      economic matters grant a certain measure of freedom or 'play in the joints'
      to the executive. 'The problem of Government' as pointed out by the
      Supreme Court of the United States in Metropolis Theater Co. v. State of
      Chicago

         'are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough
         accommodations, illogical, it may be, and unscientific. But even such

         Mere errors of Government are not subject to our judicial review. It is
         only its palpably arbitrary exercises which can be declared void'.
       The Government, as was said in Permian Basin Area Rate cases, is entitled
      to make pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular
      circumstances. The Court cannot strike down a policy decision taken by
      the State Government merely because it feels that another policy decision
      would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific or logical. The Court can
      interfere only if the policy decision is patently arbitrary, discriminatory or
      mala fide. It is against the background of these observations and keeping
      them in mind that we must now proceed to deal with the contention of the

</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">      "12. After an exhaustive consideration of a large number of decisions and
      standard books on administrative law, the Court enunciated the principle

      The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the manner
      in which the decision was made. The court does not have the expertise to
      correct the administrative decision. If a review of the administrative
      decision is permitted it will be substituting its own decision, without the
      necessary expertise, which itself may be fallible. The Government must
      have freedom of contract. In other words, fair play in the joints is a

contours of judicial review upon a challenge to a tender process:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">      "10. There have been several decisions rendered by this Court on the
      question of tender process, the award of contract and have evolved several
      principles in regard to the same. Ultimately what prevails with the courts
      in these matters is that while public interest is paramount there should be
      no arbitrariness in the matter of award of contract and all participants in
       the tender process should be treated alike. We may sum up the legal
      position thus:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">         (i) The Government is free to enter into any contract with citizens but
         the court may interfere where it acts arbitrarily or contrary to public
         interest.

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">         (ii) The Government cannot arbitrarily choose any person it likes for

<blockquote id="blockquote_50">         (iii) It is open to the Government to reject even the highest bid at a
         tender where such rejection is not arbitrary or unreasonable or such
         rejection is in public interest for valid and good reasons."</blockquote>


<p id="p_51">      In a change of tack, the State places a judgment reported at (2000) 5 SCC
488 (<a href="/doc/161448/" id="a_26">Arnit Das v. State of Bihar</a>) in furtherance of the argument that the order of
September 25, 2008 on WP No. 23632 (W) of 2007 did not take into account the
desirability of the court going into the nitty-gritty of price fixation and if the
judgment implies that the court could supervise and have the final say on the
rate of cooked diet to be supplied to government hospitals in the state, then such
aspect passed sub-silentio in the judgment. As to the meaning of sub-silentio,
paragraph 20 of the report is cited:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">      "20. A decision not expressed, not accompanied by reasons and not
      proceeding on a conscious consideration of an issue cannot be deemed to
      be a law declared to have a binding effect as is contemplated by Article
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_52">      141. That which has escaped in the judgment is not the ratio decidendi.

      &amp; Chemicals Ltd</a>. SCC, para 41.)"</blockquote>


<p id="p_52">      On the general principles involved in judicial review in a matter pertaining
to the award of government contracts, the State cites a judgment reported at
(2004) 4 SCC 19 (<a href="/doc/149148745/" id="a_28">Directorate of Education v. Educomp Datamatics Ltd</a>.) and places
reliance on paragraphs 9 to 12 of the report where the relevant previous
pronouncements of the Supreme Court had been noticed:
</p><p id="p_53"> "9.   It is well settled now that the courts can scrutinise the award of the
contracts by the Government or its agencies in exercise of their powers of
judicial review to prevent arbitrariness or favouritism. However, there are
inherent limitations in the exercise of the power of judicial review in such
matters. The point as to the extent of judicial review permissible in
contractual matters while inviting bids by issuing tenders has been
examined in depth by this Court in <a href="/doc/884513/" id="a_29">Tata Cellular v. Union of India</a>. After
examining the entire case-law the following principles have been deduced:
(SCC pp. 687-88, para 94)

   "94. The principles deducible from the above are:
</p><p id="p_54">   (1) The modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative
   action.
</p>
<p id="p_55">   (2) The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the
   manner in which the decision was made.
</p>
<p id="p_56">   (3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative
   decision. If a review of the administrative decision is permitted it will be
   substituting its own decision, without the necessary expertise which
   itself may be fallible.
</p>
<p id="p_57">   (4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny
   because the invitation to tender is in the realm of contract. Normally
   speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the contract is
   reached by process of negotiations through several tiers. More often than
   not, such decisions are made qualitatively by experts.
</p>
<p id="p_58">   (5) The Government must have freedom of contract. In other words, a fair
   play in the joints is a necessary concomitant for an administrative body
   functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi-administrative sphere.
   However, the decision must not only be tested by the application of
   Wednesbury principle of reasonableness (including its other facts pointed
   out above) but must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or
   actuated by mala fides.
</p>
<p id="p_59">   (6) Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burden on the
   administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted expenditure."
</p><p id="p_60">       (emphasis supplied)

"10. <a href="/doc/722054/" id="a_30">In Air India Ltd. v. Cochin International Airport Ltd</a>. this Court
observed: (SCC p. 623, para 7)
    "The award of a contract, whether it is by a private party or by a public
   body or the State, is essentially a commercial transaction. In arriving at
   a commercial decision considerations which are paramount are
   commercial considerations. The State can choose its own method to
   arrive at a decision. It can fix its own terms of invitation to tender and
   that is not open to judicial scrutiny. It can enter into negotiations before
   finally deciding to accept one of the offers made to it. Price need not
   always be the sole criterion for awarding a contract. It is free to grant
   any relaxation, for bona fide reasons, if the tender conditions permit
   such a relaxation. It may not accept the offer even though it happens to
   be the highest or the lowest. But the State, its corporations,
   instrumentalities and agencies are bound to adhere to the norms,
   standards and procedure laid down by them and cannot depart from
   them arbitrarily. Though that decision is not amenable to judicial
   review, the court can examine the decision-making process and
   interfere if it is found vitiated by mala fides, unreasonableness and
   arbitrariness." (emphasis supplied)

"11. This principle was again restated by this Court in <a href="/doc/1780859/" id="a_31">Monarch
Infrastructure (P) Ltd. v. Commr., Ulhasnagar Municipal Corpn. It</a> was held
that the terms and conditions in the tender are prescribed by the
Government bearing in mind the nature of contract and in such matters
the authority calling for the tender is the best judge to prescribe the terms
and conditions of the tender. It is not for the courts to say whether the
conditions prescribed in the tender under consideration were better than
the ones prescribed in the earlier tender invitations.
</p>
<p id="p_61">"12. It has clearly been held in these decisions that the terms of the
invitation to tender are not open to judicial scrutiny, the same being in the
realm of contract. That the Government must have a free hand in setting
the terms of the tender. It must have reasonable play in its joints as a
necessary concomitant for an administrative body in an administrative
sphere. The courts would interfere with the administrative policy decision
only if it is arbitrary, discriminatory, mala fide or actuated by bias. It is
entitled to pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by the particular
circumstances. The courts cannot strike down the terms of the tender
prescribed by the Government because it feels that some other terms in the
tender would have been fair, wiser or logical. The courts can interfere only
if the policy decision is arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide."
</p><p id="p_62">       A more recent judgment reported at (2008) 11 SCC 273 (BSNL v Bhupender
Minhas) is placed by the State where the law as recognised in Educomp
Datamatics Ltd. has been reiterated.
</p>
<p id="p_63">      On behalf of the State, another judgment reported at (2007) 11 SCC 92
(<a href="/doc/1569551/" id="a_32">U.P. SEB v. Pooran Chand Pandey</a>) is cited and paragraphs 12 to 16 thereof
placed as to the principles to be kept in mind in applying the law laid down in
previous authorities to the facts of a case in hand. A two-judge Bench in Pooran
Chand Pandey had distinguished a Constitution Bench judgment reported at
(2006) 4 SCC 1 (<a href="/doc/179794777/" id="a_33">State of Karnataka v. Umadevi</a> (3)) and observed that the
"Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and any judgment, not even of the
Supreme Court, can violate the Constitution." This judgment has, however, been
held to be per incuriam and overruled in Official Liquadator v. Dayanand ((2008)
10 SCC 1) and it was inappropriate for it to be cited.
</p>

<p id="p_64">      Further authorities have been presented by the State so that what is
claimed to be its policy decision embodied in its determination of price is
insulated from any searching inquiry in judicial review. The judgment reported at
(1998) 4 SCC 117 (<a href="/doc/1563564/" id="a_34">State of Punjab v. Ram Lubhaya Bagga</a>) is placed in support of
the proposition that the Court would generally refrain from probing into any
policy matter. The State relies on a sentence at paragraph 31 of the report that
the "court would not interfere with any opinion formed by the government as it is
based on relevant facts and circumstances or based on expert advice." On the
same aspect of limited judicial interference in a policy decision, a judgment
reported at (2007) 6 SCC 44 (<a href="/doc/586046/" id="a_35">Ram Singh Vijay Pal Singh v. State of U.P</a>.) is placed
where the Supreme Court reiterated the principle and quoted its earlier
enunciation of the proposition in the BALCO Employees' Union case.
</p>
<p id="p_65">      With particular reference to the petition in WP No. 12603 (W) of 2009, the
State says that the petitioner, Trilochan Ghosh, had no locus standi to bring the
petition as it is evident from the opening paragraphs of the petition that the
 contractor and the intending bidder was a co-operative society and not the
named petitioner. The State says that the affidavit in support of the petition
would show no authority of the relevant co-operative society and the petitioner
had no right to bring a vicarious action on behalf of the society. The judgments
reported at (2007) 5 SCC 65 (<a href="/doc/1680408/" id="a_36">State of Manipur v. Y. Token Singh</a>) and (2007) 10
SCC 635 (<a href="/doc/1637170/" id="a_37">Raj Kumari Soni v. State of U.P</a>.) are placed in the context to
demonstrate that a petitioner ought to have a legal right to maintain proceedings
in this jurisdiction and that the foundational facts have to be adequately pleaded
in the petition to enable the respondents to meet the case. Paragraph 18 of the
report in Y. Token Singh may be particularly noticed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_53">      "18. Moreover, it was for the respondents who had filed the writ petitions
      to prove existence of legal right in their favour. They had inter alia prayed
      for issuance of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus. It was, thus, for
      them to establish existence of a legal right in their favour and a
      corresponding legal duty in the respondents to continue to be employed.
      With a view to establish their legal rights to enable the High Court to issue
      a writ of mandamus, the respondents were obligated to establish that the
      appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate
      adumbrated in Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. They have
      not been able to show that any advertisement had been issued inviting
      applications from eligible candidates to fill up the said posts. It has also
      not been shown that the vacancies had been notified to the employment
      exchange."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_54">      A judgment reported at (2007) 10 SCC 33 (Puravankara Projects Ltd v.
</blockquote><p id="p_66">Hotel Venus International) is next placed to demonstrate the distinction between
administrative law and contract law and paragraphs 32 and 33 of the report are
referred to in furtherance of the contention that the principles of fairness or
reasonableness cannot be invoked to alter the terms set in the tender documents
by a government or any of its instrumentalities:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_55">      "32. In Asstt. <a href="/doc/1974738/" id="a_38">Excise Commr. v. Isaac Peter</a> this Court highlighted that the
      concept of administrative law and fairness should not be mixed up with fair
      or unfair terms of the contract. It was stated in no uncertain terms that
      duty to act fairly which is sought to be imported into a contract to modify
       and/or alter its terms and/or to create an obligation upon the State
      Government which is not there in the contract is not covered by any
      doctrine of fairness or reasonableness. The duty to act fairly and
      reasonably is a doctrine developed in administrative law field to ensure the
      rule of law and to prevent failure of justice when the action is
      administrative in nature.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">      "33. Just as the principles of natural justice ensure fair decision where
      function is quasi-judicial, the doctrine of fairness is evolved to ensure fair
      action when the function is administrative. But the said principle cannot
      be invoked to amend, alter or vary the expressed terms of the contract
      between the parties."</blockquote>


<p id="p_67">      The State refers to a judgment reported at (2007) 14 SCC 517 (<a href="/doc/899938/" id="a_39">Jagdish
Mandal v. State of Orissa</a>) for the proposition that in judicial review of
administrative action the court would only check whether the conduct is lawful
and not whether the decision is sound. Paragraph 22 of the report is placed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">      "22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended to prevent
      arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and mala fides. Its
      purpose is to check whether choice or decision is made "lawfully" and not
      to check whether choice or decision is "sound". When the power of judicial
      review is invoked in matters relating to tenders or award of contracts,
      certain special features should be borne in mind. A contract is a
      commercial transaction. Evaluating tenders and awarding contracts are
      essentially commercial functions. Principles of equity and natural justice
      stay at a distance. If the decision relating to award of contract is bona fide
      and is in public interest, courts will not, in exercise of power of judicial
      review, interfere even if a procedural aberration or error in assessment or
      prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial review will not
      be permitted to be invoked to protect private interest at the cost of public
      interest, or to decide contractual disputes. The tenderer or contractor with
      a grievance can always seek damages in a civil court. Attempts by
      unsuccessful tenderers with imaginary grievances, wounded pride and
      business rivalry, to make mountains out of molehills of some
      technical/procedural violation or some prejudice to self, and persuade
      courts to interfere by exercising power of judicial review, should be
      resisted. Such interferences, either interim or final, may hold up public
      works for years, or delay relief and succour to thousands and millions and
      may increase the project cost manifold. Therefore, a court before interfering
      in tender or contractual matters in exercise of power of judicial review,
      should pose to itself the following questions:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_58">             (i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is
      mala fide or intended to favour someone;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_59">            OR

             Whether the process adopted or decision made is so arbitrary and
      irrational that the court can say: "the decision is such that no responsible
      authority acting reasonably and in accordance with relevant law could
      have reached";
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_60">            (ii) Whether public interest is affected.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_61">      If the answers are in the negative, there should be no interference under
      <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">Article 226.</a> Cases involving blacklisting or imposition of penal
      consequences on a tenderer/contractor or distribution of State largesse
      (allotment of sites/shops, grant of licences, dealerships and franchises)
      stand on a different footing as they may require a higher degree of fairness
      in action."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_62">      The State has relied on a decision reported at (2008) 5 SCC 772 (S.S. &amp; Co.
</blockquote><p id="p_68">v. Orissa Mining Corpn. Ltd) for the proposition that a notice inviting tender
should not be viewed in a pedantic or legalistic manner. Another judgment
reported at (2007) 11 SCC 704 (<a href="/doc/958760/" id="a_41">State of Assam v. Abhinandan Trading (P) Ltd</a>) is
placed and the following sentence from paragraph 31 of the report is read out to
suggest that the exercise to be undertaken by court is only to see if a prudent
process had been adopted for fixing the rates:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">      "31. ... Unless it can be shown that the said procedure had been misused
      to favour any particular individual, which is not so in the instant case, it
      would not be proper for us to express any opinion as to the procedure the
      Government should adopt except to say that whatever procedure is
      adopted should be open, fair and transparent."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">      Finally, a judgment reported at (2005) 13 SCC 495 (State of Orissa v.
</blockquote><p id="p_69">Gopinath Dash) is cited in support the fundamental basis of the State's stand in
these proceedings that the court should not substitute its view for the State's in a
sphere which requires expertise.
</p><p id="p_70">       In the context of the weight of legal authority that the parties have brought,
the ground-rules should first to be set. Every judicial order needs to be moored to
a basic legal principle; an order made on impression would be erroneous in form
and substance. The scope of inquiry in judicial review is ordinarily confined to
the decision-making process and to the question whether the decision is contrary
to any statutory provision or in violation of the acknowledged rights or is opposed
to the tenets of the Constitution. Even if the decision may not appeal to the
court, it would scarcely barge in to the domain of the executive. The appropriate
measure of assessment has always to be as has been recognised in the third
Renusagar case (that of the lifting-of-corporate-veil fame) where the correctness
of the quantum of electricity duty fixed was called into question.

<blockquote id="blockquote_65">      "The exercise of power whether legislative or administrative will be set aside

      exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous. If a power

</p><p id="p_72">       The starting point of the present proceedings has undoubtedly to be the
previous order of September 23, 2008. It was held therein that the determination
of the rates for supply of cooked diet to Government hospitals was an
administrative decision and could be "the subject matter of scrutiny of a court so
far the decision making process is concerned." It was held that rates had to be
arrived at "keeping in mind the current price of the same." It was, however, the
decision-making process that culminated in the rates being fixed by the
memorandum of September 25, 2007 that was the subject matter of the previous
proceedings. The Court found that the "decision making process ... cannot be
sustained in law ... (as the) intending suppliers will be compelled to enter into an
unhealthy competition compromising with the quality and quantity of the diet to
be supplied ... at abnormally low rate." The order directed that the State should
determine the prices of different categories of cooked diet "keeping in mind the
quality and quantity of such diet in the greater interest of indoor patients as also
to avoid unhealthy competition among the intending suppliers." The State
accepted the order and it was submitted on its behalf in course of the hearing in
subsequent petitions that culminated in the order dated December 18, 2008 that
"the Government had decided not to prefer any intra court appeal against the
judgment and order dated 25.9.2008 and would require at least six months time
to revise the rates of diet in compliance with such order." (Emphasis supplied)

      If the entire exercise of the State which has now been called into question
were to be in compliance of the order dated September 25, 2008, the State ought
to have been conscious of the interest of the patients and the necessity to avoid
unhealthy competition among intending suppliers. The memorandum of June 12,
2009 announces that the committee had been appointed by the Government
"(f)ollowing the directions of the Hon'ble Court" contained in such order. The
decision-making process and the State's action have, per force, to be seen in the
context of such previous order which the State unreservedly professed to accept.
</p><p id="p_73">       Before the challenges on the two major aspects are taken up, it must be
said that there has been a qualitative change in the Government's approach to
the matter. The same would appear from the memorandum of June 12, 2009.
Disregarding the few anomalies and minor contradictions, there appears to have
been considerable thought which has gone in to the making of the document and
the arrangement and content of the appendices thereto. The State has come a
long way from the faltering steps in making the first memorandum of 2002 and
the unsure approach evident even in the memorandum of 2007. The Government
is much more organised and assertive in the terms and conditions now set.
</p>
<p id="p_74">      The petitioners' attack on the eligibility criteria can only be probed to a
limited extent since the State has to be left free to set its terms and choose the
players that it wishes to deal with. In the fifth clause of the eligibility criteria the
State has demanded that a bidder must have an office with a telephone "in the
sub-division of the hospitals for which the bid is being made." The clause may
have been inartistically drafted but it does not fail to convey the intended
meaning. It is not unreasonable for the State to ask for one centralised location
within the sub-division for the State to communicate with the contractor. It has
sufficient nexus with the work and can be seen to be inarguably for the ultimate
benefit of the patients.
</p>
<p id="p_75">      The memorandum of June 12, 2009 carries the model terms which have
been suggested for all Government hospitals in the State to make them the basis
for the tender terms individually set by them. The petitioners' apprehend that
clause 6 of the eligibility criteria, which requires various licences and registration
certificates to be produced by a bidder, would imply that irrespective of the
requisite licence or certificate being necessary in respect of a particular hospital,
the same would be required to be furnished. In view of the words "as may be
required" appearing in the clause and the State's express clarification in such
regard, the apprehension appears to be misplaced. The clause does not signify
that all the licences and registration certificates referred to therein would be
 necessary in every case. For smaller hospitals requiring less manpower from the
bidder, the various licences and registration certificates may be unnecessary.
However, it is possible that the individual tender documents released by
individual hospitals may incorporate such clause in its entirety without
considering the applicability thereof to the particular case. It would have been
more agreeable if the memorandum had clarified or even better if the
memorandum had required one nodal person or a body or committee to vet the
individual tender documents prepared by individual hospitals to ensure that the
individual tender terms were in sync with the one suggested by the
memorandum.
</p>
<p id="p_76">      The second limb of challenge to clause 6 is that the Government as
principal employer was seeking to pass off its liability in respect of the employees
to the immediate employers or the contractors, whether on account of provident
fund or employees' state insurance. The relevant statutes would not permit the
Government as principal employer to shirk its responsibility and, whether or not
the contractors as immediate employers meet the obligations, the State may still
be found to be primarily responsible if the employees are not included under any
scheme that takes care of their provident fund and their insurance. The clause
may have an impact on the cost component, but it is neither absurd nor mala
fide for the Government to require the immediate employer to be liable for
payment of the provident fund and insurance, wherever applicable, on account of
the employees engaged by the contractor. It may happen, as the petitioners have
suggested, that the employees remain the same at a number of the Government
hospitals despite contractors changing. Even then the clause would not be
unconscionable though it might fasten additional obligations on a contractor.
</p>
<p id="p_77">      What is, however, missing from the clause and the relevant term in the
proposed agreement is the payment on account of service tax. In view of the
State's stand in its affidavit and submission made at the hearing, the relevant
 agreement should now include a clause providing for reimbursement or payment
of service tax by the Government to the contractors.
</p>
<p id="p_78">      Clauses 10, 11, 12 and 13 relate to the experience and financial ability of
the bidders. If in its wisdom the State has set norms for the contractors to meet
on such counts, it is not open to the aspiring contractors to question the same;
far less for the Court to interfere in the matter of a pure contractual requirement.
None of the clauses is so absurd that it needs to be struck down. These criteria
would ensure a better lot of contractors with proven track record and sound
financial ability. The particular challenge to clause 13 that it should not be the
State's concern as to whether a bidder had garnered profits in the previous two
financial years, does not appeal. Again, if the State has reckoned it to be a
relevant factor to be taken into account, unless it is demonstrably capricious the
Court would hardly interfere with it in this jurisdiction. All the eligibility criteria
have a realistic nexus with the nature of work required to be discharged and can
be rationally perceived to be in the patients' interest.
</p>
<p id="p_79">      Though the general refrain of the petitioners in dealing with the eligibility
criteria has been a charge of mala fides, it is not shown as to who the State
wished to confer undue benefits on and who, in particular, the State desired to
exclude. The suppliers and intending suppliers are all individuals or small
organisations. The State has required such parties to show that they have the
staying power to run the distance. The thirteenth clause would insulate
Government      hospitals    against   pretenders     and    fly-by-night   operators
masquerading as suppliers with little stamina to sustain consistent performance.
</p>
<p id="p_80">      As much as the Government has put its best foot forward in laying down
the conditions for bidders and contractors in the several appendices to the
memorandum of June 12, 2009, commensurate effort does not appear to have
been expended in arriving at the rates fixed. The eligibility criteria for
participating bidders; the general terms and conditions set for bids; the
enunciation of the special terms and conditions for preparation of cooked food,
 employment of manpower, responsibilities of the contractor and enumeration of
other conditions; and, the specification of the standards of the food material -
leave little room for criticism. There is, indeed, a qualitative improvement in the
Government's approach. It appears to be more studied than the amateurish
endeavours of 2002 and 2007. Yet, the considerations that have gone into fixing
the rates for the different categories of diet leave room for considerable
improvement and betray a pronounced lack of industry, imagination and
foresight.
</p>
<p id="p_81">      For a start, it is inexplicable that the committee appointed to revise the
rates called for a further committee of dietitians to be formed to suggest the diet
and yet the suggestions of the dietitians' committee were not taken into account.
The records do not show that the rates committee considered the dietitians'
proposals and turned them down. There are no meaningful minutes of the rates
committee's three meetings held in January, March and May, 2009. The rates
committee received inputs from the Directorate of Agricultural Marketing on the
prices of vegetables and other ingredients that go into the patients' cooked diet
before it projected the contractors' cost therefor. It was unnecessary for the State
to labour over the rates committee's choice of median rates over mean rates. In
judicial review, the Court would hardly get into the nitty-gritty of a decision made
by an expert body if it found that relevant factors had been taken into account. It
is for such reason that the sundry challenges launched by the petitioners in
respect of the price of potato and other ingredients are found unworthy of any
anxious consideration. It is again for such reason that the petitioners' criticism of
the 2007 and 2008 rates being used as the benchmark for supply in 2009 is
found to be devoid of merit.
</p>
<p id="p_82">      There does not appear to be any apparent arbitrariness in the decision-
making process of the rates committee in respect of the matters that such
committee took into account. But there appears to be a gaping hole in the
decision-making process in that the rates committee failed to take into account
 divers germane matters. In the absence of there being anything in the records or
in the state's affidavit it cannot be presumed that it was the rates committee that
settled the eligibility criteria or stipulated the other special or general conditions
or drafted the terms of the model agreement. It also does not appear from the
records nor has it been asserted in the State's affidavit that all the material that
now appear in the appendices to the memorandum of June 12, 2009 were placed
before such committee or otherwise brought to its notice. It cannot be assessed,
in such circumstances, whether the cost implications that the terms and
conditions entail had been taken into account by the rates committee. Apart from
the preliminary discussion held by the rates committee early in January of this
year, it appears to have deliberated in silence as it spoke only in the
recommendations that it made in May, 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_83">      The State is free to set the bar high for worthy and classy contractors to
effect supply of cooked food to Government hospitals. But enhanced standard
would be directly proportional to the cost of supply. This fundamental principle
has been lost sight of in the decision-making process and it is not necessary to
speculate whether the rates committee was made aware of the qualitative
improvement in the standards now set by the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_84">      There are several terms in the appendices to the memorandum of June 12,
2009 which would have a material impact on the cost of cooked diet. If a
contractor has to meet the expenses on account of provident fund contribution
for its employees or for insurance premium, the relatable proportion thereof has
to be added to the cost of supply. The infrastructure expenses incurred by a
contractor have to also to be passed on to the user. The State is to be lauded for
the exacting demands made to ensure service of cooked food in a hygienic
manner; but covered trolleys, refrigerators, heating equipment, sparkling
utensils, cooking implements, unsoiled uniform for staff, dishwashers and other
overheads, including electricity and water charges, cost money. Even if some or
most of them are capital expenses that should be borne by the contractors, the
 cost of servicing such capital or the depreciation cost needed to be accounted for
in the determination of the rate. The myriad conditions included in annexure 'D'
to the memorandum of July 12, 2009 particularly in respect of preparation of
cooked food, employment of manpower, responsibilities of the contractor and
payment conditions warranted such that factors carry commensurate weight in
the assessment of the rate. Neither the records produced nor the State's affidavit
offers any glimpse into the decision-making process having embraced such
pertinent matters.
</p>
<p id="p_85">      The relevant memorandum sets down breakfast cost at Rs.12.98, lunch at
Rs.15.62 and dinner at Rs.14.46 for the general adult diet per day. The
recommendations of the rates committee indicate that the fuel cost for cooking
would be Rs.1.01 per meal. The daily general diet of Rs.43.06 comprises the cost
of the food ingredients, fuel cost and profit. There is a break-up running into four
sheets and entitled "Working Sheet for the Calculation of Patient Diet Rates" that
is appended to the State's affidavit. For every meal there are two columns:
quantity and amount. The total quantity of a commodity forming part of the daily
diet is multiplied by the median value to arrive at the daily cost on such head.
The working sheet takes into account the cost of spices and condiments. There is
absolute clarity in the determination of the cost of the food ingredients. On the
last page of the calculations, the total cost on account of the food component for
the general daily diet, inclusive of fuel charge, is shown to be Rs.39.15. The
median value of the contractor's profit is shown to be 0.10 (presumably,
translating to 10 per cent) for a daily figure of Rs.3.91. The last line of the
calculations records the total daily costs for the three meals and the grand total
of the daily cost for general diet to be Rs.43.06. Though the first page of the two-
page recommendation of the committee records at clause 6(d) that the "profit for
contractor is taken as 10% of costs which includes deployment of staff and other
incidental charges", the basis for including employees' cost and other incidentals
is not reflected in the calculation sheet.
</p><p id="p_86">       Profit, by its very nature, should not ordinarily include any cost element
though it may include the tax payable thereon. Neither the recommendations of
the committee nor any other document in the records produced reveal any
assessment having been made on account of employees' cost or for incidentals or
overheads. There is no opinion expressed that a 10 per cent top-up over the cost
of the food ingredients is a generally accepted norm in such cases. If an expert
body had opined as such, unless the same appeared to be demonstrably
erroneous and absurd, the Court in judicial review would not have been minded
to engage itself in the specifics. But there is nothing to show from the records
that the decision-making process was alive to the various expenses which a
contractor is likely to incur on account of the onerous but commendable terms
set by the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_87">      If the cost that a contractor has to sustain on account of the personnel
required to be engaged is looked into, by way of example, it would indict the
decision-making process involved in the impugned determination. A contractor is
required to pay the minimum wages to any employee. The minimum wages
payable daily to an unskilled worker is Rs.122/-. If a contractor is required to
engage the "adequate number of personnel with required skill", as the several
clauses under the heading "responsibilities of the contractor" necessitate, it
would have a material bearing on the cost of supply of cooked diet. The
conditions require employees to be engaged in shifts. In one of the petitions, an
existing contractor says he has engaged eight employees for supply of cooked diet
to a 135-bed hospital even under the present, less stringent regime. The State
does not say that under the new, stricter dispensation a contractor would require
fewer hands to service such a hospital. Even if it is assumed that all eight are
paid the minimum daily wages of Rs.122/- each, the cost of the employees per
day would amount to over Rs.5/- per bed. The cost of labour per patient may be
lower elsewhere, particularly in the bigger hospitals, but that is not the point.
The point is that labour comes at a cost more than fish or milk or rice or curd.
Yet the committee did not deem it necessary to factor in such major head of
 expense of the contractor in its detailed deliberations in the calculation sheet and
relegated it to a parenthesis in the footnote as part of the top-up of 10 per cent
euphemistically clubbed together as profit.
</p>
<p id="p_88">      It would not be in the interest of the patients that high standards are set in
the   conditions   and   an   enhanced   quality   of   diet   is   proposed   without
commensurate rates being offered. It would only imply that there would not be
any quality control at the post-award stage to ensure adherence to the exalted
specifications. If the high standards as set by the Government are to be met at
the rates offered, there would necessarily be a compromise on the quality. The
standards demanded cannot be effective till a quality control mechanism is put in
place to ensure that the norms are scrupulously followed. As honourable as the
State's motive appears to be, the mechanism adopted for determining the rate is
flawed to the point of arbitrariness and being insensitive to the patients'
wellbeing.
</p>
<p id="p_89">       If one were to go on impression alone, a 51 per cent increase offered by the
State over the rates fixed in the year 2002 or a 26 per cent increase over the
immediate previous prevailing rate would appear to be reasonable. But supply,
and particularly the cost thereof, depends as much on the quantity as on the
quality of demand. An impression formed on an unsophisticated overview of the
matter based only on the quantum leap reflected in the present prescribed rates,
would be - as impressionistic appraisals often are - distressingly blemished. The
qualitative improvement in the diet that the State insists it has introduced would
have a spiraling impact on the cost. The rules of the game have now been
changed. The simplistic suggestion that a substantial increase in the rate in
rupee terms should deter the Court from probing into the specifics that went into
the determination is unrealistic and utterly unacceptable.
</p>
<p id="p_90">      One need not look much beyond the State's candid confession that a
contractor intending to supply to one or a few of the hospitals within a sub-
division would not be able to break even. Nothing in the memorandum or the
 suggested or actual tender terms give so much as a hint that an aspiring
contractor intending to supply cooked diet to a sub-divisional hospital had to bid
to supply to all hospitals within the sub-division or to none at all. The question
that arises is as to what happens, then, to the stand-alone cases like the Mahesh
Bhattacharya Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital. There is no room
provided in the memorandum for increased rates for the stand-alone cases. More
importantly, if the tender terms do not call for a clubbed bid for all hospitals
within a sub-division, the State can hardly impose or imply it after bids have
been received.
</p>
<p id="p_91">      The singular failure to consider service tax would also demonstrate the
irrationality in the decision-making process that culminated in the rate being
fixed. If there were no petition challenging the process and if there were no
affidavit filed by the state thereto, no contractor could have demanded
reimbursement or payment of service tax from the government on the strength of
the terms of the agreement that the government proposed to enter into with the
contractors. The exercise undertaken by the rates committee may have been
confined to the actual ingredients that go into the meal and not extended to
matters beyond. But without any speculation, it can be said that all relevant
factors that ought to have been taken into consideration in the process of
determining the final rates were, in fact, not taken into consideration. Unlike the
eligibility criteria and other conditions set which would be matters of policy, there
is nothing in the manner in which the rates were assessed that would make the
fixation a matter of policy. The government may have said that as a matter of
policy it had decided to keep the rates at a particular level. It could then have
worked out as to what could be supplied to the patients, and in what manner, at
such fixed rate. The assessment in judicial review then may have been as to
whether the policy was in-keeping with the patients' wellbeing. But there is no
element of policy involved in the rates fixed here. A committee was set up to
assess the rate on the basis of the cost of ingredients; the committee made its
recommendations unmindful or unaware of the attendant conditions of supply;
 and,   the   government   regurgitated   the   recommendations     in   an   official
memorandum without the slightest consideration as to whether the quality of
service demanded could be maintained at such rates. The records do not reflect
kind of churning of the matter in the government corridors subsequent to the
committee's recommendations being received and prior to the memorandum
incorporating the recommendations being published.
</p>
<p id="p_92">       There is another aspect, though a matter of policy, which needs to be
noticed. Clause 20(f) of appendix 'C' to the memorandum of June 12, 2009
provides that the inter se assessment between technically responsive bids would
be on the basis of who offered the most food at the specified rate. The rationale
may be questioned both in the State's assumption therein that more is good (and,
the corollary thereto that the original diet may be deficient) and in the obvious
arbitrariness that is sown thereby in the final assessment of competing bids. The
form of the bid requires the additional quantity offered to be expressed in
percentage terms. Theoretically, the difference could be in decimal points. Since
the clause requires the best offer to be chosen, it may lead to an onerous
appraisal of the quantitative difference in the marginal figures and in the
mechanism to ensure that the exact percentage of increased supply is translated
in the extra food on the patients' plate. It is possible to envisage a credible
challenge on the possible ills in the implementation of the clause and the
promised additional supply. It would have been no better if instead of percentage
terms some other criterion had been stipulated which may have resulted in one
bidder offering an extra slice of toast and another offering a handful more of rice
</p><p id="p_93">- it would inevitably involve comparing the incomparables. A more imaginative
method may have been desirable not only to arrest unhealthy competition among
the bidders but also to preclude unsavoury allegations being levelled as to the
final assessment and the implementation of the promised supply.
</p>
<p id="p_94">       To return to the basis of the exercise undertaken in these proceedings, the
order dated September 23, 2008 must again be seen. Such order, which the State
 has accepted, called upon the State to take care of the patients' interests and to
eliminate unhealthy competition among bidders. Neither seems to have been
achieved in the process undertaken by the Government that culminated in the
issuance of the memorandum and its several appendices. The interest of the
patient is best served in the what and the how of the meal that arrives by his
bedside; not in the piety trapped in cold print of noble-intentioned white sheets
waiting to turn yellow in some stately cabinet. The proof of the pudding, as they
say, is in the eating. If clause 20(f) of the special conditions portends an
assessment of marginal percentage figures with no mechanism put in place to
ensure commensurate delivery, the unhealthy competition between the bidders
that the order of September 23, 2008 required to be eliminated, still looms large.
</p>
<p id="p_95">      And yet, for all the public interest involved in the welfare of the ordinary
and the less-privileged who flock to government hospitals this is not a public
interest litigation. As much as the patients' interests have to be borne in mind,
the motive and object of these petitioners cannot be missed. They come not to
speak for the patients, but in the ultimate hope of filling their coffers.
</p>
<p id="p_96">      The primacy of the executive in such matters of administration cannot be
questioned. The manner of administration may sometimes fall for consideration
in judicial review. Hospitals cannot be run from the coolth of court chambers or
the high horse of a rostrum. For an old order to be changed and a new to be
ushered in there would be inevitable teething problems and the Government
must also be allowed its share of experimentation. A regime put in place in 2002
has not been perfected or even refined seven years down the line. But the
Government did not have a fair run of trial to count its errors. Even with the
imperfect process now brought in by the memorandum of June 12, 2009, the
Government must be allowed a free run to assess and reappraise the process and
the working thereof. It is on such consideration that the Government is left free
to proceed with the memorandum of June 12, 2009 and the tender processes
commenced thereunder, with the rider that it would pay or reimburse service tax
 over and above the prescribed rates to the contractors selected in accordance
with the new criteria set. The obvious arbitrariness reflected in the determination
of the rates should be corrected by such appropriate measure, including the
setting up of a more broad-based committee within a period of six months from
date which should iron out all the creases before the next annual tender process
for the year 2010-11 is commenced. The arbitrariness apparent in the
determination of price can be ignored once to allow the Government the leverage
to experiment, particularly when the errors do not appear to be mala fide, it may
not be permitted to recur.
