Law Laid down:

The petitioner has locus to challenge the order
passed by the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal.

secure the mortgaged property even without
bringing a suit for redemption, subject to
payment of entire dues to the Bank.

That the decision by the Debt Recovery Tribunal
will not operate as a clog on the right of
respondent No.1 to secure the property on

</pre><p id="p_1">                     (10/08/2017)

Per Justice Sanjay Yadav:
</p>
<p id="p_2">      Present petition is directed against the
order dated 29.10.2013 passed by the Debts
Recovery Appellate Tribunal, Allahabad whereby
the appeal directed against the order dated
08.03.2013     passed      by    the    Debts     Recovery
Tribunal has been disposed of with certain
directions.
</p><p id="p_3">(2)   Relevant facts briefly are that respondent
No.1 sole proprietor of M/s Arpit Brothers
availed cash credit facility from respondent
No.2/Bank. As respondent No.1 defaulted in
repayment,      proceedings        were        brought    by
respondent No.2 for recovery of Rs.21,49,778.92
on    12.01.2005     before      the    Debts     Recovery
Tribunal along with pendente lite and future
interest @ 15.50% per annum with quarterly
rests.   Respondent       No.1    remained       ex    parte.
Consequently, ex parte judgment was passed on
08/11/2005      whereby        respondent       No.1     was
directed to pay to respondent No.2 sum of
Rs.21,49,778.92 along with interest @ 12%,
pendente      lite   and       future    interest,       from
12/01/2005 and costs. Failing which it was
ordered that the Bank shall have the right to
recover              by                 sale               of
charge/hypothecated/mortgaged                    properties.
Since respondent No.1 failed to honour the
judgment, respondent No.2 took recourse to
auction the property bearing land bearing Survey
No.1541 admeasuring 0.531 and 5681 Sq. Ft.
Built up area at ground floor with RCC and built
                                3              WP.8646.2013

up area at ground floor with GI sheet roof 1500
Sq. Ft situated at Ward No.13, opposite old ice
factory, Sironj Guna Road, District Vidisha on
14.12.2007 with an upset price Rs.25,00,000/-
(Rupees     Twenty      Five       Lacs).   The     petitioner
participated in the auction held on 21.01.2008,
as his price bid of Rs.25,12,000/- was highest, he
was   declared    the     highest        bidder.     Petitioner
deposited    earnest       money         Rs.2,50,000/-       on
18.1.2008. Further deposited Rs.3,78,000/- on
21.01.2008 i.e. the date of acceptance of bid and
remaining amount was deposited on 28.01.2008.
(3)   However,        before       the   issuance     of    sale
certificate respondent No.1 filed a Writ Petition
bearing     number        2868/2008           wherein        on
12.03.2008, taking note of the contentions that
the order has been passed ex parte and that
application for recalling is pending and the
respondent judgment Debtor has expressed the
willingness to retain the property by depositing
the entire amount received in the auction held
for the sale of property, further steps for
confirmation     of    sale        and   issuance     of    sale
certificate in pursuance to the auction was
stayed. Later on, in the same proceedings, i.e. in
W.P.No.2868/2008          learned           Single         Judge
recording the demeanor of the respondent No.1
borrower/judgment         Debtor,        directed     for    his
personal presence as to why he be not proceeded
in contempt. The order records:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "In the present case, petitioner has
      given a written undertaking before this
      Court that he shall deposit all the
      amounts due to be paid to the
      respondent-Bank. The amount has not
      yet been paid. This Court on 14.05.2008
                          4               WP.8646.2013

      recorded the statement of the petitioner
      that he is willing to deposit the entire
      amount due against him on or before the
      next date of hearing. The case was fixed
      for 28.7.2008. The matter was taken up
      on 30.07.2008. Again on behalf of the
      petitioner it was stated that petitioner
      went to deposit the amount with the
      Bank but the Bank has not accepted the
      same.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">            Today, the petitioner is present
      before this Court and as against the
      total dues of Rs.51,50,000/- he is not
      even willing to deposit a sum of Rs.40.00
      Lac. On basis of the same, it is apparent
      that petitioner is prima facie guilty of
      breach of the undertaking given by him
      in writing and a statement was also
      given before this Court that the entire
      amount shall be deposited by the next
      date of hearing i.e. 28.07.2008 as per
      order of this Court dated 14.05.2008
      and thus he has made himself liable for
      contempt of this Court in view of the
      breach of the undertaking given before
      the Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">            At this stage, the petitioner has
      handed over the two cheques of
      Rs.25.00 Lac and Rs.15.00 Lac dated
      19.08.2008 and 5.9.2008 respectively in
      the name of respondent No.1 Bank to
      the learned counsel appearing for
      respondent No.1."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_4">(4)   This order was assailed in Writ Appeal
No.939/2008      which     was     disposed   of    on
02.09.2008 in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "Though the matter was listed as
      regards the maintainability of the
      appeal without entering into the same
      we have thought it apt to hear the

      accordingly, we have heard Mr. R.K.

      appellant and Mr. Rajesh Maindiratta,
      learned counsel for the respondent

<pre id="pre_2">      Be    it    noted,         under    certain
                         5            WP.8646.2013

      circumstances      the   appellant   had
      handed      over    the   two    cheques

      dated 19.08.2008 and 05.09.2008
      respectively in the name of respondent
      No.1 Bank. Number of submission have
      been put forth by Mr. R.K. Verma but
      we do not enter into the same. We have
      been apprised by Mr. Maindiratta that
      the Cheque of Rs.25 lacs has been
      dishonored. However, Mr. Maindiratta
      submits that Bank will not take any
      action if the appellant deposits a sum of
      Rs.40 lacs by way of bank drafts.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">            Having heard learned counsel for
      the parties and without entering into
      any kind of debate with regard to the
      merits of the case and the contentions
      which have been raised before us, we
      direct that the appellant shall present a
      bank draft of Rs.25 lacs in the
      respondent No.1, Bank by 17.09.2008
      and further sum of Rs.7.5 lacs by
      13.10.2008 positively failing which it
      will open to the Bank to take
      appropriate      steps     against    the
      petitioner. If the aforesaid direction is
      complied with, we would request the
      learned Single judge to take up the writ
      petition and dispose of the same as
      expeditiously as possible. We repeat at
      the cost of repetition that we have
      made such a request regard being had
      to lis in question. It needs no special
      emphasis to state that the deposition of
      the amount in the bank is without
      prejudice to the contentions raised by
      either of the parties.

<p id="p_5">(5)   Respondent No.1 who was required to
deposit Rs.32,50,000/- (Rs.25 lacs by 17.09.2008
and Rs.7.5 lacs by 13.10.2008) in the account of
M/s Arpit Brothers, deposited Rs.15 Lacs in M/s
                         6               WP.8646.2013

Arpit Brothers' account and Rs.10 Lacs in M/s
Jain Brothers' account on 17.10.2008, as is
evident from the certificate issued by the Bank
on    17.09.2008     (Annexure    R/5).    That   on
13.10.2008      respondent       No.1      deposited
Rs.2,50,000/- in the account of M/s Jain Brothers
and Rs.5,00,000/- in the account of M/s Arpit
Brothers.    Thus,     instead     of     depositing
Rs.32,50,000/- in the account of M/s Arpit
Brothers, respondent No.1 deposited only Rs.20
lacs in the said account. It can be argued that
since the auction proceedings were in respect of
two properties respectively mortgaged in the
account of M/s Arpit Brothers and M/s Jain
Brothers and therefore respondent No.1 was
justified in depositing the amount in both the
accounts, though may sound well but does not
reason to logic as the auction was only in respect
of property which was mortgaged to secure the
cash credit limit in account of M/s Arpit Brothers.
The respondent No.1, thus prima facie, violated
the direction in Writ Appeal No.939/2008. Be that
as it may.
</p><p id="p_6">(6)   The Writ Petition No.2868/2008 was later
on disposed of on 09/12/2009 with the liberty to
respondent No.1 to avail the remedy before the
Debts Recovery Tribunal. It was ordered that in
case if the appeal is filed within 30 days, the
same was directed to be decided on merit.
(7)   Pertinent it is to note at this juncture that
the auction proceedings which were initiated to
recover the decreetal amount was as per second
schedule to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_1">Income Tax Act</a> 1961 and the
Income-Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules 1962,

made applicable by virtue of Section 29 of the
Recovery of Debtss. Due to Banks and Financial
Institutions Act 1993. That Rule 60, 61, 62 and
63 of said second schedule provides that:

</p>

<p id="p_14">(8)   Furthermore in case any order is passed by
the recovery officer on the objections raised in
respect of the auction proceedings, such order is
made appealable vide <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_2">Section 30</a> of the Act of
1993.
</p><p id="p_15">(9)   In the case at hand though the respondent
of his own wanting sought leave to avail the
remedy of appeal under <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_3">Section 30</a> of 1993 Act
but there was no cause because there was no
order by the Recovery Officer under Rule 61, 62
or 63 of Second Schedule since the petitioner
had not raised any objection before the Recovery
Officer. This aspect led the Debts Recovery
Tribunal record a finding in its order dated
08.03.2013 that the respondent No.1 has not
complied with Rule 61 of second schedule. Be it
noted that the Debts Recovery Tribunal was in
seisin with the appeal after its remand from the
Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal by its order
dated 06.07.2012 to decide the appeal on merit.
The Debt Recovery Tribunal observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">        "As seen rightly contended by the Bank
        the appellant had not deposited the
        amount of Rs.36,26,816/- along with
        interest at 12% w.e.f. 12.01.05 as
        required under Rule 61 proviso (b) of
        <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_4">Income Tax Act</a> and therefore, he is
        not entitled to challenge the auction
        proceedings in this claim specially
        when the 2nd respondent had deposited
        the purchase price in Jan.08 and no
        illegality is proved by the appellant. So
        also it is revealed that ground raised in
        this appeal and the amount raised in
        the W.P.2868/2008 are totally different
        which reveals an after though on the
                         10                WP.8646.2013

      part of the appellant for deliberately
      delaying the recovery proceedings
      seen conducted by the RO. The
      decision in S.A.No.71/09 of this
      Tribunal is not applicable to the case
      of the appellant because the facts is
      entirely different. In this case against
      the dues of Rs.36,26,816/- he is
      intending to settle for Rs.27.00 lacs
      since the property was sold for an
      lesser amount. He could have easily
      participated in the bid and purchased
      the property for Rs.27.00 lacs instead
      of doing so he is now attempting to set
      aside the sale illegally without
      complying Rule 61 of the Income Tax
      Rules which cannot be permitted. The
      collusion between the Bank, RO and
      Advocate Commissioner is not seen
      pleaded in the Writ Petition which was
      lodged against the very same auction.
      On 04.09.12 an IA was lodged for
      taking subsequent development on
      record and producing some more
      documents. These pleadings do not
      form part of the appeal as the same
      ought to have been incorporated in the
      appeal    by    way    of    amendment.
      Therefore, these documents are not
      taken on record for the purpose of this
      appeal. Moreover, the signature of the
      appellant on page 20, 40 &amp; 48 reveal
      that different signatures are being put
      by the appellant for his convenience as
      seen rightly submitted by Respondent
      no.2 in its reply to the IA. When it is
      revealed that no illegality as pleaded is
      seen proved against the recovery
      proceedings, there is no scope for
      allowing the prayer of the appellant in
      this appeal. Therefore, the appeal
      found to be devoid of merits is
      dismissed with costs of Rs.25,000/-
      each to the Respondents Bank.

<p id="p_22">       6. The Bank has filed its calculation
       sheet and on the basis of the same,
       the Bank has to recover the total
       amount of Rs.22.16 lacs from the
       borrower. The borrower is ready to
       pay the said amount. The amount
       which has been arrived at by the Bank
       is in accordance with the Recovery
       Certificate, wherein the DRT has
       directed to pay the simple rate of
       interest @ 12% per annum and
       against the same the Bank has not
       preferred any appeal to this Tribunal,
       therefore, the judgment passed by the
       DRT has attained the finality so far as
       not only the rate of interest but also
       wherein the amount is also quantified.
       The borrower is prepared to pay the
       full amount.
</p>
<p id="p_23">       7. On payment of full amount as
       aforesaid, the Bank shall release the
       title deed in favour of the appellant."

<p id="p_24">(11) Interestingly, there is no whisper in the
appellate order as to whether the order under
challenge is modified or set aside. Be that as it
may.
</p><p id="p_25">(12) There are a few more developments which
have taken place after passing of the order by
DRAT. Petitioner in compliance to said order
deposited   Rs.29,10,000/-     by     06/12/2013,   a
certificate to said effect was issued by the
Recovery Officer, Second, DRT. Though as per
the petitioner the respondent No.1 who was
required to deposit as per direction by the
Appellate Tribunal did not deposit the entire
amount. It is urged that the respondent was to
deposit Rs.22,16,000/- in favour of Bank and
Rs.17,32,660/-   in   favour     of    the   auction
purchasee: total amount of Rs.39,48,660/-. The
                              13              WP.8646.2013

amount of Rs.17,32,660/- is arrived at as per
paragraph 3 of the judgment by the DRAT. It is
urged that the respondent No.1 is still in default
of Rs.10,38,660/-. This aspect will be dwelt at
later stage.
</p><p id="p_26">(13) It is pertinent to note that in the earlier
round, this petition was dismissed on 26.04.2016
on the ground that appeal before Debt Recovery
Tribunal was belatedly filed on 08/02/2010,
instead of 08/01/2010 without an application for
condonation of delay. Consequently, the orders
passed by DRT and DRAT were quashed. The said
order        has   been    reversed    in   Civil   Appeal

</p><p id="p_27">(14) The parties were heard at length. Issues
which arise for consideration are:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">        1.     Whether the petitioner has any
        locus to challenge the order passed by
        the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">        2.     Whether it can be said that the
        petitioner had acquired any right to

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_17">        3.     Whether      the respondent      No.1
        had any right to question the auction
        sale proceedings?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_18">        4.     Whether the decision by the Debt

        entire amount due and recoverable at

      the stage of auction sale proceedings?
</blockquote><p id="p_28">Issue No.1 and 2: As these issues compliment
each other are taken up together.
(15) It is contended on behalf of respondent
No.1 that the auction having not culminated into
a sale, as no sale certificate has been issued
because of stay of entire proceedings by order
dated 12.03.2008 in Writ Petition No.2868/2008,
there is no accrual of right in favour of the
petitioner who is an alien to entire transaction
between respondent No.1 and respondent No.2,
Bank, has no locus standi to question the order
passed by the Appellate Tribunal which has
directed for restoration of mortgaged property in
favour of the respondent No.1, its owner. It is
urged that since the mortgage remains with non-
confirmation of sale, the petitioner has no legal
right to enforce the auction sale. The petitioner
on his turn has refuted the contentions. It is
urged that there being the order for recovery of
debt due with a further direction to recover the
same by auctioning the property mortgaged; and
the creditor Bank having exercised the option,
the petitioner being the highest bidder and the
bid   having   been   settled   in   his    favour,   in
furtherance whereof the petitioner has deposited
the entire sale amount within the stipulated
period which is being duly acknowledged the
Appellate Tribunal, the petitioner has the right to
protect the interest which has accrued in him. It
is urged that the petitioner is, thus, not an alien
to the cause, which is the sale of property. It is
also contended that the respondent No.1 at no
point of time during auction proceedings raised
                         15            WP.8646.2013

any objection when the bid was finalized in
favour of petitioner. On these contentions, it is
submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the
objection as to locus of the petitioner to question
the order by Appellate Tribunal is sans merit.
Petitioner has placed reliance on the decision in
"<a href="/doc/92195429/" id="a_5">Sadashiv Prasad Singh v. Harendar Singh

having close similarity to the question raised
herein as to accrual of interest of the auction
purchaser was under consideration. It was held:

     the law on this point, wherein a three
     Judge Bench held as follows: (IA p.16)
           "A great distinction has been
           made between the case of bona

           holders themselves. In Bacon's
           Abridgment, it is laid down,
           citing old authorities, that "If a
           man recovers damages, and
           hath execution by fieri facias,
           and upon the fieri facias the
           sheriff sells to a stranger a term
           for   years,     and    after   the
           judgment is reversed, the party
           shall be restored only to the
           money for which the term was
           sold, and not to the term itself,
           because the sheriff had sold it
           by the command of the writ of
           fieri facias.". So in this case,
           those bona fide purchasers who
           were no parties to the decree
           which was then valid and in
           force, had nothing to do further
           than to look to the decree and to
           the order of sale."</blockquote>

relying on the judgment rendered by

of a bona fide purchaser in an auction
sale in execution of a decree to which
he was not a party stood on a distinct
and different footing from that of a
person who was inducted as a tenant
by a decree-holder-landlord. It was
held as follows: (SCC p.370, para 3)
       "3.    ...A   stranger   auction
       purchaser does not derive his
       title from either the decree-

       not be granted against him but a
       tenant who obtains possession
       from the decree-holder landlord
       cannot avail of the same right as
       his possession as a tenant is
       derived from the landlord."

 K. Abdulla</a> (1996) 7 SCC 668, this
 court in para 11 observed as under:</p><pre id="pre_5">
 (SCC p.672)
             18             WP.8646.2013

</pre><p id="p_36">"11. In the present case, as the
ex parte decree was set aside,
the      judgment-debtor       was
entitled to seek restitution of the
property which had been sold in
court auction in execution of the
ex parte decree. There is no
doubt that when the decree-
</p><p id="p_37">holder himself is the auction-
purchaser in a court auction
sale held in execution of a
decree which is subsequently
set aside, restitution of the
property can be ordered in
favour of the judgment-debtor.
The      decree-holder     auction-
</p><p id="p_38">purchaser is bound to return the
property. It is equally well
settled that if at a court auction
sale in execution of a decree,
the properties are purchased by
a bona fide purchaser who is a
stranger        to     the   court
proceedings, the sale in his
favour is protected and he
cannot be asked to restitute the
property to the judgment-debtor
if the decree is set aside. The
ratio behind this distinction
between a sale to a decree-
</p><p id="p_39">holder and a sale to a stranger
is that the court, as a matter of
policy,    will    protect  honest
outsider purchasers at sales
held in the execution of its
decrees, although the sales may
be subsequently set aside, when
such purchasers are not parties
to the suit. But for such
protection, the properties which
are sold in court auctions would
not fetch a proper price and the
decree-holder himself would
suffer. The same consideration
does not apply when the decree-
holder is himself the purchaser
and the decree in his favour is
set aside. He is a party to the
litigation and is very much
aware of the vicissitudes of
                  19            WP.8646.2013

     litigation   and     needs     no
     protection."
</p>
<p id="p_40">In Para 16, the court further
elaborated the distinction between
the decree-holder auction purchaser
and a stranger who is a bona fide
purchaser in auction. Para 16 reads as
under: (P.K. Abdulla case, p.674)
     "16. The distinction between a
     stranger who purchases at an
     auction sale and an assignee
     from a decree-holder purchaser
     at an auction sale is quite clear.
     Persons who purchase at a court
     auction who are strangers to the
     decree are afforded protection
     by the court because they are
     not in any way connected with
     the decree. Unless they are
     assured of title; the court
     auction would not fetch a good
     price and would be detrimental
     to the decree- holder. The policy,
     therefore, is to protect such
     purchasers. This policy cannot
     extend to those outsiders who
     do not purchase at a court
     auction.      When      outsiders
     purchase from a decree-holder
     who is an auction-purchaser
     clearly their title is dependent
     upon the title of decree-holder
     auction- purchaser. It is a
     defeasible title liable to be
     defeated if the decree is set
     aside. A person who takes an
     assignment of the property from
     such a purchaser is expected to
     be aware of the defeasibility of
     the title of his assignor. He has
     not purchased the property
     through the court at all. There
     is, therefore, no question of the
     court extending any protection
     to him. The doctrine of a bona
     fide purchaser for value also
     cannot extend to such an
     outsider who derives his title
     through       a     decree-holder
     auction-purchaser. He is aware
                          20            WP.8646.2013

             or is expected to be aware of the
             nature of the title derived by his
             seller who is a decree-holder
             auction- purchaser."

      Custodian &amp; Others</a> (2006) 2 SCC
      385, this court whilst relying upon the
      aforementioned two judgments stated
      the principle in the following words:
      (SCC p.407, para 70)
             "70. ....In any event, ordinarily,
             a bona fide purchaser for value

             differently than a decree holder
             purchasing such properties. In
             the former event, even if such a
             decree is set aside, the interest
             of the bona fide purchaser in an
             auction sale is saved."
</p>
<p id="p_42">     20. Law makes a clear distinction
     between a stranger who is a bona fide
     purchaser of the property at an
     auction sale and a decree holder
     purchaser at a court auction. The
     strangers to the decree are afforded
     protection by the court because they
     are not connected with the decree.
     Unless the protection is extended to
     them the court sales would not fetch
     market value or fair price of the
     property."

<p id="p_44">(19) In    the   present         case,   evidently,   the
proceedings for auction of property in question is
as per Rule 60 of the Rules of 1962. Sub-Rule (1)
of Rule 63 of the Rules 1962 provides that where
no application is made for setting aside the sale
under the foregoing rules or where such an
application is made and disallowed by the Tax
Recovery Officer, the Tax Recovery Officer shall if
the full amount of the purchase money has been
paid    make an order confirming the sale, and,
therefore, the sale shall become absolute. That
no objection to set aside the sale is shown to
have been filed by the respondent No.1 and
except that there was an interim order passed on
12.03.2008 in W.P.2868/2008 which is much after
the entire deposit made by the petitioner on
28.01.2008, the petitioner, in our considered
opinion, has an interest accrued in his favour to
protect the right under the auction in his favour
to protect the right under the auction sale. The
first and second question is thus answered in
favour of the petitioner. The petition is, thus, held
maintainable     at   the        instance   of   auction-
purchaser. These issues are answered in favour
of the petitioner.

Evidently, respondent no.1 suffered an order of
recovery in an original application preferred by
the Bank respondent no.2 for recovery of dues in
cash credit limit. The Tribunal has passed an
order for recovery of Rs.21,49,778.92 and the
interest thereon @ 12% per annum pendente lite
and future w.e.f. 12.01.2005 and the cost with a
further direction that if the amount is not paid,
the Bank would be at liberty to recover the same
through    auction        of        mortgaged        property.
Admittedly,     the      respondent          No.1    did   not
challenge the order of recovery and has allowed
the same to attain finality. The question is
whether with the attainment of finality of the
recovery order, the respondent No.1 can be
deprived to secure the property without taking
recourse to redeem by bringing a suit for
redemption. The question is more pertinent in
the backdrop of the fact that the sale has not
been made absolute under Rule 63(1) of the
Rules of 1962.
</p><p id="p_48">(21) It is urged on behalf of the petitioner that
incumbent it was on the part of the respondent
No.1 to have raised objection against the auction
sale proceedings. Having not objected to the
proceedings, the respondent No.1 borrower had
waived    his    right     to       secure    the    property
mortgaged. Reliance is placed on the Rules viz.
Rule. 61, 62 and 63 of the Rules 1962 and
<a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_11">Section 29</a> of Act 1993 to substantiate the
contention that they being mandatory in nature
cannot be surpassed. These submissions, as
evident, are to meet the course resorted by the
respondent      No.1      by        filing    Writ    Petition
                                23                    WP.8646.2013

2868/2008 and depositing the dues as directed
therein.
</p><p id="p_49">(22) It must be remembered at this juncture that
the Act of 1993 aims at recovery of dues to the
Bank and the object of the Act of 1993 is not to
declare that the order passed by it would
tantamount       to      foreclose       the    right     of    the
borrower. Be it also noted that the petitioner had
not perfected his right over the suit property for
want of an order from the Recovery Officer that
the sale has become absolute under sub-rule (1)
of Rule 63 of the Rules of 1962. Though in earlier
part of this judgment we have opined that an
executable       right    accrues        in    favour     of    the
petitioner to protect the interest in property even
before sale has become absolute; however, since
the     sale   has       not   attained        the      stage    of
absoluteness, the borrower has the right to
protect its title over the mortgaged property,
subject to his paying of the entire dues adjudged
by the Tribunal. No such provisions under the
Act of 1993 have been commended at that, with
the order of recovery the borrower's right to

On the contrary the scheme of <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_12">Section 29</a> read
with the Rules of 1962, more particularly Rule
60, 61, 62 and 63 that the borrower has a right
to defend the title over the mortgaged property
even at the stage of its sale by auction. Thus even
if the adherence to the procedure prescribed in
these    Rules     are     held     to   be    mandatory        as
suggested on behalf of the petitioner, they do not
lead to conclusion as to exclusion of the right of

(23) The case of Mathew Varghese (supra)
was in regard to the interpretation of Section
13(8) of the SARFASI Act read with Rules 8
and 9 of the Security Interest (Enforcement)
Rules, 2002. Sub-section (8) of <a href="/doc/354318/" id="a_19">Section 13</a>
envisages that if the dues of the secured
creditor together with all costs, charges and
expenses incurred by him are tendered to the
secured creditor at any time before the date
fixed for sale or transfer, the secured asset
shall not be sold or transferred by the
secured creditor, and no further step shall be
                         25              WP.8646.2013

taken by him for transfer or sale of that
secured asset. Paragraph 49 whereon reliance
is placed envisages:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">      "49. Reference to the above principles
      laid down in the various decisions also
      supports our conclusion that the
      application of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_20">SARFAESI Act</a> will
      be in addition to, in the present case
      to Section 29 of the RDDB Act. Once
      we steer clear of the said position
      without any hesitation, it can be held
      that whatever stipulations contained
      in <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_21">Section 29</a> as regards the
      application of certain provisions of the
      <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_22">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 in particular
      Schedule II Part I Rule 15 of the
      <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_23">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 for effecting a
      sale   or    transfer    would    apply
      automatically.    We    have    already
      extracted Section 29 of the RDDB Act,
      as well as Schedule 2 Part I Rule 15 of
      the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_24">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961. Therefore,
      what is to be considered is as to what
      is the mode prescribed under the
      above provisions, namely, Rule 15
      prescribed under Schedule 2 Part I of
      the Income Tax Act, 1961.

<p id="p_50">However, in paragraph 50, it is held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">      "50. Section 29 of the RDDB Act is an
      enabling provision under which the
      Second and Third Schedules to the
      <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_25">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 (43 of 1961)
      and the Income Tax Rules, 1962 can
      be applied as far as possible with
      necessary modifications as if the
      provisions and the Rules are referable
      to the debt due, instead of the income
      tax due. Therefore, fictionally, by
      virtue of section 29 of the RDDB Act,
      the mode and method by which a
      recovery of income tax can be
      resorted to under the Second and
      Third Schedules to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_26">Income Tax
      Act</a> and the Income Tax Rules, 1962
      have to be followed. Therefore,
      reading <a href="/doc/116137496/" id="a_27">Section 37</a> of the SARFAESI
      Act and Section 29 of the RDDB Act,

        the only aspect which has to be taken
        care of is that while applying the
        procedure prescribed under Rule 15
        of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 (Ed.:
        The reference is to Rule 15 of
        Schedule II Part I of the Income Tax
        Act, 1961.), no conflict with reference
        to any of the provisions of the
        <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_28">SARFAESI Act</a>, takes place."</blockquote>

<p id="p_51">        Furthermore affirming the decision in <a href="/doc/1575288/" id="a_29">Ram
Kishun V. State of U.P</a>. [(2012) 11 SCC 511], it is
held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">         "43.The above principles laid down
         by this Court also make it clear that
         though the recovery of public dues
         should be made expeditiously, it
         should be in accordance with the
         procedure prescribed by law and that
         it    should     not    frustrate     a
         constitutional right, as well as the
         human right of a person to hold a
         property and that in the event of a
         fundamental       procedural      error
         occurred in a sale, the same can be
         set aside.

<p id="p_52">(24) Thus, unless the sale is confirmed as
absolute      the    borrower's      right   to    hold   the
property in question does not get extinguished.
The procedure laid down in <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_30">Section 29</a> of 1993
Act     is   held    to   be   an    enabling     provision.
Therefore, even if the borrower has, instead of
taking recourse to the stipulations contained
under Rules 61, 62 &amp; 63 of the Rules of 1962,
approaches the High Court where instead of non-
suiting      him    his   interest   in   the     mortgaged
property is protected subject to certain direction,
the right to retain the mortgaged property
cannot be said to have been waived by the
borrower.</p><pre id="pre_6">

     then prevailing market price, there
     was no justification whatsoever to set

     the vested right of the appellant in the

     subjected him to grave injustice by
     depriving him to property which he

     clear principles laid down by this

<blockquote id="blockquote_28">     23. At the time of hearing, we were
     thinking of remanding the matter to

     into the objection of Harender Singh

     to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_31">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961. But
     considering the delay such a remand
     may cause, we have ourselves
     examined the objections of Harender
     Singh and rejected the objections for a
     variety of reasons:</blockquote>

<p id="p_54">        23.1. Firstly, the contention raised
        at the hands of the respondents
        before the High Court, that the
        facts narrated by Harender Singh
                 28             WP.8646.2013

[the appellant in Special Leave
Petition (C) No. 26550 of 2010]
were a total sham, as he was
actually the brother of one of the
judgment-debtors,             namely,
Jagmohan        Singh.    And      that
Harender Singh had created an
unbelievable       story   with     the
connivance and help of his brother,
so as to save the property in
question. The claim of Harender
Singh in his objection petition was
based      on      an    unregistered
agreement to sell dated 10-1-1991.
Not only that such an agreement to
sell would not vest any legal right in
his favour, it is apparent that it may
not have been difficult for him to
have had the aforesaid agreement
to sell notarised in connivance with
his brother, for the purpose sought
to be achieved.
</p>
<p id="p_55">23.2. Secondly, it is apparent from
the factual position depicted in the
foregoing        paragraphs        that
Harender Singh, despite his having
filed objections before the Recovery
Officer, had abandoned the contest
raised by him by not appearing (and
by not being represented) before
the Recovery Officer after 26-10-
2005,     whereas,     the   Recovery
Officer had passed the order of sale
of the property by way of public
auction more than two years
thereafter, only on 5-5-2008. Having
abandoned his claim before the
Recovery Officer, it was not open to
him to have reagitated the same by
filing a writ petition before the High
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_56">23.3. Thirdly, a remedy of appeal
was available to Harender Singh in
respect of the order of the Recovery
Officer assailed by him before the
High Court under <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_32">Section 30</a>, which
is being extracted herein to assail
the order dated 5-5-2008:
</p><p id="p_57">    "30. Appeal against the order
                29             WP.8646.2013

   of    Recovery        Officer.--(1)
   Notwithstanding           anything
   contained in <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_33">Section 29</a>, any
   person aggrieved by an order of
   the Recovery Officer made
   under this Act may, within thirty
   days from the date on which a
   copy of the order is issued to
   him, prefer an appeal to the
   Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_58">   (2) On receipt of an appeal
   under sub-section (1), the
   Tribunal may, after giving an
   opportunity to the appellant to
   be heard, and after making such
   inquiry as it deems fit, confirm,
   modify or set aside the order
   made by the Recovery Officer in
   exercise of his powers under
   <a href="/doc/1226169/" id="a_34">Sections     25</a>   to    <a href="/doc/555776/" id="a_35">28</a>   (both
   inclusive)."
</p><p id="p_59">   The High Court ought not to
   have interfered with in the
   matter agitated by Harender
   Singh in exercise of its writ
   jurisdiction. In fact, the learned
   Single       Judge       rightfully
   dismissed the writ petition filed
   by Harender Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_60">23.4. Fourthly, Harender Singh
could not be allowed to raise a
challenge to the public auction held
on 28-8-2008 because he had not
raised   any    objection   to   the
attachment of the property in
question or the proclamations and
notices issued in newspapers in
connection with the auction thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_61">23.5. All these facts cumulatively
lead to the conclusion that after 26-
10-2005, Harender Singh had lost
all interest in the property in
question    and    had    therefore,
remained a silent spectator to
various orders which came to be
passed from time to time. He had,
therefore, no equitable right in his
favour to assail the auction-
purchase made by Sadashiv Prasad
                           30                WP.8646.2013

        Sinha on 28-8-2008.
</p>
<p id="p_62">        23.6. Finally, the public auction
        under reference was held on 28-8-
        2008. Thereafter the same was
        confirmed on 22-9-2008. Possession
        of the property was handed over to
        the    auction-purchaser   Sadashiv
        Prasad Sinha on 11-3-2009. The
        auction-purchaser           initiated
        mutation proceedings in respect of
        the property in question. Harender
        Singh did not raise any objections
        in the said mutation proceedings.
        The said mutation proceedings
        were also finalised in favour of
        Sadashiv Prasad Sinha. Harender
        Singh approached the High Court
        through CWJC No. 16485 of 2009
        only on 27-11-2009. We are of the
        view that the challenged raised by
        Harender Singh ought to have been
        rejected on the grounds of delay
        and laches, especially because
        third-party rights had emerged in
        the meantime. More so, because
        the auction-purchaser was a bona
        fide purchaser for consideration,
        having purchased the property in
        furtherance of a duly publicised
        public auction, interference by the
        High Court even on the ground of
        equity was clearly uncalled for."
</p>
<p id="p_63">(26) The factual scenario of the case at hand is,
however,   totally    different.    The    title   in    the
property is not transferred in favour of the
petitioner because of the stay order as such no
absolute right accrued in favour of the petitioner.
Since there is no vested right in favour of the
petitioner there was no merger of mortgaged
debt in the decreetal debt, as would create
further right in the petitioner to impede the
borrower   from      retaining     the   property       after
paying the entire amount due. Thus, the decision
                          31               WP.8646.2013

in Sadashiv Prasad Singh (supra) is also of no
assistance to the petitioner.
(27) In Annapurna (supra), the issue was
whether the High Court could have ignored the
settled   law   that   under    <a href="/doc/1688766/" id="a_36">Article   127</a>   of   the
<a href="/doc/1317393/" id="a_37">Limitation Act</a>, 1963 and application to set aside
a sale under Order XXI Rule 89 CPS has to be
filed within 60 days from the date of sale and the
same is the period for making the required
deposit, is also of not much help to the petitioner
in present fact situation.
</p><p id="p_64">(28) Reliance is also placed on the decision in
<a href="/doc/1511187/" id="a_38">Transcore v. Union of India</a> (supra), wherein
it is held:
</p><p id="p_65">      "18.     On    analysing    the   above
      provisions of the <a href="/doc/1683455/" id="a_39">DRT Act</a>, we find that
      the said Act is a complete code by
      itself as far as recovery of debt is
      concerned. It provides for various
      modes of recovery. It incorporates
      even the provisions of the Second and
      Third Schedules to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_40">Income Tax
      Act</a>, 1961. Therefore, the debt due
      under the recovery certificate can be
      recovered in various ways. The
      remedies mentioned therein are
      complementary to each other. <a href="/doc/1683455/" id="a_41">The
      DRT Act</a> provides for adjudication. It
      provides for adjudication of disputes
      as far as the debt due is concerned. It
      covers secured as well as unsecured
      debts. However, it does not rule out
      applicability of the provisions of the
      <a href="/doc/515323/" id="a_42">TP Act</a>, in particular <a href="/doc/70101/" id="a_43">Sections 69</a> and
      <a href="/doc/1389379/" id="a_44">69-A</a> of that Act. Further, in cases
      where the debt is secured by pledge of
      shares or immovable properties, with
      the passage of time and delay in the
      DRT proceedings, the value of the
      pledged      assets    or     mortgaged
      properties invariably falls. On account
      of inflation, value of the assets in the
      hands of the bank/FI invariably
      depletes which, in turn, leads to asset-

<p id="p_67">     22. <a href="/doc/354318/" id="a_47">Section 13</a> falls in Chapter III
     which deals with enforcement of

     court's intervention, by such creditor
     in accordance with the provisions of
     this Act. When we refer to the word
     "court", it includes DRT. We quote
     hereinbelow sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_50">Section

<p id="p_71">(31) In "Embassy Hotels (P) Ltd. v. Gajaraj &amp;

     by providing that the mortgagor can
     exercise such a right by paying the
     mortgaged money at any time after
     the principal money has become
     due. But the proviso clarifies that
     the right conferred by that section is
     available only if it has not been
     extinguished by act of the parties or
     by decree of the court. The act of the
     parties would cover act of the
     mortgagor and the mortgagee, if
     they are unable to settle the dispute
     arising out of money claim covered
     by the mortgage and by their action,
                            36             WP.8646.2013

        allow the mortgaged property to be
        sold through auction in favour of a
        third party. Hence, it is not possible
        to accept the case of the plaintiff-
        respondent that in spite of sale of
        the suit property becoming final
        through court auction, for the
        purpose of grant of specific relief to
        the plaintiff in the present suit, the
        first defendant would be deemed to
        still retain the right to redeem the

        property to the plaintiff regardless of
        the right, title and possession
        already legally vested in the auction-
        purchaser the appellant."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_72">(32) First of all it is to be seen as to whether
<a href="/doc/530033/" id="a_65">Section 60</a> is attracted in the case at hand
wherein the order of recovery precedes the sale
of property to recover the money due. In this
context reference can be had of the decision in
"Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. v. Hong
Kong       and    Shanghai       Banking       Corpn.,
Reported in [(2009) 8 SCC 646]" wherein it is
held:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">        "85. If the Tribunal was to be
        treated to be a civil court, the debtor
        or even a third party must have an

        or financial institution to approach it
        first.   The    continuance     of    its
        counterclaim is entirely dependent
        on     the    continuance      of    the
        applications filed by the bank. Before
        it no declaratory relief can be sought
        for by the debtor. It is true that claim
        for damages would be maintainable
        but the same have been provided by
        way of extending the right of
