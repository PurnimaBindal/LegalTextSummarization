1.         By this order, I shall  dispose off  the contentions, raised on 

           behalf of the parties, on the point of sentence.



2.         In the  present case,  convicts,  namely,  Smt.  P.  M.  Singh 

           (A­1),  Navinder   Kumar   Sharma  (A­3)   and  Subhash 

           Chandra   Aggarwal(A­4)  have   been  convicted  for   the 

           offence   punishable   under  section   120­B   <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_1">IPC</a>  read   with

           of Corruption  Act</a>,  1988  and,  in addition,  under  <a href="/doc/1359568/" id="a_5">section

           convicts, namely, Smt. P. M. Singh (A­1), Navinder Kumar 

           Sharma (A­3) and Subhash Chandra Aggarwal (A­4)  have 

           also   been  convicted  for   the   offence   punishable   under

 CBI vs. Smt. PM Singh &amp; Ors.                                                       2 of 223 pages

                                                                                  CBI case . No.27/11 




3.         It has been strongly contended   on behalf of the State by 

           the Ld.   PP for the CBI that this is a  corruption case,  in 

           which,   the   convicts   have   been   convicted,   as   they   were 

           involved  in the conspiracy and that in pursuance to the 

           well   organized,   systematic   and   well­knit   criminal 

           conspiracy,   they   flouted   all   the   rules   and   regulations, 

           provisions   of  NDMC   Act,  Master  Plan   of  Delhi   to  attain 

           illegal   object   i.e.   to   regularize   the   unauthorized 

           construction  in  the   garb   of  residential  property   whereas 

           the same was actually being used as a hotel by accused K. 

           L. Bhatia (since deceased), illegally.

               

4.         The   State   has   further   contended   that   the   maximum 

           prescribed   substantive   punishment   with   fine   be   handed 

           over to all the convicts, so that enough and clear  message 

           goes   to   one   and   all   and   especially   to   the   potential 

           offenders,   who   are   in   the   waiting   to   commit   such   like 

           crimes so that the punishment act as a deterrence and the 

           intent  of the legislature is fulfilled. 



5.         Convict, P. M. Singh (A­1), has prayed that a lenient view 


 CBI vs. Smt. PM Singh &amp; Ors.                                                       3 of 223 pages
                                                             4
                                                                                  CBI case . No.27/11 

           be  taken  on  the   ground  that  she  is  a  senior   citizen and 

           retired   from   the   service.     That   she   was   the   Financial 

           Commissioner of Delhi State.   That she has unblemished 

           record.   That   her both children are living abroad.       That 

           she   has   an   old   mother   of   88   years   of   age   residing   in 

           Chandigarh and nobody is in the family  to look after her. 

           That the convict  is afflicted with hypertension.   That her 

           husband is also of old age, who retired from army and is 

           residing   with   her   in   Delhi.         That   she   remained   co­

           operative during   the  long  trial of the  case.    She further 

           submitted  that there  is no  case  of illegal  gratification  of 

           money.   That she  is not the beneficiary of any gain.  That 

           she   is   not   a   previous   convict.       She   has   prayed   that   a 

           lenient view may be taken. 



6.         Convict,  Navinder   Kumar   Sharma  (A­3)   has   submitted 

           that   he   is   under   dialysis     and   is   required   to   undergo 

           dialysis thrice a week.   That he is seriously afflicted with 

           various diseases like  diabetes and kidney failure with high 

           susceptibility to infections  and is at terminal stage.   That 

           he has faced long trial.     That he is  not  a convict in any 

           other case.   He has prayed for leniency.

                                                             5
                                                                                  CBI case . No.27/11 

7.         Convict,  Subhash   Chandra   Aggarwal  (A­4),  has   also 

           prayed for  a lenient view.  He submitted that he is junior 

           most officer in the present case.     That he has two sons, 

           who   are   of   marriageable   age   and   used   to   stay   out   of 

           station. That he is alone in the family and is the sole bread 

           earner  for his family.   That  there  is  no  male  member   in 

           his family to support his wife.       That he is a patient of 

           hypertension.  He prayed for minimum sentence.  



8.         The  above  said  convicts  have, thus, prayed for taking a 

           lenient view.     



9.         The contentions, raised by the convicts, have met stiff and 

           very strong opposition on behalf of the State.  It has been 

           urged that convict, P. M. Singh, who has been convicted in 

           this case, was the then Chairperson, NDMC and was duty 

           bound to protect the interest of the   Central Government 

           and   NDMC.       She   has   mischievously   cheated   both   the 

           Central Government and NDMC by dishonestly  allowing 

           issuance of health  licence    fraudulently  to accused K. L. 

           Bhatia   (since   deceased)   on   15.1.2003   and   then 

           fraudulently   approved   compounding   of   unauthorized 

           construction subsequently  on 13.2.2003, knowing  it fully 


 CBI vs. Smt. PM Singh &amp; Ors.                                                       5 of 223 pages
                                                             6
                                                                                  CBI case . No.27/11 

           well   that   the   residential   premises   earmarked   for   group 

           housing was being illegally used as a full fledged hotel by 

           accused   K.   L.   Bhatia   (since   deceased)   contrary   to   the 

           interest  of the leassor i.e. Govt. of India (the property had 

           been re­entered and vested  in the President  of India) and 

           against  the   public   interest.   It  has,   therefore,  been  urged 

           that   this   convict   deserves   maximum   and   exemplary 

           punishment. 



10.        Regarding the convicts, Navinder Kumar Sharma (A­3) &amp; 

           Subhash   Chandra   Aggarwal  (A­4),  it   is   stated   that   they 

           criminally   misconducted   and   abused     their   power   and 

           position.   That under criminal conspiracy, they joined the 

           convict   P.   M.   Singh   in   attaining   the   illegal   object   i.e. 

           compounding   of   unauthorized   construction   in   the 

           premises contrary to the terms of lease deed Master Plan 

           of Delhi, Building Bye Laws, etc., and as a result thereof, 

           they caused substantial undue  pecuniary gains to accused 

           K.   L.   Bhatia   (since   deceased)     against   public   interest. 

           That they are not entitled to any mercy or compassion. 



11.        It is further urged on behalf of the State that most of the 

           pleas taken by the convicts   are routine and stock pleas 


 CBI vs. Smt. PM Singh &amp; Ors.                                                       6 of 223 pages
                                                             7
                                                                                  CBI case . No.27/11 

           and   in   any   case,   in   the   case   under   the   <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_11">Prevention   of 

           Corruption Act</a>,   these pleas taken   are not considered as 

           mitigating circumstances.   It has, therefore,   been prayed 

           that appropriate punishment   be awarded to the convicts 

           herein.  



12.        The   defence     has   contended   that   despite   the   alleged 

           fraudulent   approval accorded by convict P. M. Singh on 

           13.2.2003,   the   compounding   and   regularization     of   the 

           unauthorized construction did not take place  as convict P. 

           M. Singh was transferred  from NDMC  on 31.3.2003.  That 

           it has not been regularized till date, admittedly, which is 

           not disputed by the State.     It has, therefore,   been urged 

           that this may be taken  as mitigating  circumstance among 

           others while awarding sentence to the convicts.

14.        On behalf  of the  convicts,  following  case law have been 

           cited:

           (i)   Ram Lal Dogra Vs. State (CBI), 2001 (2)  JCC (Delhi) 239
           (ii)  C. B. Rai  Vs. CBI, 2013 (2) JCC 1241  



15.        At the very outset, it is observed that there is no quarrel 

           over   the   settled   propositions   of   law   discussed   in   the 

           aforesaid case law,  cited by the parties. 



16.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case law, reported as  Dr. 
           Subramanyam Swami    Vs. Dr. Manmohan Singh,  2012, 
           AIR(SC) page 1185, has observed that ­:
                      "The magnitude of corruption in our public 
                      life   is   incompatible   with   the   concept   of

                      socialistic   secular  democratic  public.     The 
                      duty   of   the   Court   is   that   any   anti  
                      corruption   law   has   to   be   interpreted   and 
                      worked   out   in   such   a   fashion   as   to 
                      strengthen to fight against corruption."


17.         It has further been observed in the same case that  "In a 

           situation   where   two   constructions   are   eminently  

           reasonable,  the Court  has to accept  the one  that  seeks  to  

           eredicate  corruption  to the one which seeks to perpetuate 

           it."



18.        It has been held in case reported as  Narendra  Champak 

           Lal Trivedi Vs. State of Gujrat, 2012 (7) SCC page 80 that­: 

                      "Corruption  at  any level  does  not  deserve  

                      either  sympathy or leniency."  



19.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case law, reported as State 
           of Madhya Pradesh   V Sheikh Shahid,  AIR 2009 SC 2951, 
           has observed that ­:
                      "Justice   demands   that   Courts   should  
                      impose punishment befitting  the crime so 
                      that  the Courts  reflect  public    abhorrence 
                      of the crime.   The Court must not only keep 
                      in view  the rights of the criminal  but also  
                      the rights  of the victim of the crime and the 
                      society   at   large   while   considering     the

20.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan 

           Vs. Vinod  Kumar,  decided  on,  18th  May,  2012 (Criminal  

           Appeal No. 1887) reiterated   the law laid down in State of 

           J&amp;K   Vs.   Vinay Nanda,  AIR 2001 SC P 611,  and observed 

           that  superannuation of the convict   and the pendency   of  

           criminal  trial  for over a period of time cannot  be treated  a  

           special reason to reduce  the sentence.   



21.        It was observed  by   the Hon'ble  High Court in the  cases 

           reported as   Jai Bhagwan  Vs. State (NCT of Delhi),  2008 

           150  DLT  46 (Delhi) and  Ravinder  Kumar  Arora Vs.  CBI 

           Manu/DE/8816/2007 (Delhi) ,  that ­:                                            

                      "It   is   a   normal   thing   that   'trial'   of   the  
                      person   is   considered     a   period   of   'agony'  
                      undergone by him.   But   we tend to forget  
                      the   agony   of   the   society   and   the  
                      complainant   who   dared     lodge   the  
                      complaint.   The   entire   purpose   of   the 
                      legislature   of   sentencing   the   offenders  
                      stands defeated  and that is the one reason  
                      that   wages   of   corruption   are   considered  
                      more   attractive     in   this   country.     The 
                      person caught is not always   a first­timer

                      corrupt   activities   /   practices   for   a   long  
                      number   of years.     It is to his advantage  
                      that  the trial  is  prolonged.      He spends  a 
                      fraction   of   amount,   earned   by   corrupt  
                      practices on litigation and professionals  to 
                      see   that   ultimately     he   makes     Criminal  
                      Justice System   a laughing stock.     In this  
                      process,   the   entire     legislative   purpose   of  
                      punishing a corrupt stands defeated. 


22.        It   was   further   observed   by   the   Hon'ble   Court   in   the 

           aforesaid case  that ­:

                      "Accused   facing   trial   since   long;   amount

                      "Corruption by public servant has become  
                      gigantic   problem.   It   has   spread

                      been   left   unaffected   by   the   stink   of

24.        In   the   same   appeal   quoting   'M   B   Joshi   Vs.   State     of 

           Maharashtra, AIR 2001 SC 147' the Hon'ble   Apex   Court 

           observed that­:

                      "It is the defect  of the system that longevity  
                      of the cases tried   under the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_14">Prevention of 
                      Corruption   Act</a>   is   too   lengthy.     If   that   is  
                      regarded     as   sufficient     for   reducing     the 
                      sentence     mandated   by   the   Parliament  
                      legislative exercise  would stand defeated." 



25.        It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case 

           reported as  State of J &amp; K  Vs. Vinay Nanda, AIR 2001 SC  P 

           611,  that ­:

                      "Corruption  at any level, by any person, of 
                      any   magnitude,   is   condemnable,   which

26.        It   was   observed   by   the   Hon'ble   High   Court   in   the   case 

           reported as AIR 1961, Mysore P 49, that­:                    

                       "Infliction of a lenient sentence will defeat  
                       the purpose  of the P. C. Act."


27.        It   was   observed   by   the   Hon'ble   Apex   Court   in   the   case 
           reported as State of T. N Vs. Kaliaperumal, (2005) 12 SCC 
           473   and State Vs. Ratan Lal Arora, (2004) 4 SCC 590 that

28.        The convicts, therefore, cannot be enlarged on probation 
           in this case relating  to serious  offences. 


29.        It was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case 
           reported as  State   of   M. P. Vs. Ram Singh,  AIR 2000 SC 
           870,  that­:                    
                       "Corruption   in   a   civilised     society     is   a 
                       disease like cancer, which   if not detected

                      weight.     Corruption   is   opposed   to 
                      democracy     and   social   order,   being     not  
                      only anti people,  but  aimed  and targeted  
                      against them.   It affects the economy and 
                      destroys  the cultural heritage."


30.         Further, it was observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 

           the case law reported as Ankush Maruti Shinde Vs State of 

           Maharashtra,  AIR 2009 SC 2609  that­:

                     lost sight of  and per se require  exemplary  
                     treatment.     Undue   sympathy     to   impose  
                     inadequate sentence would do more harm 
                     to   the   justice   system   to   undermine   the 
                     public  confidence in the efficacy of law and

                      "If   a   given   transaction   constitutes   two 
                      offences under two enactments generally, it 
                      is   wrong     to   have   consecutive     sentences.  
                      But   this   rule     has   no   application     if   the  
                      transaction   relating to offences is not   the  
                      same     or   the   facts   constituting   the   two 
                      offences   are   quite     different.       Sentencing  
                      judge  should try to ensure  that the totality 
                      of the sentences is correct  in the light of all 
                      the circumstances of the case."    
                      "In arriving   at an appropriate   sentence,  
                      the court  must consider, and some  times 
                      reject,   many   factors.       The   court   must

                      to  corruption  and  coerce    the public  into 
                      paying them illegal gratification, the whole

35.        It was held in the case reported as <a href="/doc/922592/" id="a_20">Madhukar Bhaskarrao 

           Joshi vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, 2001 Cr. LJ 175(SC):  that­:

                       "When   corruption   was   sought   to   be  
                       eliminated   from   the   polity   all   possible  
                       stringent   measures   are   to   be   adopted 
                       within   the   bounds   of   law.   One   such  
                       measure   is   to   provide   condign 
                       punishment.   Parliament   measured   the 
                       parameters  for such condign punishment  
                       and   in   that   process   wanted   to   fix   a  
                       minimum   sentence   of   imprisonment   for 
                       giving   deterrent   impact   on   other   public 
                       servants who are prone   to corrupt deals. 
                       That   was   precisely   the   reason   why   the  
                       sentence     was   fixed   as   seven   years   and  
                       directed     that   even   if   the   said   period   of  
                       imprisonment   need   not   be   given,   the

                       sentence   shall   not   be   less   than   the 
                       imprisonment   for   one   year.   Such   a 
                       legislative   insistence     is   reflection   of 
                       Parliament's   resolve     to   meet   corruption  
                       cases with very strong hand to give signals  
                       of deterrence as the most pivotal feature of  
                       sentencing  of  corrupt  public  servants. All 
                       public servants   have to face very serious  
                       consequences.     If   on   the   other   hand   any  
                       public servant  is given the impression that  
                       if   he   succeeds   in   protracting   the 
                       proceedings that would help him to have  
                       the   advantage   of   getting   a   very   light 
                       sentence   even   if   the   case   ends   in 
                       conviction,   its   fallout   would   afford  
                       incentive   to   public   servants   who   were  
                       susceptible   to   corruption   to   indulge   in  
                       such   nefarious   practices   with   immunity. 
                       Increasing   the   fine   after   reducing   the 
                       imprisonment   to   a   nominal   period   can 
                       also   defeat   the   purpose   as   the   corrupt  
                       public servants could   easily raise the fine 
                       amount through the same means."

           contentions.   I have also examined the asserted mitigating 

           and   aggravating   circumstances,   pointed   out     by   the

           fully   aware   that   the   premises   in   question   were   illegally 

           used as a Centre Point Hotel by accused K. L. Bhatia (since

           and 62 beds (which, in fact, was a hotel).   She, therefore,

           private   person,   to   make   commercial   /   pecuniary   gains.

           and   it   kept   on   rotating   amongst   higher   officers. 

           Surprisingly,  he did  not  know who was  the Chairperson,  

           NDMC, at the relevant time. He has admitted that at serial 

           no. 752 and 753, there is no mention of details of the file 

           and date of receiving and sending of the file. His testimony 

           is not reliable and helps in no manner the defence.

           cancelled health license in the year 2000), which had put up the said 

           fraudulent note dated 10.01.03 and processed the matter. When CBI

           to be 16.45 meters against the 14.94 meters recorded in the said note 

           dated 10.01.03. Even in the proposal of the party, after the addition 

           alteration was over, in October/November 1985, the achieved height 

           given was 51' (i.e. more than 15 meters). Thus on the showing of the

           for  regularization of unauthorized  construction,  illegally. 

           The  remand  was only  to the  extent that opportunity    of 

           being   heard   should   be   given   to   the   party,   before   taking 

           demolition action. In order to achieve goal and objective 

           of accused K.L. Bhatia (since deceased), accused PM Singh 

           engineered   along   with   accused   (A­5)   and   (A­3)   &amp;   (A­4) 

           conspiracy. She first got issued health license illegally  to 

           (A­5)   and   then   approved   the   regularization   of 

           unauthorized   construction,   knowing     fully   well   that   the 

           premises in fact were being used as a hotel.



</p><p id="p_774">396.       It is contended on behalf of accused Smt. PM Singh that 

           she   joined   as   Chairperson,   NDMC,   on   01.11.2002   and 

           remained   there   till   31.03.2003.   That   section   241(g)   of 

           NDMC Act is not applicable, as the power is discretionary. 

           This   contention   has   no   merit   as   while   approving 

           regularization   of   unauthorized   construction,   discretion 

           was not exercised as there is no such noting by her in the

           and not to enrich a private person illegally as against the 

           public   policy   or   the   concern   of   the   Government.

           Section 2(21) of NDMC ACT defines 'land' as  inclusive of 

           anything permanently attached to land and thus includes 

           building.   The   same   import   has   to   be   taken   in   section

           PM Singh was inconceivable as she was a senior IAS officer 

           and was required to cross check as to since when and why 

           the proposal for regularization was pending and when the 

           license    expired  last.  It appears that with  evil  intentions 

           accused   PM   Singh   did   not   raise   such   common   sense 

           questions, as that would have compelled the staff to place 

           on   record   history   of   the   case   and   complete   true   facts 

           which   would   have   made   impossible   for   her   to   favour 

           accused K.L. Bhatia (A­5)(since deceased).

           'please discuss' and after discussion, and note given by the 

           Chief   Architect,   she   appended   her   signatures.   That   no 

           criminality   can   be   attributed,   therefore,   to   her.   This 

           contention too has no merit. The Chairperson was not a

           facts and carry out the objects and purpose of NDMC Act 

           as head of the NDMC. She was a very Senior IAS Officer. As 

           a common sense, she should have questioned why file was 

           not traceable, what was the background of the case, what 

           pleas of the department were taken before the court, what 

           led the department to take demolition action in the past 

           and what are the relevant provisions. All this was not done 

           as she had been a party to fraudulent issuance of a health 

           license on 15.01.03 to accused K.L. Bhatia and she knew 

           that the premises was being misused as a hotel contrary to 

           section   327   and   331   of   NDMC   Act.   It   appears   from   the 

           circumstances established that the remark  'please discuss' 

           was   written   by   her   as   an   eye   wash   to   falsely   justify   her 

           illegal   act.   She   knew   it   well   that   her   sole   object   was   to 

           approve the compounding hurriedly so that accused  K.L. 

           Bhatia (since deceased) continue to run hotel illegally and 

           make huge pecuniary gains.

           the   rest   of   the   persons'   are   in   carbon   copy.   That 

           fabrication of the seizure memo is apparent as Ex.PW33/A 

           is the carbon copy of  Ex.PW55/A  and the second page of 

           both do not match.   In this regard, it is observed that  we 

           can   conveniently   discard   this   evidence   of   the

           Tribhuvan   Singh.   Admittedly,   accused   Tribhuvan   Singh 

           was under the Control  of the Government of UP. At the

                                                                                CBI case . No.27/11 

           relevant   time,   he  was   on  deputation  in  NDMC   and  was 

           reverted back to State Cadre. The contention that has been 

           raised with respect to his sanction is that it is invalid. That 

           it is not in accordance with law. That it has been passed 

           without   application   of   mind.   That   PW52   herself     in   her 

           cross examination admitted that she was not competent to 

           accord the sanction without the permission of the Chief 

           Minister.   That   there   is   nothing   on   record   put   by   the 

           prosecution  to show that the permission of Chief Minister 

           was obtained or the entire material was ever placed before 

           the   Chief   Minister.   There   is   no   whisper   in   the   sanction 

           order   that   such   permission   was   sought   or   given   by   the 

           Chief   Minister   or   was   taken   by   PW52.   That   once,   PW52 

           abdicated her power, sanction is vitiated. 



</p><p id="p_829">423.       It is well settled that the official in whom the law confides 

           the discretion, must function himself/herself and exercise

           in each case coming before her, without any interference 

           or   dictation   from   any   higher   officer.   In   the   case   law

           help   of   the   scale.   That   it   is   impossible   to   take

           admitted that the witness was not asked about the nature 

           and length of the scale. This, therefore, cannot be the sole 

           basis to discard the height given in the report,  Ex.PW4/B. 

           The   inspection   team   as   is   evident   from   their   report, 

           Ex.PW4/B  mentioned   the   height   of   the   building   on 

           inspection   much   more   than   the   permissible   limit   of   15 

           feet.   Let   us   discard   the   height   given   by   the   report, 

           Ex.PW4/B  for a moment. The prosecution has placed on 

           record, the record of NDMC when revised plan of the party 

           were rejected in 1985. At that time party itself has given the 

           height of the building achieved as 51 feet in the revised
