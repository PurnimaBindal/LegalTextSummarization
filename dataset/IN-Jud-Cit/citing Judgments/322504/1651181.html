                                 JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">      The petitioner company is represented by its Executive Director in

this writ petition. The challenge is against the refusal of the respondents to

accept the tender submitted by the petitioner in respect of Tender No.95 in

Ext.P1 with regard to electrical power distribution at the Medical College,

Kottayam. Accordingly, the petitioner seeks for a direction to respondents 2

and 3 to refer the revised offer submitted by the petitioner company as per

Ext.P8 to the Tender Committee for its final decision at the earliest.

</p><p id="p_2">      2.   The petitioner company has approached this Court              in the

following circumstances. By Ext.P1, the first respondent issued a tender

notice in respect of two items of identical works, one at the Medical

College, Thiruvananthapuram and the other at Medical College, Kottayam.

The probable amount of contract in respect of Tender No.94/09, i.e. with

respect to the work at            Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram is

Rs.3,35,23,365/- and the probable amount of contract in respect of the

work to be executed at the Medical College, Kottayam is Rs.6,05,11,104/-.

</p><p id="p_3">      3. The petitioner duly submitted the tender for both the works in time

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">wpc31958 /2009                        2</span>

along with the required documents. Before submitting the tender, there was

a pre-bid meeting     on 18.7.2009 at 11 a.m. in the office of the third

respondent, wherein the petitioner company also participated. All the three

tenderers had the requisite pre-qualification and thereafter the tenders were

opened on the appointed day at the prescribed time and it was found that

the petitioner company has quoted the lowest rate in respect of the work to

be executed at the Medical College, Kottayam, at 52% above the estimate

rate.  With regard to the work to be executed at Thiruvananthapuram

Medical College, the lowest tender was from V-Tech Electric Group, i.e.

57% above the estimate rate.
</p>
<p id="p_4">      4. In terms of the procedure prescribed, the lowest tenderers were

invited for negotiation and      the petitioner was invited by the third

respondent on 22.9.2009 for a negotiation in respect of the tender submitted

by them. The petitioner agreed to reduce by 3% from the percentage excess

quoted, i.e. instead of 52%, it was limited to 49% above the estimate rate

and Ext.P4 is the copy of the letter given in this regard. A further letter was

given as per Ext.P5 also wherein the petitioner company explained the

circumstances under which they are unable to reduce the rates substantially.

According to the petitioner, they did not receive any further communication

or information in this regard, but they came to know that the third

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">wpc31958 /2009                         3</span>

respondent was negotiating with V-Tech Electric Group in respect of the

work tendered for the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, even by

written communications and Ext.P6 fax message is produced in support of

the above plea. In response to the said communication, the said group

submitted Ext.P7 agreeing, to execute the work at 35% above the estimate

rate, on certain conditions. It is the case of the petitioner that the tender of

the said group was accepted in respect of Thiruvananthapuram Medical

College. But, strangely in respect of the Kottayam Medical College, the

third respondent did not give any information similarly to them and the

petitioner company was denied the opportunity to reduce the rate mentioned

in Ext.P4. According to the petitioner, this amounts to discrimination and

arbitrary action.   Again, they submitted Ext.P8 communication dated

26.10.2009 to the third respondent intimating that the petitioner is agreeable

to execute the work at 35% above the estimate rate. Thereafter, there was

no communication from the respondents. A further letter was forwarded by

the petitioner to the Superintending Engineer, the third respondent on

2.11.2009 as Ext.P9 in the matter, but he did not respond.

</p><p id="p_5">      5. Alleging that the third respondent, instead of entering into any

negotiation with the petitioner or referring the tender for the decision of the

Tender Committee, attempts to retender the work , the petitioner has filed

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">wpc31958 /2009                           4</span>

this Writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_6">       6. Mainly, it is contended that the third respondent has taken a

different stand and has initiated different steps with regard to the two

tenders, viz. in respect of Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram Medical

Colleges, resulting in arbitrary and discriminatory action which is violative

of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. What is highlighted in

ground B of the writ petition is that even though the petitioner was the

lowest tenderer in respect of the work at Medical College, Kottayam, and as

the work in question with regard to the two Medical Colleges are similar in

nature, i.e. the nature of work, method of execution, quality of materials,

etc., the attitude is not even handed, as far as the process to award the work

is concerned whereas in Thiruvananthapuram, the work has been awarded at

a lower rate and even though the petitioner offered for the same rate, no

communications have been issued in the matter.            It is offered that the

petitioner is prepared to execute the work at 35% above the estimate rate.

</p><p id="p_7">       7. The first respondent has filed a counter affidavit and the petitioner

has filed a reply affidavit and an additional reply affidavit.         The first

respondent has lastly filed an additional counter affidavit and the petitioner

has filed a further reply affidavit to the said additional counter affidavit.

</p><p id="p_8">       8. The stand taken by the first respondent in the matter, in a nutshell,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">wpc31958 /2009                        5</span>

is the following: The petitioner was the      LI contractor who quoted the

lowest rate for the execution of the work in Medical College Hospital,

Kottayam, quoting the initial rate as 52% above the estimate rate. When

negotiated to reduce the rate, he reduced only 3% bringing down the tender

excess to 49% above estimate rate. When he was asked to reduce the rate

further, he took an adamant stand and has given a detailed letter stating that

he was not in a position to reduce the rates further. The third respondent

had given two chances to the contractor to reduce the rates to a reasonable

limit in order to recommend to the Government Tender Committee. As

there was no response from the contractor in reducing the tender excess, the

third respondent was forced to retender the work with the approval of the

2nd respondent Chief Engineer, as per notification dated 24.10.2009 which

was forwarded to the Director of Public Relations on 26.10.2009.         The

Public Relations Department as per their letter dated 30.10.2009 intimated

that they have given instructions vide release order No.345/01/09/PR dated

29.10.2009 to publish the Tender Notification in the next immediate issue of

the daily `Deshabhimani'. The petitioner has forwarded a letter showing his

willingness to execute the work at 35% above estimate rate only after the

tender notice was forwarded to the Director of Public Relations for

publication. It is further pointed out that 35% above estimate rate is not at

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">wpc31958 /2009                        6</span>

all reasonable in any way. The inability of the third respondent to accept

the reduced rate of 35% above estimate rate after re-tendering the said work,

has been intimated to the petitioner vide letter dated 6.11.2009. It is further

averred that knowing that the work is retendered on 24.10.2009, the

petitioner sent a suo motu negotiation letter dated 26.10.2009 reducing the

quoted rate to 35% above estimate rate. Since it was received after inviting

retender, it was not considered. In para 9 of the counter affidavit, it is

further explained thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">         "The major components of both the works are almost the same and

         the cost element is almost the same except for L.T. cabling work.

         For the work in MCH, Thiruvananthapuram, the cost component

         for LT cabling work is only Rs.6,64,095.00 where as for the work

         in MCH, Kottayam the cost component for LT cabling work is

         Rs.2,91,27,655.00. Hence, it can very well be seen that for the

         work in MCH, Kottayam there is an additional amount of about

         Rs.285.00 lakhs for LT cabling work alone. Today, the LT cable

         market is highly competitive      due to emergence of many new

         companies. Also, there is substantial reduction in cost of LT cable

         due to reduced price of raw materials due to economic recession.

         For works having substantial component for the cabling work, the

         contractors used to quote very low rates bringing the quoted rates

         even below estimate rates, when there is healthy competitions. For

         example, a work recently      tendered, viz. the work "PMSSY -

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">wpc31958 /2009                         7</span>

         Installation of CT, MI &amp; CATH Lab in Medical College Hospital,

         Thiruvananthapuram" in which LT cabling was the main

         component. The cost component for panel boards is Rs.5,43,250/-

         and the cost component for LT cabling is Rs.29,35,309/-. The

         total estimate PAC      is Rs.34,86,163.47.      The lowest tenderer

         quoted 27% below estimate rate.................. Considering the above

         facts, the reduced rate of 49% offered by the petitioner is not at all

         justified. Even the reduced rate offered by the petitioner contractor

         in his suo moto negotiation at 35% above estimate rate is not at all

         reasonable since the cost component for the LT cabling work for

         the    work   in   Medical     College,   Kottayam      is  huge,    ie

         Rs.2,91,27,655/-. So, the tender of the petitioner cannot be

         recommended to Government Tender Committee for acceptance as

         it will cause huge drain of Exchequer."</blockquote><p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">      9. The petitioner has replied to the above contentions in        the reply

affidavit and in the additional reply affidavit.
</p>
<p id="p_11">      10. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner Shri N. Haridas and Shri

K. Ramesh, learned Govt. Pleader.
</p>
<p id="p_12">      11. It was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the

third respondent has clearly discriminated the petitioner while in similar

circumstances, recommended the contract in favour of the lowest tenderer

in respect of the work at Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram.             It is

submitted that the petitioner was not given any opportunity after the first

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">wpc31958 /2009                         8</span>

negotiation unlike the other tenderer. It is pointed out that by Ext.P6 a

specific communication was given to the lowest tenderer in respect of the

work at Trivandrum Medical College, which evidences the fact that actually

he was   interested in the award of works in respect of the said Medical

College, whereas the petitioner was not given a fresh opportunity in the

matter. It is submitted that the attitude and approach was not even handed.

In this context, learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to

decision No.4 taken in the pre-bid meeting, the minutes of which have

been produced as Ext.P2. It is submitted that decision No.4 therein shows

that outsourced equipments and fabrication done outside the factory will

not be acceptable, which is reiterated in Ext.P3 also in column No.30. It is

pointed out that as far as the work in Thiruvananthapuram Medical College

is concerned, going by Ext.P7 letter issued by the V-Tech Electric Group

who are the successful tenderer therein, even this condition has been sought

to be modified, for which the third respondent has no power. It is therefore

submitted that clearly this brings out the attitude of the third respondent

which is discriminatory. It is further pointed out that the petitioner had

submitted Ext.P4 offering a reduction of 3%. Later, after coming to know

of Exts.P6 and P7 with regard to the negotiation in respect of the work in

Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, they submitted Ext.P8 agreeing to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">wpc31958 /2009                          9</span>

execute the work at 35% above the estimate rate.
</p>
<p id="p_13">       12. It is further pointed out that the justification now sought for in the

counter affidavit cannot be believable also. My attention was drawn to

Ext.R1(f), the copy of a handwritten letter given by the Director of V-Tech

Electric Group for the execution of the work in Thiruvananthapuram

Medical College, which according to the learned counsel for the petitioner,

is not at all believable also.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       13. The petitioner is mainly aggrieved by the non-furnishing of a

reasonable opportunity in the matter which is a part of the principle of

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_1">Article 14.</a> Only one chance was given to the petitioner whereas two

chances were given to the tenderer of the work in the other Medical

College, is the contention. It is well settled that there should be a level

playing field to all tenderers as far as the procedure for award of works are

concerned. Herein, going by the averments in the counter affidavit and the

additional counter affidavit, it can be seen that in the first negotiation the

petitioner reduced the rate to 3%. It is pointed out that again they were

asked to reduce the rate further, but by Ext.R1(a) produced along with the

counter affidavit, the petitioner took the stand that they are unable to make

any further reduction. Significantly, a reading of Ext.R1(a) shows the fact

that after the negotiation held on 22.9.2009 and the revised offer made by

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">wpc31958 /2009                        10</span>

the petitioner on the same day, there had been further discussions. This is

clear from the first sentence in Ext.R1(a) letter dated 10.10.2009 which

shows that Ext.R1(a) (Ext.P5 produced in the writ petition) is in response

to further discussions made by the third respondent, wherein a request was

made to reduce the rates further.      This is evident from the following

sentence: "This has reference to the above and further discussions

requesting us to reduce our rates further."      References therein are the

tender, the offer dated 11.8.2009 and the negotiation and the revised offer

on 22.9.2009 (Ext.P4). Therefore, it is evident that there had been further

discussions with the third respondent wherein there was a further request to

reduce the rates by the petitioner from the part of the Superintending

Engineer. Finally, by Ext. R1(a), the petitioner has informed that they are

unable to make any further reduction in the matter. Therefore, the stand

taken by the third respondent in the counter affidavit as well as additional

counter affidavit in para 6 that when the petitioner was asked to reduce the

rate further, they took an adamant stand not to reduce the rate, is clearly

supported by Ext.R1(a) (Ext.P5). It is reiterated in the last para of the said

letter that "considering the above aspects, we feel the revised rate offered by

us is reasonable and we are unable to make any further reduction." It is in

that background, the contention raised by the petitioner in the writ petition

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">wpc31958 /2009                        11</span>

that there was a different attitude to them, has to be analysed. It is evident

and amply clear from the counter affidavit and in the additional counter

affidavit that the petitioner was given two chances to reduce the rate. The

retender notification is dated 24.10.2009 (Ext.R1(b). Ext.R1(c) shows that

the retender notification was forwarded to the Director of Public Relations,

which was acknowledged by them on 26.10.2009. Steps were taken to

publish the same on 29.10.2009 also and the details were published in the

search window iprd09/m 2927.         This is supported by Ext.R1(d).      The

revised offer by the petitioner was voluntary and not in response to any oral

communication from the third respondent also. The revised offer made by

the petitioner to reduce the rate upto 35% above estimate rate is dated

26.10.2009. Therefore, evidently as contended by the respondents, this is

an after thought, after coming to know about the steps for retender of the

work.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      14. Then, the further question is whether Ext.P9 ought to have been

acted upon by the third respondent. While considering this aspect, the stand

taken in the counter affidavit with regard the rate quoted by the petitioner at

35% above the estimate rate, and the rate at which the work was accepted

by the Tender Committee         in respect of Thiruvananthapuram Medical

College, are relevant.      Going by the counter affidavit of the third

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">wpc31958 /2009                          12</span>

respondent, as far as the acceptance of tender with regard to the

Thiruvananthapuram Medical College is concerned, the work is now

approved at 25% above the estimate rate by the Government Tender

Committee and the Contractor agreed to execute the work accordingly. He

was not adamant also in reducing the rate reasonably, which according to

the third respondent, is a positive attitude, whereas the petitioner has taken

an adamant attitude as per Ext.R1(a), not to reduce the estimate rate from

49% above.       Therefore, it is clear from the pleadings that the third

respondent has really decided to retender the work in the light of the stand

taken by the petitioner in Ext.R1(a), that the rate cannot be reduced further.

</p><p id="p_16">       15.   Apart from the above, the third respondent has sought

justification in para 9 of the counter affidavit which is already extracted

above, that even the reduced rate offered by the petitioner at 35% above

estimate rate is not at all reasonable, since the cost of component for the LT

cabling work for the work in Medical College, Kottayam is huge, i.e.

Rs.2,91,27,655/-. It is stated that the same cannot be recommended to the

Government Tender Committee for acceptance as it will cause huge drain

on Exchequer. This explanation is offered in the light of the fact that LT

cable market is highly competitive and there is substantial reduction in cost

due to reduced price of raw materials due to economic recession and in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">wpc31958 /2009                       13</span>

respect of such components for the cabling work, the contractors used to

quote very low rates bringing the quoted rates even below estimate rates,

when there is healthy competitions and an example also is quoted with

regard to the work PMSSY by installation of CT, MRI and CATH Lab in

Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram in which the LT cabling

work was the main component and the lowest tenderer quoted 27% below

estimate rate. Ext.R1(g) is the selection notice issued in respect of the said

work.
</p>
<p id="p_17">       16. One of the explanations offered with regard to the negotiation in

respect of the work in Thiruvananthapuram Medical College is that the

contractor was not initially responding to the personal requests and it is in

that circumstances, Ext.P6 fax message was sent. Thereafter, he reduced the

rate to 35% in writing without changing any conditions of the tender. It is

therefore contended that no discrimination was there from the part of the

third respondent. I see much force in the above contention. The third

respondent had not acted in any undue haste or extended any favour in

issuing a communication as per Ext.P6 to the contractor for the execution

of the work in respect of the Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. As

noticed already, the petitioner was being asked to reduce the rate, but even

then, the rate was reduced only by 3% as per Ext.P4 which is evident from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">wpc31958 /2009                          14</span>

Ext.P5 letter dated 10.10.2009 of the petitioner and he had further discussed

also in the matter with the third respondent. The contention raised by the

third respondent with regard to the issuance of Ext.P6 to the contractor for

the tender in respect of Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, has therefore

to be accepted. There is nothing unusual in issuing such a communication

as per Ext.P6.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      17. As far as the principles governing the matter is concerned, it is

well settled by various decisions of the Apex Court that the concept of

"level playing field" which is embodied in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_2">Article 19(1)(g)</a> will apply. In

the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/1278125/" id="a_3">M/s. Zoom Developers

Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Kerala and others</a> (2008 (4) KHC 934), the Bench

has quoted a dictum laid down by the Supreme in Court <a href="/doc/1775045/" id="a_4">Reliance Energy v.

MSRDC Ltd</a>. {(2007) 8 SCC 1} in para 85 which reads thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       "<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_5">Article 14</a> of the Constitution embodies the principle of            'non-

       discrimination'. However it is not a free standing provision. It has to

       be read in conjunction with rights conferred by other articles like

       <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_6">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The said <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_7">Article 21</a> refers to 'right to

       life'. It includes 'opportunity'. In our view, as held in latest judgment

       of the Constitution Bench of nine Judges in <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_8">I.R. Coelho v. State of

       T.N</a>., 2007 (2) SCC 1, Articles 21/14 are the heart of the chapter on

       fundamental rights.     They cover various aspects of life.         'Level

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">wpc31958 /2009                         15</span>

       playing field' is an important concept while construing <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_9">Article 19(1)</a>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (g) of the Constitution. It is entitled to invoke the said doctrine of

       'level playing field'. We may clarify that this doctrine is, however

       subject to public interest. In the world of globalisation, competition

       is an important factor to be kept in mind. The doctrine of 'level

       playing field' is an important doctrine which is embodied in <a href="/doc/935769/" id="a_10">Article

       19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.      This is because the said doctrine

       provides space within which equally placed competitors are allowed

       to bid so as to subserve the larger public interest."</blockquote><p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">      17. Judged in the light of the above principles also, it cannot be said

that there is any discrimination or arbitrariness as far as the dealings with

the petitioner is concerned with regard to the aspect of negotiation and in

respect of the offer made by him. Ample opportunities were given to the

petitioner. The doctrine of level playing field as held by the Apex Court

and by a Division Bench in the above quoted decision is however subject

to public interest. The petitioner insists that his offer at 35% above estimate

rate could have been accepted. The third respondent has demonstrated that

the said offer is also on a higher side and it is not reasonable at all. Even

though the said aspect is not so relevant for a final decision of this case, in

the light of the findings rendered by me earlier, while considering the

element of public interest, this is important. As highlighted in the counter

affidavit, the respondents have considered the aspect of loss of Exchequer

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">wpc31958 /2009                         16</span>

for considering the offer made by the petitioner at 35% above estimate.

Therefore, the grant of opportunity by invoking the concept of level playing

field, will have to yield to public interest also.
</p>
<p id="p_21">       18. Even before the receipt of the final offer made by the petitioner

as per Ext.P9, evidently there was a decision to retender the work. It cannot

be said therefore that the authorities have acted illegally and arbitrarily in

not accepting the offer made by the petitioner. With regard to both the

tenders, twice opportunities were given. It is not a case where even with

regard to the tender at Thiruvananthapuram, any additional advantage or

additional chances for negotiation was given, than the petitioner. Going by
