The asterisks used in the PHC column against the first two services in the aforesaid
break of posts in the Notification, was annotated in the following manner:
*One post in each in Jr. Scale of KAS and J&amp;K Accounts (G) Service is
earmarked for selection of Physically Challenged Candidates through
Horizontal Reservation in Accordance to Govt. Order No.61-SW of 2001 
dated 13.03.2001 and Combined Competitive Examination Rules, 2008.  

</p><p id="p_15">3.      The petitioner appears to have offered his candidature as general candidate
under the Physically Handicapped Category suffering from locomotors disability.
According to the petitioner, he appeared in the Preliminary Examination, qualified the
same and was, thereafter, called for Main Examination under Roll no.1901298.
Subsequent thereto, according to the petitioner, the Commission issued Notification
dated 28.05.2013 whereby 226 candidates were declared to have qualified for interview
and no candidate from Physically Handicapped Category (PHC) was declared qualified 
for interview. The petitioner, feeling aggrieved of the said Notification challenged the
same in the writ petition wherein he made the following prayers:
</p>
<p id="p_16">      That the Notification dated 28.05.2013 issued by Public Service
Commission may be quashed to the extent of filling up of two posts under
PHC Category candidates against those two posts. 
</p>
<p id="p_17">      And by issuance of a writ of mandamus the respondents be directed
to consider PHC Category candidates including the petitioner on the basis
of merit obtained in Main Examination for the two Reserved PHC Category
posts as prescribed in the basic advertisement notice and consider the
petitioner for select ion and allow him to appear in interview and thereafter
consider him for appointment on the basis of his merit in Main Examination
and interview against the posts reserved for PHC category. And the
respondents be directed to do the needful accordingly as is being done by
Union Public Service Commission in terms of the Reservation Rules, which
are similar and same as applicable in J&amp;K State, as same shall be in the
interest of justice.

In the petition, the petitioner did not array any successful candidate as party
respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_18">4.      Alongwith the writ petition, the petitioner made a civil miscellaneous petition,
CMP no.1702/2013, with a prayer, inter alia, to direct the Commission to conduct
interview of the petitioner under PHC. On 06.06.2013, while issuing notice in the
petition, this Court directed the Commission to conduct the interview of the petitioner
under PHC at his own risk and responsibility. The result of the petitioner was directed to
be kept in sealed cover till final disposal of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_19">5.      Thereafter, on 29.07.2013 the petitioner made an application, CMP no.
2242/2013. In the said application, the petitioner stated that pursuant to Court order
dated 06.06.2013 he had been interviewed and that the Commission had issued a 
notification on 23.07.2013 indicating that 37 candidates, including one candidate under
PHC, had been selected under the Open Merit Category (OMC). The petitioner in the
application claimed that, since in terms of the basic Notification the respondents had
advertised 37 Open Merit posts out of which one post each in Junior Scale KAS Service
and J&amp;K Accounts Gazetted Service had been earmarked for PHC candidates through    
Horizontal Reservation and since only one candidate under PHC had been selected, 
the respondents be directed to reserve one post out of the two advertised PHC
candidate posts.
</p>
<p id="p_20">6.      While issuing notice in the aforesaid application, CMP no. 2242, one of the
Coordinate Benches of this Court, by order dated 30.07.2013, directed that respondents
shall not finalize the selection under the PHC till next date of hearing. However, the
said order was later modified on 16.08.2013 in the following terms:
</p>
<p id="p_21">      Direction dated 30th July, 2013 with the consensus of learned
counsel for the parties is modified to the extent that now process for
selection shall be finalized, however, one post under Handicapped
Category shall not be filled up until further orders from the court.

The application, CMP no. 2242/2013 was, accordingly, disposed of. However, the basic
application for ad-interim relief, being CMP no. 1702/2013, remained pending.
</p>
<p id="p_22">7.      On 16.09.2013, one Kumar Abhishek son of Girdhari Lal Sharma resident of 
Poonch, moved an application, CMP no. 2808/2013, for impleadment as party  
respondent in the writ petition. In the said application, he stated that he was one of the
candidates declared to have qualified for interview under Open Merit Category vide
Notification dated 28.05.2013 and appears in the said Notification at serial no. 96. He
also stated therein, inter alia, that the Commission had declared and notified the result
of the Combined Competitive Examination pursuant to Notification dated 23.07.2013
and that he figured at serial no. 36 of the Select List. The said application was allowed
in terms of order dated 20.09.2013 on the no objection of the learned counsel for the
petitioner and the said Kumar Abhishek was ordered to be arrayed as party respondent
no.3 in the writ petition, SWP no.1058/2013.
</p>
<p id="p_23">8.      Subsequently, on 26.09.2013, the newly arrayed respondent no.3, made the 
instant application, CMP no.2987/2013, seeking vacation / modification of order dated
16.08.2013 so far as it directed reservation of one post under PHC.
</p>
<p id="p_24">9.      Meanwhile, it may be mentioned here, the Commission filed its reply / objections
to the writ petition. Respondent no. 3, too, filed his reply / objections to the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_25">10.     In their respective replies filed by the Commission and respondent no. 3, it was
brought on record that the Commission declared and notified the final result of the
Combined Competitive Examination in terms of Notification dated 23.07.2013 and the
selectees were also called upon to undergo Medical Examination and, in fact, the
selected candidates had already undergone medical examinations etc. Faced with this
situation, the petitioner has filed CMP no. 3612/2013 seeking to amend the writ petition.
The petitioner has also placed on record the memo of amended writ petition wherein
the petitioner has sought quashment of not only the Notification dated 28.05.2013
issued by the Commission notifying the candidates who had qualified for interviews,
but has also challenged the Notification dated 23.07.2013, i.e., the final select list, to the
extent it shows the name of respondent no.3. It may be mentioned here that pursuant to
the order dated 16.08.2013 passed in CMP no. 2242/2013, the Commission, vide  
Notification dated 04.09.2013, while notifying the list of 64 candidates in order of merit
who have been recommended for appointment, have withheld one post in open merit 
category. The petitioner has challenged this Notification as well to the extent his name
has not been shown therein. The petitioner has also prayed for Mandamus directing
the respondents to select and appoint him against the PHC post on the basis of his
merit obtained in written test and interview in terms of reservation rules. The petitioner
has further prayed for prohibition against appointment of respondent no. 3 against the
post in question.
</p>
<p id="p_26">11.     As submitted above, respondent no. 3 has filed the instant application, CMP no.
2987/2013, seeking vacation / modification of order dated 16.08.2013 passed in CMP
no. 2242/2013 so far as it directed reservation of one post under PHC.
</p>
<p id="p_27">12.     I have heard learned counsel for the parties, perused the material on record and
considered the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_28">13.     Though the learned counsels for the parties have advanced full-fledged
arguments at the Bar on the merits of the writ petition, yet I think it would be appropriate
to restrict this order only to the fundamental principles governing the grant or vacation
of an ad-interim order or direction.
</p>
<p id="p_29">14.     The law on grant or vacation of ad-interim reliefs, interlocutory orders or
interlocutory injunctions is not res integra. It would be appropriate to mention herein the
law laid down by the Supreme Court in this regard. Reference in this regard may be
made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_1">Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. COCA COLA 
Co</a>., (1995) 5 SCC 545. In paragraph 43 of the aforesaid judgment, it has been
observed and held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_30">The grant of an interlocutory injunction during the pendency of legal
proceedings is a matter requiring the exercise of discretion of the court.
While exercising the discretion the court applies the following tests  (i)
whether the plaintiff has a prima facie case; (ii) whether the balance of
convenience is in favour of the plaintiff; and (iii) whether the plaintiff would
suffer an irreparable injury if his prayer for interlocutory injunction is
disallowed. The decision whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction
has to be taken at a time when the existence of the legal right assailed by
the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both contested and uncertain and
remain uncertain till they are established at the trial or evidence. Relief by
way of interlocutory injunction is granted to mitigate the risk of injustice to
the plaintiff during the period before that uncertainty could be resolved. The
object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury
by violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated
in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his
favour at the trial. The need for such protection has, however, to be weighed
against the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against
injury resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own
legal rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. The court
must weigh one need against another and determine where the balance of
convenience lies. [] In order to protect the defendant while granting an
interlocutory injunction in his favour the court can require the plaintiff to
furnish an undertaking so that the defendant can be adequately
compensated if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial. 

In paragraph 47 of the judgment, the Supreme Court has further observed and held as
under:
</p>
<p id="p_31">47. In this context, it would be relevant to mention that in the instant case
GBC had approached the High Court for the injunction order, granted
earlier, to be vacated. Under Order 39 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
jurisdiction of the Court to interfere with an order of interlocutory or
temporary injunction is purely equitable and, therefore, the Court, on being
approached, will, apart from other considerations, also look to the conduct of
the party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court, and may refuse to interfere
unless his conduct was free from blame. Since the relief is wholly equitable
in nature, the party invoking the jurisdiction of the Court has to show that he
himself was not at fault and that he himself was not responsible for bringing
about the state of things complained of and that he was not unfair or
inequitable in his dealings with the party against whom he was seeking
relief. His conduct should be fair and honest. These considerations will
arise not only in respect of the person who seeks an order of injunction
under Order 39 Rule 1 or Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, but also in
respect of the party approaching the Court for vacating the ad interim or
temporary injunction order already granted in the pending suit or
proceedings.

</p><p id="p_32">15.     I am conscious that the Civil Procedure Code is not applicable to the writ
proceedings, but the principles thereof are. Above being the law on the subject on ad-
interim reliefs, let the case at hand be examined.
</p>
<p id="p_33">16.     In the instant case, Mr. M. Y. Bhat, learned counsel for the petitioner, in order to
demonstrate that the three tests governing the exercise of discretion by the Court for
grant of ad-interim relief, namely, prima facie case, balance of convenience and
irreparable loss, tilt in his favour, precisely raised two points: first that since 3% posts
have been reserved for Physically Handicapped Category candidates, therefore, at
least six candidates deserved to be qualified for interview. He submitted that, instead,
no candidate has been declared qualified in the Main Examination for interview from
amongst the PHC category. Contrary to that, he contended, in so far as the candidates
belonging to other social reserved categories are concerned, in order to ensure that the
ratio of 1:3 of candidates to be interviewed is maintained in those categories, their cut
off merit point has been lowered, which has not been done in the case of the
candidates belonging to PHC. This, according to the petitioners, is absolutely illegal,
discriminatory and violative of the Act and the Rules. This is the principal case of the
petitioner. His second argument is that in terms of the basic notification inviting
applications for the Preliminary Examination, two posts, one each in Junior Scale KAS
Service and J&amp;K Accounts (G) Service, have been earmarked for selection of PHC 
candidates and, therefore, he has a right to be appointed against one such post.
</p>
<p id="p_34">17.     On the other hand, Mr. R. A. Jan, learned Senior counsel for respondent no. 3,
referring to the relevant provisions of the Jammu and Kashmir Persons with Disabilities
(Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1998 (for short
1998 Act) and the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Rules, 2005 (Reservation Rules,  
for short), submitted that since the law provides horizontal reservation for the Physically
Handicapped Category candidates, a candidate claiming consideration under such 
category is not entitled to any separate relaxed standard for determination of his merit,
and that since the petitioner has failed to secure the minimum marks in the Main
Examination fixed by the Commission to entitle him to be called for interview, he cannot
seek selection or appointment to the post against which the applicant-respondent no.3
has been selected.
</p>
<p id="p_35">18.     Mr. Azhar-ul-Amin, learned counsel for the Commission, submitted that the
petitioner was a General Candidate belonging to the Physically Handicapped Category.
He was required to obtain minimum qualifying marks in the written part of the main
examination fixed by the Commission in terms of SRO 387 dated 01.12.2008. Since he  
failed to obtain the minimum qualifying marks, he was not short listed for interview.
Learned counsel also submitted that it is not correct to say that no candidate from PHC
has been declared qualified for the interview. According to him, out of 226 declared to
have qualified for viva-voce, one candidate with Roll no. 1101355 under PHC category
(Main category Open Merit) qualified for the interview and, in fact, was included in the
select list by dislodging the last candidate in the Open Merit Category.
</p>
<p id="p_36">19.     Let me first deal with the second point raised by the learned counsel for the
petitioner. The basic notification inviting applications, carried an annotation that one
post each in Jr. Scale of KAS and J&amp;K Accounts (G) Service is earmarked for selection
of Physically Challenged Candidates through Horizontal Reservation in accordance
to Govt. Order No.61-SW of 2001 dated 13.03.2001 and Combined Competitive   
Examination Rules, 2008. In this connection, it would suffice to say that Government
Order no. 62-SW of 2001 (wrongly mentioned as Order no.61-SW in the notification)
dated 13.03.2001 did not intend to, or create, any reservations in favour of the
Physically Handicapped Persons; it was only aimed at identifying the posts in different
establishments of the Government which could be utilized for appointing such persons.
The note appended to the notification, therefore, did not create any reservations over
and above what was provided by the Reservation Rules, 2005; the note was only meant 
to identify the posts against which the Physically Handicapped Persons, otherwise
making the grade, could be selected. This is further fortified by Explanation (C)
appended to Rule 4 of the Reservation Rules, 2005 which provides that for the purpose
of clause (e) reservations in recruitment shall be available for physically challenged
persons for services and posts specified under <a href="/doc/1326525/" id="a_2">section 22</a> of the Jammu and Kashmir
Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full
Participation) Act, 1998.
</p>
<p id="p_37">20.     In so far as the first point raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is
concerned, I deem it unnecessary to quote the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act or
the Reservation Rules having bearing on the matter. It is the positive case of the
petitioner that he is a Physically Challenged Person suffering from locomotor disability.
It is further his admitted case that Physically Challenged Persons are entitled to 3%
Horizontal Reservation out of which 1% each, in order of preference, is prescribed for
persons with (i) blindness or low vision; (ii) Hearing Impairment; and (iii) Locomotor
Disability or Cerebral Palsy. Explanation (B) under Rule 4 of the Reservation Rules
provides that the horizontal reservation means the reservations which would cut
across the vertical reservation (what is called inter-locking reservation) and the person
selected against the physically challenged quota will have to be placed in the
appropriate category viz. if he / she belongs to the scheduled caste category, he / she
will be placed in that quota by making the necessary adjustment and similarly if he / she
belongs to the open competition category, he / she will be placed in that category.
Horizontal reservation is not the same as vertical reservation. The distinction between
the two types of reservations has been explained by the Supreme Court number of
judgments, referred to and relied upon by none other than the learned counsel for the
petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_38">21.     Learned counsel for the petitioner, in this connection, has relied upon the
judgments of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/698833/" id="a_3">Rajesh Kumar Daria v. Rajasthan Public Service
Commission</a>, AIR 2007 SC 3127.   
</p>
<p id="p_39">22.     <a href="/doc/698833/" id="a_4">In Rajesh Kumar Daria v. Rajasthan Public Service Commission</a> (supra), the
Supreme Court has held as under: 
</p><p id="p_40">Before examining whether the reservation provision relating to women had
been correctly applied, it will be advantageous to refer to the nature of
horizontal reservation and the manner of its application. <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_5">In Indra Sawhney
vs. Union of India</a> [1992 Supp.(3) SCC 217], the principle of horizontal
reservation was explained thus (Pr.812) :
</p><p id="p_41">all reservations are not of the same nature. There are two types of
reservations, which may, for the sake of convenience, be referred
to as 'vertical reservations' and 'horizontal reservations'. The
reservations in favour of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes
and Other Backward Classes [(under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_6">Article 16(4)]</a> may be called
vertical reservations whereas reservations in favour of physically
handicapped (under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_7">Article 16]</a> can be referred to as
horizontal reservations. Horizontal reservations cut across the
vertical reservations - what is called interlocking reservations. To
be more precise, suppose 3% of the vacancies are reserved in
favour of physically handicapped persons; this would be a
reservation relatable to clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_8">Article 16.</a> The persons
selected against the quota will be placed in that quota by making
necessary adjustments; similarly, if he belongs to open
competition (OC) category, he will be placed in that category by
making necessary adjustments. Even after providing for these
horizontal reservations, the percentage of reservations in favour
of backward class of citizens remains - and should remain - the
same. 
A special provision for women made under <a href="/doc/1603957/" id="a_9">Article 15(3</a>), in respect of
employment, is a special reservation as contrasted from the social reservation
under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_10">Article 16(4).</a> The method of implementing special reservation, which is a
horizontal reservation, cutting across vertical reservations, was explained by this
Court in <a href="/doc/1055016/" id="a_11">Anil Kumar Gupta vs. State of U.P</a>. [1995 (5) SCC 173] thus :
The proper and correct course is to first fill up the Open
Competition quota (50%) on the basis of merit; then fill up each of
the social reservation quotas, i.e., S.C., S.T. and B.C; the third step
would be to find out how many candidates belonging to special
reservations have been selected on the above basis. If the quota
fixed for horizontal reservations is already satisfied - in case it is
an overall horizontal reservation - no further question arises. But if
it is not so satisfied, the requisite number of special reservation
candidates shall have to be taken and adjusted/accommodated  
against their respective social reservation categories by deleting
the corresponding number of candidates therefrom. (If, however, it
is a case of compartmentalized horizontal reservation, then the
process of verification and adjustment / accommodation as stated
above should be applied separately to each of the vertical
reservations. In such a case, the reservation of fifteen percent in
favour of special categories, overall, may be satisfied or may not
be satisfied.) [Emphasis supplied]
          (Highlighting &amp; underlining supplied)
The law on application of vertical and horizontal reservations thus stands elaborately
settled and explained. Whereas vertical reservations create separate slots or
compartments for each of the reserved categories, say SC / ST / OSC / ALC / General
according to the prescribed percentage of reservations; horizontal reservation cuts
across and shares the very same slots or compartments. In other words, a person
claiming horizontal reservation would otherwise belong either to General Category, SC
category, ST Category or OSC category or ALC category and would thus be considered  
against one of such vertical categories to which he may belong, but would not by itself
constitute a separate slot or compartment. As a necessary corollary, if such a candidate
would belong to any of the Social Reserved Categories, he would be entitled to the
same relaxed standard as may be applicable to such Category, not because of being a 
PHC candidate, but because of belonging to the Social Reserved Category. If a
reserved category candidate makes the grade, he can even go into and be selected in
the General Category on the basis of his merit. Further, depending upon the nature of
horizontal reservation prescribed  compartmentalized horizontal reservation or overall
horizontal reservation  if in a given category, say, for instance, General Category, the
required number of PHC candidates do not come in the selection list as per the
percentage of reservation fixed for such candidates, the short fall would be made good
by dislodging equal number of selected candidates of the General Category figuring at
the bottom of that category.
</p>
<p id="p_42">23.     Resultantly, the contention of the petitioner that the Commission ought to have
summoned six PHC candidates for interview is misplaced and misconceived.  
</p>
<p id="p_43">24.     There is yet another aspect of the matter. The Combined Competitive
Examination is governed by the provisions contained in the Conduct of Combined
Competitive Examination (for Direct Recruitment to various Services) Rules, 1995
framed under Section 124 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir promulgated in 
terms of General Administration Department notification SRO 161 dated 17.07.1995.
Sub-rule (iii) and (iv) of Rule 8 of the aforesaid Rules provide as under:
</p>
<p id="p_44">(iii) The Main Examination will consist of a written examination and an
interview test. The written examination will consist of papers of conventional
essay type (out of which one paper will be of qualifying nature only) in the
subjects set out in Appendix-IA and the detailed syllabus in Appendix-IB.
</p>
<p id="p_45">(iv) Candidates who obtain such minimum qualifying marks in written part of
the Main Examination as may be fixed by the Commission in any or all the
papers at their discretion shall be summoned by them for an interview.
</p>
<p id="p_46">      The interview test is intended to judge the mental caliber of a
candidate. In broad terms, this is really an assessment of not only his
intellectual qualities but also social traits and his interest in current affairs.
Some of the qualities to be judged are mental alertness, critical powers of
assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgment, variety and
depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, intellectual and
moral integrity;
</p>
<p id="p_47">      Provided that a candidate who fails to secure such minimum number
of marks as are fixed by the Commission in their discretion in more than one
subject shall not be eligible to be called for interview.

Rule 9 of the aforesaid Rules prescribes that the number of candidates to be
summoned for interview will not be more than thrice the number of vacancies to be
filled.
</p>
<p id="p_48">25.     A conjoint reading of sub-rule (iii) of Rule 8 and Rule 9 would show that in effect
and in essence the minimum cut off mark in each of the categories may not actually be
fixed by the Commission, but would rather be determined by the marks obtained by the
competing candidates. This may be explained like this: Suppose there are 10 vacancies
in a particular category to be filled in. As per Rule 9 the ratio of candidates to be
summoned for interview has to be 1:3, which means, the Commission has to call 30 
candidates for the interview. The cut off point would thus be the marks as may have
been secured by the 30th candidate. The Commission would have nothing to do with 
determination of such cut off point. Sub-rule (iii) of Rule 8 is basically a provision to
meet and safeguard anomalous situations. In that view of the matter, the contention of
the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Commission has lowered the merit
position of other category candidates so as to bring them within the 1:3 ration is
unfounded and an argument bereft of any merit.
</p>
<p id="p_49">26.     Law, as it is, requires that a candidate belonging to PHC in order to be entitled to
be called for the next step in the selection process, would have to obtain such minimum
qualifying marks in the written part of the main Examination as would bring him within
the number of candidates in his Category as per the 1:3 ratio fixed by Rule 9. It is not
that a PHC candidate would be entitled to be called for interview irrespective of whether
or not he qualifies the written examination as per the minimum qualifying marks in the
written examination so determinative of his merit position within his Category, namely,
SC / ST / OSC / ALC / General category. 
</p>
<p id="p_50">27.     Learned counsel for the petitioner has also cited a recent judgment dated
08.10.2013 of the Supreme Court in SLP (Civil) No.7541 of 2009 titled Union of India v
National Federation of Blind. In  the said judgment, the Supreme Court has held that the
computation of reservation for persons with disabilities has to be computed on total
number of vacancies in the cadre strength. Consequently, the Supreme Court has,
among other things, directed the Central Government to modify the OM dated
29.12.2005 and the subsequent OMs. Since the said OM is not applicable in the State
of Jammu and Kashmir, therefore, the judgment is of no help to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_51">28.     The petitioner in the instant  case was a General Category Candidate. Since he
has failed to make the grade to find a place within the number of candidates called for
interview in the said Category, it becomes immaterial to ascertain whether as per 3%
horizontal reservation fixed for PHC candidates as against the total of 65 seats one
PHC candidate or two such candidates ought to have been selected. Nonetheless, it is
the case of the respondent Commission that one PHC candidate was included in the 
final select list by dislodging the last Open Merit candidate.
</p>
<p id="p_52">29.     As against the petitioners claims, as discussed, above, the applicant-respondent
no.3 has been selected as an Open Merit Candidate. He is also stated to have
undergone the Medical Examination. However, recommendation in his favour has 
been withheld by the Commission on account of the interim direction dated 16.08.2013
passed by the Court in CMP no.2242/2013. On the touchstone of the law, as laid down
by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_12">Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. v. COCA COLA Co</a>. (supra), the
question is whether the petitioner, in the facts and circumstances of the case as
discussed above, has a prima facie case in his favour. Prima facie case connotes a
case where a serious issue is involved for determination prejudicing the right of the
applicant. As seen from the above discussion, there does not seem to be any such
serious issue involved any more, prejudicing the right of the petitioner as cannot be
taken care of by the Court at the final disposal of the case. I am convinced that on the
contrary the applicant-respondent no.3 has made out a prima facie case in his favour.
The balance of convenience also lies in favour of the applicant-respondent no.3,
inasmuch as he stands selected; whereas the petitioner has not even qualified the
Mains Examination. The other selectees are stated to have already been appointed.
The applicant-respondent no. 3 is unnecessarily suffering. He cannot be compensated
by damages for the loss of appointment; whereas the interests of the petitioner, if any,
can adequately be secured pending final disposal of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_53">30.     For all what has been said and discussed above, CMP no.2987/2013 is allowed. 
The interim direction dated 16.08.2013 passed in CMP no. 2242/2013 is vacated. The
official respondents are free to proceed with the filling up of the said post. Appointment
of the applicant-respondent no. 3, if made, shall remain subject to the final outcome of
this writ petition. It is made clear that in the event his selection is finally quashed, his
appointment shall cease to operate. CMP no.1702/2013 shall abide the above order.
</p>

<p id="p_54">CMP no.3612/2013   

</p><p id="p_55">31.     In view of the fact that the averments made in the amended writ petition were
relied upon and referred to by the learned counsel for the parties during the course of
arguments, this CMP is allowed on the deemed no objection from the respondents. The 
amended writ petition stands taken on record. Respondents to file their respective
replies thereto within a period of 6 weeks with an advance copy thereof to the learned
counsel for the petitioner who in turn would have two weeks time thereafter to file,
rejoinder if any. The matter be listed final hearing in the 2nd week of March, 2014.
