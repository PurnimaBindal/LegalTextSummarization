                     NICE classification is an infringement of plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark

                     among the general public is detrimental to the distinctive character and

                     plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademark. The defendant unauthorisedly using the the

                     well known trademark “CYCLE” has also placed the device of cycle closely

                     to create an unequivocal impression in the minds of general public that the

                     defendant&#x27;s product is somehow associated with the plaintiff. The trade

                     mark “CYCLE” along with the cycle logo in a prominent fashion is in close

                     proximity to the plaintiff device of cycle. This is bound to cause confusion

                     among the general public and this is an origin of defendant&#x27;s product. An

                     ordinary person with imperfect recollection would be easily confused and

                     deceived into believing that the defendant&#x27;s goods emanates from the

                     plaintiff. The use of the identical mark “CYCLE” by the defendant is a

                     manufacturing edible vegetable oils under the trade mark “CYCLE” since

                     2009. They have adopted the trade mark “CYCLE” as it was an arbitrary

                     choice for edible oils. They are using the said trade mark for the past 8

                     years. The plaintiff used the trade mark “CYCLE” only with respect to

                     incense sticks and agarbathies and they have never used the trade mark

                     “CYCLE” with respect to food products. The registration of the plaintiff

                     deception in the market will cause. The plaintiff is a manufacturer and

                     suppliers of incense sticks and allied products under cycle brand. Whereas,

                     the defendant is using the mark “CYCLE” for edible oils which is neither

                     allied or cognate to the goods of the plaintiff. The mark “CYCLE” is neither

                     a coined word nor a fancy word. It is a word well known in English.

                     Adoption of the common dictionary word for particular product a trade

                     mark for its product will not give exclusive right to the plaintiff over the

                     said name. It is an arbitrary choice of the defendant to use the word

                     “CYCLE” for its product edible oils. It is not in bad faith.



</p><p id="p_21">                              11.The plaintiff has not filed any document to show that they are

                     dealing with food products under the trade mark “CYCLE”. The plaint

                     averment clearly confines their claim of reputation and operation in respect

                     of incense and agarbathies only. Therefore, the use of trade mark “CYCLE”

                     by the defendant for its edible oils no way cause infringement or passing

                     off. The trade mark “CYCLE” mentioned and used by the plaintiff is not

                     application i.e. 20.01.1992, admittedly, the plaintiff had never used the trade

                     mark “CYCLE”for goods under class 29 and 30. More particularly, as far as

                     edible oil, which falls under class 29, the defendant is the prior user of the

                     trade mark “CYCLE”. The plaintiff is not entitled to claim monopoly over

                     the word “CYCLE” across the product. Any accolades or awards received

                     by the plaintiff as a trader will not confer monopoly over the trade mark

                     “CYCLE” for all products cutting across goods. The claim of the plaintiff

                     that its trade mark “CYCLE” has gained the status of well known mark, is

                     its product likely to have association with the plaintiff. The word “CYCLE”

                     is neither distinctive nor can be appropriate by the plaintiff as their own

                     against the world. The plaintiff has never used the word “CYCLE”

                     independently, but had associated with its product Agarbathies. Therefore,

                     using the device of “CYCLE” by the defendant for their edible oils will not

                     cause confusion amidst the public. The public will not mistake the product

                     of the defendant originate from the plaintiff. The plaintiff seeking dilution

                     ought to have shown that the word so well imprinted in the minds of the

                     public that any reference to the word “CYCLE” shall immediately bring to

                     the mind the plaintiff&#x27;s product.     This is possible only if the word is

                     distinctive and had been so exclusively used by the plaintiff. In the instant

                     case, the word “CYCLE” is used by several persons across several products

                     and services including one of the symbols recognised by the Election

                     Commission of India. It could not be exclusively identified with the

                     plaintiff. As far as edible oil under class 29, the defendant is the prior user

                     of the mark and hence, have a better right than the plaintiff.

                     defendant from the year 2008 (Ex.D2) would show that the defendant are

                     the prior user of the trade mark “CYCLE” with respect to edible oils. The

                     plaintiff has not produced any evidence to show that, they were in trade of

                     food products anywhere before 2008. Hence, their claim on the ground of

                     prior user is incorrect. Further, when the plaintiff never used the trade mark

                     “CYCLE” with respect to food products, the apprehension of confusion and

                     deception in the market is un-found. Agarbathies and edible oils are not

                     allied or cognate goods. The word mark “CYCLE” is an ordinary English

                     word, which cannot be monopolised by the plaintiff and it can never be

                     identified with that of the plaintiff alone. It is neither distinctive nor can be

                     appropriated by the plaintiff as his own against all the world. The sales

                     turnover of the defendant for the previous years, which is marked as Ex.D3,

                     would show that the product of the defendant is an existence for more than

                     nine years without causing any actual confusion.

                     is established through Ex.D2(series). Through the invoices for cycle

                     cooking oil, the defendant has proved that they are marketing their product

                     by using the mark “CYCLE”. The statement of turnover from the year 2009-

                     2010 to 2016-2017 furnished by the defendant and marked as Ex.D3 is

                     sufficient to show that atleast 8 years prior to the suit, the defendant are

                     identical adoption for identical goods and ends, with identical or similar

                     mark for different goods. However, if a trade mark holder wants to

                     protection of his mark across the goods, he should prove that his registered

                     trade mark has a reputation in India and it is used by others without due

                     cause to take unfair advantage or the use of its trademark by others. Even

                     across the goods will be a detrimental to a distinctive character or reputation

                     of his trade mark. Therefore, in this spectrum of infringement, there are

                     exceptions and limits. It is to be tested, whether the adoption of the mark

                     “CYCLE” by the defendant for his edible oil falls within the spectrum of

                     infringement, as defined under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_43">Section 29</a> or falls outside the spectrum due

                     differing from its primary one and the defendant attempts to sell his own

                     goods under the pretence, that are the goods of another man. The plaintiff

                     for that purpose should prove a distinctive character in its trade mark, which

                     likely to be diluted.     In the present case, unlike “Eenadu” case, or

                     Mahendra and Mahendra Paper Mills Limited case, there is no evidence

                     to show that the defendant will gain unfair advantage by using the mark

                     “CYCLE” per se for its edible oil or such use will be detrimental to the

                     distinctive character or reputation to the plaintiff. This complete lack of

                     evidence on the part of the plaintiff to establish that its reputation will be

                     diluted or will be detrimental to its distinctive character. The evidence of

                     turn over and expenses over advertisement are tested for reputation. For

                     detrimental of reputation and dilution of distinctive character independent

                     evidence is required. The defendant continuous use of the mark “CYCLE”

                     for its edible oil prior to the plaintiff dis-entitles the plaintiff from seeking

                     the relief of injunction either on the ground of infringement or passing off.

                     Accordingly, Issue No.7 is answered in negative.
