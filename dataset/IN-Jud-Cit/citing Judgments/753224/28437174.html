ORDER NO: ____________________________


Per: P.R. Chandrasekharan:
</p><p id="p_4">     The appeal is directed against Order-in-Appeal No: AT/443/M-II/2005 dated 29/08/2005 passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals), Mumbai Zone  II.
</p><p id="p_5">2.  The appellant, M/s. Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. filed a refund claim for refund of service tax paid amounting to ` 25,80,156/- paid by them on 31/03/2004 under the category of Technical Testing and Analysis Service.  The refund claim was filed vide claim dated 26/08/2004. The ground on which the refund claim was made is that that the services received by the appellant on which tax has been paid would be covered under Business Auxiliary Service and not under Technical Testing and Analysis Service and since the assessee received information technology service they are not liable to tax under Business Auxiliary Service also.  The said claim of the appellant was rejected by the department.  On appeal, the lower appellate authority also rejected the claim and hence the appellant is before us. 
</p><p id="p_6">3. The learned counsel for the appellant submits that as per Boards Circular No. 275/7/2010-CX.8A dated 30/06/2010, levy of service tax on taxable service received in India provided by a non-resident, not having office/establishment in India, arises on reverse charge basis w.e.f. 01/01/2005.  The said clarification has been issued after the judgment of the honble Bombay High Court in the case of Indian National Ship Owners <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_1">Association vs. Union of India</a> 2009 (14) STR 289 wherein it was held that service tax at the hands of the recipient of the service would be leviable only w.e.f. 18/04/2006, after the insertion of Section 66A in Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994.  Since in the present case, the service tax payment has taken place prior to these dates, the appellant is rightly entitled for the refund of the claim made irrespective of the classification of the service.  Accordingly, he prays that the refund claim be allowed.
</p><p id="p_7">4. The learned Commissioner (AR) appearing for the Revenue fairly concedes that in view of the decision of the honble High Court of Bombay in the case of Indian National Ship Owners <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_2">Association vs. Union of India</a>, cited supra, the question of payment of tax by service recipient prior to 18/04/2006 would not arise. Therefore, the matter has to go back to the jurisdictional Assistant/Deputy Commissioner for consideration of the refund claim by the appellant in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_8">5. We have carefully considered the submissions made by both the sides.  There is merit in the contention of the appellant that they were not required to discharge any service tax liability as recipient of service prior to 18/04/2006, in view of the decision of the honble High Court of Bombay in the case of Indian National Ship Owners <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_3">Association vs. Union of India</a>, cited supra.  Therefore, on merits the appellant has a claim for refund of the service tax wrongly paid. However, since refund has to be granted after considering the  time-bar and unjust enrichment provisions, the matter has to go back to the jurisdictional Assistant/Deputy Commissioner to consider only these aspects i.e., whether the claim is time-barred or not, and, whether the question of unjust enrichment would apply to the facts of the case or not?
</p><p id="p_9">6. Thus, the appeal is allowed by way of remand.
