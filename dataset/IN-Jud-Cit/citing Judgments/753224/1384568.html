<p id="p_1">M.KARPAGAVINAYAGAM,J.        
</p>
<p id="p_2">                G.Rajendran,   party-in-person,   claiming   himself   as  the
President of Madras High Court Practising Advocates'  Association,  has  filed
this Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, seeking for
the prayer, as under :
</p><p id="p_3">        "I  therefore  pray  that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to issue a
writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, direction  or  order,  in  the
nature  of  writ,  directing  the  Union  of  India, represented by Secretary,
Ministry of Law and Justice, first respondent, and Union of India, represented
by Secretary, Home Department,  second  respondent,  to  strictly  follow  the
guidelines laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case, namely, Supreme 
Court Advocate on record <a href="/doc/181443842/" id="a_3">Association -vs- Union of India</a>, reported in AIR 1994
SUPREME COURT 268 and also the suggestions mentioned in this Writ Petition, in   
the  matter of appointment of Judges to the Hon'ble High Court from out of the
lists so far sent to the Union of India, Ministry of Law  and  Justice,  which
are pending consideration."
</p>
<p id="p_4">                2.   The  circumstances,  which led to the filing of this Writ
Petition as a pro bono publico,  according  to  the  party-in-person,  are  as
follows :
</p>
<p id="p_5">                "(a)  Petitioner  has been given to understand that recently a
list of names of advocates were recommended for elevation as  Judges  of  this
High Court.    He came to know from the newspaper reports and from the Members  
of the Bar that most of them are having political attachment and membership in
political parties.  When such politically attached advocates get  elevated  to
the  post  of High Court Judges, there is every possibility of showing bias or
favoritism.  Therefore, C.B.I.  or I.B.  may be requested to  investigate  and
report separately on the political affiliation or association of any advocate,
who has  been recommended for elevation, before deciding the matter.  If it is
found that the advocate belongs to political party, it may be decided that  he
shall not be appointed as a Judge of the High Court.  In addition, yet another
new  deplorable  malady  has  taken  place  that  some  of  the  advocates now
recommended  are  very  close  relatives,  classmates,  former  associates  or
convenient  friends  of  the  Hon'ble sitting and retired Judges of the Madras
High Court.  Thus, it is clear that nepotism has crept in.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                (b) If the higher Judiciary of the  State  is  allowed  to  be
occupied by the family members of the sitting and retired Judges and political
personalities,  there  may  be a phenomenon of anarchism in the modern time of
judicial activism, equalism and independence.   So,  the  advocates,  who  are
close  relatives and convenient friends of the sitting and retired Judges, are
not to be appointed.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                (c) He saw a news item  in  Tamil  Daily  "Thina  Thanthi"  on
28.01.2005  ,  giving  the news that names of 12 new persons have been sent by
the Chief Justice of the High Court, recommending for their appointment.    He
sent  a  representation  to  Law  Minister  on  30.11.2004 and a letter to Law
Secretary and Home Secretary on 30.07.2005, objecting to  the  appointment  of
the  persons,  who  are  politically  connected and closely related to Judges.
Some of them are related to Judges and some of them are connected to political
activities.  But, there is no  response.    Hence,  he  has  filed  this  Writ
Petition, seeking for a mandamus."
</p>

<p id="p_8">                3.  We  have heard Mr.G.Rajendran, party-in-person.  He argued
at length, on the basis of the guidelines laid down by the  Supreme  Court  in
AIR  1994 SUPREME COURT 268 (SUPREME COURT <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_4">ADVOCATES-ON-RECORD ASSOCIATION AND                       
ANOTHER v.  UNION OF INDIA</a>).  Pointing out various  paragraphs,  he  submitted 
that  in  view  of  the  guidelines given by the Supreme Court relating to the
undesirability of the  political  influence  and  nepotism,  which  should  be
discouraged,  suitable directions may be issued by this Court to respondents 1
and 2, to follow those guidelines, given by  the  Supreme  Court.    He  would
further  point  out  that  before  deciding  the appointments, the authorities
concerned may consult  the  Presidents  of  various  Advocates'  Associations,
Senior  Advocates  and  also  the  public,  by giving suitable advertisements,
mentioning the names of the persons, proposed to be appointed as Judges. 
</p>

<p id="p_9">                4.  We have  also  heard  Mr.V.T.Gopalan,  learned  Additional
Solicitor  General,  appearing  for  the  Union of India; and Mr.N.R.Chandran,
learned Advocate General, appearing for the State.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                5.  We have carefully considered the submissions made  by  the
counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                6.   At the outset, it shall be stated that the prayer in this
Writ Petition is not only innocuous, but also preposterous.    Before  dealing
with  the  said  strange prayer, it would be worthwhile to express our anguish
over the averments made by the petitioner, who is a  practising  advocate  and
claiming  himself  to  be  the  President  of  Madras  High  Court  Practising
Advocates' Association, to the extent of casting aspersions  on  the  persons,
whose  names were allegedly sent with the recommendation, by the Hon'ble Chief 
Justice,  as  contained  in  the  Tamil  Newspaper  "Thina   Thanthi",   dated
28.01.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                7.   The  petitioner,  without  any material whatsoever, would
state that some of the advocates, now recommended, are very  close  relatives,
classmates  and  convenient  friends of the sitting and retired Judges of this
Court.
</p><p id="p_13">                8.  It is quite unfortunate to state that some of the persons,
whose names are found in the list of advocates and recommended for  elevation,
belong  to political parties and, therefore, they should not be allowed to get
elevated.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                9.  We are at a loss to understand as  to  how  this  sort  of
allegation,  casting  general  aspersions  on  the  members of the Bar without
placing any material, could be made.    The  petitioner,  as  party-in-person,
should  have  shown  responsibility, while approaching this Court, in order to
convince this Bench that his prayer is genuine and  he  has  come  with  clean
hands and clean mind. 
</p>
<p id="p_15">                10.   A perusal of the affidavit, filed in this Writ Petition,
would indicate that there is a general allegation, casting aspersions  on  all
the  persons,  whose  names are mentioned in the list, which has been sent for
consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_16">                11.  As  laid  down  in  2004  (3)  SUPREME  COURT  CASES  363
(<a href="/doc/716916/" id="a_5">DR.B.SINGH v.    UNION  OF  INDIA  AND OTHERS</a>), the Court has to be satisfied  
about :   (  a)  the  credentials  of  the  applicant,  (b)  the  prima  facie
correctness  or  nature  of  information given by him, and (c) the information
being not vague and indefinite.   The  information  should  show  gravity  and
seriousness involved.    The  Court  has  to  strike  a  balance  between  two
conflicting interests :  (i) nobody should be allowed to indulge in  wild  and
reckless  allegations besmirching the character of others; and ( ii) avoidance
of public mischief and to avoid mischievous petitions seeking to  assail,  for
oblique motives, justifiable executive actions.
</p>



<p id="p_17">                12.   It  is not the ipse dixit of any individual to say as to
whether the  recommended  person  is  fit  for  appointment,  by  making  wild
allegations,  which has become common these days, and has resulted in delaying 
appointment of Judges, though a large number of vacancies exist  in  different
High Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                13.   The  high-sounding  words  used  in  the petition by the
petitioner about the desirability of a transparent judicial system cannot,  in
our  view,  turn  a  misconceived  petition  filed  with oblique motives to be
treated as a public interest litigation.
</p>
<p id="p_19">                14.   The  peculiarity  in  the  prayer,  sought  for  by  the
petitioner,  is  that the advocates, who are politically connected and closely
acquainted with the Judges, are about to be appointed and the same  should  be
stopped.
</p>
<p id="p_20">                15.   The  procedure for appointment of a Judge is provided in
<a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_6">Article 217</a> of the Constitution.  The process is an elaborate one.    Where  a
particular  person  is  to  be  appointed  as  a  Judge,  the  modalities  and
procedures, to be adopted, have been elaborately dealt with in  SUPREME  COURT  
<a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_7">ADVOCATES-ON-RECORD ASSOCIATION  AND  ANOTHER  v.  UNION OF INDIA</a>, reported in              
AIR 1994 SUPREME COURT 268 and in PRESIDENTIAL REFERENCE,reported in AIR  1999            
SUPREME COURT 1.     
</p>
<p id="p_21">                16.   <a href="/doc/259647/" id="a_8">Article  217  (1)</a> of the Constitution of India, which is
relevant, reads thus :
</p><p id="p_22">        "Appointment and conditions of the Office of a Judge of a High Court :
</p><p id="p_23">        (i) Every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by
warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief  Justice  of
India,  the  Governor of the State, and, in the case of appointment of a Judge
other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court,  and  shall
hold  office,  in  the  case  of an additional or acting Judge, as provided in
<a href="/doc/570782/" id="a_9">Article 224</a>, and in any other case, until he  attains  the  age  of  sixty-two
years..."
</p>

<p id="p_24">                17.   The Constitutional functionaries, like the Judges of the
High Court, who are required to be involved in the selection process in  terms
of  <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_10">Article  217</a>  of  the  Constitution are, the President of India, the Chief
Justice of India, the Governor of the State and  the  Chief  Justice  of  High
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_25">                18.   As  referred  to  in  SUPREME COURT <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_11">ADVOCATES-ON- RECORD    
ASSOCIATION AND ANOTHER v.  UNION OF INDIA</a>, reported in AIR 1994 SUPREME COURT             
2 68, in the case of appointment of a Judge to the High  Court,  the  proposal
emanates  from  the  Chief  Justice  of  the  High  Court and that proposal is
considered by the Chief Minister of the State and duly processed  through  the
Governor  and  forwarded to the Chief Justice of India through the Ministry of
Law and Justice.  Thereafter, the Ministry of Law, with the recommendation  of
the  Chief Justice of India, forwards the proposal to the Prime Minister, who,
then, approves and advises the President to issue a formal warrant.
</p>
<p id="p_26">                19.  Paragraphs 224, 225 and 504 of the  judgment  in  SUPREME
COURT <a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_12">ADVOCATES-  ON-  RECORD  ASSOCIATION  AND  ANOTHER  v.   UNION OF INDIA</a>,               
reported in AIR 1994 SUPREME COURT 268, would clearly indicate that there  are  
norms  fixed  for selecting the persons, to be appointed as Judges of the High
Court.  While recommending a candidate for the  higher  State  Judiciary,  the
Chief  Justice  of the High Court has the advantage of proximity in evaluating
the caliber and legal ability of the candidate.  However, the Chief Justice of
India, before whom the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court as  well
of  the  State Government is placed with all the relevant materials concerning
the proposal, is in a better position either to accept the  recommendation  or
reject it  for  strong  and  cogent  reasons  to  be recorded.  The merit of a
candidate with regard to his/her professional  attainments,  legal  soundness,
ability, skill  etc.    can be evaluated only by the Chief Justice of the High
Court in the matter and, ultimately, to be approved by the  Chief  Justice  of
India.  However, since the Judiciary does not have sufficient machinery of its
own to check the antecedents and background of the candidate, Chief Justice of
the  High  Court  and  the  Chief Justice of India may not be in a position to
express any opinion about the character  and  antecedents  of  the  candidate.
But,  the  Government,  with its powerful machinery, can check the antecedents
and background of the candidate and give its opinion on that aspect.
</p>
<p id="p_27">                20.  When a recommendation of the  Chief  Justice  of  a  High
Court  comes to the Chief Justice of India with all particulars, including the
background of such candidate, the Chief Justice of India will be in  a  better
position,  on  examination of all the materials placed before him, to evaluate
the fitness of the candidate.  Therefore, in all circumstances, the opinion of
the Chief Justice of India is entitled to have the right  of  primacy  in  the
matter of selection of Judges to the High Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                21.   In  matters relating to the appointment of Judges to the
High Court, the Chief Justice of India is expected to take  into  account  the
view  of  his colleagues in the Supreme Court, who are likely to be conversant
with the affairs of the High Court concerned.  The Chief Justice of India  may
also  ascertain the view of one or more Senior Judges of the High Court, whose
opinion, according to the Chief Justice of India, is likely to be  significant
in the formation of his opinion.  The opinion of the Chief Justice of the High
Court  would  be entitled to the greatest weight, and the opinion of the other
functionaries involved must be given due  weight,  in  the  formation  of  the
opinion of  the  Chief  Justice of India.  The Chief Justice of India, for the
formation of his opinion, has to adopt a course, which  would  enable  him  to
discharge  his duty objectively to select the best available persons as Judges
of the High Courts.  This ensures that the opinion of  the  Chief  Justice  of
India is not merely his individual opinion, but an opinion formed collectively
by a body of men at the apex level in the judiciary.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                22.    When   there   is   already   inbuilt  check  procedure
contemplated under <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_13">Article 217</a> and also the guidelines given  by  the  Supreme
Court  in  PRESIDENTIAL  REFERENCE,  reported in AIR 1999 SUPREME COURT 1, the         
approach of the  petitioner,  that  too  as  party-in-person,  seeking  for  a
direction  from  this Court to respondents 1 and 2 to follow the guidelines by
way of judicial review, is totally misconceived.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                23.  In this context, it would be worthwhile to refer  to  the
observations  regarding  the  judicial  review  made  by  the Supreme Court in
PRESIDENTIAL REFERENCE,reported in AIR 1999 SUPREME  COURT  1,  which  are  as          
follows :
</p>
<p id="p_31">        "Judicial  review  in  the  case  of  an appointment, or a recommended
appointment, to the Supreme Court or a High Court is, therefore  available  if
the  recommendation  concerned is not a decision of the Chief Justice of India
and his senior-most colleagues, which is  constitutionally  requisite.    They
number  four  in  the  case of a recommendation for appointment to the Supreme
Court and two in the case of a recommendation for appointment to a High Court.
Judicial review is also available if, in making the decision, the views of the
senior-most Supreme Court Judge, who comes from the High Court of the proposed  
appointee to the Supreme Court, have not been taken into account.   Similarly,
if, in connection with an appointment, or a recommended appointment, to a High
Court,  the views of the Chief Justice and senior Judges of the High court, as
aforestated, and of Supreme Court Judges knowledge about that High Court  have
not  been  sought  or  considered  by  the  Chief Justice of India and his two
senior-most puisne Judges, judicial review is available.  Judicial  review  is
also available, when the appointee is found to lack eligibility."
</p>
<p id="p_32">                24.   In view of the above observations, it is clear that this
Court can entertain the Writ Petition,  inasmuch  as  the  scope  of  judicial
review is  limited,  only  on  two grounds:  (i) want of consultation with the
named  Constitutional  functionaries,  and  (ii)  lack  of  any  condition  of
eligibility in  the  case  of  appointment.    That  means,  there cannot be a
judicial review on any other ground.
</p>

<p id="p_33">                25.  It is not the case of the  petitioner  that  any  one  of
these circumstances has arisen in this case.
</p>
<p id="p_34">                26.    As   pointed  out  by  the  learned  Advocate  General,
recommendations have been sent and they are yet to receive  the  attention  of
the Chief Justice of India and to go through the process, that is contemplated
in terms of the Constitution and the judgement of the Apex Court.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                27.   It  is  also  not  the  case  of the petitioner that the
persons, whose names are  stated  to  be  recommended  for  appointment,  lack
eligibility, as  prescribed  in  <a href="/doc/37564/" id="a_14">Article  217 (2)</a> of the Constitution.  On the
other hand, it is the contention of the petitioner, as  party-in-person,  that
even though the persons, whose names mentioned in the list which was sent, are
eligible  and  capable,  they should not be appointed, since they happen to be
the  relatives  of  the  Judges  or  closely  connected  with  the   political
activities.
</p>
<p id="p_36">                28.   This  submission  reflects  lack of understanding of the
provisions, contained in <a href="/doc/1682952/" id="a_15">Article 217</a> of the Constitution.  Though  suitability
is  a different matter, it can be decided by the Constitutional functionaries,
as per the judgment  of  the  Apex  Court,  in  the  cases  of  SUPREME  COURT
<a href="/doc/753224/" id="a_16">ADVOCATES-ON-RECORD ASSOCIATION  AND  ANOTHER  v.  UNION OF INDIA</a>, reported in              
AIR 1994 SUPREME COURT 268 and the PRESIDENTIAL  REFERENCE,  reported  in  AIR           
1999 SUPREME  COURT  1.   It is clearly held in those decisions that it is for
these Constitutional functionaries to decide as to whether the  person,  whose
name  has been recommended, is suitable or not for being appointed to the High
Court.  No person outside the group of Constitutional  functionaries  referred
to  into  the relevant Articles of the Constitution and in the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the cases referred to supra can claim any right to impose his
or her opinion  on  the  suitability  on  those,  who  are  charged  with  the
responsibility of considering the suitability of the candidate.
</p>
<p id="p_37">                29.   It  is clear beyond any doubt that no one has a right to
seek judicial review of the appointment process even  before  the  matter  has
reached  the  stage,  where  the  Hon'ble Chief Justice of India and the other
Hon'ble Judges of the Apex Court are required to consider  the  names  of  the
persons recommended  for  appointment.   The recommendations made by the Chief   
Justice of India, after due consultation with his  colleagues  and  the  Chief
Justice of the High Court, is to have primacy in the matter of final selection
and appointment of Judges of the High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_38">                30.   As  held  by  the  Apex Court, merit alone has to be the
predominant consideration in judging as to whether a person is  the  best  and
the  most  suitable for appointment as a Judge of the High Court, irrespective
of his caste, creed, colour, religion and political affiliations.
</p>
<p id="p_39">                31.  Therefore, we are not inclined to give any  direction  or
suggestion to any of the authorities, as suggested by the party-in-person.  On
the  other  hand,  we  deem it appropriate to suggest the petitioner, who is a
practising advocate in this Court, to concentrate more on practice in the High
Court, instead of filing this sort of  vexatious  petitions  and  wasting  the
Court's time.  In the light of what is stated above, it is not possible for us
to entertain this Writ Petition.
</p>
<p id="p_40">                32.   In  the  result,  we  dismiss this Writ Petition, at the
admission stage itself.      No   costs.      Consequently,   the    connected
W.P.M.P.No.2720 9 of 2005 is also dismissed.
