They also increased clean energy cess, Service Tax and also levy of

Swachh Bharat Cess as events of change in law.

any change in law after cut-off date (16.11.2007) amounts to change in

law; therefore, in terms of inclusive definition, it includes any notification,

order, circular etc. issued by an Indian Governmental Instrumentality. They

contend that accordingly the affected party (Appellants) have to be

compensated for such change in law events. The Revised Tariff Policy

issued by Ministry of Power dated 28.01.2016 acknowledges increase in

taxes and levies as change in law events and had to be allowed as pass-

through. They further contend that any increase in input cost or operating

cost which has occasioned specifically on account of change in law event,

the same deserves to be allowed.

over from UHV to GCV based pricing is merely a change in pricing

methodology and did not constitute a change in law. The CERC totally

ignored the introduction of change in pricing methodology by way of

gazette notification which falls within the definition of Law under Haryana

PPAs. The change in pricing regime has led to an increase in the base

price of Grade F coal from Rs.570 per tonne to Rs.660 per tonne thereby

leading to an increase in cost during the operating period. The CERC,

though allowed items like royalty and clean energy cess on coal on the

ground that these items have an impact on the cost of coal, but failed to

appreciate the change in law in pricing regime which has increased base

price. According to the Appellants, CERC was not justified in relying on

Clause 2.7.2.4 of RFP since it has no applicability to the present case.

Similarly, it misinterpreted the judgement of the Tribunal in Appeal No. 288

of 2013.    The Appellants further contend that they are not seeking

compensation for an increase in base price of fuel but seeking

compensation for increase in cost on account of change in law which has

led to increase in the cost of fuel.

surcharge, development surcharge and Service Tax, since these levies

and charges are issued through notification and rate circulars by Railway

Board which is an instrumentality of Union of India which functions under

the Ministry of Railways.        Therefore, it falls within the Governmental

Instrumentality in terms of PPA. The Appellants contend that CERC was

not justified in opining that Appellants were expected to take into account

the possible revision in these charges while quoting the bid. They contend

that this was totally uncalled for since they are not required to take into

account such factors while quoting the bid since such factors are subject

to change through Governmental Instrumentality on account of change in

law. They further contend that there is no specific trend in the increase in

either busy season surcharge or development surcharge.                   These two

charges were constant at the time of bidding and remained so for 4 to 5

years. Therefore, even on factual scenario, no developer can forecast the

increase in these charges subsequent to their bid in 2007.

railways was increased from time to time in terms of two different <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_7">Finance

the landed cost of coal which in turn lead to an increase in cost of

generation and supplying power to the DISCOMS. All these three events

are in pursuance of change in law.             Therefore, they are entitled for

that these charges were allowed by Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory

Commission as change in law events in Petition No. 163 of 2014. Based

on these submissions, they contend that CERC was wrong in holding that

Appellants were expected to take into account possible revision of these

charges while quoting the bid. Once conditions envisaged under <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_9">Article 13</a>

of PPA in question are fulfilled, automatically compensation has to be

allowed towards these change in law events.                 As a matter of fact

erred in holding that the increase in VAT as amended by Government of

Odisha by a notification dated 30.03.2012 does not constitute change in

law. The increase in VAT is in pursuance of notification dated 30.03.2012

issued by Government of Odisha which is an Indian Governmental

Instrumentality under Haryana PPAs.             This notification was effective

admittedly from 01.04.2012 which is subsequent to cut-off date; therefore,

they are entitled for the same. CERC went wrong by relying on its own

earlier order in Petition No. 6/MP/2013.            It proceeded wrong on the

premise that Para 2.7.2.4 of the RFP is applicable. They contend that

VAT is applicable on various components, i.e. ROM price of coal, royalty,

Central Excise Duty, Clean Energy Cess which themselves have

undergone changes several times subsequent to cut-off date. Increase in

VAT is not due to absolute increase in rate, but it could also be due to

increase on account of the above said components; therefore, Appellants

were required to take into account tax prevailing at the cut-off date and not

future assumptions since such assumption cannot be forecasted by any

bidder. VAT depends on Central Excise Duty, Royalty, and clean energy

cess which are allowed in the impugned order as change in law events.

MERC ought to have allowed this item - VAT as change in law event.


</p><p id="p_47">22.   In respect of Increase in costs on account of change in water

charges, according to the Appellants, CERC erred in disallowing the claim

of the Appellant on account of increase in water charges in pursuance of

amendments to Orissa Irrigation Rules which comes within the ambit of

law under Haryana PPAs. Government of Orissa is an Indian

Governmental Instrumentality; therefore, as water charges from time to

time came to be increased subsequent to cut-off date have to be allowed,

since it has revenue burden on the generation of power. CERC, according

to the Appellants, went wrong in opining that Appellants were expected to

take into account possible escalation of charges at the time of quoting the

tariff. According to Appellants, the increase in water charges is tenfold

since it has increased from Rs. 0.44 per cusec in 2007 to Rs.4.5 per cusec

in 2010.    No bidder can practically envisage such sudden and abrupt

increase in water charges. Once the conditions envisaged in PPA are

fulfilled, the Appellants are bound to get compensation on such events.

Therefore, they content that they are entitled for compensation on this

count as well.

carrying cost. According to the Appellants, CERC went wrong in opining

that there is no concept of return on equity or interest on working capital in

competitive bid process since bidders are required to quote all inclusive

tariff. The Appellants contend that though there is no return on equity

concept in competitive bid tariff, but the increase in cost due to change in

law event which have indirect bearing on them, have to be considered.

According to the Appellants, the interest on incremental working capital at

normative interest rate has to be allowed to put the Appellants to the same

economic position as if change in law has not occurred. They further

contend that in terms of <a href="/doc/772605/" id="a_13">Article 13.2</a> of PPA, restoring the affected party to

the same economic position means it is not just a simple correlation of

increased expenditure and a corresponding compensation; but also means

the loss caused to the Appellant on account of time gap between payment

(working capital) by the generating company till recovery of deployed

additional funds. Since it has a cost attached to it, restoration to the same

economic position would take into such time gap between the time money

is spent and the time money is recovered. They have relied upon the

counter affidavit contending that the present Appeal is devoid of merits and

deserves to be dismissed.            According to these Respondents, the

impugned order of CERC is based on cogent reasons in support of its

conclusions; therefore, no interference is called for. According to them, it

had invited Case-1 bid where the Appellants through PTC were the

successful bidders. The essence of Case-1 bidding is that the bidder has

to quote tariff including all factors; therefore, Appellant ought to have

factored all the issues at the time of Case-1 bidding participation and is not

permitted to seek any revision on any of the ground now raised. They

further contend that it is the duty of the project developer to take care of all

the issues and the procurers are only required to pay the agreed tariff

towards power received by them, since the project was conceived based

on domestic coal and the imported coal was never the basis for the project

and any increase in cost on account of imported coal cannot be fastened

to the procurers. In terms of Para 2.7.2.1 of RFP issued by HPGCL, the

bidders were required to quote tariffs under Stream-1 and Stream-2 while

submitting their financial bid. They were required to quote a fixed tariff

under Stream-1 for both capacity charge and energy charge. They were

required to quote firm Capacity Charge or a combination of escalable and

non-escalable capacity charges under Stream-2 in terms of the PPA.

SCCL in this regard. Therefore, the pricing of coal was fully de-regulated

by a notification dated 01.01.2000 in supersession of 1945 Colliery Control

      speaks of inter-State transmission and inter-State operations. This is to be
      contrasted with Section 86 which deals with functions of the State
      Commission which uses the expression "within the State" in sub-clauses (a),
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_29">      (b), and (d), and "intra-state" in sub-clause (c). This being the case, it is
      clear that the PPA, which deals with generation and supply of electricity, will
      either have to be governed by the State Commission or the Central
      Commission. The State Commission's jurisdiction is only where generation
      and supply takes place within the State. On the other hand, the moment
      generation and sale takes place in more than one State, the Central
      Commission becomes the appropriate Commission under the Act. What is
      important to remember is that if we were to accept the argument on behalf of
      the appellant, and we were to hold in the Adani case that there is no
      composite scheme for generation and sale, as argued by the appellant, it
      would be clear that neither Commission would have jurisdiction, something
      which would lead to absurdity. Since generation and sale of electricity is in
      more than one State obviously Section 86 does not get attracted. This being
      the case, we are constrained to observe that the expression "composite
      scheme" does not mean anything more than a scheme for generation and
      sale of electricity in more than one State.

         The aforesaid dictionary definitions lead to the conclusion that the
         expression "composite" only means "consisting of at least two elements".
         In the context of the present case, generation and sale being in more
         than one State, this could be referred to as "composite".

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">            26.    Even otherwise, the expression used in Section 79(1)(b) is that
         generating companies must enter into or otherwise have a "composite
         scheme". This makes it clear that the expression "composite scheme"
         does not have some special meaning - it is enough that generating
         companies have, in any manner, a scheme for generation and sale of
         electricity which must be in more than one State.

         <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_33">Section 79(1)</a> (b) cannot be doubted and, according to us, correctly
         brings out the meaning of this expression as meaning nothing more than
         a scheme by a generating company for generation and sale of electricity
         in more than one State. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_34">Section 64(5)</a> has been relied upon by the
         Appellant as an indicator that the State Commission has jurisdiction even
         in cases where tariff for inter-State supply is involved. This provision
         begins with a non-obstante clause which would indicate that in all cases
         involving inter-State supply, transmission, or wheeling of electricity, the
         Central Commission alone has jurisdiction. In fact this further supports
         the case of the Respondents. <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_35">Section 64(5)</a> can only apply if, the
         jurisdiction otherwise being with the Central Commission alone, by
         application of the parties concerned, jurisdiction is to be given to the
         State Commission having jurisdiction in respect of the licensee who
         intends to distribute and make payment for electricity. We, therefore, hold
         that the Central Commission had the necessary jurisdiction to embark
         upon the issues raised in the present cases."

                                                   Judgment in Appeal No. 195 of 2016




</p><p id="p_104">44.   According to them, since the notification issued by Government of

India through Coal India Limited and its subsidiaries is nothing but change

in law, therefore, the pricing methodology of coal has an impact on the

cost of fuel; hence, it has to be taken into consideration. The reliance of

CERC on Clause 2.7.2.4 of RFP is totally incorrect and it has wrongly

placed reliance on the judgment of this Tribunal on 12.09.2014 in Appeal

No. 288 of 2013 titled <a href="/doc/159150243/" id="a_44">Wardha Power Company Ltd. v. Reliance

Infrastructure Limited &amp; Anr. The Appellants</a> contend that the primary

issue in that case was "whether the State Commission was incorrect to link

the computation of compensation payable to the Appellant under Change

in Law provisions of the PPA with the base used in the bid i.e. energy

charges quoted to the bid by the Appellant?" The said findings have no

relevance to the present case since GKEL is not seeking compensation for

an increase in base price of fuel, but it is seeking compensation on

account of change in law which has led to increase in cost of fuel.



</p><p id="p_105">45.   The Appellants also placed reliance on Adani judgment and GMR

Warora's case quoted above for allowing compensation towards increase

in busy season surcharge, development surcharge and imposition of

Service Tax. According to them, these charges have to be allowed since

the Tribunal has already opined so in the case of the above generators.

</p><p id="p_106">46.   They contend that change in VAT rate was also held to be change in

law event in the Sasan Power judgment quoted above. Therefore, the

increase in VAT was not just due to absolute increase in rate, but was also

increase on account of various components like price of coal, royalty,

Central Excise duty, clean energy cess etc., and the same has to be

allowed if the increase in VAT is after cut-off date which is in this case

also, since it amounts to change in law.
</p>
<p id="p_107">
</p><p id="p_108">47.   Coming to water charges, the Appellants contend that since it is

introduced by the Government of Orissa which is also an Indian

Governmental Instrumentality, and if the amendments are after cut-off date

resulting in increase in cost, the same has to be allowed as change in law,

rejecting the opinion of CERC that it is an input cost in terms of 2.7.2.4.


</p><p id="p_109">48.   Similarly, they contend that MAT rate has to be allowed as change in

law based on the judgment of Sasan Power, <a href="/doc/1010805/" id="a_45">Article 13.1.1</a>, also relevant

paragraph, i.e. Para 50 in the case of <a href="/doc/29719380/" id="a_46">Energy Watchdog vs. Central

Jaiprakash Hydro Power referred to above in Appeal No. 39 of 2010.

Appellants contend that no finding on the issue of carrying cost was given

carrying cost on change in law events.              To substantiate the above

contention, they placed reliance on the judgment of the Tribunal dated

13.04.2018 in Appeal No. 210 of 2017 titled <a href="/doc/46401114/" id="a_47">Adani Power Ltd. vs CERC

&amp; Ors</a>. wherein this Tribunal recognised concept of restitution and allowed

carrying costs in respect of the allowed change in law events. With these

arguments, they sought for allowing the Appeal as prayed for.

the Commission was justified in rejecting the compensation towards -

The Commission also contends that compensation for increase in costs

claimed for the first time. Therefore, the Appellants are not entitled for the

said amount.

and PPA. They further pressed upon the fact that since bidders were

required to quote tariff for both Stream-1 and Stream-2 while submitting

financial bid keeping in mind they were required to quote a fixed tariff for

both the capacity and energy charge during the term of PPA.                      The

transmission charge of the intervening CTU network up to the delivery

point was not part of capacity or energy charges; therefore, it had to be

quoted separately. In terms of RFP, the bidder was required to indicate

the progress/proof in support of fuel arrangement. <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_48">Article 13</a> of PPA refers

to change in law and how the application and principles would apply for

computing compensation on account of change in law events during the

operating period of the project. Several other requirements like notification

of change in law, tariff adjustment payment on account of change in law

were also part of this PPA at <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_49">Article 13.</a> The Respondents 2 to 4 further

place reliance on the judgment of this Tribunal dated 23.03.2015 in Appeal

No. 90 of 2014 (SPL v CERC) referring to Para 43 to contend that change

in law in price of diesel did not amount to change in law; therefore,

contend that it squarely applies to the present case.

in busy season surcharge and development surcharge, they contend that

judgment in Sasan Power applies since the tariff quoted by the Appellant

was through bidding process. They reiterate their contentions raised in the

objections with regard to increase in water charges contending that the

charges of increase in water charges by Government of Orissa cannot be

considered as a change in law event, since it was a period phenomena

and the said change was in terms of Odisha Irrigation Act, 1959 and the

Appellant has not chosen to quote any escalable element in tariff to take

care of such revision. With these submissions, they seek for dismissal of

            According to the above judgement the executive instructions
            issued on a missing field under statue will have force of law.
            APRL, on the issue of interpretation of contract has relied on
            the judgements of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of <a href="/doc/1900915/" id="a_69">United

            We have carefully gone through the said judgements and
            find that the Hon'ble Court has held that the terms of the
            contract have to be strictly read and natural meaning is to be
            given to it. Hon'ble Court has further held that outside aid in a
            contract can only be sought only when the meaning is
            ambiguous. In the present case too while interpreting the
            PPA we cannot artificially divide the circulars, notifications,
            rules etc. issued by Indian Government Instrumentality as
            issued under sovereign functions/ non-sovereign function of
            the Government.

              be factored in by APRL at the time of bidding. Accordingly
              any change in such surcharges/levy of new surcharge was to

opinion that increase in development surcharge as well as busy season

surcharge amount to change in law events for the following reasons:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">      (a)   The increase in Development Surcharge and Busy Season

            Surcharge was pursuant to Rate Circular Notifications

            issued under the <a href="/doc/1022405/" id="a_71">Railways Act</a>, 1989 which fall within the

            Instrumentality.

            generating and supplying power to the Haryana Discoms.

accept the contention of the Appellant that the fact that the busy

season surcharge or development surcharge was constant at the

time of the bid date which was 2% till 2010 and thereafter it was

increased to 5%.       Therefore, the Appellants are justified in saying

that it was not possible to forecast the increase in these charges so

</p><p id="p_160">61.   In the light of the above discussion and reasoning, we are of

the opinion that the Appellants are entitled for these three items, i.e.

compensation claimed towards increase in transportation of goods by

railways due to increase in busy season surcharge and development

surcharge, and Service Tax.

<p id="p_161">
</p><p id="p_162">62. Then coming to VAT as change in law event, according to the

Appellant-generator, the rate of VAT which was 4% got increased to 5%

from 30.03.2012.      This notification being issued by the Government of

Orissa, the same has to be considered as a notification issued by the

Indian   Governmental       Instrumentality     in     terms     of   Haryana      PPA.

Apparently, the notification resulting in increase in VAT rate subsequent to

cut-off date resulted in increase in cost during operating period. In several

judgments of this Tribunal viz., <a href="/doc/168827139/" id="a_78">M/s Wardha Power Company Limited vs.

Reliance Infrastructure Limited (Appeal No</a>. 288 of 2013, dated

Regulatory Commission (Appeal No</a>. 161 of 2015 dated 19.04.2017)

VAT came to be considered as change in law event. It is also seen that

VAT is applicable on various components of ROM price of Coal, Royalty,

Central Excise Duty, Clean Energy Cess, which themselves have

undergone change several times after the cut-off date.                 Therefore, the

increase in VAT rate is not just due to absolute increase in rate from 4%

to 5% but also due to increase on the above items due to change in law.

VAT depends on the Central Excise Duty, Royalty and Clean Energy

Cess.         Similarly, in terms of revised tariff policy issued by Ministry of

Power, change in taxes, duties and levies after the cut-off date have to be

recognised as change in law events thereby they have to be allowed as a

pass through. In the light of the above discussion, we are of the opinion

that the Appellants are entitled for compensation due to change in law i.e.,

enhancement of rate of VAT subsequent to cut-off date.

carrying cost, Appellants have sought for interest on working capital and

       no such contention was raised before the High Court. There has to be
       some sanctity and finality attached to the decision of the arbitrator and new

</p><p id="p_184">64.   In the case of Adani Power Limited's case (Appeal No. 210 of

2017 dated 13.04.2018) this Tribunal recognised the concept of restitution

by placing the parties to the same economic position. On that concept

carrying cost came to be allowed in respect of change in law events. Of

course, the carrying cost has to be on actual after ascertainment of actual

amount but carrying cost is payable from the date of occurrence of the

expenditure. Sub-para Nos. (Ix) and (x) of the said Judgment at Page

            Commission for approval of the Change in Law and its
            consequences. There is always time lag between the happening of
            Change in Law event till its approval by the Central Commission and
            this time lag may be substantial. As pointed out by the Central
            Commission that the Appellant is only eligible for surcharge if the
            payment is not made in time by the Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 after
            raising of the supplementary bill arising out of approved Change in
            Law event and in PPA there is no compensation mechanism for
            payment of interest or carrying cost for the period from when
            Change in Law becomes operational till the date of its approval by
            the Central Commission. We also observe that this Tribunal in SLS
            case after considering time value of the money has held that in case
            of re-determination of tariff the interest by a way of compensation is
            payable for the period for which tariff is re-determined till the date of
            such re-determination of the tariff. In the present case after perusal
            of the PPAs we find that the impact of Change in Law event is to be
            passed on to the Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 by way of tariff adjustment
            payment as per <a href="/doc/430906/" id="a_86">Article 13.4</a> of the PPA. The relevant extract is

            determination of the existing tariff.

            the same economic position as if Change in Law has not occurred is
            in consonance with the principle of 'restitution' i.e. restoration of
            some specific thing to its rightful status. Hence, in view of the
            provisions of the PPA, the principle of restitution and judgement of
            the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Indian Council for <a href="/doc/1356184/" id="a_90">Enviro-
            Legal Action vs. Union of India &amp;Ors</a>., we are of the considered
            opinion that the Appellant is eligible for Carrying Cost arising out of
            approval of the Change in Law events from the effective date of
            Change in Law till the approval of the said event by appropriate
            authority. It is also observed that the Gujarat Bid-01 PPA have no
            provision for restoration to the same economic position as if Change
            in Law has not occurred. Accordingly, this decision of allowing

that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the Appellant is not

entitled for any compensation towards increase in water chares. It is an

admitted fact that price on water charges if not envisaged in the PPA and

depending upon whether in any particular case bidder has quoted the

energy charges in escalable or non-escalable components considering the

market risks, the same price, if found in the escalation rate index published

on half yearly basis by the Central Commission, one can seek such

increase in water charges, since bidder is entitled to quote only escalable

energy charges or only non-escalable energy charges or combination of

both. In that view of the matter, we are of the opinion that there cannot be

any compensation on this count.

                           of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_106">Electricity Act</a>, 2003, one of the components
                           specifically allowed as tariff is tax on income. The pass
                           through of minimum alternate tax or income tax in
                           case of tariff determination under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_107">section 62</a> is by
                           virtue of the specific provision in the Tariff Regulations
                           which require the beneficiaries to bear the tax on the
                           income at the hand of the generating company from
                           the core business of generation and supply of
                           electricity. Such a provision is distinctly absent in case
                           of tariff discovered through competitive bidding where
                           the bidder is required to quote an all-inclusive tariff
                           including the statutory taxes and cesses. Thus, the
                           change in rate of income tax or minimum alternate tax
                           cannot be construed as "Change in Law" for the

         xxv.    GWEL has relied on the judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
                 the JK Industries Case on this issue. We have gone through the
                 said judgement and we find that the issue in the said judgement
                 and the issue in hand are different and hence in view of facts
                 and circumstances of the present case the said judgement is not
                 applicable to the present case.

                 2010 (JP Judgement) wherein reimbursement of MAT was
                 allowed on account of Change in Law. The order dated
                 20.04.2015 in Petition 163 of 2014 of MERC is also relied for
                 allowing increase in MAT Rate as a Change in Law. We have
                 gone through the JPJudgement of this Tribunal and we find that
                 there was a specific provision in the PPA in the said case for
                 payment of tax on income by the Himachal Pradesh Electricity
                 Board based on which the change in MAT rate was allowed by
                 this Tribunal. In the present case there is no such provision in
                 the PPA for allowing payment of tax on income by the Procurer.
                 Hence, the said judgement is not applicable to the present case.
                 Accordingly, the reliance on the JPJudgement and the order of
                 the MERC which is based on the JPJudgement and other
                 judgements of this Tribunal is misplaced. The other two
                 judgements of this Tribunal quoted by MERC in the said order
                 has no relevance to the present case as they are not related to
                 bidding under <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_110">Section 63</a> of the Act. Reliance of GWEL on new
                 tariff policy which was issued in 2016 is also misplaced as the
                 bidding was conducted based on the earlier tariff policy issued
                 by GoI.

                          hard coke and D grade of non-coking coal with effect
                          from12.3.97. The Government also decided to allow
                          CIL and SCCL to fix prices of E, F and G grades of
                          non-coking coal once in every six months by updating
                          the cost indices as per the escalation formula contained
                          in the 1987 report of the BICP and on 13.3.1997,
                          necessary instructions were issued to CIL and SCCL in
                          this regard. The pricing of coal was fully deregulated
                          after the Colliery Control Order, 2000 notified on
                          1.1.2000 in supersession of the Colliery Control Order,
                          1945. Under the Colliery Control Order, 2000 the
                          Central Government has no power to fix the prices of
                          coal. Therefore, the prices of coal from CIL and its
                          subsidiaries were market based. Only the pricing
                          methodology was UHV basis at the time of bid
                          submission which was switched over to GCV based

                          dated 30.12.2011. In our view, any decision affecting
                          the price of inputs for generating electricity including
                          coal cannot be covered under Change in Law except

                   eligible for compensation due to change in base price of coal as it
                   has already inbuilt in its bid the perceived risks. We also observe
                   that GWEL has quoted only the escalable energy charges and
                   would have been adequately compensated for such change in
                   pricing mechanism. The Central Commission has also observed
                   that GWEL has also not quantified the claim in its petition before
                   the Central Commission due to such change in pricing
                   mechanism.

         xxi.      This Tribunal in the judgment dated 12.9.2014 in Appeal No. 288
                   of 2013 has clearly concluded that as per the provisions of the
                   said PPA, there is no co-relation of the base price of electricity
                   quoted by the Seller and computation of compensation as a
                   consequence of Change in Law. The compensation is only with
                   respect to the increase/decrease of revenue/expenses of the
                   Seller following the Change in Law. The same view has been
                   reiterated by this Tribunal in the Sasan Judgement. The
                   provisions in the PPA in the instant case are similar to that dealt
                   by this Tribunal in Appeal No. 288 of 2013 on issue of base price
                   of coal.

<p id="p_219">
         xxii.     In view of the above, we are of the opinion that there is no legal
                   infirmity in the order of the Central Commission on this issue.



                Accordingly, this issue is answered against GWEL."



      In the light of above opinion of the Tribunal in the other appeals on

this issue, we decline to interfere with the opinion of Commission.
