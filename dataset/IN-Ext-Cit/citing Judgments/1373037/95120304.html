<p id="p_1">                 (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD)

5   06-08-2018                 The present Letters Patent Appeal has been preferred

                  for setting aside the judgment dated 02.05.2018 passed by

                  learned Single Judge of this Court in Civil Writ Jurisdiction

                  Case No. 8198 of 2017.
</p>
<p id="p_2">                              By the impugned order the learned Single Judge has

                  been pleased to set aside the order dated 29.09.2016 passed by

                  learned Munsif, Hilsa, Nalanda in Election Case No. 3 of 2016

                  by which he had permitted the Election Petitioner (respondent

                  no. 7 in the writ petition and appellant in the present appeal) to

         amend the election petition by adding necessary parties. The

         petitioner before the learned Single Judge had also prayed for

         quashing of the order dated 04.04.2017 passed in the said

         Election Case by which the learned Munsif had rejected the

         petition dated 25.01.2017 filed by the writ petitioner raising

         objection by the petitioner against the maintainability of the

         election petition.
</p>
<p id="p_3">                      At the outset, Mr. Amit Srivastava, learned counsel

         representing        the State Election Commission has taken a

         preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the Letters

         Patent Appeal under Clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the Patna

         High Court. Mr. Srivastava submits that in view of the judgment

         of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1373037/" id="a_1">M/s M.M.T.C.

         Limited v. Commissioner of Commercial Tax &amp; Ors</a>. reported

         in AIR 2009 SC 1349 and in the case of M/s Lokmat

         Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Shankarprasad reported in AIR

         1999 SC 2423, the Letters Patent Appeal cannot be maintained.

         It is submitted that in the present case the learned Single Judge

         of the High Court while considering the petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article

         226</a> or 227 has exercised his jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a> only.

         Learned counsel submits that since in the present case the

         learned Single Judge has exercised only a supervisory

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                             3/5</span>




         jurisdiction as after finding that the learned Munsif had passed

         the impugned order in violation of legal provision on the

         subject, the learned Single Judge has issued a writ of Certiorari

         and while setting aside the impugned orders the matter has been

         remanded to the learned Munsif Court for examining the whole

         matter afresh and pass necessary orders in accordance with law

         in the light of the observations made by the learned Single

         Judge in the preceding paragraph of the judgment under appeal.

</p><p id="p_4">                      On the other hand, learned counsel representing the

         appellants submits that the learned Writ Court could not

         appreciate that amendment petition was allowed no doubt after

         the prescribed statutory period of 30 days but it was with

         consent of other side and no objection was raised at the time

         when the learned Munsif passed the impugned order.

</p><p id="p_5">                      We have gone through the impugned judgment under

         appeal. It appears that the learned Single Judge was hearing the

         writ petition against the orders passed by the learned Munsif in

         the Election Suit. Challenge to the order of the learned Munsif

         was made in the light of Section 137 (3) of the Bihar Panchayat

         Raj Act, 2006 (in short hereinafter referred to as the Act) and

         Bihar Panchayat Election Rules, 2006 (in short hereinafter

         referred to as the Rules). It was the grievance of the writ
 Patna High Court LPA No.875 of 2018(5) dt.06-08-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                             4/5</span>




         petitioner that the learned Munsif had allowed the amendment

         after the application was filed seeking such amendment to add

         certain parties as opposite party in the case after a period of 30

         days a statutory period prescribed under the Act read with the

         Rules. It was submitted before the learned Writ Court that there

         are judgments in the case of Anil Kumar Jha Vs. State of

         Bihar reported in 2010 (4) PLJR 475 and Kameshwar Singh

         vs. Surya Narain Rai and Ors. reported in 2009 (4) PLJR 722

         in which the statutory period prescribed under the Act read with

         the Rules has been found to be mandatory and it has been held

         that the Election Petitioner ought to have impleaded necessary

         parties within a period of 30 days from the declaration of the

         result of the Election and in any case no application for

         amendment of parties after the mandatory period of 30 days can

         be entertained by the Election Tribunal. The learned Writ Court

         has by placing reliance on the judgments on the subject allowed

         the writ application by quashing the impugned order.

</p><p id="p_6">                      In our opinion, by quashing the impugned orders

         passed by the learned Munsif and directing him to consider the

         matter afresh in the light of the observations made in the

         judgment, the learned Single Judge has only exercised his

         supervisory jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
          Patna High Court LPA No.875 of 2018(5) dt.06-08-2018
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                      5/5</span>




                  India and therefore, in view of the judgments of the Hon'ble

                  Supreme Court referred hereinabove this Letters Patent Appeal

                  cannot be said to be arising out of an original proceeding under

                  <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. It has been held by the

                  judicial pronouncement that <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_6">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of

                  India is a remedy of Intra Court Appeal, in our opinion this

                  remedy is not available in the present case where the learned

                  Single Judge has exercised it's supervisory jurisdiction. The

                  Letters Patent Appeal is thus, not maintainable and dismissed in

                  limine.
