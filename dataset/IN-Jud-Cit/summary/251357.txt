in India, which is registered since 1975 and has been in use for over 75 years in India.

Issue: Whether plaintiffs' registered mark/expression is valid and whether defendant has violated plaintiffs' statutory and common law rights.
Decision: The Court dismissed the application of the plaintiffs and held that the prayers sought for cannot be granted.
A registered mark is not infringed if its use is made to indicate the characteristics of the goods under Section 30(2)(a) of the TM Act, 1999.
Descriptive words and expressions are registerable and can be used as trade marks.
A descriptive mark can acquire distinctiveness, but to succeed in such a case, the plaintiff must demonstrate more than simply the sole use of the descriptive term.
The defendant is not using the impugned mark as a trade mark but as a ?descriptor?
to profess the characteristics of the goods manufactured by it.
Plaintiffs' registered mark is prima facie suspect as the word(s) which form a part of the plaintiffs' registered mark are an intrinsic part of the ?current language?
commonly used in trade.
The use of the impugned mark/expression by the defendant is not dishonest and falls within the provisions of Sections 30(2)(a) and 35 of the TM Act, 1999.
