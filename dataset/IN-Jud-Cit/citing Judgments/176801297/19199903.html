passing of the interim order by this Court, on 29th August, 2022, the
defendant had written emails to its various offices all over India to
discontinue selling books bearing the mark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot;.
</p><p id="p_6">4.    I have heard the counsels for the parties.
</p><p id="p_7">5.    It is an admitted position that as on date, there is no violation of the
interim order dated 23rd August, 2022. Yet, on the basis of the material on
record, it cannot be denied that there was delay on the part of the defendant
in communicating to the various third-party websites where the books of the
defendant were sold, to discontinue selling books under the mark
&quot;VIBGYOR&quot;. However, during the course of the hearing on 2nd March,
2023, submission of the counsel for the defendant was recorded that the
defendant is willing to file an unconditional apology. Affidavits have been
filed on behalf of two of the directors as well as the authorized
representative of the defendant, tendering an unconditional and unqualified
apology to the Court and undertaking not to indulge in any activity that may
amount to breach of the orders passed by the Court.
</p><p id="p_8">6.    In the facts and circumstances of the case, the aforesaid apology is
found satisfactory and is therefore, accepted by the Court.

</pre><p id="p_27">SUBMISSIONS ADVANCED ON BEHALF OF THE PARTIES

</p><p id="p_28">13.   Counsel for the plaintiff made the following submissions:
13.1. The earlier registration of the plaintiff in class 16, of the device mark
      using the word &quot;VIBGYOR&quot;, dates back to 18th July, 2006. In the
      LPC dated 1st July, 2022 filed by the plaintiff, under &#x27;history data&#x27;, it
      has been noted that the mark was originally registered in the name of
      Kare Edumin and subsequently, the plaintiff company was recorded
      as the proprietor of the said mark in 2018.
</p><p id="p_29">13.2. There is no registration granted in favour of the defendant for any of
      the device marks with the word &quot;VIBGYOR&quot;.
</p><p id="p_30">13.3. No details have been given by the defendant with regard to use of the
      aforesaid trademark, nor have any documents been filed in this regard.
13.4. In the notice of opposition filed by the defendant against the
      trademark application filed by the plaintiff, it has falsely been stated
      that the trademark &quot;VIBGYOR (LOGO)&quot; is registered in the name of
      the defendant.
</p><p id="p_31">13.5. In the Notice of Opposition, the defendant has stated that the plaintiff
      is using the trademark &quot;VIBGYOR RISE (LABEL)&quot; in relation to
      allied goods. Therefore, now, the defendant cannot contend that the
      goods of the defendant and the plaintiff are not similar as this would
      amount to approbation and reprobation.
</p><p id="p_32">14.   Per contra, the counsel for the defendant made the following
submissions:
</p><p id="p_33">14.1. Defendant has been in the business of selling books using the
      trademark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; since the year 2013.</p><pre id="pre_5">

</pre><p id="p_34">14.2. The user of the plaintiff is only from the year 2018 and the plaintiff
      cannot claim the benefit of the prior user by Kare Edumin.
14.3. The products of the defendant, in respect of which it uses the
      trademark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot;, is different from that of the plaintiff. The
      plaintiff only has a registration of the word mark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot;                        in
      class 41 and on the basis of the aforesaid registration, the plaintiff
      cannot attempt to restrain the defendant from using the mark
      &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; in respect of its books in class 16.
</p>
<p id="p_35">ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

</p><p id="p_36">15.   Plaintiff has a total of 28 registrations in class 16 with the word
&quot;VIBGYOR&quot;. The earliest registration of the device mark of the plaintiff
with the word &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; in class 16 is of 18th July, 2006. The plaintiff is
also the registered proprietor of the word mark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; in Class 41
with effect from 16th January, 2012. Counsel for the plaintiff has pointed out
that in the Notice of Opposition filed by the defendant against the trademark
registration application of the plaintiff under class 41, it has falsely been
stated that the trademark &quot;VIBGYOR (LOGO)&quot; is registered in the name of
the defendant. This submission has not been controverted by the counsel for
the defendant. It is also clear from the record that there is no registration in
favour of the defendant of the mark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot;. Therefore, the aforesaid
assertion of the defendant appears to be false.
</p><p id="p_37">16.   It is not in dispute that the word mark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; has been
registered in favour of the plaintiff in class 41 since 16th January, 2012. Even
in respect of the device marks, the prominent feature of the marks of
plaintiff and defendant is the word &quot;VIBGYOR&quot;. Therefore, there is a

deceptive similarity between the mark used by the defendant with the
registered mark of the plaintiff. In all the notices of opposition filed on
behalf of the defendant to the trademark registration application of the
plaintiff in respect of the label mark with the word &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; the
defendant has stated that the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark &quot;VIBGYOR RISE
(LABEL)&quot; is a mere copy of the defendant&#x27;s trademark and has therefore,
admitted to the similarity between the competing marks. The fact that the
defendant itself has applied for registration of a device mark with the word
&quot;VIBGYOR&quot; also demolishes the submission of the defendant that the mark
&quot;VIBGYOR&quot; is a generic word and that the plaintiff cannot claim exclusive
right in the same.
</p><p id="p_38">17.   The counsel for the defendant also contended that the products of the
defendant for which the defendant uses the trademark &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; are
different from those of the plaintiff. In this regard, attention of the Court has
been drawn to the Notice of Opposition filed by the defendant (page 506 of
the documents filed by the plaintiff), the relevant extracts of which are given
below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      &quot;2. The Opponent has adopted the trademark VIBGYOR
      (LOGO) in the year 2013 in Hindi and English both and is still
      stands registered, the trademarks to differentiate its products from

      applied for is in respect of the allied same goods for which the
      Opponent is having Proprietary right. The trademark applied for
      is prohibited from being registered under the Act, the mark being
      deceptive. The Applicant&#x27;s mark should not be allowed to be
      registered as it will create confusion in the market of educational
      field.&quot;

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">18.   Similar stand has also been taken in the notice of opposition filed at
page 522 of the documents of the plaintiff.
</blockquote><p id="p_39">19.   It has clearly been admitted by the defendant that goods of the
plaintiff and the defendant are allied goods. Therefore, now the defendant
cannot be allowed to take a contrary stand to the effect that the goods of the
plaintiff and the defendant are different. The defendant cannot be permitted
to approbate and reprobate.
</p><p id="p_40">20.   Counsel for the plaintiff has correctly placed reliance on the judgment
of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/176801297/" id="a_1">Anchor Health and Beauty Care
Pvt. Ltd. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Manufacturing (Tianjin) Co. Ltd. and Ors</a>.,
MANU/DE/1156/2014, wherein it was held that where the defendants
themselves have applied for registration of a mark, they cannot take a
contrary stand that the aforesaid mark is descriptive. The defendant cannot
be permitted to approbate and reprobate. In the present case also, once the
defendant in the Notice of Opposition has taken a stand that the goods of the
plaintiff and defendant are similar or allied, they cannot now be permitted to
take a stand that the goods of the plaintiff and the defendant are different.
</p><p id="p_41">21.   Counsel for the defendant has relied upon the judgement of the
Supreme Court of India in <a href="/doc/3173546/" id="a_2">Nandhini Deluxe v. Karnataka Co-Operative
Milk Producers Federation Ltd</a>., MANU/SC/0779/2018, in support of his
contention that the &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; mark is being used in relation to different
products. However, this judgement would not come to the aid of the
defendant in view of the stand taken by the defendant that the goods of the
plaintiff and the defendant are similar and allied. Further, in the present case,
there is a similarity between the goods/services of the plaintiff and the
defendant, inasmuch as the plaintiff uses the aforesaid mark in relation to

education and educational services, including books to be used in the
schools, whereas the defendant uses it in relation to books in the field of
education. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is no similarity between the
two.
</p><p id="p_42">22.    It has been further contended on behalf of the defendant that the
plaintiff has not filed proof of user of the aforesaid trademark in support of
books. Even if that be so, the remedy of the defendant would be to seek
rectification of the mark on the ground of non-user. Reference in this regard
may be made to the judgment of a Coordinate Bench of this Court in
<a href="/doc/181476656/" id="a_3">Vintage        Distillers   Limited    v.    Ramesh        Chand              Parekh</a>,
MANU/DE/4587/2022, wherein it was held that a plaintiff, being the
registered proprietor of the mark, had an exclusive right to use the same and
the right to sue for infringement was not dependent on the use of the mark
by such registered proprietor.
</p><p id="p_43">23.    Though the defendant claims to be using the &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; mark since
the year 2013, no details have been given by the defendant with regard to the
use of the aforesaid mark. It may be relevant here to mention that no
documents have been filed on behalf of the defendant in support of this
assertion.
</p><p id="p_44">24.    The contention of the defendant that the plaintiff cannot claim benefit
of prior user by the predecessor of the plaintiff, is completely misplaced. In
this regard, reference may be made to relevant portion of the &#x27;history data&#x27;
of the LPC dated 31st October, 2022 for the Trademark No.2266974, which

<p id="p_45">25.    A perusal of the LPC dated 31st October, 2022 issued in favour of the
plaintiff shows that the mark was initially registered in favour of the
predecessor of the plaintiff, Kare Edumin, which had been using the mark
&quot;VIBGYOR&quot; in relation to its services since the year 2006. In terms of the
scheme of amalgamation approved by the NCLT on 27th April, 2017,
various properties/assets, including trademarks of Kare Edumin were
transferred to the plaintiff. Taking into account the aforesaid, the Registrar
has recorded the plaintiff as the proprietor of the &quot;VIBGYOR&quot; mark with
effect from 16th January, 2012. Therefore, there is no merit in the submission
of the defendant that the plaintiff cannot claim the benefit of prior user.
</p><p id="p_46">26.    In view of the findings above, a prima facie case is made out on
behalf of the plaintiff. The balance of convenience is in favour of the
plaintiff and against the defendant. Irreparable injury would be caused to the
plaintiff if the defendant is allowed to use the impugned mark.

23rd August, 2022 granting interim injunction in favour of the plaintiff is
confirmed till the final adjudication of the suit.
