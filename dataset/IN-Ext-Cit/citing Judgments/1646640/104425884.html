                       In   the   year   2000-2001,   the   Planning  Authority  for  the

      "Kelibag   Road"  from   15   meters  to   24   meters.  In  the   Development

      2000, the width of road was retained at 15 meters. However, in the 

      Development Plan, the words "24 meters" were not scored out. Some 

      of   the   present   petitioners   and   others,   therefore,   approached   this

      Development Plan, the width of road was shown as '24 meters' came 
   



      to be recorded in the said Judgment.   As such, the petitioners and 

      other   aggrieved   persons   filed   Misc.   Civil   Application   Nos.   203   of 





      2007, 451 of 2007 and 1344 of 2007. This Court vide order dated 

      16th   November,   2005   allowed   the   Misc.   Civil   Applications   and 

      reviewed the order dated 17th January, 2007 recording therein that, 





      as per the Development Plan, the width of said road was 15 meters

      to   take   action   for   minor   modification   of   Development   Plan   as

      published   by   respondent   no.2   in   the   local   Newspapers   on   2nd

      report was submitted by the Municipal Commissioner on 17.2.2010 
   



      to the State Government. It appears that there were certain internal 

      communications   between   the   different   organs   of   the   State 





      Government.   After   considering   the   material   placed   on   record,   the 

      impugned notification came to be issued on 12th November, 2014. It 

      appears that, thereafter the petitioners made certain representations 





      to   the   Authorities.   However,   since   the   petitioners   could   not   get 

      redressal of their grievance before the respondents/Authorities, the 

      petitioners have approached this Court by way of present petitions.

<p id="p_56">      In this respect, a reliance is sought to be placed on the Judgment of 
                             
      Division Bench of this Court in the case of  Smt. Seema Salve (cited 
                            
      supra). In the said case, though in the agenda of meeting, the subject 

      to be considered was regarding alignment of 18 meters road passing 
      

      through   Survey   Nos.   344,   345   and   346   and   shifting   of   garden, 
   



      cultural  centre   and  library  in  the  concerned  DP  Plan,  the  General 

      Body in the meeting passed a resolution not limited to that topic, but 





      transcended   beyond   that   subject   including   the   policy   matters 

      regarding   further   modification   of   the   D.C.   Rules   (No.2.5)   under 

      Section   37(1)   and   for   reduction   of   premium   to   be   charged   for 





      development proposals for use of TDR under BRTS Corridor. It could 

      thus be seen that, in the said case, resolution which was passed by 

      General   Body   was   with   regard   to   the   subject   which   was   totally 

      foreign to the subject on agenda.  However, perusal of the resolution 




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">    ::: Uploaded on - 18/10/2016                           ::: Downloaded on - 20/10/2016 00:47:40 :::</span>

      passed in the present case would reveal that the same was pertaining 




                                                                                  
      to the proposal of administration, with regard to keeping width of 




                                                          
      road to 15 meters instead of 24 meters.  However, the General Body 

      passed the  resolution resolving to maintain width of the road to 24 




                                                         
      meters.   It   could   thus   be   seen   that   the   resolution   passed   by   the 

      General Body was with respect to the same road. It is not as if that 

      the subject on the agenda was with regard to 'A' road; whereas the 




                                           
      resolution passed was with regard to 'B' road. A General Body has 
                             
      passed resolution with regard to the same road albeit not approving 
                            
      the   width   of   15   meters   as   suggested   by   administration,   but 

      reiterating to have the width of 24 meters.

      minutes   of   the   meeting   which   are   reproduced   hereinbelow   would 

      clearly   show   that   the   agenda   of   the   meeting   was   with   regard   to 





      Kelibag road and the topic discussed is also with regard to the same 

      road.   Merely   because   the   proposal   of   administration   was   for 





      increasing the width of road of 15 meters and the resolution of the

      to a conclusion that the subject discussed in the meeting was not the 

      one which was specified in the agenda.

      that the contention of the petitioners that the Judgment of the

      be noted that, the entire subject was before the House. However,

      the Commissioner of Nagpur Municipal Corporation  as to whether 

      width of road could be maintained at 24 meters without the heritage 





      structures being adversely affected. Not only that, but minutes of the 

      meeting of Heritage Committee dt.8.4.2011 approving widening of 

      the road to 24 meters were also taken into consideration by the State 

      Government.     Perusal   of   the   file   further   reveals   that   though   the

      Secretary of the State Government did not agree with it and put up 

      an endorsement that opinion of the Director does not appear to be

      recommended to accept the proposal of the Corporation to increase it 

      to 24 meters, in order to have smooth traffic flow. Same was also 




                                         
      approved by the Principal Secretary. Thereafter, the Chief Minister 
                             
      had put a note to obtain report of Commissioner, Nagpur Municipal

      meters, without affecting the Heritage Structure of Murlidhar temple, 
      

      Kelibag temple and Gujar gateway. Since the said report was already 
   



      available,   the   file   was   resubmitted   on   5.11.2014.   The   same   was 

      approved   by   the   Joint   Secretary,   the   Principal   Secretary   and 





      thereafter, by the Hon'ble Chief Minister. It could thus be seen that 

      the opinion of the Director of Town Planning was very much taken 

      into consideration by the State Government while arriving at a final 





      decision. However, it cannot be said that the State Government was 

      bound to accept the opinion as expressed by the consultee i.e. the 

      Director of Town Planning.

               enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it 
               deems   fit   is   a   condition   precedent   to   the 
               subordinate legislation, the nature and the extent 
               of   the   enquiry   is     in   the   discretion   of   the 




                                                           
               subordinate legislating body and the subordinate

               ground   that   the enquiry was not as full as   it 
               might  have been.  The  provision for 'such  enquiry

               right   in   anyone   other   than   the   subordinate 
               legislating body. It is the sort of enquiry  which  the 
                            
               legislature   itself   may   cause   to   be   made   before

      exercising its legislative powers to find out as to whether the enquiry 
   



      was not as full as it might have been. The only permissible inquiry 

      would   be,   as   to   whether   the   inquiry   as   contemplated   under   the 





      provisions was in fact conducted by it or not. In view of paragraph 4 

      in the said Judgment, the only inquiry that would be permissible for 

      this Court, would be as to whether the policy and factors are present 





      in the mind of the authorities exercising powers or not, as to whether 

      relevant  considerations  have  gone  in  and irrelevant  considerations 

      are kept out of determination while exercising powers or not.

              discussion.  The  site inspection  report of  the  Kelibag  Road  
              was   read   out   before   the   committee.   At   the   end   of   the  
                            
              inspection, it had been decided that it was not very clear as  
              to   which   heritage   structure   would   be   affected   by   the  
              proposed   widening   of   the   Kelibag   Road   to   24   mtrs.   The  
      


              N.M.C. had been requested to prepare a map showing which  
   



              heritage   structures   would   be   affected   and   also   to   present  
              photographs of these structures. After this information was  





              submitted   to   the   committee,   further   decision   would   be  
              taken.   The   N.M.C.   has   now   prepared   a   map   showing   in  
              detail as to which heritage structure would be affected by  
              the   road   widening.   This   map   was   considered   by   the  





              committee.   Relevant   photographs   were   also   shown   to   the  
              committee   by   Shri   A.B.Mogarkar,   Dy.   Engineer,   N.M.C.,

              necessity.   The   committee   therefore   decided   to   accord   its

      place   for   valid   reasons   and   some   of   them   beyond   the   control   of

              rule making and regulation making without any  
              added   requirement   of   transparency,   we   would  




                                                           
              exhort   Parliament   to   take   up   this   issue   and  
              frame   a   legislation   along   the   lines   of   the   US  
              Administrative Procedure Act (with certain well-
              defined   exceptions)   by   which   all   subordinate  




                                                          
              legislation is subject to a transparent process by  
              which   due   consultations   with   all   stakeholders  
              are   held,   and   the   rule   or   regulation   -making  
              power is exercised after due consideration of all  
              stakeholders'   submissions,   together   with   an  




                                             
              explanatory memorandum which broadly takes  
              into   account   what   they   have   said   and   the  
                             
              reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with them. 
              Not only would such legislation reduce arbitrariness  
              in subordinate legislation-making, but it would also  
                            
              conduce   to   openness   in   governance.   It   would   also  
              ensure   the   redressal,   partial   or   otherwise,   of  
              grievances of the  stakeholders concerned prior to the  
              making   of   subordinate   legislation.   This   would  
      


              obviate,   in   many   cases,   the   need   for   persons   to  
              approach   courts   to   strike   down   subordinate  
   



              legislation  on   the  ground  of  such  legislation  being  
              manifestly   arbitrary   or   unreasonable."  (emphasis  
              supplied).
