  7.12.1989. Accused no.1 Vitthabai Nimbhekar is mother of accused 

  no.4   Pradeep.     Accused   no.2   Neetu   Nimbhekar   is   the   sister   and 

  accused no.3 Ramesh is the brother of accused no.4 Pradeep.  After 

  marriage of Kusum with accused no.4 Pradeep, she went to co-habit 

  with   him.   She   was   treated   properly   for   1Â½   months   after   the 

  marriage.     However,   thereafter,   the   accused   persons   started 

  demanding fridge and motor cycle from deceased Kusum.  Deceased 

  informed   her   father.   Her   father   told   her   that   he   would   make 

  arrangement in that regard at the time of Diwali festival.   Accused 

  persons continued ill-treatment for their demand.

  to   ill-treat   the   deceased.   On   3.10.1990,   the   complainant   went   to 

  Daryapur to take Kusum with him for Diwali festival. At that time, 

  members in the family were not present at their house. Accused no.2 

  Neetu told the complainant that Kusum should be taken only after 

  Fridge, Cooler and Motor cycle were given.   Complainant went back 

  without   taking   Kusum   with   him.     Deceased   committed   suicide   by 

  burning herself. In the night itself, father and brother of deceased 

  reached to Daryapur.   In the morning, complainant lodged report. 

  Police   Inspector   Patil   went   to   the   spot   of   incident,   prepared   spot 

  panchanama, inquest panchanama etc. He has recorded statement of 

  witnesses.     Thereafter,   investigation   was   handed   over   to   Crime 

  Branch, Amravati.   Further investigation  was carried out by Police 

  Inspector   Uttam   Manikrao   Solanke   (PW-8).   He   has   recorded 

  statement of Kanchanmala on 7.3.1991 and also recorded statement 

  of Madhukar Hage on 16.3.1991. He also recorded supplementary

</p><p id="p_12">  4.               The said case was registered as Sessions Trial No.24 of 

  1992. The case was transferred to the Court of Sessions at Amravati 

  and   registered   as   Sessions   Trial   No.50   of   1999.     The   trial   Court 

  framed   Charge   at   Exh.3.     Prosecution   examined   nine   witnesses. 

  Statement   of   accused   were   recorded.     They   have   denied   material 

  incriminating evidence. It is the defence of accused that, on the day 

  of incident, complainant/father of the deceased came to fetch her. 

  The deceased was not ready to go with her father. Her father was 

  insisting her to accompany him on the very same day. He scolded 

  and   beat   deceased   Kusum.     Therefore,   in   a   fit   of   anger,   Kusum 

  committed   suicide.     To   prove   their   defence,   accused   persons 

  examined defence witness Sharad Prabhakarao Wankhade (DW-1). 

  After hearing prosecution and defence, learned trial Court acquitted 

  all the accused of the offences punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_2">Sections 498-A</a> and

  appellant/State.   He has submitted that prosecution has proved by 

  the  evidence of Gopal Ram Bharti (PW-1), Gajanan Gopal Bharati 

  (PW-3)   and   Ramrao   Bajirao   Gawande   (PW-4)   that   the   accused

  persons ill-treated the deceased for demand of Fridge, Cooler, Motor 

  cycle   etc.   Due   to   constant   harassment/ill-treatment   of   accused 

  persons, deceased committed suicide.  Learned A.P.P. has submitted 

  that the deceased was in the custody of accused persons.  They have 

  not explained as to how the deceased died. It is submitted that the 

  accused persons have not rebutted  the presumption  under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_5">Section 

  113B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act.  The learned A.P.P. has submitted 

  that the deceased died within one year from the date of marriage. 

  Her   death   was   unnatural,   due   to   burn   injuries.   Prosecution   has 

  proved   that   death   was   due   to   demand   of   dowry   in   the   form   of 

  articles   like   Fridge,   Cooler,   Motor   cycle   etc.     At   last,   the   learned

  ingredients of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_6">Sections 304-B</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_7">498A</a> of the Indian Penal Code. 

  Hence, the learned A.P.P. prayed to allow the appeal and convict the 

  accused/respondents   for   the   offences   charged   against   them.   In 

  support   of   his   submissions,   learned   A.P.P.   has   pointed   out   the

  accused persons.  No particular instance of cruelty is stated by any of 

  the   witnesses.   Ramrao   (PW-4)   was   resident   of   Daryapur.   He   was 

  mediator   of   the   marriage   between   accused   no.4   Pradeep   and   the 

  deceased. Therefore, it was natural for Gopal (PW-1) and Gajanan

  Ramrao   (PW-4)   has   not   stated   that   the   deceased   told   him   about 

  demand   of   Motor   cycle   etc.   by   her   husband.   He   has   stated   that 

  mother-in-law of the deceased told him that article like Cooker was 

  not given in the marriage. Cooker is not such an article which can be 

  taken into consideration as a dowry.

  by Sriramapuram P.S. and another reported in 2012 ALL MR (Cri) 

  1385 (S.C.), it is observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court as under  :



</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                "8. The penal laws in India are primarily based upon certain  
                fundamental procedural values, which are right to fair trial  
                and presumption of innocence. A person is presumed to be  
                innocent till proven guilty and once held to be not guilty of a  
                criminal charge, he enjoys the benefit of such presumption  
                which   could   be   interfered   with   only   for   valid   and   proper  
                reasons.   An   appeal   against   acquittal   has   always   been  
                differentiated   from   a   normal   appeal   against   conviction.  
                Wherever there is perversity of facts and/or law appearing in  
                the   judgment,   the   appellate   court   would   be   within   its  
                jurisdiction to interfere with the judgment of acquittal, but  
                otherwise such interference is not called for. "

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 "   The   golden   thread   which   runs   through   the   web   of  
                 administration   of   justice   in   criminal   cases   is   that   if   two  
                 views are possible on the evidence adduced in a case, one  
                 pointing   to   the   guilt   of   the   accused   and   other   to   his  
                 innocence,   the   view   which   is   favourable   to   the   accused  
                 should be adopted. There are no jurisdictional limitations on  
                 the power of the Appellate Court but it is to be exercised

                 with some circumspection. The paramount consideration of  
                 the   Court   should   be   to   avoid   miscarriage   of   justice.   A  
                 miscarriage of justice which may arise from the acquittal of  
                 guilty   is   no   less   than   that   from   the   conviction   of   an  
                 innocent. If there is miscarriage of justice from the acquittal,  
                 the higher Court would examine the matter as a Court of  
                 fact and appeal  while correcting the errors of law and in  
                 appreciation of evidence as well. Then the Appellate Court  
                 may even proceed to record the judgment of guilt to meet the  
                 ends of justice, if it is really called for. "

<p id="p_78">  30.              From the careful reading of the impugned Judgment, it is 

  clear that the view taken by the learned trial Court is a correct view 

  and   therefore,   no   interference   is   called   for.   Hence,   we   are   not 

  inclined to allow the appeal and pass the following order.
