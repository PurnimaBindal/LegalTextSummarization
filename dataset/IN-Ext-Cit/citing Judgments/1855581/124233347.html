<p id="p_21">5.	At
this stage it is necessary to mention that after the above referred
report dated 24.8.2010 was filed by OL, one of the creditors i.e.
opponent No. 2 (IDBI) filed affidavit dated 27.9.2010 raising
objection against the report and more particularly the application
filed by applicant - IFCI. 
</p>
 


<p id="p_22">	The said
opponent also raised objection against the report of the Chartered
Accountant and submitted that:-
</p> 


<p id="p_23">"5.
</p><p id="p_24">I say and submit that the said charted accountant has further
seriously erred in not taking into consideration the secured amount
for the loan of Rs.84,26,000/- financed by IDBI in joint
participation with IFCI Limited and ICICI Bank Limited. IFCI Limited
is a lead bank. Though he has stated that the charge is registered
with ROC (Registrar of Companies) for Rs.164 lakh by filing from No.8
on 14.7.1986, he has stated that it is an exclusive charge of IFCI
Limited and  thereby he has declared IDBI as unsecured creditor so
far as the amount financed by IDBI is concerned in jointly with IFCI
Limited and ICICI Bank Limited. This fact is evident from the letter
issued by the applicant bank on 28.7.2010 to the said charted
accountant. A copy of letter dated 28.7.2010 is annexed hereto and
marked as Annexure-R1 to this affidavit in reply. In this letter, the
applicant bank has clearly stated that rupee term loan of Rs.164 lakh
was sanctioned and disbursed by three creditors viz. IFCI Limited,
IDBI and ICICI Bank Limited under Project Finance Participation
Certificate Scheme and the said amount of Rs.164 lakh was shared by
three institutions as under:-</p><pre id="pre_2">
 


IFCI
Limited			Rs.17.92 lakh
 


IDBI				Rs.84.26
lakh
 


ICICI
Bank Limited		Rs.44.82 lakh
 


 


 


	The
</pre><p id="p_25">certificate of registration of the charge is placed on record at page
No.37 which tallies with figure shown in the letter of IFCI Limited."
</p>	
 


 


 


<p id="p_26">6.
The said opponent No.2 IDBI claimed that the Chartered
Accountant committed mistake in considering the claim by ICICI bank
inasmuch as the Chartered Accountant considered the claim of ICICI
Bank at Rs.4,65,24,121/- as on 20.1.2000 i.e. date of winding up
whereas according to the judgment of the learned tribunal, the claim
of ICICI bank was to the extent of Rs. 1,05,27,945/- only, as on
1.3.2000 and that therefore on 20.1.2000 i.e. date of winding up it
could not be Rs.4,65,24,121/- as considered by the Chartered
Accountant. Accordingly, the report of the Charted Accountant came to
be assailed.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_27">6.1	In the wake
of said objection by the opponent No.2 the OL filed further report
dated 24.12.2010 wherein OL stated, inter alia, that:- 
</p>
 


<p id="p_28">2.
That, M/s. Kirti J. Nayak and Associates, Charted Accountant vide
letter dated 24.11.2010 have submitted the supplementary report in
the office of the official liquidator regarding verification of
claims of the secured creditors and workers and also a report
regarding ratio of disbursement amongst the secured creditors and
workers. A copy of the supplementary report dated 24.11.2010 received
from the chartered accountant, M/s. Kirti J. Nayak and Associates is
annexed and marked as Annexure-B
 


</p><p id="p_29">3.
It is most respectfully submitted that on perusal of the
supplementary report of the chartered accountant, it is observed that
the claims of the secured creditors and workers have been quantified
by the chartered accountant and the revised ratio of distribution has
been worked out by them as under:-

This
report is submitted in compliance of the order dated 27.9.2010 for
such other and further orders and directions as may be considered
just and appropriate by this Hon'ble Court."
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_38">6.2	After
above referred details and objection came on record, respondent No.5
Bank of India came out with its affidavit claiming, inter alia, that
vide judgment dated 23.10.2000 the learned tribunal had allowed its
application No.149 of 1996 and passed judgment in its favour for sum
of Rs.4,65,24,121.85 with running interest @ 17.5% per annum from
30.7.1996. The said bank claimed that it has to recover a sum of
Rs.7,50,20,145.96 from the company, however the Chartered Accountant
has wrongly quantified its claim to the extent of only
Rs.4,65,24,121/-whereas its correct claim amount is Rs.7,50,20,145.96
(and the reduction to the extent of Rs.2,84,96,024.96 was incorrect).
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_39">6.3	Thereafter,
the applicant bank filed further affidavit dated 18.7.2011. On the
other hand the opponent No.2 IDBI again came out with
affidavit/objection dated 20.7.2011 (pages 173 to 175) and opponent
No.8 ARCIL filed its affidavit /objection dated 21.7.2011. The said
opponent ARCIL has tried to present bifurcation of the sale
consideration of Rs.1.90 Crores so as to demonstrate as to what
amount was received from disposal of which particular property and on
that basis what would be the percentage amount received from disposal
of the particular property vis a vis the total amount received from
disposal of the properties. The details mentioned by opponent No. 8
read thus:-

6.4
In the interregnum OL had called for fresh report of the Chartered
Accountant in light of the objection raised by the creditors. The
Chartered Accountant submitted his fresh report dated 21.9.2011 and
on that basis OL filed his report dated 12.10.2011. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_54">7.
After the above referred report dated 21.9.2011, the applicant filed
an affidavit dated 21.11.2011 raising objections against the said
report. The applicant has claimed that the said report dated
21.9.2011 contradicts the earlier report by the same Chartered
Accountant and it does not comply the directions vide order dated
22.7.2011. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_55">7.1	Thereafter,
in furtherance of the order dated 1.12.2011 passed in Company
Application No.26 of 2010 and 27 of 2010, Official Liquidator filed
report dated 15.12.2011 stating inter alia, that in view of the order
dated 1.12.2011, the Chartered Accountant was asked to clarify
factual position with regard to registration of charge against
immovable property, by IFCI, ICICI and IDBI. The Official Liquidator
has stated in the said report that:-
</p> 


<p id="p_56">  "....and
they orally informed that no charge on the immovable property is
appears to be filed with Registrar of Companies, Gujarat by IFCI,
ICICI and IDBI under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_1">Section 125</a> of the Companies Act, 1986. The said
Chartered Co. again confirmed the said position in the letter dated
15.12.2011 i.e. on the Company's immovable properties such
as land and building IDBI, ICICI and IFCI have no charge and they are
not a secured creditors on that property...." In this
context, it would be appropriate to take into account the exact
clarification made by the Chartered Accountant in the communication
dated 15.12.2011. It is stated, inter alia, therein, that ".... none
of the Financial Institutions viz. IFCI, IDBI and ICICI has complied
with the requirements of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_2">section 125</a> of the Companies Act, 1956 for
registration of their charge with the Registrar of Companies, Gujarat
in respect of immovable properties of Company. We again confirm on
the basis of documents supplied by  the financial institutions
in support of their claims and also from online search of RoC
records from MCA 21 website that no charge is registered on the
immovable property of the company in favour of IFCI, IDBI and ICICI.
 Therefore in view of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_3">section 125</a> of Companies Act, 1956, the
aforesaid Financial Institutions can not claim the status of secured
creditors qa immovable property of the Company."
</p><p id="p_57">								 (emphasis supplied)
 

 


 

</p><p id="p_58">8.
Thus, what has ultimately emerged from the reports by the Chartered
Accountant is the fact that so far as the immovable properties of the
company are concerned, any charge over any immovable properties of
the company has not been registered in accordance with the provisions
contained under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_4">section 125</a> of the Act either by the applicant -
IFCI or the other creditors and in that view of the fact -
situation, the Chartered Accountant has reported that the said
financial institutions cannot claim status of "secured
creditors". 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_59">8.1
In this context, it is pertinent to note that in reply to Court's
query during hearing of present application, even learned Counsel Mr.
Parmar for the applicant has not disputed the fact that the applicant
did not get the charge against immovable properties (which the
applicant is presently claiming against immovable properties of the
company) registered within 30 days with the Registrar of Companies in
accordance with <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_5">section 125</a> of the Act and that it does not hold
"registered charge" against the immovable properties.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_60">8.2	The
applicant / creditor(s) upon being confronted by the Chartered
Accountant's report that the creditors cannot claim status of secured
creditor, have now contended that they hold order dated 12.3.2004
passed by learned Debts Recovery Tribunal and their claim is
supported by the said order passed by the learned tribunal and that
therefore their claims are secured claim and status of secured
creditor cannot be denied to them. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_61">8.3	Thus
the applicant and other creditors who allegedly hold charge against
the assets of the company - particularly immovable properties -
but have not got the charge registered are aggrieved by the said
report of the chartered accountant. The applicant has sought to rely
on the said order dated 12.3.2004 passed by the learned tribunal.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_62">9.
Mr. Parmar, learned counsel, appearing for the applicant has
contended that the omission to register the charge would not affect
the right of the creditor to recover the amount and would not affect
the cause of action. He also contended that omission to register the
charge would not affect the security so as to deny the right to
enforce the mortgage or to realize the security. He also contended
that the liquidator cannot go behind the decree so as to reject the
claim on the ground that it is void. Mr. Parmar also claimed that the
applicant has the status of secured creditor in view of the order
passed by the learned tribunal. Mr. Parmar, learned advocate for the
applicants, relied on below mentioned decisions:-

9.1	Per
contra, learned counsel appearing for workmen has contended that in
view of the provisions under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_12">Section 125</a> of the Act registration of
charge is compulsory and any charge which is not registered with the
Registrar of the Companies in accordance with the said provision will
be void against the liquidator and the workmen or other secured and
unsecured creditors can raise objections against claim made by a
creditor on the basis of unregistered charge. He also contended that
since the order by the learned tribunal is not registered with the
Registrar in accordance with the said provision neither the applicant
can claim status of secured creditor on the strength of the order by
the learned tribunal nor their claim made on the basis of such order
can be considered as secured claim and that therefore, such claim
cannot be entertained under <a href="/doc/1190954/" id="a_13">Section 529A</a> read with <a href="/doc/955237/" id="a_14">Section 529</a> of the
Act and such claim cannot be included or taken into account for
determining the total eligible claim of all secured creditors and for
determining the disbursement ratio for preferential and priority
disbursement on pari-pasu basis amongst the secured creditors and the
workmen. The learned counsel for the workmen contended that the claim
made by the applicants on the basis of the said order is rightly
excluded by the Chartered Accountant on the ground that the applicant
does not have status of secured creditor and the claim is not secured
claim so far as the amounts realized from sale of immovable
properties is concerned. Learned counsel for the workmen relied on
the decision in case of <a href="/doc/749617/" id="a_15">Rajasthan Financial Corporation v. Jaypur
Spinning and Ginning Mills Limited</a>.  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_64">10.
At the outset, couple of clarifications would not be out of place. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_65">(a)
It is necessary to mention that immovable and movable properties of
the company have been auction sold and amounts have been realized
from such auction sale. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_66">(b)
In the report dated 20.3.2010 OL stated that total sale consideration
received from sale of movable and immovable assets of the company was
to the tune of Rs.1.90 crores.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_67">(c)
The applicant has made reference of and has heavily relied on order
dated 12.3.2004 passed by the learned Tribunal which declares that
the applicant is entitled for Rs.1,79,00,000/- from the three
opponents (before the tribunal).
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_68">(d)
On the other hand in the affidavit in support of the judge's summons
the applicant has stated that the learned Tribunal has issued
recovery certificate in a sum of Rs.12,87,76,858/- plus interest @
12% from the date of application, in favour of the applicant.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_69">(e)
The recovery certificate said to have been issued by the learned
tribunal is not placed on record along with the application.
</p> 

 

 

<p id="p_70">(f)
The gap between Rs. 1,79,00,000/- allowed by the learned tribunal's
order dated 12.3.2004 and the amount said to have been mentioned in
the recovery certificate is not explained by the applicant. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_71">(g)
On the ground that it is a secured creditor (i.e. by claiming status
of secured creditor) applicant has also requested for interim
disbursement until final ratio for disbursement is determined.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_72">(h)
However, vide his communication dated 15.12.2011 and by earlier
report the chartered accountant appointed by OL has reported that the
financial institutions viz. IFCI (present applicant), IDBI and ICICI
have not complied with the requirement of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_16">Section 125</a> of the Act for
registration of charge with the Registrar in respect of immovable
property and that therefore the said financial institutions cannot
claim status as secured creditors qua immovable property of the
company.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_73">(i)
Therefore, the workmen have opposed the claim of the applicant and
other financial institutions for disbursement by presetting their
claim as claim by secured creditors.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_74">(j)
In the report dated 21.9.2011 by the chartered accountant or in the
report filed by OL including the aforesaid last report dated
12.10.2011 the position related to charge, if any, against movable
property of the company is not clarified with reference to the
requirement prescribed and contemplated under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_17">Section 125</a> of the Act.
</p>

 

 


 

<p id="p_75">(k)
It is not disputed by the creditor/s - applicant/s that the
charge of the applicant is not registered in accordance with <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_18">Section
125</a> of the Act. So as to come out of the said difficulty, reliance is
placed on the order dated 12.3.2004 passed by the learned tribunal. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_76">(l)
In the application No. 293 of 2000 (wherein the said order dated
12.3.2009 is passed) present applicant - IFCI as well as IDBI
and ICICI Bank Ltd. were party applicants and Official Liquidator of
the company was impleded as one of the defendants along with  the
Directors of the company.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_77">11.
In light of the facts of present case and in view of rival
submissions, as well as the report of Chartered Accountant and the
said order dated 12.3.2004, it is appropriate to take into account
relevant observations in the order and also the relevant provisions
i.e. the provisions under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_19">Section 125</a>, <a href="/doc/955237/" id="a_20">Section 529</a> and <a href="/doc/1190954/" id="a_21">Section

being in force or in the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_54">Companies Act</a> itself, there is a
preferential payment provided for workmen's dues and debts due to the
secured creditors to the extent such debts rank under clause (c) of
the proviso to <a href="/doc/955237/" id="a_55">Section 529</a> (1) pari passu with such dues. Therefore,
when the assets of the company are sold and the proceeds realized,
the debts by way of workmen's dues and that of the secured creditors
have to be paid in full if the assets are sufficient to meet them and
if they are not sufficient, in equal proportions."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_146">12.4	The
provision under Section 529 A and <a href="/doc/955237/" id="a_56">Section 529</a> of the Act prescribe
right of preferential or priority payment in favour of the workers
and secured creditors. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_147">	However,
what is pertinent that the said right would be available in respect
of only those securities which create "charge" and only
those charge which are duly "registered" with the
Registrar within 30 days (i.e. in accordance with <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_57">Section 125</a> of the
Act) can be taken into account for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1190954/" id="a_58">Section 529-A</a> read
with <a href="/doc/955237/" id="a_59">Section 529</a> of the Act. Furthermore according to the said
provision the security should be alive and available for realization
of its value. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_148">12.5
	Thus, so as to claim status of secured creditor and to claim
priority and preferential payment at the time of disbursement of the
proceeds realized upon disposal of company's assets, it is necessary
that (I) the creditor must be holding "charge" over /
against company's assets (given as security for recovery of debt) and
</p><p id="p_149">(ii) such charge must be registered in accordance with <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_60">section 125</a> of
the Act.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_150">12.6	In
the background of applicable provision viz. <a href="/doc/955237/" id="a_61">Section 529</a> and <a href="/doc/1190954/" id="a_62">Section
529-A</a> read with <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_63">Section 125</a> of the Act, the situation which would
emerge is that if any creditor holds security against any asset of
the company but if the charge in respect of such security is not
registered within 30 days with the Registrar of Companies then such
charge cannot be considered "secured charge" or secured
debt for the purpose of <a href="/doc/955237/" id="a_64">Section 529</a> and <a href="/doc/1190954/" id="a_65">529-A</a> of the Act and
therefore while determining the aggregate of workmen's due and debt
of the secured creditors the claim / debt in respect of which the
charge is not registered, should be excluded.	
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_151">12.7	When
the facts of present case are examined in light of the above
mentioned provisions it emerges from the record that in present case
the dispute is with reference to the immovable properties because the
applicant and other two creditors claim that by virtue of order of
learned tribunal they are secured creditors in respect of immovable
properties as well. Whereas the chartered accountant has mentioned in
his report that any creditor has not got registered with the
Registrar any charge against any immovable property - assets of
the company.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_152">12.8
In present case even if it is assumed that charge was created against
immovable properties (as claimed by the applicant) then also mere
creation of charge (assuming it was created) against immovable
properties will not suffice because for present case the important
requirement is the one prescribed under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_66">Section 125</a> viz. the charge
must be registered within 30 days with the Registrar of Companies.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_153">12.9
Therefore, so as to cross the hurdle of the condition prescribed
under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_67">section 125</a> of the Act the applicant - creditor has
claimed that the learned tribunal has passed order dated 12.3.2004 in
its favour whereby declaration and directions are passed by the
learned tribunal and it being order of the Court the non-compliance
of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_68">section 125</a> will not render its claim void qua OL or other
creditors or workers.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_154">13.
So as to appreciate the said contention, it is relevant to take into
account the provisions under the <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_69">Registration Act</a> 1908, particularly
the provision contained under <a href="/doc/561156/" id="a_70">Section 17</a> of the Registration Act
which makes registration of certain documents compulsory. The
provision under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/561156/" id="a_71">Section 17</a> of the Registration Act
enlists the documents of which registration is compulsory. <a href="/doc/1488438/" id="a_72">Section 18</a>
enlists the documents of which registration is optional. In the facts
of present case <a href="/doc/1450831/" id="a_73">Section 17(1)(b)(c)</a> and (e) and sub-clause (vi) of
sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_74">Section 17</a> are relevant. The said provisions read

</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_164">14.1 So far as
the provision under clause (b) and clause (c)  are concerned it is
also necessary to take into account sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_75">Section 17</a> and
particularly clause (vi) of said sub-section (2).The said sub-section
(2) of <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_76">Section 17</a> and clause (vi) thereof read thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_165">"(2)
Nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) applies to-
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_166">(vi)	any
decree or order of a Court [except a decree or order expressed to be
made on a compromise and comprising immovable property other than
that which is the subject-matter of the suit or proceedings]; 
</p>
 


 

 

<p id="p_167">14.2
Subsection (2) of <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_77">Section 17</a> provides, inter alia, that the
requirement prescribed under clause (b) and clause (c) of subsection
(1) (viz. the requirement for registration of documents mentioned and
described in the said two clauses) will not apply to the items
mentioned in clause No.(i) to clause No.(xii) of said subsection (2)
of <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_78">Section 17</a>. The said twelve clauses [i.e. the items mentioned in
subsection (2)] include a decree or order of a Court (except decree
or order expressed to be made on compromise or comprising immovable
property which is the subject matter of the suit). Consequently, the
requirement prescribed under clause (b) and / or clause (c) of
subsection (1) of <a href="/doc/1513155/" id="a_79">Section 17</a> will not apply to any decree or order of
a Court (except decree or order expressed to be made on compromise
comprising immovable property which is the subject matter of the
suit).  
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_168">14.3
A special and new right can be created and conferred by a special
statute and even a separate and special remedy for enforcement of
such new right can be created by law (such special Act) and new and
special or additional obligation can also be created by special Act
(or appropriate provision). 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_169">14.4	<a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_80">Section
125</a> of the Act is one such special provision. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_170">14.5	A
charge, which, ordinarily may not require registration under
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_81">Registration Act</a> or the registration of which may be optional under
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_82">Registration Act</a> or other general laws, requires registration within
30 days with the Registrar of the Companies, for the purpose of
<a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_83">Section 529</a> and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_84">529-A</a> of the Act, otherwise, in view of the provision
under said sections the charge would be void against the liquidator,
other secured creditors and the workmen. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_171">15.	At
this stage slight diversion or detour is necessary. It is necessary
to mention that from the order dated 12.3.2004 passed by the learned
Tribunal it emerges that OL was impleaded as party defendant in the
application before the learned tribunal. It also appears that the
said order dated 12.3.2004 is not challenged by OL. Not only this,
but it also appears from the record that even during proceeding
before the learned tribunal OL did not oppose the claim of the bank
that the documents of title of four immovable properties (bearing
survey number 23, 25/1, 24/2 and 30/2) were deposited with it and
that they were deposited by one of the  Directors of the company. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_172">15.1
However it does not become clear from the order as to whether the
said four immovable properties are properties of the company or not
and as to whether the said Director (viz. Mr. Mankodi) was duly
authorized by appropriate resolution passed by the company to deposit
the title deeds of the said four properties with the bank, or not. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_173">15.2
So far as the issue regarding authority of said Mr. Mankodi is
concerned, the company Court at this stage, cannot go behind the 
learned tribunal's order and examine the said issue afresh. More so
when OL, despite being party to the proceeding, neither opposed the
said details nor took care to examine the record                  
and / or to place on record any other material from which correct and
complete factual position may emerge. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_174">15.3.
</p><p id="p_175">Therefore, at this stage Court will have to proceed on the basis of
the said order dated 12.3.2004 passed by the learned tribunal and 
notwithstanding the said limitation, it will have to be examined, as
to whether the said four properties are properties of the company or
not or they are personal properties of the Director/s. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_176">15.4	Once
this aspect is examined and if it comes out that the said four
properties are properties of the company then OL or the Court cannot
go behind the order and the claim will have to be examined in light
of the said order dated 12.3.2004.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_177">16.	The
question which would then arise is about the requirement prescribed
under <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_85">Section 125</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_86">Section 125</a> of the Act prescribes, a
special or new and additional requirement viz. to get the "charge"
registered within 30 days with the Registrar of the Companies.
Consequently, although under General Law a charge may not be required
to be registered but in view of said special provision under special
<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_87">Act (Companies Act</a> 1956) registration of "charge" is
necessary otherwise it would be void against all creditors, workmen
and OL. However, according to the applicant in view of the order by
the learned Tribunal, non-registration of charge will not render the
charge void. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_178">17.
Thus, it would be necessary to ascertain as to whether the order in
question creates a "charge" or not. 
</p>
 

<p id="p_179">	Whether
charge is created by a particular decree or order of Court; or not,
is matter of interpretation of the decree or order. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_180">18.
If on interpretation of the decree it emerges that the decree has
created "charge" then the next question which would arise
is whether, in view of the requirement prescribed under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_88">Section 125</a>
of the Act, registration of charge created by decree or order of the
Court is necessary or not. Differently put, the question which would
then arise is as to whether an order or a decree by Court and charge
created by / on account of Court's order or decree is not covered by
the requirement prescribed under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_89">Section 125</a> of the Act. Therefore,
in present case, it would be necessary to examine and understand the
effect of the said order dated 12.3.2004 is concerned.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_181">18.1	So
far as the said order dated 12.3.2004 passed by the learned tribunal
is concerned, learned tribunal has, by the said order, granted
declaration that the applicant bank is entitled to recover a sum of
Rs.1,79,00,000/- with cost and further interest @ 12% per annum. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_182">18.2	The
learned Tribunal granted one month's time for such payment and
further directed that in the event of failure to make payment within
prescribed time the bank may proceed to sell the movable assets and
mortgaged and other immovable properties of the respondents and that
period of one month will not bar the Recovery Officer to issue demand
Notice. Learned Tribunal also directed to issue Recovery Certificate.
The relevant part of the said order read thus:-
</p> 


<p id="p_183">"(A)
The applicant  bank is entitled to recover from the respondents 1 to
3, jointly and severally, a sum of Rs.1,79,00,000=00 p. with cost and
further interest at the rate of 12% per annum, from the date of
filing of the application till realization.
</p> 


<p id="p_184">(B)
 Respondent are given one month's time to settle the claim of
the applicant bank;  failing which, the bank may proceed to sell
the movable assets and mortgaged and other immovable properties of
the said respondents and adjust the sale proceeds towards the amount
due. This period of one month will not bar the Recovery Officer
to issue demand notice.
</p> 


<p id="p_185">(C)
Issue recovery certificate accordingly and parties be informed.
</p> 


<p id="p_186">(D)
Bill for the cost of the suit be drawn in accordance with the Form
No.2 of the Appendix D to the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 read with
relevant rules and regulations applicable under the Act."
(emphasis supplied)
 


 


 

18.3	In
this context it is relevant to refer to the observation by the Apex
Court in decision in the case between <a href="/doc/1956372/" id="a_90">Indian Bank vs. Official
Liquidator, Chemmeens Exports (P) Ltd</a> (1998 [5] SCC 401) wherein the
Apex Court has observed that:-
</p> 


<p id="p_187">9.
<a href="/doc/955512/" id="a_91">In Praga  Tools Ltd.  vs. Official	 Liquidator  of	 the Bengal
Engineering  Co. (P)  Ltd</a>. [1984	 (56() Company Cases 214], a 
consent decree	 for repayment	of money  was passed against the 
Bengal Engineering Company on the suit filed by Praga Tools  Company.
The  decree provided, inter alia, that in the event of non-payment of
the decreed amount, the praga Tools Company would be entitled to
execute decree and in the event of  execution of the decree, the
security furnished by the Bengal  Engineering Company  with the
Registrar under an earlier order  of the  court to	 the extent  of
Rs. 53,000/- would continue	as security  for the decree. That decree
was not registered. Thereafter, Bengal Engineering Company went into
liquidation and its  entire assets  were sold by  the official 
liquidator.The  Praga   Tools  Company  applied claiming  to be  a 
secured  creditor to  the  extent  of Rs.50,000/-.  A learned
Single Judge of  the Calcutta High Court held that as the charge was
created by an order of the court, it  would not  require registration
under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_92">Section 125</a> of the Companies Act and that the Praga Tools
Company should be treated  as secured creditor to the extent of
Rs.50,000/- and was entitled to  recover the  amount from the
official liquidator. We approve the  principle laid  down  by the
learned Single Judge of  the Calcutta High Court.  We also make
it  clear that  an order  or decree of a Court creating charge on  
the  properties   of  a   company has to  be distinguished from a
preliminary decree passed in a mortgage suit based on an unregistered
charge which is hit by <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_93">Section 125</a> of the Act. We shall advert to
this aspect presently. (emphasis supplied)
 


 


 

18.4	On
plain reading of the said order and direction and in light of  the
observation by the Apex Court in the said decision in case of Indian
Bank (supra) it comes out that the said order directs and stipulates
that in the event of failure to make payment and settling the Bank's
claims within one month the amount / dues can be realized by sale of
movable assets and other immovable assets. It is directed therein
that:-
</p> 


<p id="p_188">(A)
.............
</p> 


<p id="p_189">(B)
Respondent are given one month's time to settle the claim of the
applicant bank; failing which, the bank may proceed to sell the
movable assets and mortgaged and other immovable properties of the
said respondents and adjust the sale proceeds towards the amount
due............
</p> 


<p id="p_190">(C)
..................
</p> 


<p id="p_191">(D)
................."
</p> 


 


 

<p id="p_192">18.5
Thus the said observations and directions in the said order has
extinguished the unregistered charge and the said unregistered
charge, upon expiry of period of one month after the date of the
order merged in the order of the Court. Accordingly as a result of
and in view of the above noted observations and directions, the bank
became entitled to realise its dues by sale of the immovable
properties in question. The charge created by act or conduct of the
parties / by a contract was kept alive for one month. During the said
period the charge continued to be matter of contract but after one
month the charge travelled into the realm of order of Court and
merged into the order.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_193">18.6
<a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_94">Section 125</a> of the Act will be applicable in cases where
property of company in liquidation is offered as security and
"charge" is created. However charge created by conduct or
act of a person / company and / or by contract cannot be equited with
or cannot be put on par with decree or order of Court. It may be, in
given case, that the Court's order or decree is passed on the basis
of mortgage created by the company however if the charge created by
the act of a person / company or contract by a person / company is
merged in the order or decree of the Court the security as well as
relationship of the parties will be governed by the directions passed
by the Court and reflected in the order or decree and, as observed by
the Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank (supra), it will not be hit
by <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_95">Section 125</a> of the Act. If on reading and construction of the
decree or order of the Court it emerges that the charge which was
within the domain of contract has not travelled into the realm of
order or decree by the Court and has not merged into the Court's
order then, undoubtedly, <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_96">Section 125</a> of the Act will be attracted and
will be applicable and in such situation unregistered charge will be
void against all creditors and OL, however if it emerges that it has
merged into Court's order or decree then <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_97">Section 125</a> of the Act will
not be applicable.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_194">18.7	So
far as the dispute between the workmen and other secured creditors on
one hand and the applicant on other and their rival contentions viz.
nature and scope of the requirement prescribed under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_98">Section 125</a> of
the Act viz. Registration of the charge with the Registrar of
Companies within 30 days, and its applicability to the decree or
order passed by the Court, are concerned, the Apex Court has observed
in paragraph Nos. 7, 18 and 19 of the decision in case of Indian Bank
(supra) that:-
</p> 


<p id="p_195">"7.
</p><p id="p_196">On a  plain reading  of sub-section (1) it become clear that if a
company creates a charge of the nature enumerated in sub-section (4),
after Ist day  of April, 1914, on its properties, and fails to  have
the  charge  together with instrument, if any, by  which  the charge
is created, registered with the Registrar of the Companies within
thirty days, it  shall be  void  against  the liquidator  and any
creditor of  the company.  This, however,  is subject to the
provisions of  Part-V of  the Act.  The proviso enables the Registrar
to  relax the period of limitation of thirty days on payment  of
specified additional fees, on being satisfied that there  has been 
sufficient cause for not	 filing the particulars and instrument or a
copy thereof  within	the specified  period. Sub-sections  (2)	and 
(3)  deal	with repayment of  money secured  by the  charge.
Sub-section (2) provides that  the provision  of sub-section  (1)
shall not prejudice the  contract or obligation for repayment of
money secured by  the charge	and sub-section (3) says that when a
charge becomes	void under  the section, the money  secured shall
become payable immediately. Though as a consequence of
non-registration of  charge  under  Part-V  of the  Act,  a creditor
may  not be able to enforce the charge against the properties of the
company as a secured creditor in the event of liquidation of the
company as  the charge becomes void against the  liquidator and  the
creditor, yet he  will  be entitled to recover the debt due by  the
company on par with other unsecured  creditors. It is also evident
the <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_99">Section 125</a> applies to every  charge created  by the  company on
or after the Ist day of April, 1914. But where the charge is by 
operation of  law or is created by an order or decree of the court,
<a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_100">Section 125</a> has no application.
</p> 


 


 


<p id="p_197">18.
<a href="/doc/1930987/" id="a_101">In Suryakant  Natvarlal Surati  &amp; Ors.  vs. Kamani Bros Pvt. Ltd</a>.
[1985 (58) Company Cases 121], the company created a charge  under a 
mortgage in favour of the trustees of the Employees' Gratuity  Fund.
The	creditors by  a	preliminary decree of  December 3, 1977 were 
entitled to	receive	 the amount secured on the property of  the
company;  the court fixed December	8, 1988	 as the date for 
redemption  and ordered that  in default  of payment  of the sum due
by that date, the  property was to be sold by public auction. On an
application made  on February  16,  1978,  the company was ordered to
be wound up by and order dated August 3, 1979. As default in  payment
of the decreed amount was committed, the mortgages applied  for leave
 of the court under <a href="/doc/1537531/" id="a_102">Section 446</a> to execute  the decree	against the 
official liquidator  by application dated July 10, 1981. Three
contributories sought injunction   against taking any further action
on the ground that the  charge created  by the  company was not
registered under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_103">Section  125</a> of  the  Companies  Act,  therefore,
the mortgages should  be treated  only  as	unsecured  creditor. Their
application  was dismissed  by a learned Single Judge. On appeal, 
speaking for  the Division	Bench of  the Bombay High Court  Justice
Bharucha  (as he  then was) laid  down, inter alia, the principle
that  the question of applicability of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_104">Section  125</a> had to be
decided on the terms of the decree - whether  the unregistered
charged created by the mortgagor was kept  alive or  extinguished or 
replaced by an order of sale created  by the  decree; if  upon a
construction of the decree, the  court found  that the  unregistered
charge was kept alive,  the provisions  of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_105">Section 125</a> would apply
and if,  on the  other   hand,  the  decree  extinguished the
unregistered charge,  the section would not apply. We are in
respectful agreement  with that  principle. We hold that  a
judgment creditor  will be  entitled  to  relief  from the Company
Court accordingly. (emphasis supplied)
 


 


 


</p><p id="p_198">19.
Reverting to the  facts  of  this   case,  on	 the construction of
the decree  we have  already held  that the charge was kept alive
till August 28, 1982 and thereafter in default of  payment of decree
amount  the sale	 order would take effect. In this case, admittedly
the  decree amount was not paid  before August  28, 1982,  as such 
the matter	had passed from  the domain	 of contract  to the  realm 
of the judgment. The official liquidator filed application on March
21, 1983 seeking to declare the decree as void. By that date what was
operative in the decree as void. By that dates what was operative  in
the  decree was  not a  mere unregistered charge but  an order  for
sale of mortgaged  property for realisation of decree amount. The
preliminary decree cannot therefore be said to be void and
inoperative."

<p id="p_199">18.8	The
Apex Court observed that according to sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_106">Section 125</a>
of the Act if a company creates a charge on its properties and fails
to have the charge together with instrument, if any, by which the
charge is created, registered with the Registrar of Companies within
30 days, it shall be void against liquidator and any creditor of the
company, subject to provision of part-(v) of the Act. However what is
important for the issue on hand is that the Apex Court has observed
in the said decision that:- 
</p>
 


<p id="p_200">"But
where the charge is by operation of law or is created by an order of
decree of the Court, <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_107">Section 125</a> has no application"
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_201">18.9	Having
held so, the Apex Court made reference of the decision in case of
Overseas Aviation Engineering (G.B.) Ltd;, Re (1963 [33] Comp Cas
</p><p id="p_202">315) in which case the Court of Appeal held that the order passed by
the Court giving effect to the charge unregistered under <a href="/doc/1137180/" id="a_108">Section 95</a>
of the Companies Act (which is pari materia with <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_109">Section 125</a> of the
Act) would not be void against liquidator of the company.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_203">18.10
The Apex Court, in the said decision in case of Indian Bank (supra),
also considered the decision by the Division Bench of Bombay High
Court wherein the Court held that the question of applicability of
<a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_110">Section 125</a> of the Act should be decided in terms of the decree i.e.
whether the unregistered charge created by mortgage was kept alive or
was extinguished or replaced by order of sale created by decree and
if upon consideration of the decree it is found that unregistered
charge was kept alive, the provision of <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_111">Section 125</a> of the Act would
apply but if decree extinguished the unregistered charge then <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_112">section
125</a> of the Act would not apply.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_204">18.11
The legal position in connection with <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_113">Section 125</a> of the Act
clarified and declared by the Apex Court is applicable to order or
decree passed by the Court inasmuch as the Apex Court has, as
mentioned above, held that "where the charge is by operation or
created by order or decree of the Court, <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_114">section 125</a> has no
applicability".
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_205">18.12
In light of the said observation by the Apex Court it has to be held
that even though special and additional obligation is created by
<a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_115">section 125</a> of the Act which requires registration of "charge"
(and the instrument, if any), the said requirement will not be
applicable to the cases where the charge is created by order or
decree of Court if the unregistered charge is extinguished by and it
has merged into order or decree of the Court. However if the decree
or order of the Court has kept the charge alive then the obligation
created by <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_116">section 125</a> would be applicable with all force.
Differently put, if the unregistered charge has merged in the decree
or order of the Court then the relationship would be governed by the
terms of the decree or order of the Court which would not be affected
by obligation under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_117">section 125</a> of the Act. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_206">19.
In light of the foregoing discussion of reasons it follows, so far as
facts of present case and particularly the order by the learned
Tribunal is concerned, that the observations and directions in the
said order has extinguished the unregistered charge and the said
unregistered charge, upon expiry of period of one month after the
date of the order merged in the order of the Court. Accordingly as a
result of and in view of the above noted observations and directions,
the bank became entitled to realise its dues by sale of the immovable
properties in question. The charge created by act or conduct of the
parties / by a contract was kept alive for one month. During the said
period the charge continued to be matter of contract but after one
month the charge travelled into the realm of order of Court and
merged into the order. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_207">	Thus,
as held by the Apex Court, the non-registration of charge against the
immovable properties of the company is not hit by the requirement
under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_118">Section 125</a> of the Act and is not rendered void.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_208">20.
In this view of the matter, OL shall have to re-examine the claim and
/ or the objections of the applicant and other creditors as well as
by workers, in light of the legal position declared by the decision
in case of Indian Bank (supra). 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_209">21.	The
OL will also have to ascertain as to whether the four properties of
which reference has been made in the order passed by the learned
tribunal are personal properties of the directors / guarantors or
they were properties of the company. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_210">22.	The
OL will also have to ascertain as to whether any other properties
i.e. any properties other than the properties mentioned in the order
of the learned tribunal have been auction sold. If any other
properties not covered by / not mentioned in the learned Tribunal's
order are auction sold they would not get the protection or benefit
of the order of the learned tribunal because the protection of said
order would be available to the petitioner only qua the properties
mentioned in the said order dated 12.7.2004. Consequently if it is
found that there was no charge against the said properties or if
there was any charge it was not registered then the claim against
such properties would be governed by the provision under <a href="/doc/268030/" id="a_119">Section 125</a>
of the Act. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_211">23.	The
above mentioned aspects entail re-verification of the claim.
</p> 

 


 

<p id="p_212">24.	Therefore,
present application is disposed of with the clarification that OL
will consider and decide the claim of the applicant and other
creditors and the workers in light of the foregoing discussion and
accordingly determine the disbursement ratio. The OL will also verify
the aspects mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs. 
</p>
 

 


 

<p id="p_213">25.	If
OL considers it necessary then he may take assistance of chartered
accountant for the said purpose and also for the purpose of getting
the claims reverified by chartered accountant in light of the above
discussion. In such event the OL shall forward copy of present order
to the chartered accountant so as to enable the concerned chartered
accountant to examine the claims and relevant documents in accordance
with legal position settled by the Apex Court.
</p> 

<p id="p_214">	The
application is accordingly partly allowed. However, in the facts of
this case, no cost.
