      THIS WRIT APPEAL HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03.02.2021, ALONG WITH
WA.4/2021, WA.64/2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:
 WA Nos.4, 64 &amp; 126/2021              -4-

                             JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">             DATED THIS THE 3rd DAY OF FEBRUARY, 2021

Shaffique, J:
</p>
<p id="p_2">       These appeals have been filed by the State challenging common

judgment dated 03-09-2019 in W.P (C) Nos.5563, 9134 &amp; 20333/2019.

The substantial issue involved in these cases is with reference to

challenge made by the writ petitioners when an action had been taken

by the Taxation Department alleging escaped turnover on the ground

that the writ petitioners have sold the products under registered

trade mark though the registration certificate was received on a

future date. Contention urged by the Department was that when the

trade mark          registration becomes valid from the date of filing

application, they are liable to pay the tax which ought to have been

paid as a registered trade mark holder from the validity date though

the registration certificate was given only subsequently.

</p><p id="p_3">       2.     The writ petitioners had relied upon an earlier judgment of

this court in W.P (C) No.8888/2015 decided on 15-06-2016, wherein

a similar question had arisen in the matter. This court (myself) after

considering the effect of deeming provision under the Trade Mark Act

and referring to judgment in <a href="/doc/292181/" id="a_1">Meghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd. v.

Commissioner of Central Excise, U.P</a>.; [(2007) 3 SCC 780] held

that the deeming provision under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks Act</a> applies only to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> WA Nos.4, 64 &amp; 126/2021               -5-</span>

the provisions of the said Act and cannot be applied to any other

statute unless otherwise provided.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       3.     In the case on hand the learned Single Judge had also

taken note of the aforesaid principle and had allowed the writ petition

setting aside the assessments made. It was declared that the sale of

unregistered products which are subsequently registered does not

furnish cause of action for re-opening the assessments.

</p><p id="p_5">       4.     Learned Special Government Pleader while impugning the

judgment of the learned Single Judge tried to distinguish the law laid

down by the Apex Court in Meghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd.

(supra) while contending that the factual aspects involved in the said

case was entirely different from what has been decided in W.P (C)

No.8888/2015. But we don&#x27;t think so. Even in Meghraj Biscuits

Industries Ltd.           (supra), though the question was in regard to

claiming exemption as an SSI Unit, the Apex Court in paragraph 18

has clearly arrived at a finding regarding the effect of making the

registration certificate applicable from retrospective date. It is held

that the principle of deemed equivalence to public user of such mark

and the deeming fiction cannot be extended to the Excise Law.

Paragraph 18 reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      &quot;18. On reading the above quoted paragraphs from the above
      judgment, with which we agree, it is clear that the effect of
      making the registration certificate applicable from retrospective
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> WA Nos.4, 64 &amp; 126/2021                    -6-</span>

      date is based on the principle of deemed equivalence to public
      user of such mark. This deeming fiction cannot be extended to
      the Excise Law. It is confined to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_3">Trade
      Marks Act</a>. In a given case like the present case where there is
      evidence with the Department of the trade mark being owned by
      M/s. Kay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd. and where there is evidence of the
      appellants trading on the reputation of M/s. Kay Aar Biscuits (P)
      Ltd. which is not rebutted by the appellants (assessee), issuance
      of registration certificate with retrospective effect cannot confer
      the benefit of exemption Notification to the assessee. In the
      present      case,   issuance   of     registration   certificate   with
      retrospective effect from 30.9.91 will not tantamount to
      conferment of exemption benefit under the Excise Law once it is
      found that the appellants had wrongly used the trade mark of
      M/s. Kay Aar Biscuits (P) Ltd.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">Taking into consideration the law laid down as such, the issue is

squarely covered by Meghraj Biscuits Industries Ltd. (supra). We

don&#x27;t think that we will be justified in interfering with the judgment of

the learned Single Judge.
</p>
<p id="p_7">       Accordingly, these writ appeals are dismissed.
