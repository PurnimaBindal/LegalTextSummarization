The issue in this case is whether the respondents, Hindustan Coca Cola Limited and Coca Cola India Pvt Ltd., have infringed upon the appellants' (Pepsi Company Incorporation, Pepsico (India) Holdings Limited, and Pepsi Foods Limited) trade mark, copyright, and literary work by copying their commercial advertisement and discrediting their product through comparative advertising.
The appellants claimed exclusive rights in their roller coaster commercial, which the respondents copied, thereby infringing upon their copyright.
The respondents also discredited the appellants' product through comparative advertising, projecting it as a drink for kids and of inferior quality.
The appellants filed a suit against the respondents, which was contested by the respondents on the grounds that the Cola War is a matter of trade rivalry and a market place matter, and that there is no infringement of the appellants' roller coaster commercial.
The learned Single Judge dismissed the appellants' application for injunction, which is under challenge.
1.
Whether the respondents have infringed upon the appellants' trade mark by discrediting their product through comparative advertising?
2.
Whether the respondents have infringed upon the appellants' copyright and literary work by copying their commercial advertisement?
3.
Whether the appellants are entitled to an injunction against the respondents?
The court held that comparative advertising is permissible as long as it does not denigrate the product of the competitor.
However, if the manner of advertising is ridiculing or condemning the product of the competitor, it amounts to disparaging and is actionable.
The court also held that the use of the appellants' trade mark for comparative advertising does not ipso facto constitute infringement of their trade mark under Section 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1958.
The court further held that the use of the phrase "Yeh Dil Maange More" in the commercial advertisement can at best be mocking or parodying in the context it is used but does not amount to infringement of the appellants' trade mark.
The court also held that the copying of the elements of the appellants' cinematographic film by the respondents in their commercial constitutes infringement under Section 14 of the Copyright Act.
Therefore, the court granted an injunction against the respondents from using the appellants' commercial advertisement and ordered them to pay damages to the appellants.
The court reasoned that comparative advertising is permissible under Article 3(a) of Council Directive 84/450/EEC, provided it is not misleading and does not denigrate the product of the competitor.
The court also relied on the decision in Reckitt & Coleman v. Kiwi TTK Ltd, which held that comparative advertising is permissible subject to the rider that it does not denigrate the product of the appellant.
The court further reasoned that the use of the appellants' trade mark for comparative advertising does not ipso facto constitute infringement of their trade mark under Section 29(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1958, as it requires the usage in the course of trade of a mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the trade mark of the appellant.
The court also relied on the observation in R.G Anand v. Delux Films, which held that the copying of the cinematographic film must be identical in all respects to constitute infringement under Section 14 of the Copyright Act.
The court concluded that the respondents have infringed upon the appellants' copyright and literary work by copying their commercial advertisement, and have also infringed upon their trade mark by discrediting their product through comparative advertising.
Therefore, the court granted an injunction against the respondents from using the appellants' commercial advertisement and ordered them to pay damages to the appellants.
