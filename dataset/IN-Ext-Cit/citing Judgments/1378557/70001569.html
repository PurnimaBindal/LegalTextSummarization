</pre><p id="p_1">1.     This is a revision petition filed under <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_1">Section 25-B</a> of the Delhi Rent

Control Act, 1958 ("Act"), challenging the order of 21st September, 2013 of

the learned SCJ-cum-RC, Karkadooma Courts ("impugned order"). By the

impugned order, the learned ARC dismissed the application of the

petitioner-tenant ("tenant") seeking leave to defend and passing an order of

eviction against the tenant in Eviction Petition No. E-10 of 2013.

</p><p id="p_2">2.     The dispute can be traced back to an eviction petition filed by the

respondent-landlord ("landlord") before the learned ARC, wherein the

landlord sought eviction of the tenant from the suit property - a shop - on

the grounds of his bona fide requirement. The case of the landlord, who was




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                              Page 1 of 10</span>
</p><p id="p_3"> - at the time of filing of the petition before the ARC - about to retire, was

that he required the suit property for setting up a provisions / grocery store

for his son. He had submitted that after his retirement, he would not be able

to support his son and hence needs to set up a business for his son, who has

studied only till 7th standard and a daily wage earner. He had submitted that

he had no other suitable alternative accommodation for the same.

</p><p id="p_4">3.     It was admitted that on the ground floor of the building containing the

suit property, there were three shops on the ground floor that belonged to the

landlord. Of the three shops, it was submitted, one was sold by the landlord

to one Ms. Gayatri Devi, in April, 2009 to meet the expenses of one of his

daughter's marriage, one was being used by the landlord's other daughter for

running a beauty parlour, and the third is the suit property. The tenant,

before the ARC filed an application seeking leave to defend the petition and

raised four grounds:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">       (i) There are four shops on the ground floor, not three as contended.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       The wall between the shop being used as a beauty parlour and the

       shop adjoining it might have been broken down to show the same as

       one shop instead of two. The landlord, although he is showing to have

       only three shops, is really in possession of four shops.
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                                Page 2 of 10</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">            (ii)       No beauty parlor is being run by the said daughter of the

           petitioner as alleged or otherwise and the shop said to have been

           run as the beauty parlour is available to the landlord.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">          (iii)      The tenant has spent a considerable amount as conversion

          charges towards the suit property.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">          (iv)       The landlord and his family members are already possessed

          of sufficient means - they have many commercial vehicles and

          have sufficient credit in bank. Thus the contention that the landlord

          needs the property to set up a shot or that his son is a daily wage

          earner is false and concocted.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_5">4.     The learned ARC, after considering the contentions of the landlord

and those of the tenant, as earlier observed, dismissed the application for

leave to defend. He reasoned as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       (i) It has already been admitted by the landlord that one of the shops

       on the ground floor has been sold. It is not believable that the wall

       between two shops adjoining the tenant's shop could have been taken

       down by the landlord without the tenant knowing of it. It is not even

       the case of the tenant that the wall has been taken down recently so as

       to defeat any claims of the tenant.
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                                   Page 3 of 10</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">        (ii) The tenant has not been able to lead any material to show that the

       ground floor has four shops. On the other hand, it is amply clear from

       the documents produced by the landlord that there are only three

       shops therein.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       (iii) The denial qua the daughter of the landlord not running any

       beauty parlour and of not being in possession of one of the shops is a

       mere bald denial and is fit to be ignored. While the landlord has

       produced the electricity bill of 2007 in the name of the said daughter

       in support of his submissions, the tenant has not even pleaded as to

       whose possession the shop is in or what business was being carried

       out thereform.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">       (iv) That the tenant has spent a large amount towards conversion

       charges is irrelevant in the context of this dispute.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       (v) The contention that the landlord and his family members are in

       possession of commercial vehicles or that they have sufficient credit

       in the bank is not relevant in considering whether the requirement of

       the landlord is bona fide.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       (vi) When the son of the landlord is shown to have studied only till

       the 7th standard, and not in possession of any shop to run any business




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                              Page 4 of 10</span>
        from, and when the landlord himself is shown to be a retired person

       who might be in need of further means to support his family, the bona

       fide requirement is clearly proven.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_6">5.     Thus reasoning, the learned ARC, by the impugned order, rejected

leave to defend and passed an order of eviction. The tenant has hence filed

the instant petition seeking revision of the impugned order.

</p><p id="p_7">6.     Before this Court, the counsel for tenant strenuously contended that

the learned ARC has misinterpreted and misconstrued the facts and

documents on record in passing the impugned order. Particular reliance was

placed on two documents:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">       (i) an agreement to sell between the landlord and Ms. Gayatri Devi,

and, (ii) of rent receipts issued in respect of the suit property. It was

submitted that since the agreement to sell referred to shop no. 697/4 and the

rent receipts referred to shop no. 697/3, it is indicative of the fact that the

ground floor has four shops and that the tenant is in possession of shop no. 3

and not shop no. 2 as alleged.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.     It was further contended that the site plan of the ground floor clearly

shows four shops and the landlord would have demolished one wall between




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                               Page 5 of 10</span>
 two shops to make it seem like one shop. Additionally, the tenant largely

reiterated his contentions before the ARC and submitted that the findings of

the ARC qua the same are incorrect and ought to be reversed.

</p><p id="p_10">8.     This court is unpersuaded by the contentions of the tenant, which are

issues of fact; it finds no infirmity with the findings of the learned ARC that

requires interference under the proviso to <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_2">section 25-B</a> of the Act. The

learned Supreme Court, even as early as in 1987, in the case of Sushila Devi

v Avinash Chandra Jain, (1987) 2 SCC 219, held that the scope of

jurisdiction of the High Court under the proviso to <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_3">Section 25-B</a> is wider

than that under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It held:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">       3. ...It is necessary to emphasise that unlike Section 115 of the
       Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 where the High Court's power
       of interference in revision touches jurisdiction, the power of the
       High Court to interfere in revision under sub-section (8) of
       <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_4">Section 25-B</a> of the Act is much wider in scope and enables the
       High Court to satisfy itself as to whether the decision rendered
       by the Rent Controller on the facts in issue is in accordance
       with law, that is to say, in accordance with the well-settled
       principles."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_11">9.     However, in the very next year, in the case of Hiralal Kapur v Prabhu

Choudhury, (1988) 2 SCC 172, the Supreme Court had opportunity to

clarify that the scope of jurisdiction, even if wider than that under Section




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                                Page 6 of 10</span>
 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, ought to not be exercised to enter

into the merits of the matter. It observed:
</p>
<p id="p_12">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">       "8. ...Though under <a href="/doc/828425/" id="a_5">Section 25(B)(8)</a> of the Delhi Rent Control
       Act the powers of the High Court are somewhat wider than
       similar powers of revision under Section 115 of the Civil
       Procedure Code, it is well established by a series of decisions
       of this Court that the power of revision under the Rent Control
       Acts does not entitle the High Court to enter into the merits of
       the factual controversies between the parties and to reverse
       findings of fact in this regard. It is sufficient, in this context, to
       refer to the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1378557/" id="a_6">Helper Girdharbhai v.
       Saiyed Mohmad</a> [(1987) 3 SCC 538] which reviewed earlier
       decisions. The decision in <a href="/doc/459568/" id="a_7">Sushila Devi v. Avinash Chandra
       Jain</a> [(1987) 2 SCC 219] to which counsel for the respondent
       referred, lays down no different principle."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_13">10.    On the issue of when the High Court can interfere with findings of the

learned ARC on questions of fact, the Supreme Court, in Ram Narain Arora

v Asha Rani, (1999) 1 SCC 141, held:
</p>
<p id="p_14">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">       "12. It is no doubt true that the scope of a revision petition
       under <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_8">Section 25-B(8)</a> proviso of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_9">Delhi Rent Control Act</a> is
       a very limited one, but even so in examining the legality or
       propriety of the proceedings before the Rent Controller, the
       High Court could examine the facts available in order to find
       out whether he had correctly or on a firm legal basis
       approached the matters on record to decide the case. Pure
       findings of fact may not be open to be interfered with, but
       (sic:if) in a given case, the finding of fact is given on a wrong
       premise of law, certainly it would be open to the revisional
       court to interfere with such a matter."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                                   Page 7 of 10</span>
<p id="p_15"> 11.    In a decision that reprised the dicta of the precedents and clarified as

to the limited scope of the provision, the Supreme Court, in Sarla Ahuja v

United India Insurance Co. Ltd., (1998) 8 SCC 119, observed:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "5. <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_10">Section 25-B</a> of the Act lays down "special procedure for
       the disposal of application for eviction on the ground of bona
       fide requirement". Sub-section (1) says that every application
       for recovery of possession on the ground specified in <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_11">Section
       14(1)(e)</a> of the Act shall be dealt with in accordance with the
       procedure specified in <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_12">Section 25-B</a>. Sub-section (8) says that
       no appeal or second appeal shall lie against an order for the
       recovery of possession of any premises made by the Rent
       Controller in accordance with the procedure specified in this
       section. The proviso to that sub-section reads thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">              "Provided that the High Court may, for the purpose of
       satisfying itself   that an order      made by the Controller
       under this section is according to     law, call for the records
       of the case and pass such order in respect thereto as it thinks
       fit."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "6. The above proviso indicates that power of the High Court is
       supervisory in nature and it is intended to ensure that the Rent
       Controller conforms to law when he passes the order. The
       satisfaction of the High Court when perusing the records of the
       case must be confined to the limited sphere that the order of the
       Rent Controller is "according to the law". In other words, the
       High Court shall scrutinize the records to ascertain whether
       any illegality has been committed by the Rent Controller in
       passing the order under <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_13">Section 25-B</a>. It is not permissible for
       the High Court in that exercise to come to a different fact
       finding unless the finding arrived at by the Rent Controller on
       the facts is so unreasonable that no Rent Controller should
       have reached such a finding on the materials available.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "7. Although, the word "revision" is not employed in the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">RC. REV. NO.6/2014                                               Page 8 of 10</span>
        proviso to <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_14">Section 25-B(8)</a> of the Act, it is evident from the
       language used therein that the power conferred is revisional
       power. In legal parlance, distinction between appellate and
       revisional jurisdiction is well understood. Ordinarily, appellate
       jurisdiction is wide enough to afford a rehearing of the whole
       case for enabling the appellate forum to arrive at fresh
       conclusions untrammelled by the conclusions reached in the
       order challenged before it. Of course, the statute which
       provides appeal provision can circumscribe or limit the width
       of such appellate powers. Revisional power, on the contrary, is
       ordinarily a power of supervision keeping subordinate
       tribunals within the bounds of law. Expansion or constriction of
       such revisional power would depend upon how the statute has
       couched such power therein. In some legislations, revisional
       jurisdiction is meant for satisfying itself as to the regularity,
       legality or propriety of proceedings or decisions of the
       subordinate court. <a href="/doc/1047289/" id="a_15">In Sri Raja Lakshmi Dyeing Works v.
       Rangaswamy Chettiar</a> [(1980) 4 SCC 259] this Court
       considered the scope of the words ("the High Court may call
       for and examine the records ... to satisfy itself as to the
       regularity of such proceedings or the correctness, legality or
       propriety of any decision or order ...") by which power of
       revision has been conferred by a particular statute. Dealing
       with the contention that the above words indicated conferment
       of a very wide power on the revisional authority, this Court has
       observed thus in the said decision: (SCC p. 262, para 3)

                      "The dominant idea conveyed by the incorporation
               of the words „to satisfy itself‟ under <a href="/doc/828425/" id="a_16">Section 25</a> appears
               to be that the power conferred on the High Court under
               <a href="/doc/828425/" id="a_17">Section 25</a> is essentially a power of superintendence.
               Therefore, despite the wide language employed in
               <a href="/doc/1483303/" id="a_18">Section 25</a> the High Court quite obviously should not
               interfere with findings of fact merely because it does not
               agree with the finding of the subordinate authority."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_16"> 12.    Given the above, it is amply clear that the jurisdiction of this Court in

exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_19">Section 25-B</a> has to be to a limited extent and

only to ensure that the findings of facts are in accordance with law. The

tenant, by this petition, is praying that the court upset the reasoned findings

of the learned ARC in the impugned order. The findings of the learned ARC

on the basis of the documents on record is a possible interpretation and is

reasonable, based on the documents on record. Given the same, this Court

does not find it appropriate to substitute the reasoned findings of the learned

ARC with any other possible opinion.

<p id="p_17">13.    For the above reasons, the petition is dismissed.
