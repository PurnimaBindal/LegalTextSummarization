Did the defendants breach confidentiality?
Did the defendants infringe on the plaintiff's copyright?
Is the plaintiff entitled to ad-interim relief?
The court finds that the defendants breached confidentiality and infringed on the plaintiff's copyright of a literary work.
The plaintiff is entitled to ad-interim relief.
The court finds that the plaintiff passed on information regarding "her concept" and the format of the program in "concept notes" to the defendants in confidence.
The defendants used that idea to create their own television program with other actresses.
Even in a case where there is a threat to use such information passed on in confidence, the plaintiff would be entitled to protection.
The court also notes that substantial part of the plaintiff's work has been lifted in the defendants' program titled "Summer Showdown".
The dissimilarities pointed out by the defendants are trivial and insignificant to answer the point in issue.
Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to ad-interim relief on the ground of infringement of copyright of plaintiff's literary work in relation to the program titled "Work in Progress".
