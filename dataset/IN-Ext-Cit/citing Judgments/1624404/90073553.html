2.         In   the   present   case,   all   the   convicts,   namely,  Sri   Kant 

           Chawla (A­1), Sushil Verma (A­2) and Jagpal Singh Chaney  

           (A­3),   have   been  convicted  for   the   offence   punishable

           Verma(A­2),  has   been   convicted,   in   addition,   for   the 

           offences   punishable   under  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_14">sections  420</a>   &amp;   <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_15">471</a>   IPC. 

           Convict, Jagpal Singh Chaney (A­3) has been convicted, in 

           addition, for the offences punishable under  <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_16">sections  420</a>,

3.         It has been strongly contended   on behalf of the State by 

           the Ld. Sr. PP for the CBI  that this is a corruption case, in 

           which,   the   convicts   have   been   convicted,   as   they   were 

           operating as an organised racket and have caused illegal 

           huge   pecuniary   loss   to   the  State   Bank   of   Bikaner   and 

 CBI vs. Sri Kant Chawla &amp; Ors.                                                2 of 135 pages

                                                                            CBI case . No.12/11 

           Jaipur,  Govt.   of   India   Undertaking.       That   they   have 

           cheated   the said bank to the tune of  Rs. 5,46,33,317.50. 

           They have, therefore, caused loss to the public exchequer 

           of   the   said  amount.    It  has  further  been   stated   that   the 

           amount, to the extent to which the Government has been 

           cheated, was not a small amount as the case   pertains to 

           the period prior to the year 2006, when it was a huge and 

           fat  amount.

               

4.         The   State   has   further   contended   that   the   maximum 

           prescribed   substantive   punishment   with   fine   be   handed 

           over to all the convicts, so that enough and clear  message 

           goes   to   one   and   all   and   especially   to   the   potential 

           offenders,   who   are   in   the   waiting   to   commit   such   like 

           frauds so that the punishment act as a deterrence and the 

           intent  of the legislature is fulfilled. 



5.         Convict Sri Kant Chawla, has prayed that a lenient view be 

           taken on  the  ground  that    there  is no allegation  against 

           him that he  has been benefited even with  single  penny. 

           That he has an old and ailing   mother of 80 years of age. 

           That he is the only male member in the family to support 

           his wife and  son, who is bed ridden.   That he, himself, has

                                                                            CBI case . No.12/11 

           also been afflicted with health problems. 



6.         Convict  Sushil  Verma  has   submitted   that   he   is  afflicted 

           with heart ailments and has undergone bye pass surgery. 

           That he has only  a daughter  in his family, who is living 

           alone  and there is no one else to support her.  That he is 

           ready to pay the outstanding amount. 



7.         Convict  Jagpal Singh Chaney  too prayed for lenient view 

           stating   that   he   is   63   years   of   age   and   is   afflicted   with 

           various ailments like - high Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, 

           etc.  That he is also suffering from Glucoma and is unable 

           to   see   properly.     That   he   has   not   been   convicted 

           previously.  He has, however,  been convicted  in another 

           case also by this Court.



8.         All   the   convicts   have,   thus,   prayed   for   a   lenient   view. 

           They all have prayed  for release on probation.  



9.         The contentions, raised by the the convicts, have met stiff 

           and very strong opposition on behalf of the State.   It has 

           been urged that convict Sri Kant Chawla, the then public 

           servant, has been convicted,  in as many as three different 


 <a href="/doc/1875620/" id="a_20">CBI vs. Sri Kant Chawla &amp; Ors</a>.                                                4 of 135 pages
                                                             5
                                                                            CBI case . No.12/11 

           cases as he had illegally and dishonestly sanctioned loans/ 

           Cash   Credit   Limits   on   the   basis   of   false   and   fraudulent 

           documents in the year 2006, when it was quite a big sum. 

           It   has,   further,   been     stated   on   behalf   of   the   State   that 

           being a public servant at the relevant time, convict Sri Kant 

           Chawla   acted   corruptly   with   full   vigour,   in   sanction   of 

           loan,   one   after   the   other   and   then   allowed   abnormal 

           overdraft payments illegally without informing the higher 

           authorities,   with   a   view   to   benefit   his   son,   who   was   a 

           partner with convict Sushil Verma in another firm.    It has, 

           therefore,   been   urged     that   this   convict     is   a   habitual 

           offender and was the Kingpin  in defrauding the bank and 

           deserves maximum punishment. 



10.        Similarly, it is stated that convict Jagpal Singh Chaney is 

           held guilty in two cases.   it is stated that in pursuance to 

           the   systematic   and   well­planned   conspiracy,   he   forged 

           valuation reports/documents in respect  of a non­existent 

           property and acted in connivance with other convicts in 

           this case.  



11.        Regarding the convict Sushil Verma, it is stated that he was 

           the beneficiary of the big fraudulent loan and huge illegal

                                                             6
                                                                            CBI case . No.12/11 

           over­drawn amount.     That he pocketed the loan money 

           and   then   in   connivance   with   other   co­convict   drew 

           overdraft money amounting to more than Rs. Five Crores, 

           in this case, to which   he was not legally entitled to.     He 

           has successfully cheated Public Sector Bank i.e.  State Bank 

           of   Bikaner   and   Jaipur,   Nagal   Raya   Branch,   using   bogus 

           collateral security and duped the public money  alongwith 

           other   convicts.    That   he  is  not  entitled  to   any   mercy   or 

           compassion. 



12.        It is further urged on behalf of the State that most of the 

           pleas taken by the convicts   are routine and stock pleas 

           and   in   any   case,   in   the   case   under   the   <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_22">Prevention   of 

           Corruption Act</a>,   these pleas taken   are not considered as 

           mitigating circumstances.  It has, therefore,  been  prayed 

           that exemplary punishment   be awarded to the convicts 

           herein.  

13.        On behalf of the CBI, following case law have been cited:

14.        On behalf of the convicts, no case law has been cited.



15.        At the very outset, it is observed that there is no quarrel 

           over   the   settled   propositions   of   law   discussed   in   the 

           aforesaid case law, cited.



16.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case law, reported as  Dr. 

           Subramanyam Swami    Vs. Dr. Manmohan Singh,  2012, 

           AIR(SC) page 1185, has observed that ­:

                                "The magnitude of corruption in our public 
                      life is incompatible with the concept of socialistic  
                      secular democratic public.  The duty of the Court  
                      is   that   any   anti   corruption   law   has   to   be  
                      interpreted and worked out in such a fashion as to  
                      strengthen to fight against corruption."

17.        It has further been observed in the same case that   "In a 

           situation   where   two   constructions   are   eminently  

           reasonable,  the Court  has to accept  the one  that  seeks  to  

           eredicate  corruption  to the one which seeks to perpetuate 

           it."



18.                   It   has   been   held   in   case   reported   as  Narendra 

           Champak Lal Trivedi   Vs. State  of Gujrat,  2012 (7) SCC 

           page 80 that­:                   "Corruption   at   any   level   does   not  

           deserve either  sympathy or leniency."  



19.        The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Rajasthan 

           Vs. Vinod  Kumar,  decided  on,  18th  May,  2012 (Criminal  

           Appeal No. 1887) reiterated   the law laid down in State of 

           J&amp;K   Vs.   Vinay Nanda,  AIR 2001 SC P 611,  and observed 

           that  superannuation of the convict   and the pendency   of  

           criminal  trial  for over a period of time cannot  be treated  a  

           special reason to reduce  the sentence.   



20.        In   the   same   appeal   quoting   'M   B   Joshi   Vs.   State     of 

           Maharashtra, AIR 2001 SC 147' the Hon'ble   Apex   Court 

           observed that­:

                      "Corruption   at any level, by any person, 
                      of any magnitude, is condemnable, which

                      when proved.   No leniency is required   to  
                      be   shown     in   proved   cases   under     the

                      the   agony   of   the   society   and   the 
                      complainant   who   dared     lodge   the  
                      complaint.   The   entire   purpose   of   the 
                      legislature   of   sentencing   the   offenders  
                      stands defeated  and that is the one reason  
                      that   wages   of   corruption   are   considered  
                      more   attractive     in   this   country.     The  
                      person caught is not always   a first­timer  
                      corrupt.       He   may   have   been   indulging  
                      into     corrupt   activities   /   practices   for   a  
                      long   number     of   years.       It   is   to   his  
                      advantage that the trial is prolonged.   He  
                      spends   a   fraction   of   amount,   earned   by 
                      corrupt   practices   on   litigation   and 
                      professionals     to   see   that   ultimately     he  
                      makes     Criminal     Justice   System     a  
                      laughing stock.   In this process, the entire  
                      legislative purpose of punishing a corrupt  
                      stands defeated.

                      be   ensured.   If   such   public   servants   are 
                      open to corruption and coerce   the public  
                      into paying them illegal gratification, the 
                      whole   structure   of   the   society   would   be  
                      upset   and   the   policy   of   the   Government  
                      and   of   the   Legislature,   howsoever,  
                      beneficial it may be, would gravely suffer.  
                      A   public   servant,   therefore,   once   he   is  
                      found   to   be   guilty   of   accepting   or 
                      obtaining illegal gratification, deserves no 
                      soft corner or indulgence from the Courts  
                      of Law."

                       "When   corruption   was   sought   to   be  
                       eliminated   from   the   polity   all   possible  
                       stringent   measures   are   to   be   adopted 
                       within   the   bounds   of   law.   One   such  
                       measure   is   to   provide   condign 
                       punishment.   Parliament   measured   the 
                       parameters  for such condign punishment  
                       and   in   that   process   wanted   to   fix   a  
                       minimum   sentence   of   imprisonment   for 
                       giving   deterrent   impact   on   other   public 
                       servants who are prone   to corrupt deals. 
                       That   was   precisely   the   reason   why   the  
                       sentence     was   fixed   as   seven   years   and  
                       directed     that   even   if   the   said   period   of  
                       imprisonment   need   not   be   given,   the 
                       sentence   shall   not   be   less   than   the 
                       imprisonment   for   one   year.   Such   a 
                       legislative   insistence     is   reflection   of 
                       Parliament's   resolve     to   meet   corruption  
                       cases with very strong hand to give signals  
                       of deterrence as the most pivotal feature of  
                       sentencing  of  corrupt  public  servants. All 
                       public servants   have to face very serious  
                       consequences.     If   on   the   other   hand   any  
                       public servant  is given the impression that  
                       if   he   succeeds   in   protracting   the 
                       proceedings that would help him to have  
                       the   advantage   of   getting   a   very   light 
                       sentence   even   if   the   case   ends   in 
                       conviction,   its   fallout   would   afford

                       susceptible   to   corruption   to   indulge   in  
                       such   nefarious   practices   with   immunity.

                       imprisonment   to   a   nominal   period   can 
                       also   defeat   the   purpose   as   the   corrupt  
                       public servants could   easily raise the fine

           conspiracy is that  the required  objective manifestation  of  

           disposition   to   criminality   is   provided   by   the   act   of 

           agreement.   Conspiracy   is   a   clandestine   activity.   Persons  

           generally   do   not  form   illegal   covenants   openly.   In   the  

           interest  of  security,   a  person  may  carry   out   his   part   of  a  

           conspiracy without even being informed of the identity of  

           his co­conspirators. An agreement of this kind can rarely be

           circumstantial evidence of what lies in their minds".

           "Regarding   admissibility   of   evidence,   loosened  
           standards prevail in a conspiracy trial. Contrary to 
           the   usual   rule,   in   conspiracy   prosecutions,   any 
           declaration by one conspirator, made in furtherance  
           of   a   conspiracy   and   during   its   pendency,   is  
           admissible against each co­conspirator. Despite the  
           unreliability of hearsay evidence, it is admissible in  
           conspiracy prosecutions. Thus conspirators are liable  
           on agency theory  for statements  of  co­conspirators,  
           just   as   they   are   for   the   overt   acts   and   crimes
