challenge      the   orders     dated     17.2.2010        and    10.3.2010

Additional      Chief     Judicial       Magistrate        No.2,    Udaipur

taking    cognizance       against       the    petitioners         for   the

<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">            The factual matrix, necessary to be noticed

is that petitioner Subhash Chandra while working as

Chief    Manager,     Union     Bank     of    India,      New    Fatehpura

Branch, Udaipur,        found     that      Shri     Bharat      Kumar, the

Head Cashier of the branch, misused his position and

embezzled a sum of Rs.35,81,900/-, thus, lodged an FIR

at   Police     Station    Amba      Mata      and   on    that     basis   a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                         2</span>

criminal    case     was    registered.            After      completion      of

investigation a         charge     sheet        was    filed    and    charges

against Bharat Kumar were framed.



</p><p id="p_6">            The trial court recorded the statements of

the     prosecution        witnesses          including         the    present

petitioners       and      the     accused          Bharat       Kumar      also

explained the circumstances appearing against him in

evidence.    The     arguments          in    the      case    commenced     on

16.11.2009 and were also to be heard on 25.11.2009.

The trial court on 25.11.2009 suo moto took cognizance

against     the    present        petitioners          for     the    offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_7">Sections 409</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_8">120-B</a> Indian Penal

Code     while    exercising            powers        under     <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_9">Section      319</a>

Cr.P.C.,    the     petitioners             were   accordingly        summoned

through a warrant of arrest. The cognizance against

accused Bharat Kumar was also taken for the offences

punishable under <a href="/doc/1131784/" id="a_10">Sections 408</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_11">120-B</a> Indian Penal

Code.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">            The trial court was of the view that huge

amount    from    the    bank's         chest      could      have    not   been

embezzled without the connivance and consent of the

present     petitioners          and,       therefore,        apprehended      a

conspiracy.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10">            Being       aggrieved            by       the     order      taking

cognizance the petitioners preferred separate revision

petitions before the learned Sessions Judge and those
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                         3</span>

came to be rejected on 17.2.2010 and 10.3.2010, hence

these misc. petitions are preferred.



</p><p id="p_11">             While     pressing             these     petitions,        it    is

submitted    by     counsel       for       the     petitioners     that     the

cognizance against the petitioners are taken merely on

basis   of   a     bald   suspicion,           based    on     some     alleged

negligence and that is not sufficient to take motion

as per provisions of <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_12">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C.



</p><p id="p_12">             Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor quite

straneously submitted that the present petitioners are

responsible officers of the bank and two sets of keys

of chest could not have been handed over to Bharat

Kumar by them without having a definite role in a

criminal conspiracy, thus, the cognizance under the

order impugned was rightly taken.



</p><p id="p_13">             Heard counsel for the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_14">

             The     trial    court          under      the     order    dated

25.11.2009 took cognizance of the offences punishable

under <a href="/doc/1131784/" id="a_13">Sections 408</a>, <a href="/doc/1326844/" id="a_14">409</a> and <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_15">120-B</a> Indian Penal Code

with the factual background that during the course of

recording evidence,          it    revealed that              the   bank keys

were handed over by petitioner K.L.Jat to Bharat Kumar

Lodha and on 13.8.2008 the safe was closed by Bharat

Kumar Lodha in presence of petitioner Balwant Singh.

As per the prescribed norms, the officers of the bank
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                         4</span>

should have kept one key with them and, another with

Bharat Kumar Lodha and both the sets of keys could

have not been given to one officer. Looking to the

wrong committed, by handing over two sets of keys to

Bharat        Kumar,     the     trial        court     presumed       strong

suspicion regarding participation of the petitioners

in criminal conspiracy.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">               Precisely, the issue requires determination

is that whether the trial court after examining the

present petitioners as prosecution witnesses and also

getting explanation from accused Bharat Kumar could

have   taken      cognizance       as       impugned,    on    basis    of   a

suspicion?

               in appropriate situations. This section is
               extracted below:--</blockquote><p id="p_19">


</p><p id="p_20">               "319.Power to proceed against other persons
               appearing to be guilty of offence.--(1)
               Where, in the course of any inquiry into, or
               trial of, an offence, it appears from the
               evidence that any person not being the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                  5</span>

accused has committed any offence for which
such person could be tried with the accused,
the Court may proceed against such person for
the   offence  which he    appears   to  have
committed.
</p>
<p id="p_21">
(2)Where such person is not attending the
Court, he may be arrested or summoned, as the
circumstances of the case may require, for
the purpose aforesaid.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
(3)Any person attending the Court, although
not under arrest or upon a summons, may be
detained by such Court for the purpose of the
inquiry into, or trial of, the offence which
he appears to have committed.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
(4)Where the Court proceeds       against   any
person under sub-sec.(1) then--
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">(a)the proceedings in respect of such person
shall be commenced afresh, and witnesses re-
heard;
</p><p id="p_26">(b)subject to the provisions of Cl.(a), the
case may proceed as if such person had been
an accused person when the Court took
cognizance of the offence upon which the
inquiry of trial was commenced."
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">11.The basic requirements of invoking the
above section is that it should appear to the
Court from the evidence collected during
trial or in the inquiry that some other
person, who is not arraigned as an accused in
that case, has committed an offence for which
that person could be tried together with the
accused already arraigned. It is not enough
that the Court entertained some doubt, from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                  6</span>

the evidence, about the involvement of
another person in the offence. In other
words,   the  Court   must  have    reasonable
satisfaction   from   the  evidence    already
collected regarding two aspects. First is
that the other person has committed an
offence. Second is that for such offence that
other person could as well be tried along
with the already arraigned accused.


</p><p id="p_29">12.But even then, what is conferred on the
Court is only a discretion as could be
discerned from the words "the Court may
proceed    against    such    person".    The
discretionary power so conferred should be
exercised only to achieve criminal justice.
It is not that the Court should turn against
another person whenever it comes across
evidence connecting that another person also
with the offence. A Judicial exercise is
called for, keeping a conspectus of the case,
including the stage at which the trial has
proceeded already and the quantum of evidence
collected till then, and also the amount of
time which the Court had spent for collecting
such evidence. It must be remembered that
there is no compelling duty on the Court to
proceed against other persons.

Kishan Rohtagi &amp; Ors</a>., (1983)1 SCC 1, this
Court has truck a note of caution, while
considering whether prosecution can produce
evidence to satisfy the Court that other
accused against whom proceedings have been
quashed or those who have not been arrayed as
accused, have also committed an offence in
order to enable the Court to take cognizance
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                 7</span>

           against them and try them along with the
           other accused. This was how learned Judges
           then cautioned:--
</p>
<p id="p_32">
           "But we would hasten to add that this is
           really an extra-ordinary power which is
           conferred on the Court and should be used
           very sparingly and only if compelling reasons
           exist for taking cognizance against the other

           the power u/s.319<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_20"> of the Code</a>, must address
           itself about the other constraints imposed by
           the   first   limb   of   sub-sec.(4),   that
           proceedings in respect of newly added persons
           shall be commenced afresh and the witnesses
           re-examined. The whole proceedings must be
           re-commenced from the beginning of the trial,
           summon the witnesses once again and examine
           them and cross-examine them in order to reach
           the stage where it had reached earlier. If
           the witnesses already examined are quite a
           large in number the Court must seriously
           consider whether the objects sought to be
           achieved by such exercise is worth wasting
           the whole labour already undertaken. Unless
           the Court is hopeful that there is reasonable
           prospect of the case as against the newly
           brought accused ending in conviction of the
           offence concerned we would say that the Court
           should refrain from adopting such a course of
           action."

</p><p id="p_40">21.An order under <a href="/doc/1138947/" id="a_27">Section 319</a> of the Code,

Sufficient and cogent reasons are required to
be assigned by the court so as to satisfy the
ingredients of the provisions. Mere ipse

an evidence must be convincing one at least
for   the   purpose    of   exercise    of   the
extraordinary      jurisdiction.     For     the
aforementioned    purpose,    the   courts   are
required to apply stringent tests; one of the
tests being whether evidence on record is

</p><p id="p_42">22.The observation of this Court in MCD and
other decisions following the same is that
mere existence of a prima facie case may not
serve the purpose. Different standards are
required to be applied at different stages.
Whereas the test of prima facie case may be
sufficient for taking cognizance of an
offence at the stage of framing of charge,
the court must be satisfied that there exists
a strong suspicion. While framing charge in
terms of <a href="/doc/470297/" id="a_28">Section 227</a> of the Code, the court
must consider the entire materials on record
to form an opinion that the evidence if
unrebutted would lead to a judgment of

           question. The answer to these questions
           should be rendered in the affirmative. Unless

           an opinion to summon a person as an

           The same issue was also considered in <a href="/doc/1976721/" id="a_30">Ram

Singh and others v. Ram Niwas and another</a>, reported in

(2009)14 SCC 25, and it was held that "the provision

of <a href="/doc/1138947/" id="a_31">Section 319</a> of the Code confers an extraordinary

power upon a court to summon a person who, at the

relevant   time,   was    not    being    tried   as   an    accused,

subject,   of   course,   to     fulfilment    of    the    condition

that it appears to the court that he had committed an

offence. A finding to that effect must be premised on

the   evidence     that    had    been     brought     on    record.

Indisputably, the court must satisfy itself about the

existence of an extraordinary situation enabling it to

exercise   an    extraordinary        jurisdiction.    It    is   true

that the court is not denuded of its power to exercise

the said jurisdiction only because a person named as

an accused in the FIR was not charge-sheeted as a

result whereof no cognizance has been taken against

him. What is necessary for the said purpose is that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                              11</span>

the person concerned was not being tried as an accused

before the court at that stage." In the same case it

was also held that for exercising powers under <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_32">Section

319</a> Cr.P.C. it is necessary for the court to arrive at

a satisfaction that the evidence adduced on behalf of

conviction of the persons sought to be added as the

accused in the case.

</p><p id="p_49">           The         trial      court,      in    the       instant     matter

apprehended involvement of the petitioners in criminal

conspiracy only for the reason that both the keys of

the chest, as per the norms, could not have been given

to Bharat Kumar. The court drew an inference regarding

involvement       of     the       petitioners          on    basis     of    the

statements    given          by     themselves.          True    it     is,   the

petitioners stated that two sets of the keys could

have not been given to one officer, but that assertion

in   itself       is     not       adequate        to    presume        definite

participation           of        the    petitioners            in      criminal

conspiracy. It may be good reason for the employer to

take disciplinary action against the petitioners, but

that is not at all sufficient to reach at a conclusion

about the possible conviction of the petitioners, if

remains unrebutted. The trial court, as a matter of

fact exercised an extraordinary power available to it

in quite a casual manner. The evidence available is

required     to    be        examined        by    the       trial    court    in

accordance with the law discussed above and only by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 13</span>

getting satisfied about a definite conclusion, in the

event of not having an adequate rebuttal. The trial

court has not considered the issue as per the law

settled. The revisional court also utterly failed to

examine the matter on merits and by simply stating

that the cognizance order does not suffer from any

illegality, rejected the revision petition. In view of

the   reasons    given    above,     I     am    of   the    considered

opinion that vide the order dated 25.11.2009 the trial

court    exercised     powers   under      <a href="/doc/435819/" id="a_36">Section        319</a>     Cr.P.C.,

without having any legal foundation, thus, the order

impugned is bad.
