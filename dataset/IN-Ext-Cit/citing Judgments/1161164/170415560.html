     • Strategic Management functions: Bahwan India is responsible
     for all management functions of corporate strategy, treasury, legal

     operations. Bahwan Oman together with Bahwan India plays a
     significant role in determining the business strategy of the group.

     receivables, employee management, management information

<p id="p_9">     • Marketing/Business development: AEs formulate the
     making strategy and are responsible for marketing the products/
     services offered by Bahwan Group. As each AE is the front-end
     contact for the customers in its region, it undertakes lead generation,
     marketing and sales activity for the products/ services provided to
     the customers. It is responsible for maintaining and developing
     relationship with its customers and is therefore responsible for
     expanding the business. Bahwan India does not undertake any

marketing and business development functions within India.
</p>
<p id="p_10">• Conceptualisation and design of the product: Bahwan India
in consultation with the AEs is responsible for conceptualization and
design of the product.
</p>
<p id="p_11">• Functional specification and requirement analysis: Bahwan
India determines the requirement analysis and functional
specification of the software module to be developed. AEs initiate
performance analysis to validate the appropriateness of the
functional specifications of the modules to be designed and
developed by Bahwan India to a certain extent.
</p>
<p id="p_12">• Coding and documentation: Bahwan India undertakes software
coding and also generates and maintains documentation for the code
generated.
</p>
<p id="p_13">• Project management: Bahwan India and its AEs jointly
undertake project management. AEs provides information (as
required) in order to provide clarity in respect of the work to be
performed. Bahwan India interacts regularly with its AEs and
project tracking happens through e-mails and conference calls. This
ensures close co-ordination, quality control and minimal rework in
the development process. AEs are responsible for monitoring and
co-ordinating the       development     of the    entire  software
product/solution to be provided to the customer.
</p>
<p id="p_14">• Quality control and Testing: Bahwan India is responsible for the
quality of work undertaken by it based on pie-defined quality
control procedures. However, both Bahwan India and its AEs are
jointly responsible for the final acceptance testing of the software
product.
</p>
<p id="p_15">• After Sales Support: Bahwan India provides after sales support
to the customers through Call Centers and also, in the form of
Annual Maintenance Contracts. Similarly, AEs render after sales
support services to the customers through designated Customer
Relationship Managers. However, based on the agreement between
the customer and AE and/or Bahwan India, the support services are
rendered either from by Bahwan India and/or AEs. Also, the costs in
respect of these services are shared by Bahwan India and its AEs,
akin to the revenue sharing model.

            Adopting TNMM as the most appropriate method to
</pre><p id="p_19">     substantiate the arm&#x27;s lengthiness of its transaction with the AEs, the
     assessee has short-listed 25 comparable companies after applying
     certain filters in Prowess and Capital Line database. The 3 years
     weighted average margin calculation of the comparable companies
     after providing working capital adjustment is 1.85%.
</p>
<p id="p_20">     As against this the assessee has declared margin of 10.23% as
     operating profit/Operating cost after making economic adjustments
     towards product development expenses, unabsorbed expenses
     including depreciation and domestic transaction. Based on the above,
     the taxpayer holds the transaction to be within arm&#x27;s length.&#x27;

Here, it may be relevant to mention two things:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">      a). the remuneration model consistently adopted by the assessee for
      sharing the revenue between itself and its Associate Enterprises (AEs) is
      70:30 for software development and 60:40 for product development.
      These ratios are based on contract value, and exclude third-party costs
      and cost attributable to on-site services; and

     The Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO), upon Functional &amp; Risk (FAR)
analysis, rejecting the assessee&#x27;s report, held as under computing the ALP
accordingly:
</p><p id="p_22">&#x27;7.6 Attribution of income between the AE and the Assessee:
</p><p id="p_23">       During the course of the assessement proceedings the assessee was required to
furnish the TP pricing policy .........
</p>
<p id="p_24">   • The assessee has (not) furnished any Master Service Agreements
     that would delineate the revenue split ratio between the AEs and
     the assessee. The assessee has merely stated that revenue split ratio
     has been formulated and fine-tuned by the assessee and its AEs
     over years of experience. No basis has been given for the figures.
     Documentations and computations supporting the respective
     allocation, details of expected revenue flows, cost-benefit analyses
     which would support the assessee&#x27;s claim have not been provided.
     In the absence of the above, the assessee has not established that
     the entities involved have employed any reason and competitive
     market analysis to accept that the numbers as well as the division.
     This makes the entire contract between the assessee and the AE
     opaque wherein the evolution, derivation and determination of the
     revenue split ratio is unavailable. In the absence of the above, the
     robustness, validity and reliability of the revenue split
     figures remain untestified and unjustified.
</p>
<p id="p_25">   • There are no checks and controls or the unprejudiced dynamics of
     markets and negotiations to hold the allocations to arm&#x27;s length
     equilibriums. This makes it all the more important that the
     allocations-attributions of revenues be above suspicion in that there
     is no attempt to lower the tax burden in the country, namely India,
     where the majority of the operations are performed. However in the
     case of the assessee, given that the allocation is done internally, it
     suffers from the lack of adequate sanctity and the danger of
     relativistic under-valuation and thereby profit-shifting.
</p>
<p id="p_26">   • Usually, an independent service provider would estimate the
     expenses to be incurred in operating a contract and providing a
     service, and employ project studies and analytics and generate a
     final figure of revenue share. In this instance, these have not
     supplied. Also no agreements as mentioned earlier have been
     furnished. Consequently under the assessee&#x27;s approach, there is no
     way of determining whether the Revenues have been attributed to
     the assessee on an arm&#x27;s length basis.
</p>
<p id="p_27">   • The FAR analysis of the assessee and the AE as outline vide para
     5.1 to 5.2 above shows that the assessee is concerned with all
     functions associated with software development viz requirement
     analysis, conceptualization and design, coding, testing, project
     management and after sale support. Hence the assessee company
     performed all the functions and assumed all the risks of an
     entrepreneurial enterprise. The AE is confined to liasoning work.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     6</span>

                                                 Bahwan CyberTek Pvt. Ltd. v. Asst</a>. CIT

   The functions are represented as below:
</p>



<p id="p_29">         In this situation, it is not known whether the revenue split
   meet the conditions of profitability usual for an entrepreneurial
   service provider of similar nature. It is also not known if the risk-
   adjusted returns of the assessee (both expected and real) meet the
   conditions of profitability that are usual for an entrepreneurial
   service provider of similar nature.
</p>
<p id="p_30">• Hence the assessee&#x27;s arithmetic and approach are not authentic
  because they represent an internal division through accounting
  apportionment between a Parent and its subsidiaries and there is no
  evidence that the revenue apportionment mentioned in its reply to
  show-cause are unqualifiedly sacrosanct and the same was
  explicitly put in place to protect the tax interests of the source
  country. Consequently, the assessee&#x27;s position on the sanctity
  of revenue sharing ratio with its AEs is rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_31">• Having rejected the assesse&#x27;s position, based on the FAR analysis
  demonstrated above and also based on study of comparables under
  TNMM, if the assessee&#x27;s margin is to be at ALP, the more
  appropriate revenue share with its AE would be 90:10 ratio.
  References are also drawn from Sec 44C of the Income Tax Act,
  wherein the section delineates the margin of 5% that can be
  retained for functions performed by the headoffice. It is to be noted
  that the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_7">section 44C</a> is not invoked here but only an inference is
  drawn to determine an appropriate revenue apportionment ratio
  between the Assessee and the AE. Considering the functions of the
  AE with regard to the transactions with the assessee, 5% of the total
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                       7</span>

      income from such transaction may be allocated in respect of
      expenditure incurred towards it and further allowing a 100%
      markup on the same, the revenue share between the Assessee and
      the AE for both software development and product development is
      determined on 90:10 proportion.
</p>
<p id="p_32">   • The assessee in its submission dated 12.01.2015 has presented a
     summary of the financial results of the AEs but has however not
     presented the total income arising from the transactions associated
     with the AEs and assessee to facilitate 90: 10 split of revenue.
     Hence the 70% split as given by the assessee is extrapolated to
     determine the 90: 10 split as follows:

       the AE would be (A)

3.1 The first issue, therefore, that arises for our consideration is if the TPO
ought to have, considering that he examined the assessee&#x27;s list of comparables
(17 in number) and, applying filters, accepted only five of them (refer para
7.3.1/pgs. 17-20 of the TPO&#x27;s order) and, further, selected four fresh
comparables (refer para 7.4/pgs. 21-22 of the TPO&#x27;s order), proceeded on that
basis, subjecting the assessee&#x27;s operating margin (i.e., operating profit
(OP)/operating cost (OC)) to the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)
test with reference to the comparables. The ancillary question would be the
selection of those comparables. This is as he, after selecting the comparables,
proceeded on a different footing, deciding the appropriate revenue sharing ratio,
which he does at 90:10 in the assessee&#x27;s favour. Considering the functions of the
AEs, in his view, a 5% (of the total revenue) would be sufficient to absorb the
costs suffered by the AEs, to which he added another 5% (i.e., 100 per cent of
cost) as margin, resulting in a revenue sharing of 90:10 in assessee&#x27;s favour.
</blockquote><p id="p_36">True, this does appear odd inasmuch as he had taken pains to examine the
assessee&#x27;s comparables; in fact, also searching some on his own. However, his
decision cannot be ousted merely because he undertook that exercise, which in
fact, to be relevant, is to be preceded by his agreement with the assessee&#x27;s
method (TNMM) as the most appropriate method (MAM). The stage of
crystallizing the comparables would be a matter subsequent, i.e., would stand to
be considered only after having decided the MAM. The crux of his finding, in
rejecting the TNMM as MAM, is that the AEs are confined to liaisoning work.
And two, that the assessee had not given any basis for the revenue sharing ratio
as adopted, which is also not supported by any agreement. In fact, considering

that the agreement is not with a third-party, but an associate entity, representing
an internal arrangement, which is the basis for the invocation of the TP
provisions, even that - the agreement between them, could not be regarded as
sacrosanct and the assessee shall have to necessarily disclose the basis of the
revenue split. The agreement would though clearly spell out the functional
areas, the roles and responsibilities of the two partners - the assessee and the
AE/s. Also relevant in the matter would be the agreement entered with third
parties, the assessee&#x27;s customers and recipient of its services inasmuch as it
would, we presume, specify both, the range of services and, two, which services
are to be provided by whom. No improvement in its case in this respect stands
made by the assessee even before us, i.e., by way of substantiating its case; the
agreement furnished on being called upon to, is dated 30.03.2012, so that it
would not govern the transactions for the relevant year. The ld. Authorized
Representative (AR) would argue that adopting the ratio, arbitrarily determined
by the TPO, would be insufficient to absorb the AEs regular costs, much less
yield a reasonable margin consistent with the functions performed and the risks
undertaken by them. That may well be true, and an ALP at a revenue split of
90:10 work to an operating loss for the AEs, but then it is for the assessee to
show so, without which it is no more than a bald statement. As regards the
charge of it being arbitrary, so is that by the assessee in the absence of any basis
for its ratio of revenue split being disclosed. In fact, an analysis of the operating
statement of the AEs, bearing their operating costs, would also exhibit what
functions they are performing, thereby effectively challenging, i.e., in
contradistinction to the TPO&#x27;s finding, affirmed by the ld. DRP, of the AEs
undertaking, in effect, only liasoning function, strongly objected to by the
assessee before us. The schematic representation of the business model,
reproduced above, it may be noted, is not disputed, so that the dispute, in
essence, is the appropriate share of the AEs, compensated uniformly by the

assessee, in the total revenue (excluding reimbursement of costs). It is this
arrangement which defines the international transactions in the instant case. And
it is this, therefore, that is to be tested. Describing it as &#x27;provision of software
services&#x27;, as the assessee does in its TP study (refer para 4 of the TPO&#x27;s order),
is an incorrect representation. In fact, the TPO does not abandon the
comparables selected, but subjects the assessee&#x27;s revenue, on the basis of the
sharing ratio of 90:10, to TNMM.
</p><p id="p_37">     Continuing further, what though cannot be denied is that the AE&#x27;s
functions being simpler by far, the same are much easier to analyze. It is well
settled that the least complex (economic) entity must be taken as the tested
party, which need not necessarily (and always) be the assessee. Why, for the
foreign tax jurisdiction, it is, on that premise, the AE that would be the tested
party. It is, therefore, the business and the economic functions, and accuracy
with which, consequently, the comparables can be crystallized, rather than the
geographical location or tax jurisdiction, that should be determinative of who is
to be regarded as the tested party. In our considered view, in the given facts of
the case, it is the assessee&#x27;s AEs, who should be the tested party. This is, in fact,
what both the TPO and the ld. DRP have, without explicitly saying so, found,
and which is manifest in their decision of the revenue split of 90:10, treating the
AEs as front-end offices, providing leads and facilitating effective
communication, a channel, between the assessee and its foreign customers, also
assuring them of backup support services, the responsibility for which, though,
is of the assessee, performing the core functions and, commensurately, incurring
nearly the whole of the cost. Yes, the assessee&#x27;s foreign subsidiaries have also
capital locked up in working capital assets abroad. But, again, it is the assessee
who bears the financial risk of the default, i.e., apart from the business risk of
non-payment on account of any flaw in the work undertaken/services rendered.
In fact, it is perhaps to avail the low cost of capital obtaining in developed

economies vis-à-vis India, that the assessee, instead of extending credit to its
AEs, required them to finance the receivables, availing bank credit in those
countries, while at the same time guaranteeing the said credit, so that, in effect,
it is it who has availed the bank credit. The financial cost, though, would be
borne only by the AEs, even as it is not clear if this business model and, thus,
extension of guarantee by the assessee, is to all the AEs availing bank credit.
This aspect, therefore, shall have to be examined. One thing, though, clear is
that if, as it appears, extension of corporate guarantee forms part of the business
model, on the basis of which FAR analysis is carried out, the same, though an
international transaction, is not to be separately benchmarked, and shall be
along with the other transactions. That is, the financial cost, though incurred by
the AE/s, would yet not entitle it to any return thereon as the corresponding
financial risk is borne by the assessee. Why, the TPO (and the ld. DRP) have
not, and, as it appears, for the same reason, not separately benchmarked the
international   transactions   by    way     of   reimbursement          of     expenses
received/receivable by the assessee as well as the expenses/payables reimbursed
(refer para 4/pg. 2 and para 7.6/pg. 29 of the TPO&#x27;s order). Similarly, under risk
analysis, the entire business and financial risk of the business/enterprise is to be
regarded as that of the assessee.
</p><p id="p_38">      In view of the foregoing, in our clear view, given the distribution of
economic functions, the AEs should be regarded as the tested party and their
profits benchmarked on the basis of MAM, be it the cost plus method or the
revenue split method or any other for that matter. The TPO shall properly show
cause the assessee in the matter, providing it an opportunity to raise objections
in this regard, as well and, equally importantly, to adduce comparables, which
shall require being examined/vetted by the TPO. This shall also meet the
assessee&#x27;s objection qua the ratio adopted being arbitrary and sans any basis.
Needless to add, the assessee shall be required to produce the relevant data, duly

assessment, including the documents furnished to the tax authorities, undertaken
or, as the case may be, completed in that country. The whole purport is to make
the exercise as objective and authentic as possible. As regards the TNMM,
which is even otherwise to be considered only where other more direct methods
of estimation fail, the same has already been regarded as inappropriate in the
absence of the assessee showing as to how the revenue split adopted is
consistent with the functions undertaken and risks assumed, or even the costs
incurred. The Revenue&#x27;s approach also cannot be approved for the same reason;
it applying TNMM by substituting its ratio for that adopted by the assessee. This
is impermissible, unless of course there is empirical evidence in support of the
ratio adopted, which is also the fundamental flaw in the assessee&#x27;s case.
</p>
<p id="p_39">3.2   Coming, next, to the aspect of the vetting of the assessee&#x27;s comparables
by the TPO. The assessee has advanced no valid reason for challenging the
findings by the TPO in this regard. Merely objecting for the sake of it would not
be of any consequence. A &#x27;comparable&#x27; under TNMM would, it may be
appreciated, where the assessee is the tested party, have to be similarly serviced
by an associate enterprise (AE), with there being in the instant case a
disagreement between the assessee and the Revenue as to the functional
classification of the assessee&#x27;s AEs. Alternatively, suitable adjustment for the
costs incurred and, consequently, economic value of the services availed, would
have to be suitably factored, and which was not. We have, while upholding the
rejection of TNMM by the TPO/DRP, as applied by the assessee, yet not
excluded TNMM as an option (i.e., in the second round), while pointing out its
inherent limitations as well as the factors that need to be taken into account if
the same is, for any reason, taken recourse to again. The assessee as the tested
party, we clarify, shall have to be preceded by an inability to test the AEs with
reference to the comparables. The issue qua the working capital adjustment also

sharing ratio between the assessee and its AEs is accordingly set aside to the file
of the AO/TPO, who shall decide on merits after allowing the assessee a
reasonable opportunity of hearing. Needless to add, the burden of proof to
substantiate its claims, being, in effect, the adopted ratio of revenue sharing with
its AEs being at arm&#x27;s length, is on the assessee, even as a TPO shall show
cause the assessee qua his findings before finalizing the same. The validity of
the other adjustments, as indicated above, would be with reference to the

will enable the asset to generate future economic benefits in excess of its
originally assessed standard of performance. This is one of the conditions
necessary for the capitalization of the additional expenditure incurred in relation
to an intangible in terms of AS 26 issued by ICAI. This sums up the assessee&#x27;s
case, which though did not find favour with the Revenue. In its&#x27; view, an
intangible asset is, irrespective, only a capital expenditure having enduring
benefit, entitled though to depreciation, and which was accordingly allowed @
25%, disallowing the expenditure per se as not revenue. Aggrieved, the assessee
is in appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_46">6.    We have heard the parties, and perused the material on record. Without
doubt, what the assessee is developing is an intangible, for the use in its
business. The same was being capitalized upto the accounting (financial) year
2008-09. The expenditure on software development would be, where so,
admissible u/s. 37(1), which reads as under:
</p>     &#x27;General.
<p id="p_47">     37. (1) Any expenditure (not being expenditure of the nature described in
     <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_17">sections 30</a> to <a href="/doc/1427856/" id="a_18">36</a> and not being in the nature of capital expenditure or
     personal expenses of the assessee), laid out or expended wholly and
     exclusively for the purposes of the business or profession shall be allowed
     in computing the income chargeable under the head &quot;Profits and gains of
     business or profession&quot;.&#x27;

     Clearly, therefore, expenditure in the nature of capital expenditure is not
admissible. True, the Accounting Standard provides guidelines on the
capitalization or otherwise of an expense on an intangible asset. Where,
therefore, the probable future economic benefits do not increase the original
assessed standard of performance, it cannot be said that a new asset or
advantage has come into being or existence on account of incurring the said
expenditure (para 59 of the Standard). What, then, one may ask, is the nature of
the expenditure? It, surely, is not maintenance expenditure. That is, if not on
improvement, or developing new products, what it is on? What is the extent of

improvement, i.e., over the standard of performance as originally assessed, is a
technical matter. The future economic benefits that may arise there-from is,
again, something that lies in the womb of future. This, in fact, is what the
assessee company also implies when it says that on account of it operating in
multiple markets with a diversified range of &#x27;Cuecent&#x27; products and increased
competition in the BPM space, it was not possible for it to estimate, with
reasonable accuracy, the future benefits to be derived, which thus becomes a
challenging task. The Accounting Standard may suggest or advocate it being
charged to revenue under the circumstances. The same shall however not make
it a revenue expenditure. Why, an abortive capital expenditure is also capital in
nature and, thus, a capital expenditure (refer, inter alia, <a href="/doc/325846/" id="a_20">Swadeshi Cotton Mills
Co. Ltd. v. CIT</a> [1967] 63 ITR 65 (SC); <a href="/doc/1628226/" id="a_21">Hasimara Industries Ltd. v. CIT</a> [1998]
231 ITR 842 (SC)), even as accounting policy may dictate it being written off,
and not incorrectly so. Both the revenue and capital expenditure, it may be
appreciated, are incurred only for the purpose of business, with a view to
generate revenue. How successful it would actually be is a matter subsequent,
and which in fact is not relevant. As explained by the Apex Court time and
again, as in <a href="/doc/750750/" id="a_22">CIT v. R.P.Moody</a> [1978] 115 ITR 519 (SC), the future benefit/s that
an expenditure may yield is uncertain, but that by itself is no ground for the
same to be not regarded as revenue in nature, incurred for the purpose of
generating revenue. An expenditure being unfructuous would not change its
character, and would thus equally qua qualify for being allowed or, as the case
may be, not so. The principle holds for a capital expenditure as well. All that the
company in the present case is facing is a difficulty in being able to determine,
with reasonable accuracy, if the future economic benefits would exceed that
which would arise without incurring the impugned expenditure. That is, a
difficulty in reliably estimating the increase in the future economic benefits.
And which would therefore imply an estimate of the benefits as originally

assessed as well as the extent to which the same may have materialized. This is
as only that would enable an assessment of the increase (in the benefits) on
account of the additional expenditure. Even as we have explained it to be not a
relevant consideration, there is nothing on record to exhibit the said
estimates/realization. Why, we do not even know the extent to which the
impugned expenditure is on improvement in-as-much as it could also be on new
products; the assessee, as a matter of accounting policy, charging the
expenditure on product development to revenue. The expenditure, in our clear
view, is only on creating more products in the Cuecent range of software
developed by it, or effecting improvement therein. The expenditure is, therefore,
only a capital expenditure, resulting in a capital asset, on which therefore
depreciation is exigible, which stands rightly allowed. The assessee&#x27;s grounds
are partly allowed.

begin with, no dichotomy between the decisions relied upon by the assessee and
the Revenue. A trading loss shall arise, even if on restatement, to the extent it is
qua a trading asset or liability. This is also the clear mandate of AS-11. To the
extent it is qua a liability incurred on the acquisition of a capital asset, the same
shall be a capital expenditure (or receipt), leading to an increase (or decrease) in
the cost of the capital asset. <a href="/doc/32503/" id="a_30">Section 43A</a> extends this proposition to also a
borrowing (in foreign currency) made specifically for the purpose of acquiring a
capital asset, so that the forex loss incurred on repaying the borrowing, to the
extent actually suffered, i.e., while discharging the liability, would also,
similarly, go to increase the cost of the relevant asset/s. Clearly, therefore, the
loss to the extent it is qua the capital borrowed for acquiring or financing the
acquisition of a capital asset, incurred upon repayment, shall go to increase the
cost of the relevant asset, on which increased cost depreciation shall,
consequently, be allowable. So, however, it is only the increase (or decrease) in
liability (or borrowing), as realized, that shall be so considered. To the extent
not realized, even if accounted for, as in view of AS-11, shall have to be ignored
for determining the assessee&#x27;s taxable income and, accordingly, tax liability.
<a href="/doc/32503/" id="a_31">Section 43A</a> is a non obstante provision, so that, where applicable, it shall
prevail over other provisions, as (say)<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_32"> s. 37(1)</a>;<a href="/doc/488246/" id="a_33"> s. 145</a>, etc. In fact, it explicitly
provides for overriding the method of accounting adopted by the assessee.

Continuing further, the HDFC (FCNR) loan was extended and taken as a term
loan for the purpose of repayment of an existing debt of the company. Clearly, if
the debt is in respect of a liability assumed toward, or in respect of a borrowing
for financing, the cost - in whole or part, of a capital asset, sec. 43A shall get
attracted. Accordingly, to the extent realized, the loss in respect of this term loan
shall increase the cost of the relevant capital asset/s. The assessee shall be
allowed depreciation on such increased cost. Where, and to the extent, the
existing debt is qua a trade liability or a liability assumed for financing a trade
liability, the corresponding loss shall be on revenue account. This, however, is
subject to one caveat, i.e., that the capital asset financed is acquired from
outside India. There is no finding qua this aspect in the orders by the Revenue
authorities. Where the capital asset is not acquired from outside India, sec. 43A
shall be no application. The gain or loss in such a case shall be includible or
deductible as for other assets, or even liabilities, i.e., in terms of AS 11. The
assessee shall therefore be entitled to the loss suffered during the relevant year,
i.e., with reference to the change from the end of the immediately preceding
year to the current year-end. Support for this may also be drawn from the
decision in <a href="/doc/63910/" id="a_35">CIT v. Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co. Ltd</a>. [1998] 231 ITR 285 (SC). The AO
shall decide after determining this aspect. We decide accordingly. Grounds 17
&amp; 18 are partly allowed.

<p id="p_53">Part D: (9) Gd. 19 challenges the levy of interest u/s. 234A in-as-much as the
return, filed electronically on 21.11.2012, is in time, so that no interest there-
under, which is only for the late filing of the return, could be levied. No
arguments in his behalf were made during hearing, even as, without doubt,
where the return is furnished within the time specified u/s. 139(1), no interest
u/s. 234A could be levied. Further, the challenge to the levy of interest u/ss.

Part E: (10) This raises grounds on initiation of penalty proceedings, which is
clearly not maintainable; penalty proceedings being separate and distinct
proceedings. We decide accordingly.
