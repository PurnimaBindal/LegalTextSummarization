<p id="p_1">V.K. SHALI, J:

<p id="p_2">1.    Ms.Pooja Batra, petitioner has filed the present writ

petition   for   quashing     the    detention   order   bearing

F.No.673/06/2007-CUS/VIII dated 5th December, 2007 issued by

Joint Secretary (COFEPOSA), Ministry of Finance, Department of

Revenue against her husband Deepak Kumar @ Deepak Batra S/o

Sh. Om Prakash (hereinafter referred as the detenu), R/o 1431,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                               Page 1 of 49</span>
 Gopal Street, Sangat Rashan, Paharganj, New Delhi under

Section 3 of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and

<a href="/doc/135830564/" id="a_1">Preservation of Smuggling Act</a>, 1974.         The detenu was detained

in pursuance to the said detention order on 22nd May, 2008.

</p><p id="p_3">2.       Briefly stated the facts of the case as given in the petition

are that the detenu purported to have represented himself as a

proprietor of a concern styled as M/s Om Prakash Deepak Kumar,

1074-75, Room No.23, Jyoti Market, Gandhi Gali, Fatehpuri,

Delhi-110006.         He filed a bill of entry bearing No.589144 dated

25th April, 2007 for clearance of the consignment at I.C.D.,

Tughlakabad, New Delhi through their clearing agent CHA M/s

P.P.Dutta, Wg. Cdr. (Retd.) for the clearance of 1041 cartons

containing "Telescopic Channels" of 10", 12", 14", 16" and 18"

and "Soft Scrubber" collectively valued at Rs.3,06,045.51

(Rupees Three Lacs Six Thousand Forty Five and Fifty One

Paise).         On the aforesaid valuation, a duty amount payable

was Rs.1,04,201/-(Rupees One Lac Four Thousand Two Hundred

One).     It is alleged that the clearing agent, M/s P.P.Dutta sent a

letter     to   the    Deputy    Commissioner    of   Customs,    ICD,

Tughlakabad, New Delhi wherein it expressed its inability to

clear the shipment due to some problem and accordingly issued

NOC in favour of the detenu. On 15th June, 2007, the clearing


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                    Page 2 of 49</span>
 agent along with a covering letter sent original bill of entry

invoice, packing list, Bill of lading, Certificate of origin and NOC

to the detenu.    On receipt of the aforesaid documents, the

detenu Deepak Kumar himself appeared before the Customs

Authorities, ICD Tughlakabad, New Delhi on 3rd August, 2007

represented himself to be the proprietor of M/s Om Prakash

Deepak Kumar and requested for clearance of the aforesaid bill

of entry on the ground that the clearing agent was not coming

forward to clear the consignment.     The statement of the detenu

Deepak Kumar was recorded under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_2">Section 108</a> of the Customs

Act which he alleges to have been obtained under duress and

coercion.   Thereafter, the consignment was opened and it was

found to contain goods other than the ones which were declared

to the tune of value of Rs.3,06,045.51/- (Rupees Three Lacs Six

Thousand Forty Five and Fifty One Paise).         Accordingly, his

statement was again recorded on 4th August, 2007.       In both the

statements, the detenu had represented himself as to be the

proprietor of M/s Om Prakash Deepak Kumar having its office at

1074-75, Room No.23, Jyoti Market, Gandhi Gali, Fatehpuri,

Delhi-06 having IEC Code No.050602341 dated 25th July, 2006

which was purported to have been issued by the Director General

of Foreign Trade, Govt. of India.          The detenu had also


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 3 of 49</span>
 represented that he had now shifted his business to 1431, Gopal

Street, Sangat Rashan, Paharganj, New Delhi.        Since it was a

case of under valuation and mis-declaration, the detenu was

arrested and produced before the learned ACMM, Patiala House

Courts, New Delhi on 4th August, 2007 who had remanded him to

the judicial custody.   The detenu filed a bail application on 6th

August, 2007 before the learned ACMM, New Delhi and in the

said   application,      he    made    a     mention      that     his

confession/statement     which   was   purported   to    have    been

recorded by    the    Customs    Authority   was   obtained      under

duress/coercion.     The said application for grant of bail of the

detenu was rejected on 14th August, 2007 after obtaining reply

from the Customs authorities.    On 16th August, 2007, a fresh bail

application was filed before the Learned Additional Sessions

Judge, New Delhi which was also rejected on 17th August, 2007.

On 18th August, 2007, a third application for bail was filed before

the High Court which was allowed on 30th August, 2007 on the

ground that the detenu had been in custody for 27 days and he

had already paid a customs duty to the tune of Rs. 25,00,000/-

(Rupees Twenty Five Lacs) and was prepared to pay the penalty

on account of the mis-declared imported goods.          Thereafter, a

detention order is purported to have been passed on 5th


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 4 of 49</span>
 December, 2007 against the detenu which he allegedly learnt

only on 22nd May, 2008 and whereafter he immediately

surrendered before the ACMM, New Delhi and he is in custody

since then.     He represented to the Secretary, Govt. of India on

13th June, 2008 through Jail Superintendent which representation

was rejected by the Special Secretary, Govt. of India on 1st July,

2008 and communicated to him on 2nd July, 2008 belatedly.

Similarly, the Advisory Board also rejected the case of the detenu

on 23rd July, 2008 and thereby now he was constrained to file the

present petition as averred by him.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.    So far as the respondents are concerned, they have filed

their detailed counter affidavit and contested the claim of the

petitioner    on    certain   factual    aspects   apart    from   legal

propositions.      The case of the respondent-sponsoring Authority

is that on 25th April, 2007 after filing the bill entry No.589144

dated 25th April, 2007 before the Deputy Commissioner of

Customs (Import Shed), Tughlakabad, New Delhi through

clearing agent Wg. Cdr., P.P.Dutta, the detenu or his clearing

agent did not appear for clearing the goods till 23rd July, 2008.

The   consignment       was   declared    to   contain   1041    cartons

containing "Telescopic Channels" of 10", 12", 14", 16" and 18"

and "Soft Scrubber" collectively valued at Rs.3,06,045.51


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                      Page 5 of 49</span>
 (Rupees Three Lacs Six Thousand Forty Five and Fifty One Paise)

of which a duty amount of Rs.1,04,201/- (Rupees One Lac Four

Thousand Two Hundred and One) was payable.               Since the

sponsoring authority had intelligence reports that the importer is

attempting to get imported goods cleared by mis-declaring the

description, quantity and value accordingly, surveillance was

kept on the consignment in this regard.           Simultaneously

Manager    (CONCOR)      ICD,   Tughlakabad,   New     Delhi     was

requested, not to clear the aforesaid consignment without the

written permission of the Deputy Commissioner of Customs

(Import Shed), ICD, Tughlakabad, New Delhi.          Till 23rd July,

2008, nobody came forward to get the goods cleared.       Since the

clearing agent M/s P.P.Datta, Wg. Cdr. (Retd.) had got suspicious

about the contents of the consignment on account of the fact that

the detenu had approached and stated him that at no cost the

consignment should be checked, he withdrew his authority to get

the goods cleared and returned the papers to the detenu.       On 3rd

August, 2007, the detenu appeared before the concerned official

in the Import Shed and gave a letter dated 2nd August, 2007 on

the letter head of M/s Om Prakash Deepak Kumar requesting the

Deputy    Commissioner    of    Customs   (Import     Shed),     ICD

Tughlakabad, New Delhi that the aforesaid consignment be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 6 of 49</span>
 cleared. It was also represented that the clearing agent was not

coming forward to get the goods cleared and therefore he had to

come himself.    Since there was an intelligence report regarding

the mis- declaration under violation about the quantity and the

quality, the Deputy Commissioner had written that the entire

100% of the consignment has to be checked which was done on

3rd August, 2007.     Pursuant to this, on 4th August, 2007 when the

detenu had appeared again, his statement under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_3">Section 108</a> of

the Customs Act were recorded where he had owned the concern

styled as M/s Om Prakash Deepak Kumar and he had also owned

the import on the aforesaid consignment, although he had

disputed the factum of other eight prior consignments having

been got cleared by him.     The consignment was found to contain

carton boxes / packages numbering 1118 as against 1041 and

which were more than what was claimed under the bill of entry

No.589144 dated 25th April, 2007.      The consignment was found

to contain 441 cartons as containing Telescopic Channels instead

of 700 cartons as declared.      As against the declared 341 carton

boxes containing Soft Scrubber only 54 were found to contain

Soft Scrubber.      On opening of these carton boxes of identical

marking said to contain soft scrubber, it is found that different

types of goods were kept concealed in these cartons.         It was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 7 of 49</span>
 found that 200 similar carton boxes contained shoes of Adidas,

Nike, Air brands and 67 similar carton boxes were found

containing cigarettes packets of „Marlboro‟ brand, 56 white small

boxes were found containing ignition plugs of „Mico Bosch‟ brand

and similar 300 cartons were found containing AAAR03 NISHICA

of brand battery cells.        Inquiries by the respondents also

revealed that ignition plugs of „Mico Bosch‟ were found to be

spurious and similarly „Marlboro‟ cigarettes were found to be not

containing statutory warning and therefore, it being spurious

could also be not ruled out.       It was found by the respondents,

apart from the declared goods in 495 cartons collectively valued

at Rs.2,03,220/- (Rupees Two Lacs Three Thousand Two Hundred

and Twenty) of different types of un-declared goods collectively

valued at Rs.85,04,000/- (Rupees Eighty           Five Lacs Four

Thousand) contained in 623 cartons were concealed with the

declared goods.        The duty involved on the said goods contained

in 1118 carton boxes and collectively valued at Rs.87,07,200/-

(Rupees Eighty Seven Lacs Seven Thousand and Two Hundred)

worked   out     to    be   Rs.30,00,000/-   (Rupees    Thirty   Lacs)

approximately.        Accordingly, a Panchnama dated 3rd August,

2007 was prepared and goods were confiscated along with their




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                    Page 8 of 49</span>
 packaging material under <a href="/doc/420314/" id="a_4">Section 110</a> of the Customs Act, 1962

on the reasonable ground that the same were being smuggled.

</p><p id="p_5">4.    The premises of the concern M/s Om Prakash Deepak

Kumar at the address 1074-75, Room No.23, Jyoti Market,

Gandhi Gali, Fatehpuri, Delhi were searched but nothing

offending was recovered.    The said premises were found to be in

possession of one person Deepak Kumar Aggarwal who claimed

himself to be the proprietor of the aforesaid concern as well as of

the IEC Code issued by the Director General of Foreign Trade in

which his PAN number was given.         He further stated in his

statement that he never imported any goods from China as was

purported to have been done in the present case or in the earlier

eight consignments.   He further stated that he only deals in dry

fruits which he imports from Iran, Afghanistan, Indonesia and

USA etc.

</p><p id="p_6">5.    The detenu was enlarged on bail by the High Court.          On

29th October, 2007, sponsoring Authority after completing

investigation sponsored the case of the petitioner for passing

detention order to the COFEPOSA department, which after

examining the matter in detail passed the impugned detention

order dated 5th December, 2007.     The case of the respondent is

that the detention order was passed to prevent the detenu from


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 9 of 49</span>
 indulging in smuggling activity on account of the fact that prior to

the consignment in question, the detenu had imported eight

other consignments wherein he had also imported the goods

after clearance of the Customs Authorities.     It was the case of

the respondents that although the said eight consignments were

cleared and nothing offending was detected but this was on

account of the fact that only 5 to 10% of the checking was done in

respect of the said goods while as in the instant case 100%

checking was done which revealed that it was a case of not only

mis-declaration with regard to the quality and the quantity and

description of the goods but the detenu was indulging in

smuggling activity within the definition of <a href="/doc/64279/" id="a_5">Section 2(39)</a> of The

Customs Act.    The impugned detention order which was served

on him on 22nd May, 2008 as the detenu was alleged to be

avoiding the service of the order during the interregnum period.

</p><p id="p_7">6.    We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and

perused the records.     Learned counsel for the detenu has in

essence raised five submissions essentially with a view to attack

the detention order dated 5.12.2007:-
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">(i) Documents in respect of which enquiry is pending

cannot form the basis of subjective satisfaction.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 10 of 49</span>
</p><p id="p_10"> a)   The first submission of the learned counsel for the detenu

was that he had admittedly appeared before the Deputy

Commissioner     of    Customs   requesting   him   to   clear   the

consignment under the bill of entry No. 589144 since the clearing

agent was not coming forward to clear the said consignment.         In

respect of the said bill of entry, goods which were sought to be

cleared allegedly consisted of Telescopic Channels of 10‟‟, 12‟‟,

14‟‟, 16‟‟, and 18‟‟ and Soft Scrubber collectively valued at

Rs.3,06,045.51 (Rupees Three Lacs Six Thousand Forty Five and

Fifty One Paise) on which duty payable was stated to be

Rs.1,04,201/ (Rupees One Lac Four Thousand Two Hundred and

One)-.   The aforesaid consignment was allegedly under DRI

surveillance and on checking the same it was found to be

containing undeclared imported goods, the value of which is

stated by the respondents is Rs.85,04,000/- (Rupees Eighty Five

Lacs Four Thousand) on which the duty of Rs.30,00,000/-

(Rupees Thirty        Lacs) or so was allegedly leviable.        The

detenu‟s case was that he has already secured the interest of the

revenue inasmuch as he was enlarged on bail by the High Court

in respect of alleged offence under <a href="/doc/1889775/" id="a_6">section 135</a> of the Customs

Act on the ground that he has deposited Rs.25,00,000/- (Rupees

Twenty Five Lacs) as customs duty on undeclared goods and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 11 of 49</span>
 further was prepared to pay the penalty.    Further so far as the

eight other consignments, which are purported to have been

allegedly imported earlier by the detenu, they are subject matter

of enquiry by the DRI on the request of Commissioner of Customs

ICD, Tughlakabad, New Delhi.       This enquiry is sought to be

made at the port of exports with regard to the details of payment,

the value of goods declared at the port of exports etc., and

therefore the respondents had not conclusively established the

ownership of these eight consignments qua the detenu and

therefore, it could not be form the basis of passing of the

detention order.      This leaves the department only with one

consignment in respect of which the customs duty has already

been paid and he will face prosecution under <a href="/doc/1889775/" id="a_7">Section 135</a> of the

Customs Act and one incident cannot form the basis of passing

the detention order.     The learned counsel for the detenu has

placed reliance on case titled <a href="/doc/1942242/" id="a_8">Chowdarapu Raghunandan v. State

of Tamil Nadu</a> AIR 2002 Supreme Court 1460.      In this particular

case, the baggage which was containing the contraband goods,

on the basis of which the detention order was passed, was alleged

to be belonging to the detenu.     In that case, the detenu had

disowned the ownership of the said baggage and it was prima

facie shown that the baggage was having no tags which would


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                               Page 12 of 49</span>
 indicate that the baggage was belonging to the detenu in the said

case.    Further, the petitioner was an Engineering student in that

case.    It was, under these circumstances that the Supreme Court

had observed that keeping in view that there was no past conduct

on the part of the detenu of being involved in any anti-social

activities except that he had visited the foreign countries once or

twice, the baggages containing contraband goods did not belong

to the detenu and the investigation was still pending.   Therefore

it could not be concluded that baggage belonged to the detenu

and the passing of the detention order was without any

application of mind and on inchoate material.
</p>
<p id="p_11">b)      As against this, the documents which are declaration forms

and are placed at pages 278 to 293 of the paper book are

submitted to the Customs Authorities by the detenu himself duly

signed seeking clearance of the goods on eight different

occasions.     It was purported to be containing the goods

described in such declaration forms such as steel wool scrubber

&amp; hinges etc. imported from China.     It was further contended by

Mr. Aggarwala, learned counsel for the Respondents that

although in eight these transactions goods were cleared that

does not mean that the consignments in these eight cases were

not violating the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_9">Customs Act</a>, 1962 inasmuch as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 13 of 49</span>
 in these eight transactions only a sample inspection of 5 to 10 %

of goods was carried out. While as, in the ninth transaction, the

consignment was examined 100% there was information received

from the Department of Revenue Intelligence that there is a

mis-declaration both with regard to the quality and the quantity

of the goods in the said consignment     which was found to be

correct.   The ownership of the consignment either in respect of

the earlier eight transactions or the ninth one on the basis of

which the detention order was passed was established by

preponderance of probabilities to be owned by the detenu. This is

reflected from the statements of the clearing agent Mr.Dutta and

his nominee recorded under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_10">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act

where they have stated that it was Deepak Kumar, the detenu

who had come to them since early 2006 and got the goods

/consignments cleared which were imported from China.       They

have also stated that on ninth occasion when the consignment

had come, the detenu had very emphatically impressed on them

that the consignment ought not to be permitted to be checked by

Customs Authorities and at any cost (emphasis added), which

clearly showed his guilty mind.   Therefore, merely on account of

the fact that letter is purported to have been written by the

Customs Authorities to the DRI requesting them to get the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                               Page 14 of 49</span>
 further details from the port of exports with regard to the

payment, description of goods declared, there would not in any

way make the ownership of the goods qua the detenu either in

respect of ninth or even the earlier eight consignments as

doubtful.
</p>
<p id="p_12">c)     Further, if the signatures on these declaration forms are

compared in exercise of powers conferred on the Court under

<a href="/doc/770022/" id="a_11">Section 73</a> of The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 with the signatures

appearing on the declaration form submitted for the ninth

transaction, it will clearly show that both these sets of documents

have been signed by the same person only.      The detenu went to

the Customs Authorities not only for the clearance of the goods

but he owned them in a statement recorded under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_12">Section 108</a> of

The Customs Act, on 3rd August, 2007 and 4th August, 2007 on

which date he was put under arrest.
</p>
<p id="p_13">d)     Therefore, the ratio of the judgment relied upon by the

petitioner in <a href="/doc/1942242/" id="a_13">Chowdarapu Raghunandan v. State of Tamil

Nadu -case</a> (supra) is not applicable to the facts of the present

case    as   the   said   judgment   is   totally   distinguishable.

Accordingly, we hold that there is no merit in the first contention

of the learned counsel for the detenue that the documents which

are forming part of enquiry have been made as the basis of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 15 of 49</span>
 passing of detention order wrongly or that the detention order is

passed without any application of mind.      On the contrary, the

ninth consignment is owned by the detenu while as the other

eight are by preponderance of probabilities established to be

belonging to him only.
</p>
<p id="p_14">(ii) Non- application of mind in passing Detention Order

</p><p id="p_15">a)     It was next contended by Sh. Jain, learned counsel for the

detenu that the detention order has been passed by the detaining

authority without any application of mind.   In order to drive this

point home, the learned counsel drew our attention to the

detention order and read out various portions of paras like para

5, 9 &amp; 13 etc. wherein it has been mentioned that the detenu

namely Deepak Kumar @ Deepak Batra is the proprietor of M/s

Om Prakash Deepak Kumar, 1074-75, Room No. 23, Jyoti Market,

Gandhi Gali, Fatehpuri, Delhi-6 while as the case of the

respondents is that the detenu is not the proprietor of the said

concern and therefore there is a total non-application of mind on

the part of the detaining authority as on the one hand they are

saying that the detenu is the proprietor, on the other hand, they

are stating that the IEC Code and PAN number did not belong to

him.   The said Code was also not issued on his PAN number and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                               Page 16 of 49</span>
 he was not the owner of the proprietary concern.    Therefore, it is

a case of non-application of mind.
</p>
<p id="p_16">b)   As against this, Mr. Aggarwala, learned counsel for the

Respondents contended that what has been stated in the

detention order are the facts on the basis of which, grounds or

the reasons thereof for the detention of the detenu has been

passed and therefore, it could be said that there was any

non-application rather a perusal of the detention order shows the

application of mind.
</p>
<p id="p_17">c)   Admittedly, there is a concern by the name of M/s Om

Prakash Deepak Kumar having its office at 1074-75, Room No.

23, Jyoti Market, Gandhi Gali, Fatehpuri, Delhi-6 while as

detenu‟s residential address is 1431, Gopal Street, Sangat

Rashan, Paharganj, New Delhi.           The detenu represented

himself as the proprietor of the concern namely M/s Om Prakash

Deepak Kumar and claimed himself to be the owner of the ICD

number in question and imported the goods from China which

were mis-declared with regard to the description as well as the

quantity.   As against this, enquiries had revealed that it was not

the detenu Deepak Kumar alias Deepak Batra, husband of the

petitioner who was the proprietor but it was one Deepak Kumar

Aggarwal who was the proprietor and in fact the detenu was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 17 of 49</span>
 misusing the name of the said concern to his own benefit without

the knowledge of the original proprietor.      As a matter of fact, the

detenu was indulging in criminal acts by making false declaration

before public servants by impersonating and committing offences

of cheating forging documents and using forged documents as

genuine to claim himself       to be the proprietor of the said

concern.    These facts have been given in ex tenso in the

detention order.     By no stretch of imagination the reference to

the same can be construed to be as the basis for non-application

of mind.   We don‟t find any merit in the submission of the

learned counsel for the detenu that the detention order has been

passed without any application of mind.       On the contrary, we are

of the considered opinion that a detention order which is running

into   almost   21    pages   giving   each    important    fact   and

circumstance as well as the reasons in detail which has prompted

the Joint Secretary to Government of India to pass the detention

order.   The sum and substance which has necessitated passing

of the detention order is on account of the fact that there is a

proprietary concern by the name of M/s Om Prakash Deepak

Kumar having its office at 1074-75, Room No. 23, Jyoti Market,

Gandhi Gali, Fatehpuri, Delhi-6 while as the detenu admittedly is

living at 1431, Gopal Street, Sangat Rashan, Paharganj, New


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                   Page 18 of 49</span>
 Delhi.    The proprietary concern M/s Om Prakash Deepak Kumar

actually belongs to one Deepak Kumar Aggarwal who is doing the

business of importing dry fruits from Afghanistan, Indonesia,

Iran, USA and some other countries which he sells in Khari Baoli

and not importing goods from China.        He has also admitted that

he had never imported any material of hardware like the one

which was said to be imported by the ninth transaction for which

the bill of entry No. 589144 dated 25th April, 2007 was filed.       The

said Deepak Kumar Aggarwal has admitted that importer‟s detail

like IEC number and the PAN number which is reflected on the

certificate copy of which is placed at page 47 belongs to him, but

he has never imported the goods from China.
</p>
<p id="p_18">d)       As against this, the detenu was not only misusing the name

of the concern and the importer‟s detail including IEC number

and the PAN number but was in fact forging a document by

seeking clearance of the ninth consignment on the letter head of

M/s Om Prakash Deepak Kumar and presenting the said

document as genuine with a view to get the goods cleared from

the   Customs      Authority   which      was   subject     matter      of

mis-declaration with regard to the description of goods as well as

quantity     and   quality.    He   was    therefore,     cheating      by

impersonating actual Deepak Kumar Aggarwal who was the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                     Page 19 of 49</span>
 proprietor.   Therefore, it could hardly be said that there is any

merit in this submission of the learned counsel for the detenu

that the impugned detention order is passed by the detaining

authority without any application of mind. Accordingly, the said

submission is dismissed as meritless.     So far as the reliance by

the learned counsel for the petitioner on <a href="/doc/884550/" id="a_14">Smt. Shalini Soni v.

Union of India &amp; Others</a> 1980 CRI. L.J. 1487 is concerned, it is

stated that the ratio of the said judgment has not been followed.

The detention order not only contains factual material but also

the inference leading to the passing of the detention order.

</p><p id="p_19">(iii) Non-placement          of   retraction   before    Detaining
Authority

</p><p id="p_20">a)    The third submission made by the detenu for quashing of

the detention order is to the effect that the retraction which was

made by the detenu to the learned Judicial Magistrate on the date

when he was produced before the Court of learned ACMM, New

Delhi has not been placed before the detaining authority and

therefore, the detention order is not sustainable.   The retraction

which was alleged to have not been placed before the detaining

authority reads as under:-

</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">b)    The learned counsel has also placed reliance on cases titled

as <a href="/doc/1897578/" id="a_15">K. Satyanarayan Subudhi v. Union of India and Others</a>

1991 Supp. (2) SCC 153 &amp; <a href="/doc/376841/" id="a_16">K.S. Nagamuthu v. State of Tamil

Nadu JT</a> 2005 (10) SC 216 in support of his contention.


This argument of the learned counsel for the detenu was

contested by the learned counsel for the respondents.       It was

contended    by   Mr.Aggarwala,     learned   counsel    for   the

Respondents that the detenu after being arrested had filed three

bail applications, one before the learned ACMM, Patiala House,

second before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Patiala

House and the third before the High Court for grant of bail and in

all the three applications he had made a reference to his

involuntary character of his confession/statement but the

retraction to which the learned counsel for the detenu is making

reference now and a copy of which is placed at page 305 was not

annexed by the detenu along with any of his applications.      On

the contrary, along with the application for bail before the High

Court the detenu had attached a document which was shown in

the index to be a retraction but which was not actually retraction

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                               Page 21 of 49</span>
 at all.    It was further contended that so far as the document, a

photocopy of which is placed at page 305 that is a document

which is fabricated one.     This is the reason why this document

was not annexed along with the bail application or supplied to the

respondents and could not be placed before the detaining

authority.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">c)        Further, the factum of the retraction having been made by

the detenu was contested by the respondents in their reply to all

the three applications filed by the detenu.           All the bail

applications and the reply filed by the respondent-sponsoring

authority was placed before the Detaining Authority.    This fact is

referred to by the detaining authority in paragraph 27 of the

detention order, that the retraction is considered and has been

found to be totally untrue that the detenu had been forced/

coerced to make certain involuntary and incorrect statements

under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_17">section 108</a> of The Customs Act and accordingly the

detention order was passed.       Therefore this submission of the

learned counsel for the detenu was stated to be without any

merit.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">d)        We have gone through the so called retraction, the

detention order as well as the bail applications relied upon by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 22 of 49</span>
 detenu.   At the outset, it is stated that the document which is

stated to be retraction purported to have been made by the

detenu and a photocopy of which is placed at page 305 of the

paper book is a document which prima facie seems to have been

manufactured by the detenu.      This is on account of the fact that

no doubt, in the application for bail, at all the three levels he had

made reference to his statement having been made under

<a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_18">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act under coercion or duress but this

alleged retraction was not appended along with any of the three

applications.   The natural conduct of the detenu or his counsel

would have been if this document would have been in existence

at the first available opportunity of filing the bail application the

same would have been appended by the detenu along with the

application for grant of bail.    Having chosen not to do so, it

raises a doubt about the existence and genuineness of the

document itself.      The doubt about the authenticity and the

genuineness of the document gets further compounded by the

fact that it does not bear the name of the Court, the title of the

case, the date of hearing or even the date on which it was

purported to have been given to the learned Judicial Magistrate

by the detenu and there is no order passed by the learned

Magistrate on the same.    Contrary to this, a document purported


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 23 of 49</span>
 to be a retraction is attached with the bail application in the High

Court which is not actually a retraction.            Further, the

respondents on learning about the fact of this document,

purporting to be a document of retraction only after filing of the

present writ petition on 9th June, 2008 make an application to the

learned Judicial Magistrate, New Delhi on 23rd July, 2008 to make

an enquiry as to how this document has come on to the judicial

record without a copy of the same having been supplied to them

and without any order of the learned Magistrate or any

endorsement of the Court staff.    Therefore, all these facts taken

cumulatively will make any reasonable, prudent person to arrive

at an irresistible conclusion that this document is a forged,

fabricated or in any case manufactured afterwards to create

evidence.    Further, the possibility of this document being

manufactured subsequently is further enhanced because of the

criminal proclivities of the detenu.     This is evident that the

detenu forged a letter on the letter head of M/s Om Prakash

Deepak Kumar and represented himself to be the proprietor of

the concern while as he was not.    Therefore, we prima facie feel

that the document of purported to be retraction relied upon by

the detenu is nothing but a manufactured document and cannot

be given any credence much less the non-placement of the same


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 24 of 49</span>
 can be said to be of any consequence qua the detention order

having been passed against the detenu.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">e)    Having said so, even if we assume that the detenu had

retracted the contention made by him under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_19">Section 108</a> of the

Customs Act at the first possible opportunity that is on 4th August,

2007 when he was arrested and produced before the Judicial

Magistrate on the first date, the factum of retraction was placed

before the detaining authority by way of placing the applications

of bail and the reply thereof filed by the respondents which was

duly considered and attended to by the detaining authority as

was evident from para 27 of the impugned detention order

wherein the detaining authority after examining all these facts

has come to the conclusion that though the retraction purported

to have been made by the petitioner is not correct and truthful

and therefore has not been given any credence.
</p>
<p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">f)    There is another angle to this.   If one sees the dictionary

meaning of the word „retraction‟ it is to withdraw, to draw back

or to retrace.   Meaning thereby the person who is retracting his

so called confession or the statement is prima facie admitting

tacitly the factum of confession or statement having been made

and now wants to wriggle out of the same.       If one see the bail


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 25 of 49</span>
 applications of the detenu and the so called retraction placed at

page 305 of the paper book filed in three forums he only says that

the detenu was coerced or forced to make the statement under

<a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_20">Section 108</a> of the Customs Act and it does not talk about

retraction by the detenu.   We feel that plea of retraction is only

an afterthought.
</p>
<p id="p_30">
</p><p id="p_31">g)    The Supreme Court in case titled <a href="/doc/208589/" id="a_21">Prakash Chandra

Mehta vs. Commissioner and Secretary Govt. of Kerala and

Others</a> 1985 (Supp.) SCC 144 has held that detention order is

not vitiated on the ground of non-application of mind if subjective

satisfaction arrived at on the basis of other independent and

objective factors enumerated in the grounds warrant the passing

of the detention order.   In this case also a contention was raised

that the retraction of confessional statements made by the

detenu was not referred to in the grounds of detention.        The

present case stands on a much better footing inasmuch as not

only reference to the alleged retraction is made in the detention

order but it is also observed that this alleged retraction was not

voluntary and truthful.   Further a reading of the entire detention

order running into 21 pages shows not only application of mind

for arriving at subjective satisfaction but also the propensity and

the potentiality of the detenu to indulge in smuggling activity
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 26 of 49</span>
 surreptitiously which has resulted in passing of the detention

order.
</p>
<p id="p_32">
</p><p id="p_33">h)    On the similar lines is the judgment of the Supreme Court

in <a href="/doc/1229698/" id="a_22">Madan Lal Anand vs. Union of India and others</a> (1990) 1

SCC 81 wherein it has been held by the Supreme Court that if the

documents are of such a nature that even in their absence

subjective satisfaction would not be affected then failure to place

the   documents     before   the   detaining   authority   would     be

immaterial.   Retraction as stated at page 305 is alleged to have

not been placed before the detaining authority, we are of the

opinion that failure to do so before the detaining authority would

have been immaterial on account of other overwhelming

evidence to show that the detenu was indulging in smuggling

activities by mis-declaring the goods both with regard to quality

and the quantity.     But in any case, the factum of retraction has

been taken note of in para 27 of the detention order.


</p><p id="p_34">i)    The judgments which have been relied upon by Sh.Jain,

learned counsel for the detenu are of no help to the detenu.       So

far as the first authority in case <a href="/doc/1897578/" id="a_23">K. Satyanarayan Subudhi v.

Union of India and others</a> (supra) is concerned the facts of the

case were that there was a finding by the Supreme Court that the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                  Page 27 of 49</span>
 retraction was going to the root of detention order while arriving

at a subjective satisfaction and accordingly the detention order

was considered to be invalid.   Further the detention order was

quashed not on account of this ground but keeping in view

another aspect of the matter that the detenu in the said case had

already undergo detention for a period of 8 months while as the

detention was for a period of one year.     In the present case, we

have already observed hereinabove that the document of

retraction itself is a document whose authenticity and the

genuineness itself is in doubt and therefore, cannot be relied

upon and yet the factum of retraction having been made by the

detenu has been considered by the detaining authority and it has

arrived on a subjective satisfaction by observing that the

retraction was involuntary and incorrect.
</p>
<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">j)    We have also gone through the Naga Muthu's case

(supra).   The facts of the said case are also different than the

facts of the present case and therefore, the said authority also is

not of any help to the detenu.      For these reasons the third

submission made by the detenu is concerned, that the detention

order is bad on account of retraction not having been placed

before the detaining authority has no merit.
</p>
<p id="p_37">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 28 of 49</span>
</p><p id="p_38"> (iv) Delay in         passing    the   order   and    disposal       of
representation

</p><p id="p_39">a)    The fourth submission which has been made by the learned

counsel for the detenu is consisting of two limbs.      The first is

that there was a considerable delay in passing the order of

detention from the date of alleged incident and in any case, the

arrest of the detenu was also delayed by period of five months.

Thus, at both the stages, the delay had broken the proximate and

live link of permitting the detenu to indulge in smuggling activity

and accordingly the detention order ought not to have been

passed.   The second limb of the submission was that there was a

considerable delay in disposal of the representation of the detenu

which was violating the rights of the detenu under <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_24">Article 22 (5)</a>

of the Constitution and thus the detention order was liable to be

struck down.      Elaborating this argument further, it was

contended by the learned counsel that the detenu gave a

representation dated 13th June 2008, on 16th June, 2008 to the

Superintendent Jail, Tihar.        The said representation was

received in the COFEPOSA department which was in Delhi itself

on the 16th June, 2008 itself.    The comments were received by

the COFEPOSA department from the sponsoring authority on 27th

June, 2008 and the representation has been rejected on 30th June,

2008 and intimation to the detenu about the rejection has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                  Page 29 of 49</span>
 sent on 1st July, 2008 and served on the detenu on 2nd July, 2008.

Thus there was delay of 16 days in disposal of the representation

of the detenu.      There was a delay in obtaining the comments

from the sponsoring authority and further there was a delay in

the disposal of the representation of the detenu also despite the

repeated    directions    given    by   the   Apex   Court   that    the

representation of the detenu must be dealt with as expeditiously

as possible and in any case it should not brook any delay.           The

learned counsel for the petitioner in support of his contentions

relied upon the judgments titled as <a href="/doc/678597/" id="a_25">T.Abdul Rahman v. State of

Kerala and others</a> AIR 1990 Supreme Court 225 and <a href="/doc/764779/" id="a_26">Adishwar

Jain v. Union of India and Another</a> (2006) 11 SCC 339.


</p><p id="p_40">b)    Mr. Satish Aggarwala, learned counsel for the Respondents

refuted this contention of the detenu that there was any delay

either in passing the order or the execution of the same.       He also

contended    that    there   was   no   delay   in   disposal   of   the

representation of the detenu which was received by the office of

the answering respondent on 20th June, 2008 and the same was

sent to the sponsoring authority for the purpose of obtaining

their comments which was received back along with comments

on 27th June, 2008.      28th and 29th June, 2008 were holidays of the

department being Saturday and Sunday respectively.                   The

 representation was considered by the competent authority on

30th June, 2008 and it was rejected on the same date.          The

communication about the rejection was sent to the detenu on 1 st

July, 2008 which was delivered to the detenu on 2nd July, 2008.

The learned counsel for the respondents also referred judgments

respective sides and also seen the record including the

averments made by the respective sides in this regard.


</p><p id="p_42">d)    So far as the question of delay in passing the detention

order is concerned, there is no denying of the fact that although

the bill of entry bearing No. 589144 dated 25th April, 2007 was

submitted by the detenu with the Commissioner of Customs, ICD,

Tughlakabad, New Delhi on 25th April, 2007 but nobody had

appeared before them to get the goods cleared till 23rd July, 2007.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 31 of 49</span>
 The consignment was under surveillance by the DRI and

accordingly the DRI had written a letter to the Commissioner of

Customs, ICD, Tughlakabad that they should not clear the said

consignment without their knowledge.         The detenu himself

appeared before the Customs Authorities for the first time on 3rd

August, 2007 and represented to them that as his clearing agent

was not coming forward to get the consignment cleared

because of which he was compelled to appear and request for

clearance of the consignment.    His statement under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_30">Section 108</a>

of the Customs Act was recorded so as to establish his ownership

qua the consignment.    His statement was again recorded on 4th

August, 2007 and since the consignment was subjected to 100%

check and on checking the same it was found on 3rd August, 2007

that there was mis-description of goods both with regard to

quantity and quality.   Accordingly the detenu was put under

arrest on 4th August, 2007 and produced before the learned

ACMM, Patiala House, New Delhi.      This was the starting point of

making an investigation into the matter, with a view to find out as

to whether there was potentiality and propensity of the detenu

indulging in smuggling activities in the light of the fact that

earlier also similar 8 consignments were got cleared by the

detenu.   These investigations accordingly took some time as the

 statements of witnesses like the actual owner of the proprietary

concern, the statement of the clearing agent and his nominee

were to be recorded and it was only on 29th October, 2007 after

the enquiry was complete that the          sponsoring authority

recommended to the COFEPOSA department for consideration of

the matter to pass the detention order against the detenu.       The

respondents in the counter affidavit had given the detailed

reasons and steps taken which obviously to take the time.        The

           which is unexplained in the Grounds of detention.
           In this connection, it is respectfully submitted
           that the husband of the petitioner filed Bill of
           Entry No. 589144 dated 25.4.2007 as importer
           M/s. Om Prakash Deepak Kumar through their
           CHA. From 25.4.2007 till 21.7.2007 neither the
           CHA nor the importer or his representative came
           forward for clearance of the goods.             On
           21.7.2007, a letter was sent by the Customs to
           Manager, CONCOR, ICD, TKD, New Delhi not to
           clear the container without the written
           permission of Dy. Commissioner of Customs.

           shed for clearance of the goods. The goods
           were examined on 100% basis and a panchnama
           dated 3.8.2007 was drawn. On the same day
           summons were issued to the husband of the
           petitioner and his statement under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_31">Section 108</a>
           of the Customs Act, 1962 was recorded. The
           residential premises of the husband of the

           husband of the petitioner was placed under
           arrest on 4.8.2007 and his remand to judicial
           custody was extended from time to time by the
           Ld. ACMM, New Delhi till 20.8.2007. His bail
           application before the Ld. ACMM, New Delhi and

           dated 14.8.2007 and 17.8.2007 respectively. He
           was ordered to be released on bail by the Hon‟ble

           the meanwhile, the address given in the Bill of
           Entry was searched by the Customs officers on
           4.8.2007 in the presence of one Shri Deepak
           Kumar Agarwal who was found in possession of
           the said address.       The statements of Shri
           Deepak Kumar Agarwal were recorded on
           4.8.2007 and 7.8.2007. The statement of the

           premises of the CHA firm and statement of

           conducted/recorded      between    7.8.2007    to
           16.8.2007. The verification about the originality
           of MICO BOSCH spark plugs under seizure was
           got done through representative of the Company
           on 20.8.2007. On 9.9.2007, the proprietor of

           Bills of Entry in respect of the goods cleared
           between 28.8.2006 to 9.1.2007.            Further

<p id="p_44">(e)   In the rejoinder there is only refutation of this and that too

only up to 29th October, 2007.         The steps taken by the

respondent after 29th October, 2007 have not been denied.           In

our considered opinion, the very fact that the proposal for

passing of the detention order was sent on 29th October, 2007

and the detention order was passed on 5th December, 2007, in our

view was not suffering from delay so as to snap the link between

the incident and the alleged potentiality of the detenu in

indulging in smuggling activity.   Rather in the detention order it

has been clearly mentioned that at the time when the detention

order was passed, the detenu was in custody and there was every


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 35 of 49</span>
 possibility that if he was enlarged on bail whereupon he may

again indulge in smuggling activities which necessitated the

passing of the detention order.   Therefore, so far as the delay in

passing the detention order is concerned, we are of the

considered opinion that there is no delay which can vitiate the

detention order.
</p>
<p id="p_45">
</p><p id="p_46">f)    With regard to the delay in execution of the detention

order, this plea has been taken by the detenu that he was

attending the Court and he was available in Delhi yet the

detention order was not served on him and therefore, the delay in

execution of the detention order also became fatal.   This ground

though taken during the course of arguments but has not been

averred in the writ.
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">(g)   We are of the view that even this plea raised by the detenu

does not have any merit, it is totally wrong to assume as has been

stated by the detenu that he was appearing in the Court.      As a

matter of fact, the complaint case under <a href="/doc/1889775/" id="a_34">Section 135</a> of the

Customs Act against the detenu is yet to be filed as stated by

Mr.Aggarwala.      No order sheet of the said complaint case has

been placed on record by the detenu and therefore, there is

hardly any occasion for the detenu to appear in the Court.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 36 of 49</span>
 Further, in the counter affidavit it has been stated that the

detenu‟s premises were raided twice but without any success.

The respondents had to take the coercive steps under <a href="/doc/94486389/" id="a_35">Section

7(1)(b)</a> of the COFEPOSA Act as well as under <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_36">Section 82</a> and <a href="/doc/886456/" id="a_37">83</a>

Cr.P.C. for declaring him as a proclaimed offender.     As against

this, the detenu has presented himself as if he is a very straight

forward and Law abiding citizen by contending that the moment

he learnt about the detention order he surrendered before

ACMM, New Delhi on 22nd May, 2008.         The averments or the

submission by the learned counsel for the detenu do not inspire

any confidence rather we feel that the detenu was evading the

service of detention order and making himself scarce despite

best effort of the respondents.    The ratio of Vinod Kumar's

case (supra) squarely fits in the present case.         In Vinod

Kumar's case it has been held by the Supreme Court that if the

detenu is evading service by making himself scare, it will not be

open to content that there was a delay in execution of the

detention order.
</p>
<p id="p_49">
</p><p id="p_50">h)    This is totally a false plea raised by the detenu that he was

attending the Court or he was available in Delhi yet the detention

order was not executed on him.           The detenu cannot be

permitted to take advantage of his own wrong firstly by evading
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 37 of 49</span>
 the service of detention order and then taking the point that

there was a delay in execution of the detention order. The

respondents had taken all steps expected of him in these

circumstances,    with   a   view   to   procure   his   attendance.

Accordingly, this limb of the argument of the detenu has no

merit.
</p>
<p id="p_51">
</p><p id="p_52">i)    So far as the question of delay in the disposal of

representation is concerned. No doubt the Courts have frowned

on the delay in disposal of the representation of the detenu but as

to whether there was a delay in the representation of the detenu

in a given case depends on the facts of that particular case itself.

In the instant case, the detenu has taken the plea that he made a

representation to the Secretary, Government of India as was

suggested in the detention order on 13th June, 2008 and which

was shown to have been received by the Superintendent Jail itself

on 16th June, 2008.   On the same day itself, the representation is

purported to have been sent by the Jail Superintendent to the

COFEPOSA department and the detenu also produced a letter

purported to have been issued by the Assistant Superintendent of

the Jail No. 3 where the detenu is detained.        To support his

contention that the representation was sent to COFEPOSA

department on 16th June, 2008 itself, it was also stated that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                 Page 38 of 49</span>
 jail and the COFEPOSA department both happened to be in Delhi

and the representation was delivered through special messenger

yet it took the respondents more than ten days in obtaining the

comments from the sponsoring authority and get the same

disposed of which is fatal and accordingly the detention order

deserves to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_53">
</p><p id="p_54">j)    We don‟t agree with the submission of the learned counsel

for the detenu.   No doubt the representation of the detenu is

dated 16th June, 2008 and is purported to have been delivered to

the Assistant Superintendent Jail, Tihar on the same day itself but

the respondents have made a specific averment in their counter

affidavit that the representation was received by them on 20 th

June, 2008.    This averment made by the respondents in the

counter affidavit has not been refuted by the detenu in his

rejoinder.    Therefore, it is prima facie established that the

representation dated 16th June, 2008 was received by the

COFEPOSA department only on 20th June, 2008.         On the same

day itself, it was sent to the sponsoring authority that is the

Customs Authority who sent their comments on 27th June, 2008.

Obviously when the comments have been sent for, the file has to

be processed and comments obtained from different tiers,

different officers of the Government, accordingly, the needful
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                Page 39 of 49</span>
 was done and the comments on the said representation were sent

to the COFEPOSA department on 27th June, 2008.              28th and 29th

June, 2008 were holidays being Saturday and Sunday and on the

next date i.e. 30th June, 2008, the representation of the detenu

was considered by the competent officer of the COFEPOSA

department and same was rejected.                The rejection was

communicated to the detenu on 1st July, 2008 and received by him

on 2nd July, 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
</p><p id="p_56">k)     We do not feel that there was any delay as is sought to be

projected     by    the   detenu    in   the   consideration      of   his

representation.      The authorities which have been relied upon by

the detenu are not applicable to the facts of the present case.        So

far as the case of <a href="/doc/186083145/" id="a_38">Rajammal v. State of Tamil Nadu and

Another</a> AIR 1999 SC 684 is concerned, it was in the facts of the

said case, the detention order has been vitiated that there was

five   days   in    considering    and   disposing   of    the   detenu‟s

representation on account of the absence of a minister at the

headquarter.       The absence of the minister at the headquarter

which was held to be insufficient ground justifying the delay

which impinges on the personal liberty of the detenu.             On the

contrary, the facts of the case show that on 20th June, 2008 when

the representation itself was received by the COFEPOSA
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">W.P.(Crl.) 782/2008                                       Page 40 of 49</span>
 Department, a special messenger was deputed for sending the

representation to the sponsoring authority to obtain the

comments.    The comments were received on 27th June, 2008 that

would mean that the sponsoring authority, at best got five days in

giving the comments representation of the detenu, was received

by the respondents on 27th June, 2008.    28th and 29th June, 2008

were holidays being Saturday and Sunday, the representation of

the detenu was accordingly considered by the competent

authority on 30th June and rejected. In the instant case there is no

allegation that the representation of the detenu was not dealt

with because of       the absence of     any   officer.   When a

representation is received by the sponsoring authority, the

department is bound to take some bear minimum time on

processing the matter.    We do not feel that there was any delay

much more than the bare minimum time required to obtain the

comments of the sponsoring authority and deal with the same

which was in violation of the right of the detenu granting under

<a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_39">Article 22 (5)</a> which clearly lays down that the representation of

the detenu has to be decided as soon as may be permissible under

law.   Therefore, this authority does not help the detenu in any

manner.

there was any delay in obtaining the comments of the sponsoring

authority except that the bear minimum time spent in gathering

information since incriminating evidence was found against the

detenu accordingly his representation was rejected on 30th June,

2008 and intimation in this regard was sent to the detenu on 1 st

has been held by the Supreme Court that the time taken in

the detenu is decided sometime is bound to be taken by the

sponsoring authority in giving the comments.     If, in terms of the

judgment of the Supreme Court, the time taken by the sponsoring

<p id="p_64">b)    As against this, the learned counsel for the respondents has

produced before us a notification dated 22nd April, 1998 issued by

the Finance Ministry in order to urge that the said notification

was given to the Special Secretary cannot be said to be bad.


</p><p id="p_65">c)    The representation of the detenu was considered by the

Finance to decide the representation of the detenu which was

sought to be changed by another office order dated 2nd

Secretary who considered the representation of the detenu.

Therefore, there was no infirmity in the rejection of the

representation of the detenu.   In view of the aforesaid facts and

there is no merit in the submission made by the learned counsel

recorded on 3rd and 4th August, 2007 under <a href="/doc/877314/" id="a_53">Section 108</a> of the

Customs Act had admitted that he was neither the owner of the

proprietary concern M/s Om Prakash Deepak Kumar yet he in his

own hand writing, printed or manufactured the letter head of the

said concern claiming himself to be the proprietor of M/s Om

Prakash Deepak Kumar having its office at 1074-75, Room No.23,

Jyoti Market, Gandhi Gali, Fatehpuri, Delhi-110006 and sought

clearance of the goods by using the said document as genuine

from the Customs Authorities.      Deepak Kumar Aggarwal the

actual proprietor has also got his statement recorded wherein he

stated that it was his IEC code and PAN number which were

misused by the detenu in the instant case.   As a matter of fact

the detenu was impersonating and cheating the Customs

Authorities.   The statement of clearing agent and his nominee

also support this fact.   It was on the basis of these documents

that the detenu had mis-declared his goods both with regard to

 quality, quantity and the description which on 100% checking

were found to be resulting in evasion of duty to the tune of lakhs

of rupees.    Further, though the detenu had denied that he had

never imported or got cleared eight consignments received

earlier the ICD yet there is prima facie evidence placed on record

by the respondents to show that it was the detenu who had filed

the declaration forms and got those goods also cleared on the

basis of this false fictitious representation of being proprietary of

concern with somebody else‟s IEC Code and PAN number.           This

tantamounts to prima facie commission of various criminal

offences.    We can certainly not close our eyes to these acts of

omission and commission on the part of the detenu which prima

facie is in our opinion resulting commission of various offences

under <a href="/doc/739296/" id="a_54">Sections 199</a>, <a href="/doc/1436241/" id="a_55">420</a>, <a href="/doc/556166/" id="a_56">468</a> and <a href="/doc/1466184/" id="a_57">471</a> Indian Penal Code by the

Commissioner of Customs, ICD, Tughlakabad to lodge a report

register a case under various provisions of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_61">IPC</a> as stated

hereinabove and/or any other and then proceed ahead in the

matter in accordance with law so that it acts as a deterrent not

only to the delinquent but also to the persons with similar

the local police they will deal with the same in accordance with
