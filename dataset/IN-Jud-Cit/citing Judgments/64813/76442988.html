<p id="p_1">1.    This order is on the applications, of the plaintiffs for interim

relief (IA No.4832/2000), of the defendant DDA for vacation of the ex

parte order (IA No.7382/2007), of the plaintiffs for ordering

demarcation of the suit property (IAs No.11954/2008 &amp; 4174/2009)

and of the defendant DDA for filing additional documents (IA

</p><p id="p_3"> 2.    The plaintiffs instituted the suit for declaration, injunction and

damages     with   respect   to   the   land   admeasuring   300   bighas

(approximately 65 acres) adjacent to Safdarjung Hospital and facing

the erstwhile Kamal Cinema at Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi. It is

the case of the plaintiffs that their fore-fathers were granted the

Malgujari rights and the nambardari rights of the land in question

since times immemorial and had thus been enjoying the said land as

owner thereof; that in the Jamabandies/misl hakiyat available with

the plaintiffs, the predecessors of the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs

have been shown as owners in possession of the land; that the said

land had never been acquired, no acquisition proceedings with

respect thereto had been completed and the fore-fathers of the

plaintiffs or the plaintiffs had never been given any compensation

with respect to the said land; that the possession of the plaintiffs of

the said land had been uninterrupted, continuous and adverse to the

world at large including the defendant No.1 DDA and the defendant

No.2 Union of India and further that the possession of the plaintiffs

has been hostile to any claim of the DDA/Union of India; that the said

land was situated in village Arakhpur Bagh Mochi and which had

been urbanized vide notification of 19th February, 1999.               The

plaintiffs further pleaded that the DDA had been threatening to

dispossess the plaintiffs from the said land on the plea that the same

belonged to State i.e., Sarkar Daulatmadar, even though the land

had never been acquired and possession thereof never taken. The

plaintiffs further pleaded that the DDA had, in the past, also

attempted to dispossess the plaintiffs from the said land and for

which purposes various legal proceedings as listed out in para 7 of

the plaint had to be instituted and wherein, statements were made




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS)1075/2000                                               Page 2 of 30</span>
 that the plaintiffs will not be dispossessed without due process of

law.
</p>
<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5">3.     The plaintiffs further pleaded that proceedings under the

<a href="/doc/1506082/" id="a_1">Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act</a>, 1972 had

also been initiated even though the land was not public premises.

The plaintiffs claimed that the entries of "Sarkar Daulatmadar" in

the ownership column of the revenue records with respect to the

said land were without any basis inasmuch as the land was never

acquired.    The plaintiffs alleging that the DDA and Union of India

were clouding the title of the plaintiffs to the suit land, claim the

relief of declaration of their ownership, permanent injunction

restraining the DDA and Union of India from interfering with the

peaceful enjoyment and possession of the plaintiffs of the said land,

declaration that the proceedings before the Estate Officer were null

and void and also claim damages from the defendants. The plaintiffs

also claim mandatory injunction for directing the DDA to initiate

appropriate       action   for   removal   of   illegal   and   unauthorized

encroachment including jhuggi jhopri clusters from the said land and

direction to the DDA to construct boundary wall around the Jhuggi

jhopri on the said land so as to prevent any further encroachment

thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_6">

</p><p id="p_7">4.     The defendant No.2 Union of India in its written statement

contends that the said land had been acquired vide notification

No.775 dated 21st December, 1911 and award No. 28 dated 27th

November, 1912 had been made with respect thereto.                 It is thus

contended that the suit filed in May, 2000 is barred by time. Plea is

also taken that the suit is barred by Sections 15 and 16 of the Public



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS)1075/2000                                                   Page 3 of 30</span>
 Premises Act. It is denied that the plaintiffs have any right to or are

in possession of the said land and it is pleaded that the plaintiffs

were in fact, attempting to encroach upon the land.       It is further

pleaded that the plaintiff No.1 Ishmali Devi along with predecessor-

in-interest of plaintiffs 3 and 4 had earlier filed CW.No.3819/1995

wherein vide order dated 30th October, 1995 the parties were

directed to maintain status quo and thereafter orders were made for

fencing of the said land. It is averred that under the notification and

award aforesaid and further under award 29 dated 14th February,

1913, the entire area of village Arakhpur Bagh Mochi stood acquired

and vested in the Government and possession taken; no revenue was

assessed with respect thereto thereafter and no Jamabandi had been

prepared after 1911-1912 and that, as per the revenue records, the

area in question was being shown as belonging to "Sarkar

Daulatmadar".     It is claimed that a portion of the land had been

encroached by the Jhuggi Jhopri dwellers. It is further pleaded that

pursuant to agreement dated 31st March, 1937 between the

Secretary of State for India in Council on the one hand and the

erstwhile Delhi Improvement Trust on the other hand, the land of

entire village of Arakhpur Bagh Mochi was placed at the disposal of

Delhi Improvement Trust and which included the land subject matter

of the suit. It was further pleaded that upon constitution of the DDA,

the said land vested in the DDA and the claims of the plaintiffs with

respect thereto were described as bogus. The defendant No.2 Union

of India along with its written statement filed a typed copy of the

award No. 28(supra).
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.    The defendant No.1 DDA also filed a written statement

claiming the land to have vested in it under the agreement of 1937



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS)1075/2000                                             Page 4 of 30</span>
 (Supra) and as Nazul land. It is further claimed that in 1964 and

1979 land admeasuring 7.30 acres out of the said land was handed

over to L&amp;DO for extension of Safdarjung Hospital and another 3

acres was transferred to MCD for cremation ground. It is pleaded

that in the revenue records, the cultivators were never recorded as

lawful occupants. The defendant No.1 DDA denied the claims of the

plaintiffs with respect to the said lands.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.    The plaintiffs, along with the plaint, filed an application for

interim relief.    When the suit came up before this court first, this

court required the plaintiffs to file an affidavit.   An affidavit dated

25th May, 2000 of plaintiff No.1 Smt Ishmali Devi was filed stating

the area and the Khasra No., of which each of the plaintiffs claimed

entitlement.      On 9th August, 2000 the counsels for the DDA and

Union of India stated that the proceedings under the Public Premises

Act were in progress and the plaintiffs will not be dispossessed

without the due process of law.         The counsel for the plaintiffs

contended that the proceedings under the Public Premises Act were

without jurisdiction. In the circumstances it was directed that final

order in the said Public Premises Act proceeding be not passed till

the next date of hearing, though the proceedings may continue. On

the next date i.e., 28th August, 2000, it is only ordered that the

plaintiffs be not dispossessed from the said land till the final disposal

of the application for interim relief and the earlier order dated 9 th

August, 2000 stood modified to that extent.

<p id="p_12">

</p><p id="p_13">7.    On 5th August, 2002 a Local Commissioner was appointed by

this court to identify the layout of the boundary wall being

constructed at site and to prepare a site plan covering the entire



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS)1075/2000                                              Page 5 of 30</span>
 land and indicating the extent of actual occupancy and status of

different portions of the land and to coordinate the preparation of a

joint survey report by a team of officials of the L&amp;DO and DDA and

South Delhi District Revenue Department.             It is noted in the

subsequent        order   dated   8th   August,   2002   that   the   Court

commissioner had informed the court that the land in question and

location was about 65 acres and out of which almost 48 acres was

lying vacant and uncultivated, except for a very small portion of one

acre patch.        This court in order to safeguard the land from

encroachment directed that the DDA should continue with its

construction of the walls and encircle the vacant land as already

ordered by the Division Bench in the writ petition.



</p><p id="p_14">8.    To compete the chronology of interim orders, on 7th August,

2008 it was complained by the plaintiffs that inspite of the interim

orders aforesaid, the boundary of Safdarjung Hospital on one side of

the said land had been broken down and a new boundary wall was

constructed by including a portion of the suit land within the area of

Safdarjung Hospital. This court directed maintenance of status quo

qua construction and possession and it was further clarified that no

construction activity be carried out even on the land which had been

shown included within the boundaries of Safdarjung Hospital. The

plaintiffs were directed to file another affidavit. An affidavit dated

19th August, 2008 of plaintiff Mr Rajpal had been filed in which it had

been stated that the plaintiffs were          then in possession of land

admeasuring 243.14 bighas and the proceedings under the Public

Premises Act had been initiated with respect 231.02 bighas. It was

further clarified that besides the said 243.14 bighas there was no

other open land at site.

</p><p id="p_16"> 9.         The defendants on 13th March, 2009 also filed in this court the

eviction orders issued under the Public Premises Act.



</p><p id="p_17">10.        On 19th August, 2008 it was contended by the counsel for the

DDA that out of the suit land, land admeasuring 0.647 acres and

which had been included within the boundary of Safdarjung Hospital

was required for the purposes of construction of a Sports Injury

Centre for the Commonwealth Games 2010 and as such soil test with

respect thereto was permitted to be carried out. On 16th November,

2008 senior counsel for the plaintiffs, without prejudice to the rights

and contentions of the plaintiffs and without any special equities

being created in favour of the defendants agreed, that the

construction of the Sports Injury Centre on the said 0.647 acres of

land be carried out subject to the condition that if ultimately the

defendants lose in the suit, the defendants would compensate the

plaintiffs with the costs of the said land as per market valuation of

the land on the principle that the land had been acquired as on that

date and subject to the defendants being further bound by any

further orders of the court.

             granted only to the owners; the land continued to be

         arguments that the case of the land being in Pilanji has been

        made out;

   vi. Attention was invited to the pleadings in the earlier suit

        wherein the predecessors of the plaintiffs had claimed to be

        tenant of the land and had not made any challenge to the

        entries in the revenue record of Arakhpur Bagh Mochi

        showing "Sarkar Daulatmadar" as the owner of the land;

        Government being the owner, the plaintiffs are now after 30

        years not entitled to challenge the title of the Union of India;

    xi. it was contended that thus the plaintiffs have not been able to

       demonstrate even prima facie any title to the premises.;



   xii. it was contended that that the plaintiffs had in the plaint

       referred to earlier legal proceedings but had not filed any

       copy thereof; adverse inference ought to be drawn against the

       plaintiff; if the plaintiffs did not claim ownership in the earlier

       proceedings, they cannot be permitted to do so now. Reliance

       was placed on Deva Ram Vs. Ishwar Chand (1995) 6 SCC

       733 and Shiv Kumar Sharma Vs. Santosh Kumari (2007) 8

       SCC 600. It was further contended that even in the plaint in

       the present suit it is not the case that the plaintiffs had in the

       earlier proceedings claimed ownership to the land;



   xiii. it was further urged that the plaintiffs had in the plaint in the

       present suit also claimed only Nambardari rights; it is argued

       that the Nambardars were only for recovery of rent and had

       no title to the property; that the plaintiffs could be Nambardar

       only under the ownership of Union of India. Reference was

       also made to P.T. Munichikkanna Reddy Vs. Revamma

       (2007) 6 SCC 59 to contend that the plaintiffs could not claim

       adverse possession.    In this context R. Chandevarappa Vs.

       State of Karnataka (1995) 6 SCC 309; State of Rajasthan

       Vs. Harphool Singh (2000) 5 SCC 652; Puran Singh Vs.

       State of Punjab (1975) 4 SCC 518 and Rame Gowda Vs. M.

       Varadappa Naidu (2004) 1 SCC 769 were also cited.

        plaintiffs succeeding in the suit, the land will nevertheless

       have to be acquired.

   xv. The ASG appearing for the Union of India also relied upon the

       judgment of this court in Satish Khosla Vs. M/s Eli Lilly

       Ranbaxy Ltd. 71 (1998) DLT 1 to contend that the plaintiffs

       having     suppressed   their    pleadings   in   the   earlier   legal

       proceedings are not entitled to the discretionary relief of

       injunction.

<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32">12.   The senior counsel for the plaintiffs to meet the argument of,

the plaintiffs/their predecessor in the earlier legal proceedings

having claimed to be only occupants/licencee, argued that the plaint

in earlier suit related to the land in village Mujahidpur, while the suit

land is in village Pilanji. It was contended that the earlier suits did

not relate to the suit land but related to other lands with respect

whereto       the    plaintiffs/their     predecessors         were      mere

occupants/licencees. On query, as to why, if it was so, reference to

those suits was made in the plaint in the present suit, it is answered

that it is a mistake.    It may be noticed that in the writ petition

(Supra) also, the land is described as in village Mujahidpur.



</p><p id="p_33">      It was further contended that the documents filed by the

plaintiffs and from which the senior counsel for the defendants had

pointed out the land to be situated in Mujahidpur not in Pilanji had

also been wrongly filed. It was contended that under the Punjab

High Court Rules those documents filed in earlier suits were not

admissible in evidence and were not in accordance with the Punjab

Land Revenue Act. Elaborate submissions were made as to what are

the documents of rights and it was contended that the documents

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS)1075/2000                                                  Page 18 of 30</span>
 filed by the plaintiffs and from which the land appears to be in

Mujahidpur were not such documents of rights.            It was further

contended that the plaintiffs were illiterate people and no proper

inquiry had been made from them and it was further contended that

if the original records were to be brought, the same would not

contain the records, copies of which had been filed mistakenly by the

plaintiffs. It was lastly contended that the possession of the plaintiffs

being admitted and the plaintiffs being in settled possession were

entitled to protect their possession during the trial.

the test of prima facie case irreparable injury and balance of

convenience are to be applied.      However, of late the courts have

<p id="p_35">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">      10.   Before parting with this case, we think it necessary to
            make a few observations relevant to land acquisition
            proceedings. Our country is now launched upon an
            ambitious     programme       of   all-round   economic
            advancement to make our economy competitive in the
            world market. We are anxious to attract foreign direct
            investment to the maximum extent. We propose to
            compete with China economically. We wish to attain
            the pace of progress achieved by some of the Asian
            countries, referred to as "Asian tigers", e.g., South
            Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. It is, however,
            recognised on all hands that the infrastructure
            necessary for sustaining such a pace of progress
            is woefully lacking in our country. The means of
            transportation, power and communications are
            in dire need of substantial improvement,
            expansion and modernisation. These things very
            often call for acquisition of land and that too without
            any delay. It is, however, natural that in most of these
            cases, the persons affected challenge the acquisition
            proceedings in courts. These challenges are generally
            in the shape of writ petitions filed in High Courts.
            Invariably, stay of acquisition is asked for and in some
            cases, orders by way of stay or injunction are also


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">CS(OS)1075/2000                                              Page 19 of 30</span>
             made. Whatever may have been the practices in the
            past, a time has come where the courts should keep
            the larger public interest in mind while exercising
            their power of granting stay/injunction. The power
            under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article 226</a> is discretionary. It will be exercised
            only in furtherance of interests of justice and not
            merely on the making out of a legal point. And in the
            matter of land acquisition for public purposes, the
            interests of justice and the public interest coalesce.
            They are very often one and the same. Even in a civil
            suit, granting of injunction or other similar
            orders, more particularly of an interlocutory
            nature, is equally discretionary. The courts have
            to weigh the public interest vis-a-vis the private
            interest while exercising the power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_13">Article
            226</a> indeed any of their discretionary powers. It
            may even be open to the High Court to direct, in
            case it finds finally that the acquisition was
            vitiated on account of non-compliance with some legal
            requirement that the persons interested shall also be
            entitled to a particular amount of damages to be
            awarded as a lumpsum or calculated at a certain
            percentage of compensation payable. There are many
            ways of affording appropriate relief and redressing a
            wrong; quashing the acquisition proceedings is not
            the only mode of redress. To wit, it is ultimately a
            matter of balancing the competing interest.
            Beyond this, it is neither possible nor advisable to say.
            We hope and trust that these considerations will
            be duly borne in mind by the courts while
            dealing      with     challenges      to    acquisition
            proceedings.

           challenging the validity of the order of demolition is to
           restrain such demolition with the intervention of the
           Court. In such a suit the plaintiff is more interested in
           getting an order of interim injunction. It has been
           pointed out repeatedly that a party is not entitled
           to an order of injunction as a matter of right or

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">      31. Under the changed circumstance with so many
          cases pending in Courts, once an interim order of
          injunction is passed, in many cases, such interim
          orders continue for months; if not for years. At
          final hearing while vacating such interim orders
          of injunction in many cases, it has been
          discovered that while protecting the plaintiffs
          from suffering the alleged injury, more serious
          injury has been caused to the defendants due to
          continuance of interim orders of injuction without
          final hearing. It is a matter of common knowledge
          that on many occasions even public interest also
          suffers in view of such interim orders of
          injunction, because persons in whose favour such
          orders are passed are interested in perpetuating
          the contraventions made by them by delaying the
          final disposal of such applications. The Court
          should be always willing to extend its hand to protect a
          citizen who is being wronged or is being deprived of a
          property without any authority in law or without
          following the procedure which are fundamental and
          vital in nature. But at the same time the judicial
          proceedings cannot be used to protect or to perpetuate
          a wrong committed by a person who approaches the
          Court.

             note, in this connection, that it has not always been
             regarded as altogether beyond doubt whether a

              of Interlocutory Remedies" stated that "if the plaintiff
             is likely to suffer irreparable or uncompensable
             damage, no interlocutory injunction will be granted,
             then, provided that the plaintiff would be able to
             compensate the defendant for any unwarranted
             restraint on the defendant's right pending trial, the
             balance would tilt in favour of restraining the
             defendant pending trial. Where both sides are exposed
             to irreparable injury pending trial, the courts have to
             strike a just balance". At page 447, it is stated that
             "the court considering an application for an
             interlocutory injunction has four factors to
             consider : first, whether the plaintiff would suffer
             irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; secondly,
             whether this harm outweighs any irreparable harm
             that the defendant would suffer from an injunction;
             thirdly, the parties' relative prospects of success on
             the merits; fourthly, any public interest involved in
             the decision. The central objective of interlocutory
             injunctions should therefore be seen as reducing the
             risk that rights will be irreparably harmed during the
             inevitable delay of litigation".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">        13. In "Injunctions" by David Bean, 1st Edn, at page 22, it
             is stated that "if the plaintiff obtains an interlocutory
             injunction, but subsequently the case goes to trial and
             he fails to obtain a perpetual order, the defendant will
             meanwhile have been restrained unjustly and will be
             entitled to damages for any loss he has sustained. The
             practice has therefore grown up, in almost every case
             where interlocutory injunction is to be granted, of
             requiring the plaintiff to undertake to pay any
             damages subsequently found due to the defendant as
             compensation if the injunction cannot be justified at
             trial. The undertaking may be required of the plaintiff
             in appropriate cases in that behalf. In "Joyce on
             Injunctions" Vol. 1 in paragraph 177 at page 293, it is
             stated "Upon a final judgment dissolving an injunction,
             a right of action upon the injunction bond immediately
             follows, unless the judgment is superseded. A right to
             damages on dissolution of the injunction would arise at
             the determination of the suit at law".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">        14. It would thus be clear that in a suit for perpetual
            injunction, the court should enquire on affidavit
            evidence and other material placed before the court to
            find strong prima facie case and balance of
            convenience in favour of granting injunction otherwise
            irreparable damage or damage would ensue to the
            plaintiff. The court should also find whether the
            plaintiff would adequately be compensated by
            damages if injunction is not granted. It is common
            experience that injunction normally is asked for and
            granted to prevent the public authorities or the
            respondents to proceed with execution of or
            implementing scheme of public utility or granted
            contracts for execution thereof. Public interest is,
            therefore, one of the material and relevant

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">CS(OS)1075/2000                                              Page 22 of 30</span>
              considerations in either exercising or refusing to grant
             ad     interim   injunction.   While     exercising   the
             discretionary power, the court sould also adopt the
             procedure of calling upon the plaintiff to file a bond to
             the satisfaction of the court that in the event of his
             failing in the suit to obtain the relief asked for in the
             plaint, he would adequately compensate the defendant
             for the loss ensued due to the order of injunction
             granted in favour of the plaintiff. Even otherwise the
             court while exercising its equity jurisdiction in
             granting injunction has also jurisdiction and power to
             grant adequate compensation to mitigate the damages
             caused to the defendant by grant of injunction
             restraining the defendant to proceed with the
             execution of the work etc., which is retrained by an
             order of injunction made by the court. The pecuniary
             award of damages is consequential to the adjudication
             of the dispute and the result therein is incidental to
             the determination of the case by the court. The
             pecuniary jurisdiction of the court of first instance
             should not impede nor be a bar to award damages
             beyond it pecuniary jurisdiction. In this behalf, the
             grant or refusal of damages is not founded upon the
             original cause of action but the /consequences of the
             adjudication by the conduct of the parties, the court
             gets inherent jurisdiction in doing ex debito justitiae
             mitigating the damage suffered by the defendant by
             the act of the court in granting injunction restraining
             the defendant from proceeding with the action
             complained of in the suit It is common knowledge that
             injunction is invariably sought for in laying the suit in
             a court of lowest pecuniary jurisdiction even when the
             claims are much larger than the pecuniary jurisdiction
             of the court of first instance, may be, for diverse
             reasons. Therefore, the pecuniary jurisdiction is not
             and should not stand an impediment for the court of
             first instance in determining damages as the part of
             the adjudication and pass a decree in that behalf
             without relegating the parties to a further suit for
             damages. This procedure would act as a check on
             abuse of the process of the court and adequately
             compensate the damages or injury suffered by the
             defendant by act of court at the behest of the plaintiff.

present case that the land aforesaid is required for public works,

during the arguments it was contended that the same is urgently

 required for a temporary godown in relation to DMRC project.           In

fact, on the day when the senior counsel for the plaintiffs had

conceded to construction for the Sports Injury Centre on a portion of

the said land, it was suggested that similarly, the works of DMRC be

also permitted to be carried out on the said land on the same

conditions, i.e in the event of the plaintiffs succeeding in the suit,

they would be entitled to compensation for acquisition of the said

land as mentioned in order dated 19th August, 2008. However, the

senior counsel for the plaintiffs on instructions from the plaintiffs

had declined the same.
</p>
<p id="p_45">

</p><p id="p_46">19.    Testing the element of prima facie case in the context of the

aforesaid, in my view it cannot be said that the plaintiffs have a

prima facie case of being the owners of the land as claimed in the

plaint in the present suit.   The senior counsel for the plaintiffs,

rather than showing the prima facie case of the ownership of the

plaintiffs sought to guide the arguments towards whether the

defendants have prima facie established acquisition of the land or

not.   The plaintiffs by addressing lengthy arguments and citing a

plethora of case law have though succeeded in pushing this matter to

the back burner. However, at this stage, it is not the defence which

has to be tested but the case with which the plaintiffs have

approached the court which is to be gauged.
</p>
<p id="p_47">

</p><p id="p_48">20.    The single most important factor coming in the way of the

plaintiffs establishing a prima facie case of ownership is the stand of

the plaintiffs/their predecessors in the earlier litigations of being

occupancy tenants/licencees with respect to the said land under the

Government of India. I am unable to accept the explanation of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CS(OS)1075/2000                                             Page 25 of 30</span>
 senior counsel for the plaintiffs in this regard. The plaintiffs cannot

be classified as villagers.    The plaintiffs have been litigating with

respect to this valuable land as per their own admissions in the

plaint since the year 1962 and are well aware of their rights and

have at all stages had the benefit of eminent legal assistance.      The

plaintiffs have categorically stated in the plaint that the earlier legal

proceedings were with respect to the same land with respect

whereto the suit was filed. The ingenuity of the explanation of the

senior counsel for the plaintiffs of it having been mistakenly stated

that the other proceedings were with respect to the same land

cannot save the plaintiffs.      Mistake has to be pleaded and not

argued. It was the plaintiffs who in an attempt to take advantage of

the orders in the earlier proceedings whereby the plaintiffs claimed

that    the       defendants   had   agreed   not    to   disturb     the

occupation/possession of the plaintiffs, had referred to the same. The

plaintiffs cannot be permitted to distance themselves from the same

when confronted with the contradictory stand contained in their

pleadings in the said proceedings.      Similarly, the argument of the

senior counsel for the plaintiffs that, the documents filed by the

plaintiffs themselves in support of their case and showing the land to

be in a village other than the village argued by the plaintiffs now

were filed mistakenly, also does not carry much weight. In fact on

the basis thereof, at least for the purposes present applications, the

edifice of the case built during the arguments falls.


</p><p id="p_49">21.    I also find considerable force in the contention of the

defendants that the plaintiffs having admitted that in the revenue

records of the land, "Sarkar Daulatmadar" i.e. the Government has

been entered as the owner thereof have at least at this stage not



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CS(OS)1075/2000                                              Page 26 of 30</span>
 shifted the burden of establishing otherwise. It is the case of the

plaintiffs themselves that the land has been so recorded for the last

over 40 years. In spite of the same, the plaintiffs did not take any

step whatsoever to have the said entries corrected.         In fact the

plaintiffs themselves have sought to establish their title to the land

on the basis of the said revenue records and not on any other

document. At this stage, no reason is found to disbelieve the said

revenue records and as per which for the last over 40 years prior to

the institution of the suit the Government of India is shown as the

owner of the land.
</p>
<p id="p_50">
</p><p id="p_51">22.   As far as the claim of the plaintiffs to injunction on the ground

of being in possession of the land is concerned, it is not disputed that

the land is open; no cultivation is being carried thereon.          The

principle with respect to such open land is that the same is deemed

to be in possession of the person having title thereto. Reliance in

this regard can be placed upon Naval Ram, Laxmi Das Devmurari

Vs. Vijayaben Jayvantbhai Chauda AIR 1998 Gujarat 17 where it

has been held that the concept of possession is an abstract one; the

ordinary presumption is that possession follows title; presumption of

possession over an open land always is deemed to be that of the

owner; an open piece of land shall be presumed to be in possession

of the owner unless it is proved by the trespasser that he has done

some substantial acts of possession over the land which may excite

the attention of the owner that he has been dispossessed; the

presumption of owner being in possession of open land becomes

strong when the defendant fails to establish the ground on which he

claims to have come in possession. This is so because proof of actual

possession is impossible on account of nature of such land. In the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CS(OS)1075/2000                                             Page 27 of 30</span>
 present case, it is the admitted position that the land has been

fenced under orders of the writ court. The plaintiffs themselves have

claimed    the    relief   of   asking   the   defendants   to   remove    the

encroachers on a portion of the land. For this reason also, it cannot

be said that the plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction against their

dispossession.
</p>
<p id="p_52">
</p><p id="p_53">23.   As far as the ingredient of irreparable injury is concerned,

during the course of lengthy arguments it has been repeatedly urged

by the senior counsel for the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs have no

objection to the defendants acquiring the land now and paying the

prevalent compensation therefor, if required for public purpose as

was being urged by the senior counsels/ASG for the defendants. On

the same reasoning, concession with respect to 0.647 acres of land

was given on 19th August, 2008. Thus, it is not the position that the

dispute being with respect to land, order of status quo must follow.

This lis is all about compensation for the land i.e. whether it has

already been paid at the rates of acquisition of the year 1911 or is to

be paid at the rates prevalent today. I do not find any difference in

calculating the said value for 0.647 acres or for the entire land.

Thus, even in the event of the plaintiffs succeeding, it is not as if the

plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury. The plaintiffs can always be

compensated as per their claims.
</p>
<p id="p_54">
</p><p id="p_55">24.   In these circumstances, I am of the view that if injunction, as

claimed, is issued, the same is likely to delay the public project for

which the land is required. The loss which would be suffered by the

public at large would be incalculable and irreparable. No possible

condition can be imposed on the plaintiffs to make good the said loss

in the event of the plaintiffs ultimately being not found entitled to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS(OS)1075/2000                                                   Page 28 of 30</span>
 relief. Per contra, if injunction is refused and resultantly the land is

allowed to be used for public projects and if ultimately the

defendants are found to have failed in their defence, the plaintiffs

can be compensated.
</p>
<p id="p_56">

</p><p id="p_57">25.   The question of balance of convenience has to be considered

with the question of public interest as aforesaid. The city is poised

for the Commonwealth Game of the year 2010. The DMRC work on

the Mehrauli line for which purpose the land is stated to be required

is underway. The loss which will be suffered to the public at large in

the event of the said line being not completed in time for the reasons

of the said land being not available would be far more than the

injury, if any, to the plaintiffs. Thus, the interest of the handful of

plaintiffs must give way to the larger public interest.


</p><p id="p_58">26.   In the face of it having been demonstrated as aforesaid that

the plaintiffs have concealed from this court that the plaintiffs had in

the earlier proceedings admitted themselves to be licencees/tenants

and not claimed themselves to be the owner of the land, the plaintiffs

otherwise also are not found entitled to the exercise of any discretion

in their favour.   The application of the plaintiffs for interim relief

being IA.No.4832/2000 is dismissed. IA.No.7382/2007 under Order

39 Rule 4 CPC is allowed. The ad interim orders are vacated.


</p><p id="p_59">27.   The senior counsel for the plaintiffs has also made elaborate

arguments on the application for Hadshikni and/or for having the

land demarcated. I, however, find that there is no dispute as to the

identity of the land. There was no such dispute at the time of the

institution of the suit also. The occasion therefor has arisen owing to

the arguments raised of the land being in village Pilanji, in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS(OS)1075/2000                                              Page 29 of 30</span>
 contravention of the case earlier made of the land being in village

Mojahidpur and/or Arakhpur Bagh Mochi.             In view of such

contradictory stands of the plaintiffs, the said application cannot

hold up the disposal of the applications for interim relief. There is

yet another reason for me to not allow the said application. The

entire    surrounding    area    has    been     developed.          The

demarcation/Hadshikni in revenue terms was/is carried out with

reference to fixed points contained in the revenue records and all of

which are likely to have disappeared with the urban development all

around the said land.    Also such demarcation is likely to lead to

objections and in my view for the reasons aforesaid would not serve

any purpose at this stage. It would however remain open to the

plaintiffs at the stage of evidence to, if entitled to, lead relevant

evidence. In fact no court orders are required for such demarcation.

The plaintiffs by approaching the revenue authorities and if entitled

to can have the said demarcation carried out and lead evidence with

respect thereto. In fact the plaintiffs in the last so many years since

when the suit has been pending ought to have done so and adverse

inference can be drawn against the plaintiffs for the same.            IA

No.11954/2008 &amp; IA No.4174/2009 are thus dismissed.

additional documents IA No.3352/2009 is concerned, issues having

not been framed the same is allowed.      The plaintiffs have already
