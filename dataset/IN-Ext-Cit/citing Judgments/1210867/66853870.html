CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ADITYA KUMAR TRIVEDI
CAV JUDGMENT
Date: 29-11-2013

                    Informant/petitioner being aggrieved and dissatisfied

   with the judgment of acquittal dated 08.05.2003 passed by presiding

   officer, Additional Court No. 1 (FTC), Sasaram in connection with

   Sessions Trial No. 284/2002/30/2002 has filed the instant revision

   petition.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                    2. While assailing the judgment of acquittal it has been

   submitted on behalf of petitioner that the learned lower court had not

   considered the evidence adduced on behalf of prosecution under

   proper perceptiveness. It has further been submitted that process of

   scrutinizing of the evidence by the learned trial court divulges the pre-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                            2</span>




occupied mind of the learned P.O. leaning in favour of O.P./accused

on account of which, the interest of prosecution is found severely

daunt. It has further been submitted that in spite of having sufficient

material on record to justify conviction of the Opposite Parties, the

aforesaid relevant pieces of evidences have completely been ignored.

Further elaborating the points, it has been submitted that the learned

lower court misconstrued the legal position that the evidence of

hostile witnesses should be brushed aside in its totality. It has further

been submitted that had the learned lower court taken the evidence of

the hostile witnesses in its entirety, the chain of circumstance might

have been found completely fused encircling the OPs to be

responsible for causing death of deceased in pre-planned manner.

</p><p id="p_11">               3. Then coming to the evidence of PW-9 Yogendra,

uncle of deceased as well as PW-10, the informant, it has been

submitted that Yogendra had categorically stated that he along with

deceased have got down during midst of way at Sakla Bazar while

returning from Dehri where they met with accused persons who

managed to detain the deceased, Arun Kumar Singh @ Tuntun Singh

on the pretext of gossiping as well as tracing out solution in the

background of dispute arose during previous election. Then thereafter,

the dead body of deceased was found on the following morning. That

means to say, the theory of last seen is found applicable and for that,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                            3</span>




the evidence of PW-9 was consistent without any material

contradiction as is evident from the evidence of PW-11, the I.O. It has

also been submitted that in terms of Section-134 of the Evidence Act,

it is the quality and not the quantity which would count during

appreciation of evidence whereupon PW-9 had shown his bona fide.

Therefore, rejection of evidence of PW-9 by the learned trial court

appears to be inappropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case.

</p><p id="p_12">               4. It has further been submitted that PW-9 is found

corroborated with PW-10, the informant who, though is a hearsay

witness, but his evidence is found consistent with the evidence of PW-

</p><p id="p_13">9. He had categorically stated whatever conveyed to him by PW-9

which is found corroborated by PW-9. It has further been submitted

that there happens to be no controversy with regard to death of

deceased, Arun Kumar Singh. It is also apparent that PW-9 had

supported the theme of last seen and on account thereof, it was

incumbent upon the accused to have explained during course of

statement recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_1">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C. Having not been

explained on their part is a circumstance which will go against the

accused and on account thereof, in the totality of the event the case is

found fully proved. Therefore, the judgment of acquittal recorded by

the learned lower court is bad, illegal, perverse and is fit to be set

aside.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                            4</span><p id="p_14">




</p><p id="p_15">              5. Though on account of non co-operation of learned

counsel for O.P. No.2 to 6 by having their absence for days together,

the argument on their behalf could not finally concluded. However,

during course of part hearing it has been argued that the judgment of

acquittal should not be disturbed in routine manner unless and until

there happens to be glaring procedural defect apparent from the

judgment impugned as well as gross error has been committed by the

trial court during course of appreciation of evidence. So far this

particular case is concerned, none of these factors are visualizing and

on account thereof, the judgment impugned is fit to be confirmed.

</p><p id="p_16">              6. It has further been argued that all the witnesses have

gone volte face to the prosecution. Apart from the fact that there is

improbability visualizing from the evidence of PW-9 as well as PW-

10, it is apparent that PW-10 is not an eyewitness to occurrence and

on account thereof, his evidence is of no use for the prosecution. With

regard to PW-9, it has been submitted that apart from inconsistency

appearing in his evidence, his appearance along with deceased Arun

Kumar Singh became suspicious from his own deposition whereunder

he had stated that he usually resides away from the village of which

deceased, Arun Kumar Singh was a resident. From his evidence, it is

apparent that he resides at his parental house while the deceased was

residing at Nawasa along with PW-10. Apart from this, evidence of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                            5</span>




PW-9 is not at all supported with by any of the PWs. Not only this,

from his evidence material development is found as supported by PW-

4 who makes his evidence unreliable.
</p>
<p id="p_17">               7. Because of the fact that none is an eyewitness of the

occurrence, therefore, the case based upon circumstantial evidence

and for that link of chain should be found properly inter connected.

There should not be an opportunity for a stranger to intervene. Even

accepting the evidence of PW-9, he has seen the deceased in company

of O.P. No.2 to 6 at Sakla Bazar and since thereafter there is no

evidence on the record whereupon an inference could be drawn that

deceased was taken away at the canal by the accused persons alive or

dead where his dead body was recovered. That means to say, even

accepting the evidence of PW-9, there is complete absence on the part

of prosecution to explain as to how the deceased covered such a long

distance from Sakla Market to the canal where his dead body was

found nor the O.Ps. be held accountable in the background of such

lapses.
</p>
<p id="p_18">               8. Learned APP fairly submitted that on account of

turning the material witnesses hostile, the case of the prosecution is

not at all found properly proved.
</p>
<p id="p_19">               9. The ambit and scope of revisional power more

particularly relating to judgment against the acquittal has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            6</span>




subject to consideration before the Hon'ble Apex Court times

without number and more recently in the case of Venkatasan v.

Rani as reported in (2013)4 PLJR 154 SC , it has elaborately been

dealt with in paragraphs-6 and 7 which are as follows:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                     "6. To answer the questions that have arisen in
               the present case, as noticed at the very outset, the
               extent and ambit of the revisional jurisdiction of the
               High Court, particularly in the context of exercise
               thereof in respect of a judgment of acquittal, may be
               briefly noticed. The law in this regard is well settled
               by a catena of decisions of this Court. Illustratively, as
               also chronologically, the decisions rendered in
               <a href="/doc/376653/" id="a_2">Pakalapati Narayana Gajapathi Raju vs. Bonapalli Peda

               Specifically and for the purpose of a detailed
               illumination on the subject the contents of paras 8 and
               10 of the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/512594/" id="a_6">Akalu Ahir v.
               Ramdeo Ram</a> (supra) may be usefully extracted
               below.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                          "8. This Court, however, by way of
               illustration, indicated the following categories of
               cases which would justify the High Court in
               interfering with a finding of acquittal in revision:
</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">                               (i) Where the trial court has            no
               jurisdiction to try the
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                             case, but has still acquitted the accused;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                               (ii) Where the trial court has wrongly
               shut out evidence which the prosecution wished to
               produce;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                               (iii) Where the appellate court has
               wrongly held the evidence which was admitted by the
               trial court to be inadmissible;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                               (iv) Where the material evidence has
               been overlooked only (either) by the trial court or by
               the appellate court; and
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                               (v) Where the acquittal is based on the
               compounding of the offence which is invalid under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">             7</span>




the law.</blockquote><p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">            These categories were, however, merely
illustrative and it was clarified that other cases of
similar nature can also be properly held to be of
exceptional nature where the High Court can
justifiably interfere with the order of acquittal."
</p><p id="p_22">            "10. No doubt, the appraisal of evidence by
the trial Judge in the case in hand is not perfect or free
from flaw and a Court of appeal            may well have
felt justified in disagreeing with its conclusion, but
from this it does not follow that on revision by a
private complainant, the High Court is entitled to re-
appraise the evidence for itself as if it is acting as a
Court of appeal and then order a re-trial. It is
unfortunate that a serious offence inspired by
rivalry and jealousy in the matter of election to the
office of village Mukhia, should go unpunished. But
that can scarcely be a valid ground for ignoring or for
not strictly following the law as enunciated by this
Court."
</p><p id="p_23">          The observations in para 9 in the case of
<a href="/doc/1012887/" id="a_7">Vimal Singh v. Khuman Singh</a>[6] would also be apt
for recapitulation and, therefore, are being extracted
below.
</p><p id="p_24">             "9. Coming to the ambit of power of the
High Court under <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_8">Section 401</a> of the Code, the High
Court in its revisional power does not ordinarily
interfere with judgments of acquittal passed by the
trial court unless there has been manifest error of
law or procedure. The interference with the order of
acquittal passed by the trial court is limited only to
exceptional cases when it is found that the order
under revision suffers from glaring illegality or has
caused miscarriage of justice or when it is found that
the trial court has no jurisdiction to try the case or
where the trial court has illegally shut out the evidence
which otherwise ought to have been considered or
where the material evidence which clinches the issue
has been overlooked. These are the instances where the
High Court would be justified in interfering with the
order of acquittal. Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_9">Section 401</a>
mandates that the High Court shall not convert a
finding of acquittal into one of conviction. Thus,
the High Court would not be justified in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            8</span>




               substituting an order of acquittal into one of conviction
               even if it is convinced that the accused deserves
               conviction. No doubt, the High Court in exercise of its
               revisional power can set aside an                order of
               acquittal if it comes within the ambit of exceptional
               cases enumerated above, but it cannot convert an order
               of acquittal into an order of conviction. The only
               course left to the High Court in such exceptional cases
               is to order retrial."
</p><p id="p_25">                     7.     The above consideration would go to
               show that the revisional jurisdiction of the High
               Courts while examining an order of acquittal is
               extremely narrow and ought to be exercised only in
               cases where the Trial Court had committed a
               manifest error of law or procedure or had overlooked
               and ignored relevant and material evidence thereby
               causing miscarriage of justice. Re-appreciation of
               evidence is an exercise that the High Court must
               refrain from while examining an order of acquittal in
               the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_10"> the
               Code</a>. Needless to say, if within the limited
               parameters, interference of the High Court is justified
               the only course of action that can be adopted is to
               order a re-trial after setting aside the acquittal. As
               the language of <a href="/doc/1571667/" id="a_11">Section 401</a> of the Code makes it
               amply clear there is no power vested in the High Court
               to convert a finding of acquittal into one of conviction.

</p><p id="p_26">               10.   In the background of the aforesaid settled

principle, it is evident that in exceptional cases only there should be

appraisal of the evidence that too where the trial Court has erred

during appreciation of the evidence available on the record as well as

has overlooked the same.
</p>
<p id="p_27">               11. Thus, taking into account the rival submissions as

well as plea of the petitioner more particularly, needs re-appraisal of

the evidence to come to the conclusion whether findings so recorded
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                               9</span>




by the learned lower court are sustainable. From the L.C. record it is

evident that altogether 13 PWs have been examined on behalf of

prosecution out of whom PW-1 is Mohit Yadav who had denied to

have knowledge with regard to occurrence and as such he was

declared hostile. This PW-1, in the aforesaid background is found of

no use for the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_28">                12.    PW-2 is Sitaram Halwai who had simply

disclosed with Tuntun was murdered about eight months ago but he is

unable to say as to who had murdered and where he was murdered.

Again this PW is of no use.
</p>
<p id="p_29">                13. PW-3 is Jalaluddin Ansari. As per Fardbeyan, the

deceased along with accused persons had gone to his betal shop.

However, during course of evidence, he disowned the same and on

account thereof, his evidence is also found irrelevant with regard to

prosecution version.
</p>
<p id="p_30">                14. PW-4 is Ramsundari Devi. She had simply said

that Tuntun Singh was murdered about eight months ago but she has

shown her ignorance with regard to place and manner of occurrence.

According to prosecution version, she had witnessed the deceased in

company of an accused. Therefore, her evidence is also found of no

use so far prosecution case is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_31">                15. PW-5 has simply said that he came to know that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                           10</span>




one dead body is floating in the canal but he is unable to say whose

dead body it was as he did not see the same.
</p>
<p id="p_32">               16. PW-6 had stated that a rumour was heard by him

regarding murder of Tuntun Sing but he had not seen his dead body.

He further denied presence of Tuntun Singh at his shop.

</p><p id="p_33">               17. PW-7 had said that he is unable to disclose as to

how murder of Tuntun Singh was committed but he had seen the dead

body. During cross-examination, he had stated that Jogendra Singh

and father of deceased Nathuni Singh along with his family members

had come but they have not disclosed the names of assailant.

</p><p id="p_34">               18.    PW-8 has stated that he knew about the

occurrence. Inquest report was prepared in his presence as well as in

presence of Damodar Singh by the police over which he had put his

signature and accordingly, his signature was exhibited. However, he

failed to say any thing regarding occurrence.

</p><p id="p_35">               19. PW-13 is Shashi Kant Singh, a formal witness

who had exhibited an informatory petition bearing No. 1188/2001

filed on behalf of Nathuni Singh.
</p>
<p id="p_36">               20. Now PWs-9, 10, 11 and 12 are the witnesses over

which much emphasis has been laid on behalf of prosecution.

</p><p id="p_37">               21. PW-12 is Dr. Hemant Kumar who had conducted

postmortem over the dead body of Tuntun Singh @ Arun Kumar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                            11</span>




Singh on 06.01.2002 at about 4:30 p.m. and found the following ante

mortem injuries over the dead body:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                        External
                        Ligature present at the level of thyroid
                 cartilage--about ½" width surrounding all around
                 neck. It is horizontal and slight upward in the right
                 side.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">                        2. There are two ligature marks in the right
                 side of neck ½" apart.

</p><p id="p_39">          In the opinion of the doctor, the time elapsed since death is

12 to 24 hours. The cause of death has been shown due to asphyxia

caused by strangulation. During course of cross-examination nothing

substantial has been found. When the evidence of doctor is going to

be considered, it is evident that the death of deceased might have

taken place on 05.01.2002 in between 4:30 p.m. to 06.01.2002 at 4:30

a.m. and presence of semi digested food in stomach suggests having

the food at least two to three hours before death.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                            12</span>




</p><p id="p_40">               22. PW-10 is the informant. Admittedly, he is not an

eyewitness to occurrence. He had stated that on 04.01.2002, he was at

his house. His younger brother Yogendra Singh as well as Tuntun

Singh @ Arun Kumar Singh had gone to Dehri on 04.01.2002 and

returned back to Sakla Bazar after getting Rs. 20,000/-.They met with

Bagha Pandey, Kamla Paswan, Ashok Singh and Sanju Singh at Sakla

Bazar out of whom Bagha Pandey told Yogendra to move to his

house, they along with Tuntun will come later on as they have to

resolve the dispute relating to election. Thereafter, Yogendra came

and on query disclosed the aforesaid event. Tuntun did not return in

the night. In the following morning, he was informed by a passerby

that he had seen a dead body at Sakla canal over which he along with

Yogendra rushed and identified the dead body to be that of Tuntun.

On the information of Chaukidar, police came before whom he had

given his Fardbeyan and then had shown his suspicion against the

accused persons who may have committed murder in the aforesaid

background as well as for money and golden chain. At para-6, there

happens to be contradiction. He had further admitted presence of his

ancestral house at Bharpuria Village. Then had admitted presence of

cases at the behest of others.
</p>
<p id="p_41">               23. PW-9 is Yogendra Singh. He had stated that on

04.01.2002. he along with Tuntun @ Arun Kumar Singh had gone to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                           13</span>




Dehri from Bharpuria and during midst thereof they met with Kamla

Paswan at canal who enquired from them regarding destination and

further, when they will return back over which he informed that they

were going to Dehri and will return tomorrow. Arun happens to be his

nephew. They came at Dehri, took Rs. 20,000/- and then thereafter, he

along with Tuntun Singh had got down at Sakla Bazar on 05.01.2002.

at about 5:00 p.m. by bus. The had gone to shop of Lalan Singh where

they had taken tea and during course thereof, Bagha Pandey, Kamla

Paswan, Ashok Singh and Sanju Singh came. Bagha Pandey indulged

in talk with Tuntun and then they both had gone to the shop of

Jalaluddin to take betal. He directed Tuntun to proceed over which

Bagha Pandey had disclosed that you should go to your house. He

along with Tuntun will follow as some talk with regard to case has to

be made. Thereafter, he returned back to his house and during course

thereof, he saw Mohit Yadav at Sakla canal. On query made by his

father he informed regarding Tuntun. On the following day when he

along with Nathuni Singh proceeded in search of Tuntun. They had

seen a dead body in a canal which was taken out and identified that of

Tuntun. There was string spot at his neck. The cash as well as the

golden chain were missing. The police came there and Nathuni Singh

had given statement over which he had put his signature as well as

Yogendra Singh had also put his signature. He had further identified
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                           14</span>




the accused. During cross-examination at para-9, he had admitted that

they have got tarka at village, Maheshdih and further disclosed

genealogical table of his maternal grand father. He had further

admitted presence of one 396 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_12">IPC</a> case launched by Rajdeo Singh of

Mahadeopur against his brother along with others. In para-12 he had

disclosed that after getting information with regard to death of

Tuntun, they had gone to P.O. and remained there. Para-14, 15 happen

to be contradiction and the same is found corroborated with by the

evidence of PW-11, I.O.
</p>
<p id="p_42">              24. PW-11 is the I.O. He after registration of the case,

had conducted the investigation and during course thereof, had

inspected the place of occurrence, disclosed and identified as canal.

Prepared inquest, sent the dead body for postmortem then his attention

was drawn by the prosecution towards the statement of hostile

witnesses.   During   cross-examination,      he   had   admitted   the

contradiction persisting in the evidence of PW-9 (para-14, 15 and that

of informant, Nathuni Singh under para-16).
</p>
<p id="p_43">              25. Therefore, from the evidence available on record,

it is apparent that none is an eyewitness to occurrence. Although,

there happens to be material contradiction in the evidence of PW-9,

Yogendra Singh the sole witness over which prosecution has put

reliance, even with the aid of Section-134 of the Evidence Act is sole
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                            15</span>




testimony is not found inspiring confidence on account of material

contradiction persisting in his testimony as well as having not been

corroborated by other evidence at least by a shopkeeper where they

had gone to take tea, the betal shopkeeper where deceased along with

Bagha Pandey had taken betal, Mohit Yadav with whom they had

met. Even accepting his evidence, mere association at Sakal Bazar

will not identify the Opposite Party as a culprit because of the fact that

prosecution had not been able to place any sort of evidence during

intervening period.
</p>
<p id="p_44">               26. The basic principle for consideration of case based

upon circumstantial evidence attracts the chain of circumstances be

interlinked in such a manner as not of leaving any reasonable ground

for the conclusion with the innocence of the accused, and the

prosecution evidence must be up to such a level suggesting that in all

human probability the act must have been done by the accused, and

such finding should be placed by the circumstances which should be

of a conclusive nature and tendency. Now coming to the facts of

present case, the following infirmities are found:-

</p><p id="p_45">          (a) The prosecution has not brought on record any

document with regard to previous litigation relating to election in

between Bagha Pandey and deceased (b) When the prosecution was

well knowing since before regarding acrimonious relationship then in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                             16</span>




that event, sitting idle for whole night without any reasonable

explanation (C) Informant PW-10 had not disclosed that Tuntun had

gone to place of PW-9 Yogendra Singh and from there, they had gone

to Dehri while PW-9 had suggested so on 04.11.2002.

</p><p id="p_46">               27. PW-9 as well as PW-10 had stated that they have

brought Rs. 20,000/- from Dehri but its source has not been explained

whether it was withdrawn from a Bank or it was borrowed from a

friend or it was taken on loan. PW-9 had not disclosed the reason for

getting down at Sakla Bazar. Save and except the evidence of PW-9,

the prosecution failed to prove presence of PW-9 as well as deceased

at Sakla Bazar and in likewise manner having the deceased in

association with the O.P.
</p>
<p id="p_47">               28. The medical evidence suggests death in between

12 to 24 hours and consequent thereupon it was upon the prosecution

which would have shown the presence of deceased along with O.Ps.

during intervening period by reliable evidence.

</p><p id="p_48">               29. Even having considered the evidence of PW-9, a

grave suspicion may arise. For the purpose of convicting an accused

whether suspicion could substitute the obligation whereunder

prosecution is bound to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt

that has been properly considered and explained by the Hon'ble Apex

Court in the case of <a href="/doc/102217399/" id="a_13">Raj Kumar Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a> as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                           17</span>




reported in (2013) 5 SCC 722 under para-21 which is incorporated

hereinbelow:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">                        "21.   Suspicion, however grave it may be,
                cannot take the place of proof, and there is a large
                difference between something that `may be' proved
                and `will be proved'. In a criminal trial, suspicion no
                matter how strong, cannot and must not be permitted
                to take place of proof. This is for the reason, that the
                mental distance between `may be' and `must be' is
                quite large and divides vague conjectures from sure
                conclusions. In a criminal case, the court has a duty to
                ensure that mere conjectures or suspicion do not take
                the place of legal proof. The large distance between
                `may be' true and `must be' true, must be covered by
                way of clear, cogent and unimpeachable evidence
                produced by the prosecution, before an accused is
                condemned as a convict, and the basic and golden
                rule must be applied. In such cases, while keeping in
                mind the distance between `may be' true and `must
                be' true, the court must maintain the vital distance
                between conjectures and sure conclusions to be
                arrived at, on the touchstone of dispassionate
                judicial scrutiny based upon a complete and
                comprehensive appreciation of all features of the case,
                as well as the quality and credibility of the evidence
                brought on record. The court must ensure, that
                miscarriage of justice is avoided and if the facts and
                circumstances of a case so demand, then the benefit of
                doubt must be given to the accused, keeping in mind
                that a reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or
                a merely probable doubt, but a fair doubt that is
                based upon reason and common sense. (Vide:
