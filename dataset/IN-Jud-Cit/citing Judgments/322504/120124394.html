</pre><p id="p_62">	3.		Ramachandran, detenu in HCP.No.2276/2012, is a sitting Member of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly [M.L.A] from Thalli Constituency, Krishnagiri District.   Laghumaiah [detenu in HCP.No.2191/2012] is the father-in-law; Varadharajan [detenu in HCP.No.2199/2012] is the elder brother and Kesavan [detenu in HCP.No.2327/2012] is the brother-in-law  of the detenu Ramachandran.  The above detenus have been implicated in the ground case in Cr.No.143/2012 on the allegation of conspiracy.
</p>
<p id="p_63">	4.		Apart from the above said detenus, Periasamy [detenu in HCP.No.2328/2012]; Purushothaman @ Purushothamareddy [detenu in HCP.No.2232/2012] and Kalil [detenu in HCP.No.2330/2012] also alleged to have participated in the conspiracy.  The other detenus alleged to have been involved directly in the occurrence in the ground case in Cr.No.143/2012.
</p>	
<p id="p_64">	5.		The occurrence in the ground case is said to have taken place on 05.07.2012 at 5.00 a.m. in the agricultural fields of the deceased in Palepuram and in the said occurrence, two of the accused persons who have been directly alleged to have been participated said to have used country made guns and the other accused said to have used deadly weapons, viz., aruvals and country made bombs resulting in the death of the deceased Palanisamy.  Against the detenus, the Detaining Authority also noticed certain adverse cases registered against them earlier along with the ground case.  On a perusal of the materials placed by the Sponsoring Authority, the Detaining Authority, viz., the District Collector and District Magistrate, Krishnagiri District, has arrived at the subjective satisfaction and came to the conclusion that there is an imminent possibility of the detenus to come out on bail and on such an event, they would indulge in further activities which would be prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order and accordingly, passed the above said Detention orders.
</p>
<p id="p_65">	6.		Mr.I.Subramaniam, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in HCP.No.2191/2012 [in respect of the detenu Laghumaiah], while assailing the impugned Detention Order dated 04.09.2012, has put forward the following contentions:-
</p><p id="p_66">	[1]The Detaining Authority passed the impugned Detention Order on 04.09.2012 mainly on the basis of the dismissal of the bail application filed by the detenu on 

03.09.2012 and it is highly improbable for the Detaining Authority to apply his mind by perusing the entire materials available on record which runs to 450 pages within a day.
</p>
<p id="p_67">	[2]In paragraph 3 of the English version of the grounds of Detention, the Detaining Authority has mentioned the name of the detenu as Varadharajan in two places, more particularly, stating that the Detaining Authority is satisfied that an order of detention should be passed against the said Varadharajan  under Act 14/1982.  Again, the Detaining Authority has mentioned the names of the detenus Varadharajan and Periasamy in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Tamil Version of the grounds of detention instead of the detenu Laghumaiah and as such, the Detention order was passed in total non-application of mind.
</p>
<p id="p_68">	[3]The Detaining Authority has arrived at the subjective satisfaction without any cogent materials available on record to the effect that there is a real possibility of the detenu coming out on bail in the ground case without even mentioning about the filing of any subsequent bail application in the said ground case after specifically stating that the bail application filed by the detenu in the ground case was dismissed on  03.09.2012 in Crl.MP.No.1515/2012 by the learned Principal Sessions Judge, Krishnagiri or without even stating that action has been taken by his relatives by filing such application before the same Court or the Higher Courts. 
</p>
<p id="p_69">Learned Senior Counsel, in support of his contentions, has placed reliance on the following decisions:-

It is contended that the Detaining Authority has specifically stated that the detenus have not filed any bail application in the ground case so far and in spite of the same, without any materials available on record, he has arrived at the subjective satisfaction in a mechanical fashion stating that the detenus are likely to come out on bail and in the event of the detenus coming out on bail, they would indulge in further activities which would be prejudicial to the maintenance of  public order.

It is further contended that the Detaining Authority, however, in the absence of any cogent materials available on record and in total non-application of mind, has arrived at the subjective satisfaction to the effect that there is a real possibility of the detenus coming out on bail and on such an event, they would indulge in such further activities which would be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.

</p>
<p id="p_73">	10.		Per contra, Mr.S.Shanmugavelayutham, learned Public Prosecutor would vehemently contend that there is no infirmity or illegality in the impugned Detention Orders passed by the Detaining Authority.  It is contended that the Detaining Authority, only after applying his mind and only after perusing and scrutinizing the entire materials produced by the Sponsoring Authority, has arrived at the subjective satisfaction and has passed the impugned Detention Orders.  Learned Public Prosecutor would put forward the following contentions:-
</p>
<p id="p_74">	 [1]Merely because the Detaining Authority has wrongly mentioned the name of the detenu as Varadharajan and Periyasamy instead of Laghumaiah [in HCP.NO.2191/2012], it cannot be stated that the Detaining Authority has passed the Detention Order without application of mind and it is only a typographical error and no prejudice is caused to the said detenu.  
</p>	
<p id="p_75">	[2]There is no infirmity or illegality in passing the Detention order dated 04.09.2012, though the bail application was dismissed on the previous day of passing of the Detention Order, i.e., 03.09.2012 and it is possible for the Detaining Authority to go through the entire papers and arrive at the subjective satisfaction even in one day.  
</p>
<p id="p_76">	[3]The Sponsoring Authority has forwarded all the documents along with the request to pass Detention orders, as per the proposal affidavit dated 18.08.2012 and therefore, there is enough time available for the Detaining Authority to go through the same and arrive at the subjective satisfaction.
</p>

<p id="p_77">	[4]The principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in  REKHA Vs. STATE OF TAMIL  NADU THROUGH SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT AND ANOTHER  reported in (2011) 5 SCC 244, will not apply to the facts of the instant cases as the said case deals only in respect of the pendancy of the bail applications.
</p><p id="p_78">Learned Public Prosecutor, in support of his contentions, has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in A.K.GOPALAN AND ANOTHER Vs. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA reported in AIR 1960 SC 816 : 1966 Cri. L.J. 602.
</p>
<p id="p_79">	11. 		We have given our careful and anxious consideration to the rival contentions put forward by either side and perused the entire materials available on record including the impugned detention orders and its grounds.
</p>
<p id="p_80">	12.		From the above factual background and the contentions put forward by either side, the crux of questions that arise for consideration is:-
</p><p id="p_81">	[a]		Whether the Sponsoring Authority has produced the entire material documents including the copies of the dismissal orders of the bail applications dated 03.09.2012 and whether the Detaining Authority was able to peruse the entire voluminous material documents running to 450 pages in one day?
</p>
<p id="p_82">	[b]		Whether the Detaining Authority has arrived at the subjective satisfaction in total non-application of mind and in the absence of cogent materials available on record?
</p><p id="p_83">	[c]		Whether the impugned Detention Orders passed by the Detaining Authority is in conformity with the rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_21">Article 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_22">22[5]</a> of the Constitution of India?
</p>
<p id="p_84">	13.		Now, let us consider the questions in detail involved in these matters.
</p><p id="p_85">I.		WHETHER THE SPONSORING AUTHORITY HAS PRODUCED THE ENTIRE MATERIAL DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THE DISMISSAL ORDERS OF THE BAIL APPLICATIONS DATED 03.09.2012 AND WHETHER THE DETAINING AUTHORITY WAS ABLE TO PERUSE THE ENTIRE VOLUMINOUS MATERIAL DOCUMENTS RUNNING TO 450 PAGES IN ONE DAY:-
</p>
<p id="p_86">	[a]		At the outset, it is to be stated that the Detaining Authority, viz., the District Collector and the District Magistrate, Krishnagiri District, has passed as many as 17 Detention Orders on different dates in batches.  As far as the present question is concerned, the Detaining Authority has passed four Detention Orders on 04.09.2012 in HCP.No.2191/2012, 2199/2012, 2232/2012 and 2328/2012 and among these four petitions, the bail applications filed by the detenus in the ground case in Cr.No.143/2012 [in HCP.Nos.2191/2012 and 2328/2012], were dismissed on 03.09.2012 and in respect of the remaining two petitions, viz., HCP.Nos.2199/2012 and 2232/2012 , the Detaining Authority has made a specific and definite statement to the effect that the detenus have not preferred any bail applications in the ground case so far. The fact remains that, a perusal of the original documents produced before us would show that the Sponsoring Authority ought to have produced the material documents, viz., dismissal orders of the bail applications, only after its dismissal on 03.09.2012 and the Sponsoring Authority could have obtained the order copies either in the evening of 03.09.2012 or in the morning of 04.09.2012.  Such being the position, it is possible that the dismissal order of the bail applications could have been produced by the Sponsoring Authority only on 04.09.2012 morning and as such, it is to be considered whether the Detaining Authority has perused the entire voluminous material documents running to 450 pages and passed the four Detention Orders on the same day, i.e., on 04.09.2012 in HCP.Nos.2191/2012; 2199/2012 ; 2232/2012 and 2328/2012.  In our considered view, it is highly improbable for the Detaining Authority to apply its mind to the entire material documents available on record for arriving at the subjective satisfaction within a short span of time and that too, within a day.  Though the learned Public Prosecutor took enormous pain to contend that the materials have already been produced before the Detaining Authority by the Sponsoring Authority on 18.08.2012 itself, it is seen that the said contention is not substantiated by any materials available on record.  A perusal of the original documents produced before this Court reveals that the Sponsoring Authority has submitted an affidavit dated 18.08.2012 requesting the Detaining Authority to take necessary steps for passing Detention Order in respect of the detenu Laghumaiah in HCP.No.2191/2012.  In paragraph 3 of the affidavit, the Sponsoring Authority has stated about the implication of the detenu Laghumaiah in respect of the ground case in Cr.No.143/2012 and in respect of the said ground case, it is stated that necessary documents relating to the case are enclosed.  But, the said annexure or enclosure is not available or produced before this Court.  A perusal of the original documents further reveals that there is absolutely no materials to substantiate the contention of the learned Public Prosecutor that the entire materials have been placed before the Detaining Authority already on 18.08.2012 itself.  It is also pertinent to note that the Detaining Authority has arrived at the subjective satisfaction only on the basis of the dismissal of the bail application orders passed on 03.09.2012 in respect of HCP.Nos.2191/2012 and 2328/2012, stating that the detenus may file further bail applications.  It is to be stated at this stage that even for that, there is no materials available on record.  It is not stated by the Detaining Authority that neither the friends nor the relatives of the detenus are taking steps to file subsequent bail applications in the ground case.  It is also relevant to note that on the same day, i.e., on 04.09.2012, the  Detaining Authority, as already pointed out, passed two more Detention Orders in HCP.Nos.2199/2012 and 2232/2012 and such being the position, whether the Detaining Authority had enough and sufficient time to apply its mind to the entire voluminous material documents in passing the four Detention Orders in one day, is highly doubtful.
</p>
<p id="p_87">	[b]		The yet another factor to be borne in mind of this Court is that the Detaining Authority has passed 4 Detention Orders on the same day, i.e., on 04.09.2012, in respect of the detenus Laghumaiah, Varadharajan, Purushothaman and Periyasamy in HCP.Nos.2191, 2199, 2232 and 2328/2012.    As a result, in HCP.No.2191/2012, the Detaining Authority has mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the English and Tamil versions of the Grounds of Detention, the name of the detenu has been mentioned as "Varadharajan" and "Periyasamy" instead of "Laghumaiah".  It is pertinent to note that the said Varadharajan and Periyasamy are the co-detenus as they have been implicated in the same ground case and they are the detenus in HCP.Nos.2199/2012 and 2328/2012.  Learned Senior Counsel further pointed out that the statement made by the Detaining Authority in the Detention Order mentioning different names of the detenu reflects the total non-application of mind of the Detaining Authority and the same would prejudice the detenu.  However, we are of the considered view that the mentioning of the  names of the other detenus in the Detention Order of the detenu Laghumaiah dated 04.09.2012 in HCP.No.2191/2012 is only due to the confusion that had crept in the mind of the Detaining Authority and it would amount to not only a mistake, but the same reflects inadequacy of time for the Detaining Authority to apply his mind by perusing the entire voluminous material documents running to 450 pages and to arrive at the subjective satisfaction in respect of each and everyone of the detenus relating to the Detention Orders passed on the same day, i.e., on 04.09.2012.  In our considered view, the said factor also reveals, not a mere mistake or typographical error as contended by the learned Public Prosecutor, but reflects the total confusion crept in the mind of the Detaining Authority in scrutinizing the materials documents and passing the four Detention Orders at a stretch on the same day, i.e., 04.09.2012.  Though it cannot be stated that the same has resulted in any prejudice to the detenus, we cannot ignore and overlook the said factor as the same would reflect the total non-application of mind by the Detaining Authority to the entire materials available on record for arriving at the subjective satisfaction which would definitely vitiate the Detention Orders.
</p>
<p id="p_88">	[c]		Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions from the Sponsoring Authority, would submit before this Court that a bail order alone was produced with a covering letter before the Detaining Authority after the dismissal of the bail application on 03.09.2012 and the other materials were already produced before the Detaining Authority on 18.08.2012 itself and even in respect of such submission, there is no material placed before this Court.  Learned Public Prosecutor relied on paragraph 7 of the decision made in A.K.GOPALAN's case [cited supra] reported in 1966 [2] SCR 427 : AIR 1966 S 816 : 1966 Crl. LJ 602.  The principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the said decision are not applicable to the facts of the instance cases.  As far as A.K.GOPALAN's case is concerned, the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that in the said case, the documents have been produced before the Detaining Authority long back and the same were under consideration of the Government of India for quite some time and thereafter, the Detention Orders were passed after arriving at the subjective satisfaction.  In the said case, the Hon'ble Apex Court has placed reliance on the counter filed by the Government of India for arriving at the above said conclusion. But, in the instant case, it is to be stated that even in the counter filed in HCP.No.2191/2012, the Detaining Authority has not stated that the documents have been produced even in the month of August 2012, i.e., on 18.08.2012.  Learned Public Prosecutor contended that this point is raised by the detenus only for the first time before this Court and as such, in the absence of any specific plea in the affidavits of the detenus, their contentions cannot be accpeted.  We are unable to countenance such contention of the learned Public Prosecutor for the simple reason  that while dealing with the matters relating to the challenge of Detention orders in a Habeas Corpus Petition, it is well settled that it is always open to the detenus to raise any legal points even at the time of arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_89">	[d]		It is relevant to refer the decision of Apex Court reported in 1987 SCC (Crl) 674 : (1987) 4 SCC 58 (<a href="/doc/655138/" id="a_23">Mohinuddin v. District Magistrate</a>) wherein in para 4 the Apex Court held  thus,

	"4. It was an improper exercise of power on the part of the High Court in disallowing the writ petition on the ground of imperfect pleadings. Normally, writ petitions are decided on the basis of affidavits and the petitioner cannot be permitted to raise grounds not taken in the petition at the hearing. The same rule cannot be applied to a petition for grant of a writ of habeas corpus. It is enough for the detenu to say that he is under wrongful detention, and the burden lies on the detaining authority to satisfy the court that the detention is not illegal or wrongful and that the petitioner is not entitled to the relief claimed. This Court on more occasions than one has dealt with the question and it is now well settled that it is incumbent on the State to satisfy the court that the detention of the petitioner/detenu was legal and in conformity not only with the mandatory provisions of the Act but also strictly in accord with the constitutional safeguards embodied in <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_24">Article 22(5).</a>  ........"
</p><p id="p_90">					(Emphasis Supplied)
The principle laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decision cited supra would make it abundantly clear that it is always open to the detenu to raise his point even during the course of hearing.  As far as the cases on hand are concerned, it is to be pointed out that the detenus have raised a general point to the effect that there is a total non-application of mind of the Detaining Authority before arriving at the subjective satisfaction. 
</p><p id="p_91">	In view of the aforesaid reasons, we are constrained to answer the first question in favour of the detenus.
</p>
<p id="p_92">II.		WHETHER THE DETAINING AUTHORITY HAS ARRIVED AT THE SUBJECTIVE SATISFACTION IN THE ABSENCE OF COGENT MATERIALS AVAILABLE ON RECORD FOR COMING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY OR LIKELIHOOD OF THE DETENUS COMING OUT ON BAIL:
</p>			
<p id="p_93">	[a]		As far as this important question is concerned, it is pertinent to note that in respect of 17 Detention Orders, the Detaining Authority has made specific and definite statements to the effect that the detenus have not preferred any bail applications or the detenus have filed bail applications and the same were dismissed or the detenus were granted bail by this Court but they were shown formal arrest in some other case and they are in the prison as on the date of passing of the Detention orders.  But there is no statement to the effect that the detenus have preferred any subsequent bail applications or the relatives are taking steps to file bail applications in respect of the ground case etc., and in the absence of cogent materials, the Detaining Authority has arrived at the subjective satisfaction to the effect that the detenus are likely to come out on bail and on such an event, they would indulge in such further activities which would be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
</p>
<p id="p_94">	[b]		Now, let us deal with the specific statements made by the Detaining Authority in the 17 Detention Orders.  The Detaining Authority has specifically stated in paragraph 4 of the respective Grounds of Detention, viz., in HCP.Nos.2191/2012, 2276/2012, 2327/2012, 2328/2012, 2329/2012, 2429/2012 and 2490/2012  as follows:-

</p>
<p id="p_132">	[e]		A thorough reading of the above said statements made by the Detaining Authority makes it crystal clear that the Detaining Authority has passed the impugned Detention Orders by arriving at the subjective satisfaction in the following categories, viz.,


[a]	Bail applications filed in the ground case but the 	same 	were dismissed and in one case, further bail 	application filed before this Court is pending;
</p>
<p id="p_133">[b]	Bail applications not filed in the ground case so far; 	and

[c]	Bail granted to the detenus by the High Court but 	they were shown formal arrest in Cr.No.34/2012 	and their remand period was also extended.
</p>
<p id="p_134">In respect of the first category, the Detaining Authority has not stated whether the detenus have filed any subsequent bail applications pursuant to the dismissal of their bail applications in respect of the ground case.  In one of the petitions, viz., in HCP.No.2276/2012, though it is stated that though the bail application was dismissed by the Sessions Court, the detenu has filed a petition before this Court and the same is pending in Crl.OP.No.20849/2012, the Detaining Authority has not whispered a word about the filing of any bail applications by the detenu in respect of ten adverse cases, in which the detenu was arrested and remanded to judicial custody. In respect of the second category, the Detaining Authority has specifically stated that the detenus have not filed any bail petitions in the ground case as on the date of passing of the Detention Orders and in the third category, the Detaining Authority has stated in the grounds that though the detenus were granted bail by this Court, they were shown formal arrest in Cr.No.34/2012 and they are in the judicial custody as on the date of passing of the Detention Orders and he has also not stated whether the detenus  have filed any bail applications in respect of Cr.No.34/2012.  Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the Detaining Authority, in the absence of any cogent materials available on record, has arrived at the subjective satisfaction in total non-application of mind and in a most mechanical fashion to the effect that there is a likelihood of the detenus coming out on bail and on such an event, they would indulge in such further activities which are prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and as such, the impugned Detention Orders are vitiated and they are liable to be quashed.

There was no cogent material before the detaining authority on the basis of which the detaining authority could be satisfied that the detenu was likely to be released on bail.  The inference has to be drawn from the available material on record. In the absence of such material on record the mere ipse dixit of the detaining authority is not sufficient to sustain the order of detention."
</p>
<p id="p_137">	It is also relevant to refer to the latest decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in in Huidrom Konungjao Singh Vs. State of Manipur reported in (2012) 3 MLJ (Crl) 794 (SC)  wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court followed its earlier landmark decision in REKHA Vs. STATE OF TAMIL  NADU THROUGH SECRETARY TO GOVERNMENT AND ANOTHER  reported in (2011) 5 SCC 244.  Tthe Hon'ble Apex Court has held as here under:-
</p>
<p id="p_138">	........In our opinion, there is a real possibility of release of a person on bail who is already in custody provided he has moved a bail application which is pending. It follows logically that if no bail application is pending, then there is no likelihood of the person in custody being released on bail, and hence the detention order will 

be illegal. However, there can be an exception to this rule, that is, where a co-accused whose case stands on the same footing had been granted bail. In such cases, the detaining authority can reasonably conclude that there is likelihood of the detenu being released on bail even though no bail application of his is pending, since most courts normally grant bail on this ground.	
</p><p id="p_139">   14........Thus, as the detenu in the instant case has not moved the bail application and no other co- accused, if any, had been enlarged on bail, resorting to the provisions of Act was not permissible. Therefore, the impugned order of detention is based on mere ipse dixit statement in the grounds of detention and cannot be sustained in the eyes of law."		        			[emphasis supplied]

The principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decisions cited supra are also applicable to the facts of the instant cases in view of the reasons assigned earlier and as such, the Detention Orders are vitiated and accordingly, we are constrained to answer the second issue also in favour of the detenus. 
</p><p id="p_140">III.		WHETHER THE IMPUGNED DETENTION ORDERS PASSED BY THE DETAINING AUTHORITY IS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE RIGHTS GUARANTEED UNDER <a href="/doc/581566/" id="a_72">ARTICLE 22</a> OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA:-		
</p>	
<p id="p_141">	[a]		This Court is also constrained to point out that in all these matters, the Detaining Authority has passed 17 Detention Orders in total non-application of mind and in a most mechanical fashion and in a most hurried manner without looking into the entire materials available on record and in the absence of cogent materials available on record.  We have also pointed out that on 04.09.2013, i.e., on a single day, the Detaining Authority has passed four Detention Orders, out of which, in respect of two Detention orders, no bail applications have been filed by the detenus and in respect of the other two Detention Orders, bail applications were dismissed on 03.09.2012.   At the risk of repetition, it is to be stated that in respect of HCP.No.2191/2012, in stead of mentioning the name of the detenu as Laghumaiah, it has been mentioned as "Varadharajan" and "Periyasamy" in three places in the English and Tamil versions of the Grounds of Detention.  The said factor reflects the confused mind of the Detaining Authority and the same also demonstrates that the Detaining Authority could not have perused the entire materials in respect of each and every detenus carefully by applying its mind to each and every material factor.   It is to be stated that it is a clear case where the rights of the detenus guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_73">Article 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_74">22[5]</a> of the Constitution of India have been infringed.  It is pertinent to note that the Hon'ble Apex Court has held in a catena of decisions that the extraordinary power of passing the Detention Orders should be resorted to exceptional cases and power vested on the authorities to pass Detention Orders should be justifiable and the same shall not infringe the life and personal liberty of a person guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_75">Article 21</a> and <a href="/doc/1709581/" id="a_76">22[5]</a> of the Constitution of India.  
</p>
<p id="p_142">	[b]		It is relevant to refer the landmark decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/488212/" id="a_77">Binod Singh v. District Magistrate</a> ((1986) 4 SCC 416)  wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_143">	7. It is well settled in our constitutional framework that the power of directing preventive detention given to the appropriate authorities must be exercised in exceptional cases as contemplated by the various provisions of the different statutes dealing with preventive detention and should be used with great deal of circumspection. There must be awareness of the facts necessitating preventive custody of a person for social defence."
</p><p id="p_144">[emphasis supplied]

	[c]		It is also relevant to refer the following decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court:
</p>
<p id="p_145">	[i]		In the Constitution Bench decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/102852/" id="a_78">M. Nagaraj v. Union of India</a> ((2006) 8 SCC 212) this Court observed: (SCC p. 241, para 20)

	20.  It is a fallacy to regard fundamental rights as a gift from the State to its citizens. Individuals possess basic human rights independently of any Constitution by reason of the basic fact that they are members of the human race.
In the nine-Judge Constitution Bench decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_79">I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N</a>.((2007)2 SCC 1), this Court observed: (SCC pp. 101 &amp; 80, paras 109 &amp; 49)
	109.  It is necessary to always bear in mind that fundamental rights have been considered to be [the] heart and soul of the Constitution.

	49.  Fundamental rights occupy a unique place in the lives of civilised societies and have been described in judgments as transcendental, inalienable and primordial.

</p><p id="p_146">	21. It is all very well to say that preventive detention is preventive not punitive. The truth of the matter, though, is that in substance a detention order of one year (or any other period) is a punishment of one year's imprisonment. What difference is it to the detenu whether his imprisonment is called preventive or punitive?
</p>
<p id="p_147">	36. It has been held that the history of liberty is the history of procedural safeguards. (<a href="/doc/564452/" id="a_80">See Kamleshkumar Ishwardas Patel v. Union of India</a> ((1995) 4 SCC 51) vide para 49.) These procedural safeguards are required to be zealously watched and enforced by the court and their rigour cannot be allowed to be diluted on the basis of the nature of the alleged activities of the detenu. As observed in <a href="/doc/153998550/" id="a_81">Rattan Singh v. State of Punjab</a> ((1981)4 SCC 481): (SCC p. 483, para 4)

	4.  May be that the detenu is a smuggler whose tribe (and how their numbers increase!) deserves no sympathy since its activities have paralysed the Indian economy. But the laws of preventive detention afford only a modicum of safeguards to persons detained under them, and if freedom and liberty are to have any meaning in our democratic set up, it is essential that at least those safeguards are not denied to the detenus.
</p><p id="p_148">	39. Personal liberty protected under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_82">Article 21</a> is so sacrosanct and so high in the scale of constitutional values that it is the obligation of the detaining authority to show that the impugned detention meticulously accords with the procedure established by law. The stringency and concern of judicial vigilance that is needed was aptly described in the following words in Thomas Pelham Dale case ((1881) 6 QBD 376 (CA): (QBD p. 461)

Then comes the question upon the habeas corpus. It is a general rule, which has always been acted upon by the courts of England, that if any person procures the imprisonment of another he must take care to do so by steps, all of which are entirely regular, and that if he fails to follow every step in the process with extreme regularity the court will not allow the imprisonment to continue.

	[ii]	<a href="/doc/679149/" id="a_83">In Khudiram Das  V. State of W.B</a>. reported in (1975) 2 SCC 81, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows :
</p><p id="p_149">	"13. .... It is, therefore, not only the right of the Court, but also its duty as well, to examine what are the basic facts and materials which actually and in fact weighed with the detaining authority in reaching the requisite satisfaction. The judicial scrutiny cannot be foreclosed by a mere statement of the detaining authority that it has taken into account only certain basic facts and materials and though other basic facts and materials were before it, it has not allowed them to influence its satisfaction. The Court is entitled to examine the correctness of this statement and determine for itself whether there were any other basic facts or materials, apart from those admitted by it, which could have reasonably influenced the decision of the detaining authority and for that purpose, the Court can certainly require the detaining authority to produce and make available to the Court the entire record of the case which was before it.  That is the least the Court can do to ensure observance of the requirements of law by the detaining authority."
</p><p id="p_150">(emphasis supplied)

	[iii]	The Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1484079/" id="a_84">Ashadevi V. K.Shivraj</a>, reported in 1979 (1) SCC 222 has held thus,
	"6. It is well-settled that the subjective satisfaction requisite on the part of the detaining authority, the formation of which is a condition precedent to the passing of the detention order will get vitiated if material or vital facts which would have a bearing on the issue and would influence the mind of the detaining authority one way or the other are ignored or not considered by the detaining authority before issuing the detention order.
</p>
<p id="p_151">[emphasis supplied by us]
The principles laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decisions cited supra are also applicable to the facts of the instant cases also in view of the reasons assigned earlier.   Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that even the 3rd issue is also answered in favour of the detenus.
</p>
<p id="p_152">	13.		In view of the aforesaid reasons, we have come to the irresistible conclusion to the effect that the impugned Detention Orders are vitiated and the same are liable to be quashed.
