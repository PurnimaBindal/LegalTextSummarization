        Bazar P.S divulging the fact that his daughter Shobha Devi was

        married with Yogendra Yadav, son of Ram Chandra Yadav of village

        Dharampur Kharwa P.S- Dulhinbazar in the month of May, 2003 and,

        had gone to her sasural where she was staying. She visited his place

        occasionally. Whenever she came to his place, she disclosed that her

        Bhaisur Hazari Yadav, hushand Yogendra Yadav and wife of Hazari

        Yadav were torturing her for procurement of a Television. For the last

        10 months, she was staying at his place in the aforesaid background.

        About five days prior to Holi, Hazari Yadav came and took Rukhsati

        of his daughter. At that very time also, he had insisted upon T.V,

        whereupon he disclosed that on account of financial constraint he is

        not able to give the same at the present moment. As soon as he is out

        of, will provide the same. Today, i.e. on 06.04.2005 at about 2 P.M

        he received an information with regard to commission of murder of

        his daughter as well as concealment of her dead body whereupon, he

        along with others rushed to the sasural of his daughter where none

        was present. His daughter was also not present. On query, he came to

        know that after causing her death, her sasuralwala concealed her dead

        body in order to screen themselves.

        examination of the witnesses finding the case true, both the appellants

        were charge-sheeted keeping investigation against the husband

        meeting with the ultimate result, subject matter of instant appeal.

        examination as well as statement recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_3">Section 313</a> of the

        Cr.P.C is that of complete denial. It has also been pleaded that

        appellants happen to be separate in mess and business from the family

        of the deceased and her husband, Yogendra Yadav and that being so,

        they could not be arrayed nor could be identified to be responsible for

        causing dowry death of the deceased. However, neither oral nor

        documentary evidence has been adduced in defence.

</p><p id="p_9">                            5. In order to substantiate its case, prosecution had

        examined altogether 9 PWs, who are PW-1, Bhagnarayan Yadav,

        PW-2, Indar Yadav, PW-3, Satyendra Kumar, PW-4, Raj Nath Prasad,

        PW-5, Kumar Jeet Kumar, PW-6, Amarjeet Kumar, PW-7, Lal

<p id="p_10">                        6.     While assailing the judgment of conviction and

        sentence, the learned senior counsel for the appellant had bifurcated

        the case of the appellants in two parts. With regard to appellant,

        Hazari Yadav, it has been submitted that he virtually saturated the

        period of sentence on account of being under custody from 01.2.2006

        to 07.7.2015. He had been sentenced under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_4">section 304B</a> of the I.P.C

        for 10 years while under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_5">Section 498A</a> of the I.P.C for three years,

        with a further direction to run the both the sentences concurrently

        therefore, the result of appeal is not going to give any kind of impact

        against him, so he is not emphatically pressing his plea relating to

        him.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                             7. While arguing the case on behalf of appellant no.1,

        Phul Kumari Devi, who happens to be the wife of appellant Hazari

        Yadav, the learned counsel for the appellant strenuously argued on

        each and every aspect coupled with over emotional plank. The first

        and foremost argument happens to be that she happens to be mother

        of six children and during course of trial, remained under custody, and

        so, there should be sympathetic approach in the background of the
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.358 of 2015 dt.10-05-2018                              5




        fact that (a) she happens to be Gotni of the deceased (b) There

        happens to be absence of specific positive evidence against her over

        demand as well as torture having been inflicted at her end. So, even if

        case is found duly substantiated then maintaining the conviction,

        sentence be modified as period already undergone.

</p><p id="p_12">                              8. Then coming over merit of the case, it has been

        submitted that from bare perusal of the L.C record, it is apparent that

        prosecution has miserably failed to substantiate its case in the

        background of the fact:

<pre id="pre_2">                            (1)                 There happens to be no conclusive

                          (2)                     There happens to be no detail with

                                                  regard to activity having at the end of

        on account of financial crunch which they are facing and in spite of

        ample material to discredit the version of the prosecution, their

        poverty restrained them to contest the case and further out of

        ignorance they could not get learned counsel at the end of the state

        and in likewise manner, the court was also not so sensitized on that

        very score, therefore prosecution became illegal, trial vitiated, hence

        she be acquitted.

        appellants has submitted that material witnesses were not at all cross-

        examined at the end of the appellants whereupon, they were

        discharged. So, their testimony remained intact. That means to say,

        nothing adverse has been found over reliability of their evidences,

        sasural of Shobha Devi where she was not present. Police came

        deposed that deceased Shobha Devi was his sister who was married

        with Yogendra Yadav about five years ago. After marriage his sister

        used to remain at her sasural where dowry in lieu of T.V was

        advanced and for that she was being tortured. As TV was not

        provided, his sister was ever been physically assaulted. Then had

        stated that he had gone to sasural of his sister where he found Hazari

        Yadav and Fhul Kumari. She asked from him whether, he has brought

        T.V. He stated that he wants to meet with his sister whereupon, she

        disclosed that she had gone to Paliganj along with her husband for

        treatment. Then thereafter, he returned back. Later on they came to

        know that his sister has been murdered. His father was informed

        whereupon his father along with villagers has gone to the sasural of

        his sister but, failed to trace her out. Then thereafter, P.S was

        her Sasuralwala is demanding T.V and for that, she was being

        physically assaulted. He had informed that for the present he is unable

        to provide the same but, as soon as money comes to his hand, he will

        provide the same. TV was being demanded by Hazari Yadav, Phul

        Kumari and her husband. Then had stated that even after Gauna when

        his daughter returned back, narrated the same. Due to poverty, he

        failed to fulfill their demand. For the last one year, his daughter was

        staying at his place. Hazari Yadav came to effect bidai which was

        fixed and then thereafter, he took away deceased Sobha to her sasural.

        Even at that very moment, Hazari Yadav had demanded T.V. Then

        had stated that about 10-15 days thereafter his son Kumar Jeet Kumar

        (PW 5) had gone to the place of his daughter. After returning from

        there, he disclosed that his daughter was not there. Then got

        information regarding death of his daughter whereupon he along with

        others rushed to her place where none was present. He had gone

        Sasural of Sobha Devi and found all the members absconding.

        Shobha Devi was also not present inside the house. Police was

        before the date of her death. Then had stated that Hazari Yadav had

        instructed him to arrange for T.V., whereupon he declined. He had

        further stated that he had gone to the sasural of the deceased. After

        death, he had gone there, and then he was cross-examined over the

        recovery of the dead body. He had also stated that he had seen black

        He also denied that she was mad. Then had denied that no such kind

        Amarjeet Kumar. He had deposed to the effect that Shobha Devi, his

        sister was married with Yogendra Yadav in the year 2003. After

        marriage, his sister had gone to her sasural. Whenever she came, she

        used to complain that her Sasuralwala was adamant over TV and for

        that, she was being physically tortured. They were demanding TV in

        lieu of dowry. Yogendra, Hazari and Phul Kumari were demanding

        and further were torturing for the same. In the aforesaid background,

        his sister was brought up to his place. Hazari Yadav took her away on

        Bidai five days prior to Holi in the year 2005. Then thereafter his

        younger brother had gone to her sasural where they have disclosed

        that your sister is not present. Then thereafter, he came to know that

        his sister has been murdered. His brother immediately returned back

        and disclosed the same whereupon he along with his father and others

        have gone to sasural of his sister where none was present. On query,

        the neighbours had disclosed that after murdering her, her dead body

        had already been disposed of. They, on their own, searched the dead

        body but could not succeed. Thereafter, his father had instituted the

        aforesaid ingredients, then in that circumstance, the onus shifts upon

        the accused to explain the same. At the present moment, the

        controversial aspect happens to be with regard to the interpretation of

        „soon before‟ and on that very score, leaned senior counsel for the

        appellant has relied upon the case of '<a href="/doc/66533225/" id="a_19">State of Karnataka v.Dattaraj

        has been taken up under the following paragrphs:- 15, 16.

</p><p id="p_32">                             15. During the course of hearing, learned counsel
                     representing the State of Karnataka vehemently contended,
                     that the acquittal of the accused by the High Court, was in
                     clear violation of the declaration of law, with reference to
                     the provisions under which the accused were charged.
                     Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned,
                     reliance in the first instance was placed on the decision
                     rendered by this Court in <a href="/doc/1263837/" id="a_20">Kans Raj v. State of Punjab &amp;
                     Ors</a>., (2000) 5 SCC 207. Learned counsel invited our
                     pointed attention to the following observations recorded
                     therein:- "15. It is further contended on behalf of the
                     respondents that the statements of the deceased referred to
                     the instances could not be termed to be cruelty or
                     harassment by the husband soon before her death. "Soon
                     before" is a relative term which is required to be considered
                     under specific circumstances of each case and no
                     straitjacket formula can be laid down by fixing any time-
                     limit. This expression is pregnant with the idea of proximity
                     test. The term "soon before" is not synonymous with the
                     term "immediately before" and is opposite of the expression
                     "soon after" as used and understood in <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_21">Section 114</a>,
                     Illustration (a) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_22">Evidence Act</a>. These words would
                     imply that the interval should not be too long between the
                     time of making the statement and the death. It contemplates
                     the reasonable time which, as earlier noticed, has to be
                     understood and determined under the peculiar
                     circumstances of each case. In relation to dowry deaths, the
                     circumstances showing the existence of cruelty or
                     harassment to the deceased are not restricted to a particular
                     instance but normally refer to a course of conduct. Such
                     conduct may be spread over a period of time. If the cruelty
                     or harassment or demand for dowry is shown to have
                     persisted, it shall be deemed to be "soon before death" if
                     any other intervening circumstance showing the non-
                     existence of such treatment is not brought on record, before
                     such alleged treatment and the date of death. It does not,
                     however, mean that such time can be stretched to any
                     period. Proximate and live link between the effect of cruelty
                     based on dowry demand and the consequential death is
                     required to be proved by the prosecution. The demand of
                     dowry, cruelty or harassment based upon such demand and
                     the date of death should not be too remote in time which,

                     under the circumstances, be treated as having become stale
                     enough." (emphasis supplied) Learned counsel submitted,
                     that the view expressed in the Kans Raj case (supra) had
                     been reiterated in another decision rendered by this Court in

</p><p id="p_33">                            16. Reliance was also placed by the learned counsel
                     for the appellant, on a recent judgment rendered by a three-
                     judge Bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/141748525/" id="a_24">Rajinder Singh v. State of
                     Punjab</a>, (2015) 6 SCC 477, wherein <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_25">Section 304B</a> has been
                     explained to the effect, that the term "dowry" expressed
                     therein, would not be limited to the traditional meaning
                     attached to the aforesaid expression, but would include a
                     demand for money for other purposes as well. In this behalf
                     it would be relevant to mention, that the three-judge Bench
                     did not accept the position expressed in <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_26">Appasaheb v. State
                     of Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9 SCC 721, in connection whereof,
                     this Court had first explained the position in the Appasaheb
                     case (supra), as under:-
</p><p id="p_34">                             "11. This Court has spoken sometimes with divergent
                     voices both on what would fall within "dowry" as defined
                     and what is meant by the expression "soon before her
                     death". <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_27">In Appasaheb v. State of Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9
                     SCC 721, this Court construed the definition of dowry
                     strictly, as it forms part of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_28">Section 304-B</a> which is part of a
                     penal statute. The Court held that a demand for money for
                     defraying the expenses of manure made to a young wife
                     who in turn made the same demand to her father would be
                     outside the definition of dowry. This Court said: (SCC p.
                     727, para 11) "11. ...A demand for money on account of
                     some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent
                     domestic expenses or for purchasing manure cannot be
                     termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally
                     understood. The evidence adduced by the prosecution does
                     not, therefore, show that any demand for „dowry‟ as defined
                     in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_29">Section 2</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the
                     Appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some
                     money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing
                     manure." And thereupon, having examined the object and
                     intent of the legislation, this Court held in the Rajinder
                     Singh case (supra), as under:- "26. The facts of this appeal
                     are glaring. Demands for money were made shortly after
                     one year of the marriage. A she-buffalo was given by the
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.358 of 2015 dt.10-05-2018                       18




                     father to the daughter as a peace offering. The peace
                     offering had no effect. The daughter was ill-treated. She
                     went back to her father and demanded money again. The
                     father, then, went along with his brother and the Sarpanch
                     of the village to the matrimonial home with a request that
                     the daughter be not ill-treated on account of the demand for
                     money. The father also assured the said persons that their
                     money demand would be fulfilled and that they would have
                     to wait till the crops of his field are harvested. Fifteen days
                     before her death, Salwinder Kaur again visited her parents'
                     house on being maltreated by her new family. Then came
                     death by poisoning. The cross-examination of the father of
                     Salwinder Kaur has, in no manner, shaken his evidence. On
                     the facts, therefore, the concurrent findings recorded by
                     both the courts below are upheld. The appeal is dismissed."
                     Based on the above decision it was the vehement contention
                     of the learned counsel for the appellant, that the demands
                     made by the accused for purchase of agricultural land, as
                     also, with reference to a sewing machine, were liable to be
                     treated as demands constituting "dowry".

<p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">                            27. That means to say, „soon before‟ her death is a

        flexible term could not be accepted in its rigidity, however, should be

        identified with proximity but, varies on fact of case to case. So far

        present case is concerned, there happens to be no challenge at the end

        of the appellants that there was Bidai of deceased 5 days prior to Holi

        in the year 2005. So, Holi happens to be in the last day of Falgun

        identifying invariably in the English Calender as month of March and

        the death had occurred in the first week of April. In likewise manner,

        as the contention of the prosecution witness, more particularly, the

        informant PW-7, has not been challenged as the defence could not be

        able to cross-examine him so, demand by Hazari Yadav on the date of
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.358 of 2015 dt.10-05-2018                    19




        Bidai itself is found uncontroverted and in likewise manner, the

        demands having previously made and having substantiated at the end

        of both the sons of the informant i.e., PW-5, PW-6. Surprisingly,

        while cross-examining, PW-6, he had not been tested in a manner as

        was expected at the end of appellant although he had spoken demand

        of dowry as well as torture on that very pretext. Furthermore, from the

        statement of accused recorded under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_30">Section 313</a> CrPC, it is evident

        that the gist of allegation has been put to them, moreover, they faced

        trial and were duly acknowledged with the incriminating material

        having been produced against them. Apart from this, during course of

        arguments, the appellants failed to show how they have been

        prejudiced.

        happens to be mother of six children inconsonance with her status,

        being illiterate, coming from lower strata of the society, patriarchal

        approach deprived her to defend herself in proper way, needs some
