     The O.A having been heard on 17th June, 2022, this Tribunal
delivered the following order on the same day:


                               O R D E R (ORAL)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Per : Mr.K.V. Eapen, Administrative Member

     The applicant in the O.A is an officer of the State Police Service (SPS) who

submits that he was in zone of consideration for appointment by promotion to the

Indian Police Service (IPS) Kerala Cadre for the year 2018. The Selection

Committee of the Union Public Service Commission however graded him as

&quot;unfit&quot; considering that the grading in his Annual Confidential Reports (ACR) for

the period 10.06.2015 to 31.12.2015 was only &quot;satisfactory&quot; and for the period

01.07.2016 to 08.08.2016 was only &quot;good&quot;. Thus the Committee arrived at an

overall assessment that the applicant was &quot;unfit&quot;. He submits, however, that the

reason for declaring him unfit to the Indian Police Service for the year 2018 is due

to a misreading of the confidential report of the applicant for the period 10.06.2015

to 31.12.2015 and 01.07.2016 to 08.08.2016, which is being upgraded. He also

submits that the steps are underway for convening the Selection Committee

meeting for the year 2019 and 2020 for promotion to the IPS Kerala Cadre. It is

submitted that it is likely that a meeting of the Committee would be held at a very

short notice.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           3</span><p id="p_2">

</p><p id="p_3">2.   It is submitted that the assessment of the applicant was given as &#x27;good&#x27; for the

period from 10.06.2015 to 31.12.2015 and also as &#x27;good&#x27; from 01.01.2016 to

08.08.2016 and &#x27;outstanding&#x27; from 08.08.2016 to 31.12.2016 and thus he has to be

reckoned as &#x27;outstanding&#x27; from 01.01.2016 to 31.12.2016, which makes him within

the eligibility criteria of the Selection Committee for considering an officer for

selection and appointment to the Indian Police Service. He submits that he is fully

eligible for such consideration. It is submitted that there has been a re-assessment

of the confidential reports of the applicant by the Reporting Authority, Reviewing

Authority and Accepting Authority, vide Annexure A4 to A8 as &quot;outstanding&quot; and

thus the overall assessment of the applicant has to be considered as &quot;very good&quot; by

the second and third respondents (Selection Committee/UPSC) for selection and

appointment to the Indian Police Service for the year 2019 and 2020. Hence, he has

prayed for relief to consider him for selection and appointment to Indian Police

Service for the years 2019 and 2020, notwithstanding the earlier assessments of the

applicant as &quot;unfit&quot; for the year 2018. The Reliefs sought are as follows :-


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">        &quot; (i) Declare that the assessment of the 3rd respondent
        Committee assessing the applicant as unfit for selection to
        Indian Police Service in the year 2018 as per Annexure A2 is
        vitiated by mistake of fact and law;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">        (ii) Direct the respondents 2 and 3 to consider the applicant
        for selection and appointment to Indian Police Service for the
        years 2019 and 2020 not withstanding Annexure A2 assessment
        of the applicant as unfit for the year 2018;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        (iii) Direct the respondents 2 and 3 to consider the
        reassessment of the annual confidential reports of the applicant
        as per Annexure A4 to A8 for the selection year 2019 and 2020;
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (iv) Issue such other appropriate direction or order this
        Tribunal may deem fit and order in the interest of justice.&quot;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                          4</span>

<p id="p_4">3.   When the matter came up before the Tribunal on 06.04.2022, the counsel for

the State Government submitted that an Original Application relating to a proper

grading for the relevant years of the Confidential Report of the applicant is pending

before Kerala Administrative Tribunal. Meanwhile, the applicant also filed an M.A

180/226/2022 to accept documents relating to his application for review of his

Annual Confidential Reports from 10.06.2015 to 08.08.2016. The said M.A was

allowed. The Respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 (UPSC/Selection Committee) also filed a

reply statement in the matter. It is their contention that the Selection Committee

which met on 24.06.2021 to prepare the Select List of 2018 for promotion to IPS of

Kerala Cadre, had considered the name of the applicant at Sl.No.27 in the

Eligibility List for the 11 vacancies. It is their contention that the Committee had

gone through all the parameters of the ACRs of 2015 and 2016 and, thereafter,

made its assessment. Though his name was considered by the Selection Committee

for the preparation of Select List 2018, the assessment of the Committee was that

the applicant was found as &quot;unfit&quot; due to the low gradings in the ACR. It is

submitted by respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 that though the applicant has himself stated

that the ACRs for the year 2015 and 2016 have since been upgraded after the

Selection Committee meeting held on 24.06.2021, it appears that these upgraded

ACRs have not been accepted by the concerned authority and sent to the UPSC. It

is also submitted that the categorization of officers in the light of the relevant

records and the norms utilised in making assessment of officers are exclusive

functions of the Selection Committee, as has been held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme

Court in the case of UPSC v H.L Dev &amp; Others [AIR 1988 SC 1069]. The Hon&#x27;ble

Apex Court has reiterated in several judgments that the Selection Committtee is

empowered to make its own assessment and that this function solely belongs to the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                          5</span>

Selection Committee and cannot be reviewed in Courts, unless there is a case of

malafide or arbitrariness involved. The respondent nos. 2 &amp; 3 have cited a series of

decisions to prove that the Selection Committee has full independence in the matter

of assessment. However, it has also been stated in the reply statement of respondent

nos. 2 &amp; 3, that the Government of Kerala has, vide its letter dated 21.05.2022 and

24.05.2022, submitted the revised eligibility lists of the years 2019 and 2020 and

that the name of the applicant figures at SI. No. 14 and SI.No. 13 in the revised

eligibility lists for preparation of the Select Lists of 2019 and 2020 respectively.

The ACRs of the applicant, including the upgraded ACRs, if any received, will be

placed before the Selection Committee Meeting scheduled to be held on

27.06.2022 for preparation of year-wise Select List of 2019 and 2020 for promotion

to IPS of Kerala Cadre.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">4.   Meanwhile, the applicant filed another M.A 180/458/2022 to receive further

documents, wherein, he has submitted that his representation for review of annual

ACRs from 10.06.2015 to 08.08.2016 had been considered by the State

Government. The reporting authority and all other officials had recommended to

upgrade his confidential report as &#x27;outstanding&#x27; but the same has been rejected by

the concerned authority vide Annexure A13 order dated 15.10.2021. It is submitted

in the M.A that he had filed O.A 144 of 2022 before the Kerala Administrative

Tribunal challenging the Annexure A13 order, as well as Annexure A14, which is

the rejection letter issued by the Home Department to him dated 17.01.2022

informing him that his request for upgrading the ACR was rejected. It is also

submitted that Kerala Administrative Tribunal by its order dated 13.06.2022, has

allowed the O.A setting aside Annexure A13 and A14 and directing the 4 th
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                           6</span>

respondent (State of Kerala represented by Chief Secretary) to reconsider the

matter. A copy of the order has been produced at Annexure A15 in the M.A

180/458/2022.
</p>
<p id="p_7">

</p><p id="p_8">5.   We have considered the above contentions. It is seen that the operative

portion of the order passed by the Kerala Administrative Tribunal at Annexure A15

is as follows: &quot;.......Accordingly this Tribunal is inclined to interfere in the matter

in order to set aside the impugned decisions, and to direct the Government to take

a fresh decision, with specific emphasis to the findings mentioned above.

Resultantly, the above Original Applicant need to succeed.

</p><p id="p_9">     Hence, the above Original Application is hereby allowed to the extent of

setting aside Annexures A15 and A19 orders of the Government. The 1 st respondent

is directed to reconsider the matter based on the request made by the applicant for

up-gradation of his ACRs with respect to the periods from 10.06.2015 to

31.12.2015 and from 01.01.2016 to 08.08.2016 from &#x27;good&#x27; to &#x27;outstanding&#x27;. An

appropriate decision shall be taken in the light of the entire facts and

circumstances of the case and on the basis of the observations contained in this

order, looking into the legal position remaining settled. Considering urgency of the

matter in view of the fact that the Committee constituted by the UPSC will be

considering the issue within a short period, a decision in this regard as directed

above shall be taken by the Governnment at the earliest possible, after affording an

opportunity of personal hearing to the applicant, at any rate, within a period of

three weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.&quot;
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                            7</span>

</p><p id="p_10">6.     The developments as outlined above have a substantial impact on the reliefs

that has been prayed for in this O.A as it is now for the State Government to act

upon the orders of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal dated 13.06.2022 in their

O.A. 144/2022. This is because the relief sought relates to the assessment by the

respondent nos.2 &amp; 3 (Selection Committee/UPSC), which is substantially based

on the gradings and other entries in the ACRs of the applicant. Thus, it is not

correct for this Tribunal to grant any relief sought for by the applicant without the

necessary steps being taken by the respondent nos.4 &amp; 5 (State Government/SPC)

in relation to the orders passed by the Kerala Administrative Tribunal. Further, as

has been seen, not only in this matter but in earlier cases including <a href="/doc/1680750/" id="a_1">C.F.Robert vs.

State of Kerala</a> represented by the Chief Secretary to the Government of Kerala &amp;

Ors. in O.A 180/444/2021 in order dated 25.11.2021, where we have decided that

the process of assessment by the UPSC on the basis of ACR received by them

about the officers is something that the Tribunals will not normally interfere with.

We thus limit our order in this matter to the expectation that the State Government

will take a decision in relation to the plea of upgradation of ACR very soon as next

meeting of the Selection Committee for selection of officials from the State Police

Service to the Indian Police Service of the Kerala Cadre is slated to be held on

27.06.2022.
