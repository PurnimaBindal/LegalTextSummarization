<p id="p_1">ORDER
 

K.S. Venkataramani, Member (T)
 

</p><p id="p_2">1. When the stay applications were called, the question arose as to whether in these cases the Tribunal will have jurisdiction to hear the appeals against Additional Collector's order because by Notification 11/92-C.E., dated 14-5-1992, definition of Collector as contained in Rule 2(ii) has been amended in the Central Excise Rules. Accordingly, the Additional Collector of Central Excise, is not Collector for the purpose of appeal. Therefore, appeal against the order-in-original, passed by the Additional Collector of Central Excise after the date will lie to the Collector (Appeals) and not to the Tribunal as at present.
</p> 

<p id="p_3">In the case of applicants, M/s. Pidilite Industry, the order is passed by the Additional Collector and in the order there are two dates. The date of the order is indicated as 8-5-1992 and the date of issue is indicated as 6-7-1992. Therefore, in this case, on the date of issue, the notification dated 14-5-1992, prescribing appeals from such orders to Collector (Appeals), had come into force. In the case of applicants, M/s. J.K. Synthetics, the Additional Collector's order again has two dates, wherein the date of the order is 18-2-1992 and the date of issue is 25-5-1992. Here again the date of issue is subsequent to the Notification 11/92 dated 14-5-1992. In this background, arguments were addressed by the Ld. Sr. Counsel, Sh. A.N. Haksar alongwith Ld. Counsel, Sh. Sanjay Grover appearing for M/s. J.K. Synthetics and by Sh. Jayant Bhushan, Ld. Advocate appearing for M/s. Pidilite Industry Ltd. and by Sh. M.K. Jain, Ld. S.D.R. and by Sh. L.N. Murthy, Ld. JDR for the department. Sh. Haksar, Ld. Sr. Counsel has pointed out that the date of despatch of the adjudication order or the date of receipt thereof by the assessee is not the right criterion. It is the date of passing of the order by the Additional Collector after hearing the party and considering their submissions, which will be the correct criterion. There will also be another reason in this view. This flows from the provisions under <a href="/doc/62932885/" id="a_1">Section 35A(3)</a> of the Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_2">Salt Act</a>, 1944 which gives Collector (Appeals) powers to enhance personal penalty which power is not vested in the Tribunal according to the Sr. Counsel. Therefore, where adjudication order has been passed by the Additional Collector before the date of the notification i.e. 14-5-1992, as adjudicating authority, if the appeal were to lie before the Collector (Appeals) because the order was issued subsequent to the date of the notification, then it will expose the appellants certain consequences such as enhancement of penalty not envisaged in the statute at the time when the adjudicating authority passed the order. The Ld. Sr. Counsel urged that what is to be looked into is the essence of the order and to find out whether on the date when the Additional Collector passed the order, he was of the rank of the Collector or not. He relied upon the Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href="/doc/494781/" id="a_3">Bharat Barrel &amp; Drum Mfg. Co. (Pvt.) Ltd. and Anr. v. Employees State Insurance Corporation</a> - AIR 1972 SC 1935 to say that right of appeal depends on the date of passing of the order by the competent authority. The Ld. Sr. Counsel referred to the view of the Central Board of Excise &amp; Customs as in its Circular No. 3/92 CX 6 dated 14-5-1992, reproduced in 1992 (60) E.L.T. (T3) wherein it has been clarified that appeals in respect of order passed before 14-5-1992, would continue to lie to the Tribunal. The Ld. Sr. Counsel, therefore, urged that the what is material in this context of the jurisdiction is the date on which the additional Collector passed the order and not the date of its communication to the person affected as, according to the Sr. Ld. Counsel, the act of communication is only the Ministerial Act.
</p> 

<p id="p_4">2.   Shri Jayant Bhushan, Ld. Counsel, referred to the provision of <a href="/doc/152525782/" id="a_4">Section 35B</a> of the Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_5">Salt Act</a>, 1944 which refers to the orders of the Collector as adjudicating authority and the question will be to determine whether the officer was of the rank of Collector when he passed the order. According to the Ld. Counsel, the order should be held as passed when the adjudicating authority signs it. He also urged if the order is signed on a date prior to the amendment and no change therein is made till its despatch that could also be a ground for holding that the date of signing of the order is the date of passing that order. The Ld. Counsel relied upon the Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1316292/" id="a_6">Collector of Central Excise v. MM. Rubber Co. -1991</a> (55) E.L.T. 289 (SC) and urged that the Supreme Court had held that date of communication of the order to the party is the criterion where the parties rights are affected, whereas this criterion is not relevant for the purpose of determining whether the power has been exercised within the prescribed time. The Ld. Counsel also referred to the Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href="/doc/98066/" id="a_7">Bachhittar Singh v. State of Punjab and Anr</a>. - AIR 1963 SC 395 and submitted that the facts of the case were distinguishable from the present issue before us and the ratio of that case cannot be taken as laying down that the date of the order is the date of its communication. The Ld. Counsel, further, argued that a change in the status of the officer between the date of signing of an order and the date of communication thereof, would not mean that the order communicated is one passed in his changed status. The order, according to the Ld. Counsel, becomes effective from the date of signing thereof. It was urged that since the Additional Collector had issued show cause notice, considered the reply thereto and decided the matter in his capacity as Collector and passed an order, it will be anomalous to say that the appeal therefrom should lie before the Collector (Appeals) based on the date of communication.
</p> 

<p id="p_5">3.   Sh. M.K. Jain, Ld. S.D.R., submitted that since the orders had been despatched subsequent to 14-5-1992 when the jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Additional Collector's order had been changed, such appeal should, thereafter, lie before the Collector (Appeals) going by the date of issue of the order. It was the Ld. S.D.R.'s submission that since the Additional Collector, as an adjudicating authority was aware of the proposed amendment ever since the introduction of the Finance Bill, 1992 in March, the Additional Collector had ample time to recall the cases in which he had passed orders after the amendment before their despatch and seek further instructions from the Collector. He relied upon the Tribunal's decision in the case of <a href="/doc/1730575/" id="a_8">Wood Paper Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise</a> - 1991 (56) E.L.T. 71 (Trib.) wherein the show cause notice under <a href="/doc/85233116/" id="a_9">Section 11A</a> of Central Excises &amp; <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_10">Salt Act</a>, 1944 was signed by the Superintendent before the amendment, but despatched thereafter and received by the assessee subsequently. The Tribunal held that show cause notice is a nullity since it would attain completion only when it reaches the hands of the assessee and the Tribunal held that the proceedings arising therefrom is void ab initio.
</p> 

<p id="p_6">4.   Shri L.N. Murthy, Ld. D.R., urged that the date of issue of the order is not the criterion but the date of signing thereof and in these cases the Additional Collector was competent to sign such order as Collector on the date of signing of these orders which were prior to the Notification dated 14-5-1992 amending appellate jurisdiction. He relied upon the Tribunal's decision in the case of Collector of Central Excise v. P.N. Monga Bottlers Pvt. Ltd. -1989 (43) E.L.T. 447 (Tribunal). The Tribunal in that case has considered the Supreme Court decision in the case of <a href="/doc/98066/" id="a_11">Bachhittar Singh v. State, of Punjab</a> (supra) and has distinguished it and the Tribunal's decision was that if an order has been validly passed and duly signed after hearing the party in pursuance of show cause notice, then it cannot be said that order would have no force of law and would not come into effect as long as the same is not communicated to the party concerned. The Tribunal, in coming to this conclusion, had followed the Bombay High Court decision in the case of <a href="/doc/766776/" id="a_12">Cosmic Radio v. Union of India and Anr</a>. - 1983 (12) E.L.T. 84 (Bom.). Therefore, Shri Murthy urged that the jurisdiction to hear this appeal will continue to be with the Tribunal.
</p> 

<p id="p_7">5. Submissions made by the Ld. Sr. Counsel, Ld. Counsel and the Ld. SDR and the Ld. D.R. have been carefully considered. In both these cases, the orders have been passed by the Additional Collector of Central Excise. In both these cases, the date of the order, as indicated in the Order-in-Original is prior to 14-5-1992 while the date of issue of these orders is subsequent thereto. The question, therefore, will be whether the Tribunal will have jurisdiction to hear these appeals which have been filed by the parties on receiving these orders subsequent to 14-5-1992 on which date the Notification 11/92 amended Rule 2(ii) of the Central Excise Rules according to which the Additional Collector of Central Excise is not the Collector for the purpose of appeal and the appeal against the Additional Collector's order would, therefore, lie before the Collector of Central Excise (Appeals) and not to the CEGAT. In both the cases, admittedly, the Additional Collectors had considered the replies to the show cause notice, heard the parties and had passed the orders on dates which are, admittedly, prior to 14-5-1992. In such circumstances, can it be taken that the order has been passed by the Additional Collector in his capacity as Collector when he has signed the order. A similar question was answered by the Bombay High Court decision in the case of Cosmic Radio (supra). Para 6 of the decision is reproduced below:
</p><p id="p_8"> "At the hearing of the petition, on behalf of the respondents a return sworn by Gobindram Parsram Mani, Assistant Collector of Central Excise, has been filed wherein it is not disputed that Mr. Kullarwar did sign the order in favour of the petitioners on December 31,1979. Mr. Mehta the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, claimed that even though Mr. Kullarwar, the Assistant Collector had signed the order, still the order would have no force of law and would not come into operation, as long as the same was not communicated to the petitioners. Mr. Mehta submits that it is open for the successor of Mr. Kullarwar to revise the order and the petitioners can make no grievance about the same. In our judgment, the submission is totally untenable. Mr. Kullarwar, the Assistant Collector of Central Excise was holding the office on December 31,1979 and has passed a valid order duly signed after hearing the petitioners in pursuance of the show cause notice. Merely because on retirement of Mr. Kullarwar, his successor takes a view that the order passed by Mr. Kullarwar is not correct, is no ground to claim that the order of Mr. Kullarwar has no force of law till it is communicated to the petitioners. The communication of the order passed by Mr. Kullarwar is merely an administrative act and the failure of the respondents to inform passing of such order would not take away the effect of the order of Mr. Kullarwar. The mere fact that the order was never communicated to the petitioners is no ground to hold that the order of Mr. Kullarwar is not in existence. The order passed by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise comes into operation as soon as the same is signed and is not made dependent upon the communication of the same to the concerned party. In my judgment, the stand taken by the successor of Mr. Kullarwar is totally erroneous and his action in issuing fresh show cause notice to the petitioners and calling upon them to re-agitate the matter before him is contrary to the provisions of law. The petitioners, accordingly, are entitled to the reliefs sought in the petition." 
</p> 

<p id="p_9">6.   It follows from the above that in these two cases, the Additional Collector has passed the order duly signed after hearing the applicants herein in pursuance of show cause notice, when clothed with the powers of the Collector, but the communication of that order is subsequent to 14-5-1992, and it also follows from the ratio of the above decision that the Additional Collector's orders in these cases will come into operation on the date the same is signed and is not dependent upon the communication  of the same to the concerned party. The Bombay High Court decision has also been followed by this Tribunal in the case of P.N.- Monga Bottlers (supra). The Supreme Court has, further, clarified and laid down the law in this respect in the case of M.M. Rubber Co. (supra). Para 12 of the Supreme Court decision is relevant and is reproduced below:
</p><p id="p_10"> "It may be seen therefore, that, if an authority is authorised to exercise a power or do an act affecting the rights of the parties, he shall exercise that power within the period of limitation prescribed therefor. The order or decision of such authority comes into force or becomes operative or becomes an effective order or decision on and from the date when it is signed by him. The date of such order or decision is the date on which the order or decision was passed or made; that is to say when he ceases to have any authority to tear it off and draft a different order and when he ceases to have any locuspaetentiae. Normally that happens when the order or decision is made public or notified in some form or when it can be said to have left his hand. The date of communication of the order to the party whose rights are affected is not the relevant date for purposes of determining whether the power has been exercised within the prescribed time." 
</p> 

<p id="p_11">7.   Supreme Court had clearly held that the date of communication of the order to the affected party is not the relevant date for the purpose of determining whether the power has been exercised within the prescribed time. In the Wood Paper case of the Tribunal (supra), distinguishing factor was that in that case it was a show cause notice demanding duty from the assessee, which is the affected party and in such as a context it was held that on the date of communication to the affected party, it should be shown that the notice was issued by the competent authority. What was being considered was whether a proper notice by the competent officer can be said to have been served on the person chargeable with a duty as required under <a href="/doc/85233116/" id="a_13">Section 11A</a> in the circumstances of that case. But here we are concerned with the provisions of <a href="/doc/152525782/" id="a_14">Section 35B</a> and whether the order, which is signed by the Additional Collector, at the material time when statutorily he was Collector after having considered the reply to the show cause notice and heard the party in the matter, will be an order passed by the Collector of Central Excise as adjudicating authority. Therefore, the ratio of that decision, dealing with a different <a href="/doc/463150/" id="a_15">Section of the Act</a> may not be pari materia. In this view of the matter, it is held that in these cases, the orders having been signed by the Additional Collector on a date prior to 14-5-1992 when Additional Collector was by definition 'Collector', the appeals from such orders will lie to the Tribunal even though it might have been issued subsequent to that date.
</p> 

<p id="p_12">S.L. Peeran, Member (J)
 

</p><p id="p_13">8.    I have gone through the order passed by my learned brother Shri K.S. Venkataramani, Member (Technical) but I regret my inability to agree with him. Hence I am recording my separate order.
</p> 

<p id="p_14">9.   My learned brother has already extracted the arguments and main contention of the parties. By Notification No. 11/1992-C.E., dated 14-5-1992, amendment to the Rule 2 in sub-rule (ii) to the definition of 'Collector' has been effected by addition of these words 'and includes an additional Collector' and in Clause (B), the words, letters and figures "and includes an Additional Collector, except for the purpose of Chapter VI-A of the Central Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_16">Salt Act</a>, 1944" shall be substituted. The effect of the amendment is that the Chapter VI-A dealing with appeals gets affected especially <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_17">Section 35</a> which reads as follows :-
</p>  

<p id="p_15">"<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_18">Section 35</a> - Appeals to Collector (Appeals) -
</p>  

<p id="p_16">(1) Any person aggrieved by any decision or order passed under this Act by a Central Excise Officer, lower in rank than a Collector of Central Excise, may appeal to the Collector of Central Excise (Appeals) (hereinafter in this Chapter referred to as the Collector (Appeals) within three months from the date of the communication to him of such decision or order;
</p><p id="p_17"> Provided that the Collector (Appeals) may, if he is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from presenting the appeal within the aforesaid period of three months, allow it to be presented within a further period of three months. 
</p> 

<p id="p_18">(2) Every appeal under this section shall be in the prescribed form and shall be verified in the prescribed manner."
</p> 

<p id="p_19">The effect of the amendment is that the orders passed by the Additional Collector are subject to appeal before the Collector (Appeals). The question before us is as to whether the amendment has retrospective effect to cover the orders passed prior to the amendment but communicated to party after the date of notification.
</p> 

<p id="p_20">10.   When does a person acquire a right of appeal and when does he chose the Appellate Forum and when does the limitation begin. Surely it is only when the order against the party is communicated and the vested right of filing appeals as provided in the Statute, is available to the party and the time for filing the appeal begins from that day. He has to chose the forum as provided by law on the date the order is communicated. When a statutory charges brings a change in forum, it is a procedural change and it will have retrospective effect to the pending matters also. In the present case, the Notification No. 11/92 has come into force with immediate effect, therefore, it effects all matters in which orders are required to be passed and also to those matters in which orders have been passed but are yet to be communicated. On the passing of the Notification No. 11/92, the Appellate forum has been changed in respect of the orders passed by the Additional Collector. Before the amendment of this notification, first appeal lay to the Tribunal. By this notification, two Appellate forums have been created. This additional creation of Appellate forum for preferring first appeal before Collector (Appeals) is a benefit confirmed on the aggrieved party and it being in a nature of procedural change in the forum only, hence it will have retrospective effect. If it were to be held that all orders passed prior to the date of notification but communicated after the date of notification should be filed in the Tribunal then in that event, a right conferred by notification by amendment to the aggrieved party, is being deprived.
</p> 

<p id="p_21">11.   Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes' 12th Edition by P. St. J. Langam at page 216 quoting Craies on Statute Law states as follows :-
</p><p id="p_22"> "Before the presumption against retrospectivity is applied, a Court must be satisfied that the Statute is retrospective... which takes away or impairs any vested right acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation or imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or considerations already past." 
</p> 

<p id="p_23">Again, at page 222, it states that -
</p><p id="p_24"> "The presumption against retrospective construction has no application to enactments which affect only the procedure and practice of the Courts. No person has a vested right in any course of procedure, but only the right of prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time being, by or for the Court which he sures, and if an Act of Parliament alters that mode of procedure, he can only proceed according to the altered mode. Alternations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless there is some good reason or other way they should not be." 
</p> 

<p id="p_25">Craies on Statute Law, Seventh Addition by S.G.G. Edger at page 401 observes as follows :-
</p>  

<p id="p_26">" Pending actions affected by new procedure or provision as to costs -
</p>  

<p id="p_27">But there is no vested right in procedure or costs. Enactments dealing with these subjects apply to pending actions, unless a contrary intention is expressed or clearly implied. "It is a general rule that when the legislature alters the rights of parties by taking away or conferring any right of action, its enactments, unless in express terms they apply to pending actions, do not affect them. But there is an exception to this rule, namely, where enactments merely affect procedure and do not extent to rights of action." For "It is perfectly settled that if the legislature forms a new procedure, that, instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should proceed in another and a different way, clearly there bygone transactions are to be sued for and enforced according to the new form of procedure. Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective unless there is some good reason or other why they should not be". In other words, if a statute deals merely with the procedure in an action, and does not affect the right of the parties, "it will be held to apply prima facie to all actions, pending as well as future"."
</p> 

<p id="p_28">12.   Again if there is a impairment of the right of appeal by imposing a more stringent or onerous condition thereon that it would not be a mere matter of procedure, and the amendment would have no retrospective effect as has been held in several judgments like <a href="/doc/119546/" id="a_19">State of Bombay v. S.G. Films Exchange</a> AIR 1960 SC 980; Horse in <a href="/doc/925351/" id="a_20">Kasain Dada (India) Ltd. v. The State of M.P. and Ors</a>. as reported in AIR 1953 SC 221 it was held that the amendment in law could not be regarded as a mere alteration in procedure or an alteration regulating the exercise of the right of appeal, if the amendment were to whittled down the right itself and such amendment would have no retrospective effect. Therefore, it is now a settled law that an impairment of a right by putting a new restriction thereon or imposing a more onerous condition is not a matter of procedure only, as it impairs or imperils a substantive right and an enactment which does so is not retrospective unless it says so expressly or by necessary intendment (para 12 AIR 1960 SC 980).
</p> 

<p id="p_29">13. In the present case, there has been no impairment of any right by amending the powers of Additional Collector for the purposes of filing appeal against his orders. In fact, this amending legislation confers another right of appeal and it does not take away any right. The amendment is merely procedural and it will have retrospective effect, as the amendment has only changed the venue of the appeal from Tribunal to the Collector (Appeals) and therefore, it does not affect the vested right of an aggrieved party to file the appeal. In these context, in a similar situation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has clarified the same in the case of <a href="/doc/1316559/" id="a_21">Union of India v. Sukumar</a> as reported in AIR 1966 SC 1206 at Paras 6 to 9 at Pages 1208 to 1209 which is reproduced below :-
</p>  

<p id="p_30">"The learned Solicitor-General, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, contends that the High Court was in error in holding that the accused had a vested right to be tried by an ordinary criminal Court. He says that the amendment only changed the venue of trial from a Magistrate to the Director of Enforcement in some cases and no vested right was affected. He refers to the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1786180/" id="a_22">Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh</a> 1953 SCR 1188 : AIR 1953 (SC) 394, where Jagannadhadas, J. speaking for the Court observed at Page 1200 (of SCR) (at page 399 of AIR) as follows :-
</p><p id="p_31"> "In this context, it is necessary to notice that what is prohibited under <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_23">Article 20</a> is only coviction or sentence under an ex-post facto law and not the trial thereof. Such trial under a procedure different from what obtained at the time of the commission of the offence or by a Court different from that which had competence at the time cannot ipso facto be held to be unconstitutional. A person accused of the commission of an offence has no fundamental right to trial by a particular Court or by a particular procedure, except in so far as any constitutional objection by way of discrimination or the violation of any other fundamental right may be involved." 
</p> 

<p id="p_32">(7) Before its amendment by Act XXXIX of 1957, Section 23 (I) of the Act read as follows -
</p><p id="p_33"> "23 (I) Whoever contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule, direction or order made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term or with both, and any Court trying any such contravention may, if it thinks fit and in addition to any sentence which it may impose for such contravention direct that any currency, security, gold or silver, or goods or other property in respect of which the contravention has taken place shall be confiscated." 
</p> 

<p id="p_34">After the amendment by Act XXXIX of 1957 another S 23(I) was substituted and S 23-D was added, which read as follows -
</p>  

<p id="p_35">"23(1) If any person contravenes the provisions of <a href="/doc/678185/" id="a_24">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1532109/" id="a_25">5</a>, <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_26">9</a>,<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_27">10</a>, Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_28">Sections 12</a>,<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_29">17</a>,<a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_30">18A</a> or 18B or of any rule, direction or order made thereunder, he shall -
</p><p id="p_36"> a) be liable to such penalty not exceeding three times the value of the foreign exchange in respect of which the contravention has taken place, or five thousand rupees whichever is more, as may be adjudged by the Director of Enforcement in the manner hereinafter provided, or
 

23-D(1) For the purpose of adjudging under Column (a) of Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_31">Section 23</a> whether any person has committed a contravention the Director of Enforcement shall hold an inquiry in the prescribed manner after giving that person a reasonable opportunity of being heard and if, on such inquiry, he is satisfied that the person has committed the contravention, he may impose such penalty as he thinks fit in accordance with the provision of the said <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_32">Section 23</a>.
</p> 

<p id="p_37">Provided that, if at any stage of the inquiry, the Director of Enforcement is of opinion that having regard to the circumstances of the case, the penalty which he is empowered to impose would not be adequate, he shall, instead of imposing any penalty himself, make a complaint in writing to the Court."
</p> 

<p id="p_38">(8) The effect of these provisions is that after the amendment of 1957, adjudication proceedings or criminal proceedings could be taken up in respect of a contravention mentioned in <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_33">Section 23</a>(1} while before the amendment only criminal proceedings before a Court could be instituted to punish the offender. The High Court, as already observed, held that the new amendment did not apply to contraventions which took place before the Act came into force.
</p> 

<p id="p_39">(9) Mr. Chatterjee, the learned counsel for the respondent urges that a substantive vested right to be tried by an ordinary Court existed before the amendment and he relied on Maxwell 11th Edition, p. 217 where it is stated that "the general principle, however, seems to be that alterations in procedure are retrospective unless there be some good reason against it." He says that there is a good reason if the principles of <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_34">Art. 20</a> are borne in mind. In our opinion, there is force in the contention of the learned Solicitor General. As observed by this Court in 1953 SCR 1188 : AIR 1953 SC 394 a person accused of the commission of an offence has no vested right to be tried by a particular court of a particular procedure except in so far as there is any constitutional objection by way of discrimination or the violation of any other fundamental right is involved. It is well recognised that 'no person, has a vested right in any course of procedure' (vide Maxwell 11th Edition page 216) and we see no reason why this ordinary rule should not prevail in the present case. There is no principle underlying <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_35">Art. 20</a> of the Constitution which makes a right to any course of procedure a vested right. Mr. Chatterjee complains that there is no indication in the <a href="/doc/1596533/" id="a_36">Amending Act</a> that the new procedure would be retrospective and he further says that this affects his right of appeal under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_37"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>. But if this is a matter of procedure, then it is not necessary that there should be a special provision to indicate that the new procedural law is retrospective. No right of appeal under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_38"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a> is affected because no proceedings had ever been started under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_39"> the Criminal Procedure Code</a>."

<p id="p_40">14.   As can be seen from the above case, alongwith change of venue of trial, the powers of the authority has also been increased in respect of imposing fines and penalties. Yet the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the amending law has retrospective effect and cover all pending matters which had already been initiated. The principle is with regard to the change of venue and not with the powers of the authority.

<p id="p_41">15.   The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1597336/" id="a_40">Anant Gopal Sheoray v. The State of Bombay</a> AIR 1958 SC 915 in para 4 has clearly held that change in law of procedure will always have retrospective effect. The said observation at para 4 at page 915 of the report is reproduced below :-
</p><p id="p_42"> "We have examined the reasons given by the trial court for holding that the document of 1906 executed by Jotkunwar and the supposed act of Jira Bai amounted to a valid surrender of the whole estate of Raghurai accelerating the succession to his estate. We have also examined the grounds upon which the High Court took a contrary view holding that the document of 1906 and the supposed act of Jira Bai did not amount to a valid surrender of the whole estate of Raghurai. On a proper appreciation of the aforesaid transactions there had been no acceleration of the succession to the estate of Raghurai by a complete self-effacement on the part of Jotkunwar and Jira Bai. Accordingly, the transactions were in the nature of gifts which could only operate upto the death of Jotkunwar. We have construed the document of 1906 and have kept in mind the submissions made on behalf of the appellants and have come to the conclusion that the view taken by the High Court was the correct view. It is quite clear from the terms of the document that Jotkunwar did not surrender the whole of the estate which came to her from her husband. She had reserved to herself cultivating rights in the sir lands to the extent of 91.5 acres. Such an area was a substantial area. The surrender therefore, was not complete. The self effacement by Jotkunwar and her daughter Jira Bai to be of any consequence had to be complete self effacement and with respect to the whole of the estate of Raghurai. A partial self effacement was not a surrender in the true sense and did not accelerate the succession to the estate of Raghurai. The subsequent gift of 91.5 acres in similar terms to Jira Bai and her three sons did not advance the matter any further as neither the document of 1906 nor the latter gift amendment to a valid surrender."

<p id="p_43">The later observation of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Jose da <a href="/doc/1427097/" id="a_41">Costa v. Bascora</a> in para 28 at page 1849-50 as reported in AIR 1975 SC 1843 is also worthy of being noted -
</p><p id="p_44"> "Before ascertaining the effect of the enactments aforesaid passed by the Central Legislature on pending suits or appeals, it would be appropriate to bear in mind two well established principles. The first is that "while provisions of a statute dealing merely with matters of procedure may properly, unless that construction be textually inadmissible, have retrospective effect attributed to them, provisions which tough a right in existence at the passing of the statute are not to be applied retrospectively in the absence of express enactment or necessary intendment (see <a href="/doc/651777/" id="a_42">Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. Income-tax Commissioner</a>) 54 Ind App. 421 : AIR 1927 PC 242. The second is that a right of appeal being a substantive right the institution of a suit carries with it the implication that all successive appeals available under the law then in force would be preserved to the parties to the suit throughout the rest of the career of the suit. There are two exceptions to the application of this rule, viz (1) when by competent enactment such right of appeal is taken away expressly or implied with retrospective effect and (2) when the court to which appeal lay at the commencement of the suit stands abolished (<a href="/doc/673500/" id="a_43">See Gari Kapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhry</a>) 1957 SCR 488 : AIR 1957 SC 540 and Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. v. Irving 1905 (AC) 369." 
</p> 

<p id="p_45">A similar controversy arose in the case of Tikaram and Sons Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Sales-tax, U.P. as reported in AIR 1968 SC 1286. By an amendment Section 11 of U.P. Sales-tax Act enabled the Commissioner of Sales-tax to ask for reference to High Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held at para 8 that it is procedure and has retrospective effect, as it does not take away the vested right of an aggrieved party. The said para 8 is reproduced below :-
</p><p id="p_46"> "It was lastly submitted by M. Chagla that a reference to the High Court under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_44">Section 11</a> of the Act at the instance of the Commissioner of Sales-tax was incompetent as the Commissioner was neither a dealer nor a person aggrieved within the meaning of the section as it originally stood and the amendment effected in Sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_45">Section 11</a> by U.P. Sales-tax Act 8 of 1954 which came into force on April 1, 1954 was not retrospective in character and could not apply to proceedings which had been initiated earlier before Sales-tax authorities as well as before the Revising authority. It was pointed out that the appellate order was made on January 4,1952 and the revision application was filed before the amending Act of 1954 came into force. It further appears that the revision application was disposed of on July 8, 1957 by the Revising authority. The contention put forward on behalf of the appellants was that the Commissioner had no power to apply for a reference at the time the appellants had made the application for revision. It was conceded by Mr. Chagla that at the time the commissioner applied for a reference under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_46">Section 11</a> of the Act the amending Act 1954 had already come into force and under the amended section the Commissioner was empowered to ask for a reference. The point taken was that the material date was the date on which the appellants made the application for revision and not the date on which the application was actually decided by the Revising authority. We are unable to accept this argument as correct. The right to apply for a reference is conferred upon a person aggrieved by an order passed under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_47">Section 10</a> and this right exists regardless of which the application for revision was made. Only the existence of an order under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_48">Section 10</a> is required for the accrual of the right to make an application for a reference. It was suggested by Mr. Chagla that the Commissioner did not have the right to apply for a reference because the right did not exist when the appellants had made the application for revision. But the right did exist on the date on which the Commissioner applied for a reference and there is nothing in the language or context of <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_49">Section 11</a> to suggest that the commissioner could exercise the right only if it existed on the date on which the application for revision had been made. On behalf of the appellants, Mr. Chagla referred to the well-recognised rule that a statute should be interpreted as far as possible, so as to respect vested rights. But this rule has no application, to the present case for we do not think that amendment of <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_50">Section 11</a> of the Act by enabling the Commissioner also to ask for a reference of a question to the right of the assessee. On the contrary, we consider that the amendment is merely procedural matter and the present case falls within the general principle that the presumption against a retrospective construction has no application to enactments which affect only the procedure and practice of courts. For "it is perfectly settled that if the legislature forms a new procedure, that instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should proceed in another and a different way, clearly there bygone transactions are to be sued for and enforced according to the new form of procedure. Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective unless there is some good reason or other why they should not be". Gardner v. Lucas [1878 (3) AC 582]. We are accordingly of the opinion that Mr. Chagla is unable to make good his argument on this aspect of the case." 
</p> 

<p id="p_47">16. The powers of authority does not in any way effect the vested right of filing an appeal. As stated in this case, the change brings in another forum of second appeal and the benefit of the amendment cannot be deprived to the aggrieved party. On this aspect also the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held so in the case of Bhagat Singh v. Management of New Delhi Tuberculosis Centre as reported in AIR 1986 SC page 842 at paras 11 to 14 at pages 844-846, reproduced below: -
</p>
  

<p id="p_48">"In interpretation of statutes, Courts have steered clear of the rigid stand of looking into the words of the section alone but have attempted to make the object of the enactment effective and to render its benefits into the person in whose favour it is made. The legislators are entrusted with the task of only making laws. Interpretation has to come from the courts. <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_51">Section 17B</a> on its terms does not say that it would bind awards passed before the date when it came into force. The respondents' contention is that a section which imposes an obligation for the first time cannot be made retrospective. Such sections should always be considered prospective. In our view, if this submission is accepted, we will be defeating the very purpose for which this section has been enacted. It is here that the court has to evolve the concept of purposive interpretation which has found acceptance whenever a progressive social beneficial legislation is under review. We share the view that where the words of statute are plain and unambiguous effect must be given to them. Plain words have to be accepted as such but where the intention of the legislature is not clear from the words or where two constructions are possible, it is the court's duty to discern the intention in the context of the background in which a particular section is enacted. Once such an intention is ascertained the courts have necessarily to give the statute a purposeful or a functional interpretation. Now it is trite to say that Acts aimed at social amelioration giving benefits for the have-nots should receive liberal construction. It is always the duty of the court to give such a construction to a statute as would promote the purpose or object of the Act. A construction that promotes the purpose of the legislation should be preferred to a literal construction. A construction which would defeat the rights of the have-nots and the underdog and which would lead to injustice should always be avoided. This section was intended to benefit the workmen in certain cases. It would be doing injustice to the section if we were to say that it would not apply to awards passed a day or two before it came into force.
</p> 

<p id="p_49">12. The learned counsel for the appellant invited our attention to a decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/87130/" id="a_52">Rustom &amp; Hornby (I) Ltd. v. T.B. Kadam</a> [AIR 1975 SC 2025] where this court was considering the scope of <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_53">Section 2A</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_54">Section 2A</a> provides thus -
</p><p id="p_50"> "Where any employer discharges, dismisses, retrenches or otherwise terminates the services of an individual workman, any dispute of difference between that workman and his employer connected with, or arising out of, such discharge, dismissal, retrenchment or termination shall be deemed to be an industrial dispute notwithstanding that no other workman nor any union of workmen is a party to the dispute." 
</p> 

<p id="p_51">Before this section was enacted, there was a bar for individual workman to raise an industrial dispute. It was this bar that the management put forward in that case.
</p> 

<p id="p_52">13.  It is contended that the reference was bad since the dismissal took place before December 1,1965, on which date the section came into force. This court did not accept this plea. The appellant's counsel submits that <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_55">Section 2A</a> and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_56">Section 17B</a> are more or less similar in their phraseology and when this court gave <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_57">Section 2A</a> retrospectivity, <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_58">Section 17B</a> should also be treated alike. This is what this Court said while dealing with <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_59">Section 2A</a>:
</p><p id="p_53"> "When the section uses the words, where any employer discharges, dismisses, retrenches or otherwise terminates the services of an individual workman it does not deal with the question as to when that was done; it refers to a situation or a state of affairs. In other words, where there is a discharge, dismissal, retrenchment or termination of service otherwise the dispute relating to such discharge, dismissal retrenchment or termination of services becomes an industrial dispute. It is no objection to this to say that this interpretation would lead to a situation where the disputes would be reopened after the lapse of many years and referred for adjudication under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_60">Section 10</a>. The question of creation of new right by <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_61">Section 2A</a> is also not very relevant. Even before the introduction of <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_62">Section 2A</a> a dispute relating to an individual workman could become an industrial dispute by its being sponsored by a labour union or a group of workmen. Any reference under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_63">Section 10</a> would be made only sometime after the dispute itself has arisen. The only relevant factor for consideration in making a reference under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_64">Section 10</a> is whether an industrial dispute exists or is apprehended. There cannot be any doubt that on the date the reference was made in the present case, an industrial dispute as defined under <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_65">Section 2A</a> did exist." 
</p> 

<p id="p_54">14. The appellant's counsel relied upon the above observation and contended that even though the words used are in the future tense, denoting something to happen in future, the section was held to operate retrospectively also and that similar is the case with <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_66">Section 17B</a>. The learned counsel for the respondents met this argument with the plea that <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_67">Section 2A</a> was only a definition section and no support could be drawn from the above judgment for the purpose of this case. In our view the principle, laid down in the above decision cannot be dismissed so lightly because this court extended the benefit of this section to a dispute that existed before the section came into force, notwithstanding the fact that the section used future tense regarding the dispute. We agree that <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_68">Section 2A</a> is a definition section. Still this court gave it a retrospective construction. We feel some support is available to the appellant from this decision."
</p> 

<p id="p_55">17. The right to file appeal is exercised only when the judgment is pronounced [<a href="/doc/673500/" id="a_69">Gari Kapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhary</a> AIR 1957 SC 540]. In the present case, the order of the Additional Collector has been issued after the date of notification amending the venue of filing the appeals from the order of Additional Collector. The right to file appeal has to be exercised only from the date the said order reaches the hands of the aggrieved party. It is only then he is made aware of the orders, that the limitation to file appeals begins from that date. The notification is to have immediate effect. Therefore, the venue of the appeal having been changed, the amendment has to be construed as have retrospective effect, as it brings changes in procedure and does not take away the vested right of filing appeal but in fact confers another benefit of second appeal to the Tribunal. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1316292/" id="a_70">Collector v. M.M. Rubber Co</a>. has to be seen in this context. The powers of an authority to exercise its review power has to be done within the prescribed time. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has clearly observed in para 12 as cited in the main order, that the date of the communication of the order to the party is the date when the rights are effected. The Hon'ble Supreme Court was on the aspect of the authority exercising its powers within the prescribed time limit fixed by the law. The later portion of the observation by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the date of communication of the order to the party, whose rights are affected, is the relevant portion applicable to the facts of this case. In this case, the remedy of filing the appeal and choosing the forum to exercise the right of appeal is only from the date of communication of the order to the party whose rights are affected. In this case, the order has been communicated after the effective date of the notification; therefore, the amendment having taken place to the appellate forum, the aggrieved party has to file the appeal before the Collector and not before this Tribunal, as this Tribunal's power to entertain appeals from the orders of the Additional Collector has been divested. The date of the signing of the order by the Additional Collector has no relevance and the ratio of the Tribunal order in the case of <a href="/doc/1730575/" id="a_71">Wood Paper Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise</a> 1991 (56) E.L.T. 71 which is based on several citations with that of Supreme Court and that of Tribunal is fully relevant and applicable to the facts of this case. The judgment of Bombay High Court rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/766776/" id="a_72">Cosmic Radio v. Union of India</a> and that of the Tribunal in the case of P.N. Manga Bottlers P. Ltd. (supra) is in a different context i.e. the orders of the authority becoming final, but the ratio does not deal with the effect of amendments having retrospective effect in respect of procedural laws affecting Appellate forums, as noted in preceding paras. In the result, I hold that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain these appeals.
