        "the   rationale   of   conspiracy   is   that   the   required  
        objective manifestation of disposition to criminality  
        is provided by the act of agreement. Conspiracy is a  
        clandestine activity. Persons generally do not form  
        illegal covenants openly. In the interest of security, a 
        person   may   carry   out   his   part   of   a   conspiracy 
        without  even being informed of the identity of  his  
        co­conspirators.   An   agreement   of   this   kind   can 
        rarely be shown by direct proof, it must be inferred

        minds".

        "Regarding   admissibility   of   evidence,   loosened  
        standards prevail in a conspiracy trial. Contrary to  
        the   usual   rule,   in   conspiracy   prosecutions,   any  
        declaration by one conspirator, made in furtherance  
        of   a   conspiracy   and   during   its   pendency,   is  
        admissible against each co­conspirator. Despite the 
        unreliability of hearsay evidence, it is admissible in 
        conspiracy   prosecutions.   Thus   conspirators   are 
        liable   on   agency   theory   for   statements   of   co­
        conspirators, just as they are for the overt acts and 
        crimes committed by their confrers".

        acted corruptly  with full vigour, in   false claims,

                 insistence                   is   reflection   of 
                 Parliament's   resolve     to   meet

                 the   most   pivotal   feature   of 
                 sentencing   of   corrupt   public  
                 servants. All public servants  have to 
                 face very serious consequences.  If on 
                 the other hand any public servant  is 
                 given   the   impression   that   if   he 
                 succeeds   in   protracting   the 
                 proceedings that would help him to 
                 have the advantage of getting a very  
                 light sentence even  if the case ends  
                 in   conviction,   its   fallout   would 
                 afford   incentive   to   public   servants 
                 who   were   susceptible   to  corruption  
                 to   indulge   in   such   nefarious  
                 practices with immunity. Increasing  
                 the   fine   after   reducing   the 
                 imprisonment   to a  nominal  period  
                 can   also   defeat   the   purpose   as   the  
                 corrupt public servants could  easily  
                 raise   the   fine   amount   through   the
