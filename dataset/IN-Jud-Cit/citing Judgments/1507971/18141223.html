                          intellectual property in the brands such as Nycil, Glucon-D, Complan, etc.
                          The Plaintiff through its predecessor has several trade mark registrations in

                          variant for the corresponding period is Rs. 231 crores. The Plaintiff is stated
                          to have expanded Rs. 24 crores in the sales promotion of the &#x27;GLUCON-D&#x27;
                          products.
</p><p id="p_8">                          6.     On 27th April, 2022, the Plaintiff came across a television commercial
                          of the Defendant in Bengali language promoting its product &#x27;DABUR
                          GLUCOPLUS-C ORANGE&#x27; on a Bengali news channel (hereinafter
                          &#x27;impugned TVC&#x27;). On 29th April, 2022, the Plaintiff came across a longer
                          version of the impugned TVC which was also aired by the Defendant on the
                          same Bengali news channel. The longer version of the impugned TVC has
                          two extra frames. The grievance of the Plaintiff in the present suit is that the
                          impugned TVC denigrates and disparages all orange glucose powder drinks.
                          In particular, the TVC disparages the Plaintiff&#x27;s product &#x27;GLUCON-D
                          TANGY ORANGE&#x27; which is the market leader in orange glucose powder
                          drinks. The Plaintiff claims that the impugned TVC gives the impression
                          that all the orange glucose powder drinks are entirely inefficacious in
                          providing energy and only the Defendant&#x27;s product is capable of providing
                          energy.

                          market share in relation to orange glucose energy drinks. Thus, this would
                          be a case where the Plaintiff is entitled to make out a case of generic
                          disparagement of the entire product category. Moreover, in view of the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s substantial market share, the Plaintiff would be directly impacted

                          energy. In fact, he relies upon the contents of Plaintiff&#x27;s and the Defendant&#x27;s
                          products, as also the nutritional information as depicted thereon to argue that
                          the energy per 100 gms of Defendant&#x27;s product is 365 kcal. On the other
                          hand, energy per 100 gms of Plaintiff&#x27;s product is 368 kcal. Thus, the energy
                          being claimed to be higher in the Defendant&#x27;s product is itself false.
</p><p id="p_21">                          11.      He further relies upon the reply filed by the Defendant to the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC to argue that
                          even in the reply the Defendant does not claim that higher glucose content
                          gives higher energy. The Defendant&#x27;s case is that it only gives higher
                          &#x27;instant energy&#x27;. Thus, the Defendant is attempting to draw up a distinction
                          between &#x27;higher energy&#x27; and &#x27;higher instant energy&#x27;, which may not be
                          deciphered by the consumers who view the commercial / advertisement of
                          the Defendant.

                          weaker child consuming the Plaintiff&#x27;s product who is not likely to win the
                          race and hence, plays on the emotions of mothers in a negative manner
                          against the Plaintiff&#x27;s product. It undervalues the Plaintiff&#x27;s product and
                          even though the Defendant may claim that the overall impression is
                          hyperbolic in nature, if it is a serious misrepresentation of fact, the same can
                          be injuncted by a court of law. Broadly, the objections of the Plaintiff qua
                          the impugned commercial are summarized as under:

                                iv.      25% more glucose does not translate to more energy. Thus, to
                                         show that the girl consuming the Defendant&#x27;s product wins the
                                         race is a misrepresentation.
</p><p id="p_24">                          13.     It is the submission of the ld. Sr. Counsel that all these elements in the
                          impugned TVC would show that the commercial is not mere puffery or
                          hyperbole, but is an effort to show the Plaintiff&#x27;s product in a bad light and
                          lower its quality. The message is that the girl consuming the Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          product loses to the other girl because of the higher energy in the
                          Defendant&#x27;s products which is false.

                          done to support the representations being made in the impugned TVC. The
                          only test report is one which claims to conduct evaluation of instant energy
                          boosting potential of Defendant&#x27;s product by estimation of ATP levels in
                          muscle cells in vitro. There has been no testing done on humans to show that
                          the Defendant&#x27;s product is better. Ld. Sr. Counsel highlights the following
                          discrepancies in the test report on record:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                  i.     The report is an internal report of Dabur&#x27;s own laboratory.
                                  ii.    The exact date of generation of the test report is not clear.
                                  iii.   The samples tested were of June, 2019 and it could have been
                                         the case that the samples were expired when they were tested.
                                  iv.    Typographical errors exist in the report. Certain errors in the
                                         test report are pointed out in the ATP levels which are
                                         mentioned in the description portion. The same do not correlate
                                         with the figures of ATP levels depicted in the table in the very
                                         same report.

                          product ingredients have remained the same since 2019. However, with the

                                         shown to be inferior. The Court further held that in case of

                                         much less as against puffery or hyperbole of the advertiser in

                          Submissions on behalf of the Defendant

</p><p id="p_35">                          19.     Mr. Rajiv Nayar, ld. Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the
                          Defendant submits that a competitor cannot be hypersensitive and ought to
                          be able to tolerate a certain amount of exaggeration or puffery in television
                          commercials. In the impugned TVC, there is no reference to any other
                          competing product, hence there cannot be any denigration. He submits that
                          the Plaintiff&#x27;s drink is not even remotely referred to in the impugned TVC,
                          unlike in other cases, where the products are sometimes even referred to by
                          blurring and other indicators. The depiction of a girl consuming an ordinary
                          drink and losing the race can best be described as puffery and nothing more.
</p><p id="p_36">                          20.     It is submitted that it is the Defendant&#x27;s case that glucose leads to
                          instant energy. This fact is admitted by the Plaintiff on its own product&#x27;s
                          packaging at several places where the Plaintiff does a comparison with an
                          ordinary drink and shows that glucose results in instant energy. If the fact
                          that the glucose leads to instant energy stands admitted, then the depiction of
                          the same in a puffed manner cannot be termed as disparaging or denigration.
                          When the Plaintiff itself can claim that the glucose leads to instant energy in
                          comparison with an ordinary drink, injunction being sought against the
                          Defendant would be contrary to the Plaintiff&#x27;s own stand on its own
                          packaging.
</p><p id="p_37">                          21.     It is submitted by Mr. Nayar, ld. Sr. Counsel, that two representations
                          have been made by the Defendants in the impugned TVC which are relating
                          to:
</p><p id="p_38">                                • 25% more glucose and
                                • 2X micronutrients.

                          On both the representations made by the Defendant, the ld. Sr. counsel
                          contends that the same are verifiable and hence the Defendant ought not to
                          be injuncted.
</p><p id="p_40">                          22.    It is submitted by Mr. Nayar, ld. Sr. Counsel that the Defendant is
                          entitled to amplify the special features of its own product. In the impugned
                          TVC, the Defendant is merely showing its own superiority and highlighting
                          its product&#x27;s features. It is his submission that the Plaintiff is being
                          hypersensitive with an intention to crush competition and further retain its
                          monopoly. The following factors are then highlighted:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                                 i.     The ingredients of the two packaging clearly shows that
                                        glucose is 50.4% in Defendant&#x27;s product and 40% in Plaintiff&#x27;s
                                        product. This would translate to 25% more instant energy,
                                        which is depicted in the commercial. Thus, the Defendant is
                                        entitled to say that it gives 25% more instant energy in every
                                        sip as glucose give instant energy.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                                 ii.    The representation made by the Plaintiff itself on its packaging
                                        on three occasions is that glucose gives instant energy. Thus,
                                        the Plaintiff cannot deny the fact that more glucose leads to
                                        more energy. The print advertisement of the Plaintiff which
                                        proudly proclaims &#x27;instant energy k liye&#x27; also supports this
                                        contention.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                                 iii.   Insofar as the micronutrients- calcium and phosphorus are
                                        concerned, even on these two nutritional ingredients, the
                                        numbers would show that the representation made is factually
                                        correct.

                             allegation can be of generic disparagement. Even on that aspect, if the
                             comparison is truthful, there can be no injunction. Reliance is placed by
                             ld. Sr. Counsel on the following judgments:

                                          is the market leader, is targeted, the Defendant is entitled to do
                                          so, as it promotes and protects commercial speech. Further,
                                          unless and until there is a direct reference, disparagement
                                          cannot be alleged.

                                 iv.    The judgment of a ld. Single judge of this Court in <a href="/doc/131750016/" id="a_10">Marico
                                        Limited v. Adani Wilmar Ltd. MIPR</a> 2013 (2)2037 to argue
                                        that so long as the advertisement is by and large truthful, the
                                        commercial should be permitted to be aired and advertisers
                                        should be given enough room to play around in the grey area. It
                                        is only if the facts are totally unsubstantiated and have no basis
                                        in reason and logic that the courts should intervene.
</p><p id="p_44">                          24.    In conclusion, Mr. Nayar, ld. Sr. Counsel submits that the
                          comparative advertisement has to be acceptable so long as there is no
                          disparagement or denigration. The market forces would have to decide and
                          the Plaintiff cannot stop other parties from entering the market. The
                          Defendant has less than 10% of the market share whereas the Plaintiff has
                          74% of the market share and under the garb of this suit cannot seek to
                          perpetuate a monopoly.
</p><p id="p_45">                          25.    Mr. Anirudh Bakhru, ld. Counsel, in addition, submits that if a puffed-
                          up statement is made, it in itself is a statement of exaggeration, since it is not
                          a factual representation at all, the consumer cannot be held to have been
                          misrepresented. Ld. counsel, cites the <a href="/doc/134483884/" id="a_11">Colgate Palmolive Company v.

                          energy value of the Defendant&#x27;s product. Mr. Bakhru, ld. Counsel further
                          highlights one fact that in the translation of the impugned TVC from Bengali
                          to English, the word &#x27;more&#x27; has been added. It is his submission that the
                          word &#x27;more&#x27; is missing in the original Bengali advertisement and the
                          translation is slightly erroneous.

</p><p id="p_47">                          26.      The grievance of the Plaintiff in the present suit is two-fold. One, that
                          the comparison being made in the impugned TVC is that of the Defendant&#x27;s
                          product &#x27;DABUR GLUCOPLUS-C ORANGE&#x27; with the Plaintiff&#x27;s product
                          &#x27;GLUCON-D TANGY ORANGE&#x27;. Secondly, that the comparison in the
                          impugned TVC is misleading, misrepresentative and also disparaging of all
                          orange glucose powder drinks including the Plaintiff&#x27;s product &#x27;GLUCON-

                                   does not result in higher energy and, thus, the statement is misleading.
                                   25% more glucose does not translate to 25% more energy. There is no

                                 Plaintiff&#x27;s own admission, the Defendant&#x27;s product has 25% more
                                 glucose than the Plaintiff&#x27;s product. This would translate into 25%
                                 more instant energy, which is depicted in the commercial.

                          the effect of the impugned commercial is to denigrate the Plaintiff&#x27;s product
                          &#x27;GLUCON-D TANGY ORANGE&#x27; and, by implication, that the said product
                          is inefficacious. The relevant paragraphs of the plaint are as under:

                                        Defendant is specifically trying to denigrate the
                                        Plaintiff&#x27;s product &#x27;GLUCON-D Tangy Orange&#x27;

<p id="p_55">                          30.    Some of the notable features of the Defendant&#x27;s impugned TVC
                          relevant for the purpose of the present analysis are:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                                 a)     There is no direct or indirect visual reference or allusion to any
                                        other orange glucose powder drink in the impugned TVC.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                                 b)     In the second frame of the commercial itself, the depiction of
                                        the generic orange coloured drink is in a glass. There is no
                                        packaging, no mark, no logo, no container which is shown in
                                        the entire advertisement except for the Defendant&#x27;s.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_24">                                 c)     In fact, the portrayal of the other orange drink being stirred by
                                        the mother showing the generic orange drink is so fleeting that
                                        it is not even visible on a single view of the impugned TVC.
</blockquote><p id="p_56">                          31.    The highlight of the impugned TVC is the mixing of the Defendant&#x27;s
                          &#x27;DABUR GLUCOPLUS-C ORANGE&#x27; drink by one of the mothers. The
                          entire focus is on the Defendant&#x27;s product. At that stage of the commercial, a
                          viewer cannot decipher that the commercial is, in fact, a comparative
                          advertisement. The impugned commercial seems like an exaggerated
                          focused commercial on &#x27;DABUR GLUCOPLUS-C ORANGE&#x27; drink.
                          Moreover, there is no still or image even highlighting or showing the girl
                          consuming the generic orange drink as is the case where the girl consuming
                          the Defendant&#x27;s product, which is prominently shown. The comparison of
                          the two girls is surely visible in the whole commercial but it is not clear to
                          the viewer as to what has been consumed by the second girl who loses the
                          race. The disappointment of the mother of the girl losing the race is obvious

                          commercial it becomes apparent that both the girls had consumed orange
                          glucose when one of the mothers asks- &quot;Both of them drank the same orange
                          glucose then how did your daughter win so easily?&quot; To this, the other
                          mother replies- &quot;It&#x27;s not the same. My daughter drinks Dabur Gluco Plus-
                          C&quot;. The caption &quot;25% more glucose in every sip&quot; appears at the end of the
                          impugned TVC.
</p><p id="p_57">                          32.    The first question that needs to be considered by the Court is whether
                          this commercial can be identified as a comparison with the Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          &#x27;GLUCON-D TANGY ORANGE&#x27; product. In its reply to the injunction
                          application, the Defendant has admitted that the generic orange glucose
                          powder drink depicted in the impugned TVC was &#x27;GLUCON-D TANGY
                          ORANGE&#x27; manufactured by the Plaintiff and it is on that basis that the
                          impugned TVC was prepared. It is, however, clear from viewing of the
                          commercial that there is no direct or indirect comparison between the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s and the Defendant&#x27;s product visible to the viewer. The Defendant
                          has, however, used the Plaintiff&#x27;s product as a standard for comparison and
                          for preparing the commercial in question. Would these facts be sufficient to
                          classify the impugned commercial as generic disparagement is the question
                          before the Court or would it be necessary for the viewer / consumer to
                          identify the Plaintiff&#x27;s product or at least the product category by viewing of
                          the commercial.
</p><p id="p_58">                          33.    The Court has repeatedly viewed the impugned TVC and has also
                          borne in mind the plea of the Plaintiff that it is a market leader in this
                          category. In the opinion of this Court, the viewing of a television
                          commercial is not to be considered on the benchmark of repeated views, as

                          purchaser of an orange glucose powder drink consider the impugned
                          commercial as a comparative disparaging advertisement or not would be the
                          question? In order to answer this question, it is not sufficient that the
                          Plaintiff has a very high market share in the product category or that the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s product has been used as a benchmark for comparison and

                          has defined comparative advertising as an advertisement where a party
                          advertises its goods or services by comparing them with the goods and
                          services of another party. This is generally done by either projecting that the
                          advertiser&#x27;s product is of the same or superior quality to that of the
                          compared product or by denigrating the quality of the compared product.
</p><p id="p_60">                          35.    Thus, there has to be either express or implied reference to a
                          competitor or its goods or a product category. A mere fleeting allusion to
                          some unidentifiable product or product category cannot constitute
                          `comparative advertising&#x27;. For an advertisement to be classified as
                          comparative advertisement, there ought to be some attributes of a product

                          which are depicted in the commercial such as the container, coloured
                          packaging, mark, logo identifying the Plaintiff&#x27;s product directly or
                          indirectly. Even if such elements are absent, for the Plaintiff to claim generic
                          disparagement, there ought to be some indicators of identification of the
                          product category at least.
</p><p id="p_61">                          36.    In the case at hand, the glass which is shown in the hand of the mother
                          giving the generic orange drink is not identifiable in any manner with the
                          Plaintiff or even with an orange energy drink. It could even be an orange
                          soft drink, orange crush, orange squash, orange mocktail, orange juice, etc.,
                          Even on careful repeated watching of the impugned TVC by the Court, it is
                          not clear as to what is the drink being stirred in the glass. It seems to be an
                          orange-coloured drink which is put into a transparent glass and nothing
                          more. However, in the conversation between the mothers after the race
                          finishes, the category of the generic product being depicted has some
                          reference when one of the mothers asks &quot;Both of them drank the same
                          orange glucose then how did your daughter win so easily?&quot; Thus, the
                          impugned TVC identifies &#x27;orange glucose&#x27; as the product category towards
                          which the advertisement in question is directed. Therefore, the impugned
                          TVC can be classified as &#x27;comparative advertising&#x27; to the broad orange
                          glucose product category.

                          the Court is whether the impugned advertisement is disparaging in nature.
                          For the purpose of examining disparagement, comparative advertising can
                          be categorised in the following categories:

</p><p id="p_65">                          38.    Numerous decisions relating to comparative advertising and
                          disparagement have been cited by the parties. Broad principles have been
                          laid down repeatedly in these decisions. Principles of comparative
                          advertising laid down in these decisions would have to be applied depending
                          upon the category of comparative advertising in which a particular case
                          would fall.
</p><p id="p_66">                          39.    Disparagement is an act of belittling someone&#x27;s goods or services
                          with a remark that is misleading. The law relating to disparaging
                          advertisements is now well settled. It is open for a person to exaggerate and
                          highlight the qualities and features of his own goods, but it is not open for a
                          person to belittle and disparage the goods of another. There is a plethora of
                          judgments which have been cited before this Court by ld. Sr. Counsels for
                          both the parties. In the case of <a href="/doc/1786438/" id="a_15">Pepsi Co. v. Hindustan Coca Cola</a> 2003 (27)
                          PTC 305 (Del.) a ld. Division Bench of this Court held that the following
                          factors are required to be considered while deciding the question of
                          disparagement:

                          said principles were amplified/ restated by another ld. Division Bench of this
                          Court in the following terms:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_25">                                   i.     The intent of the advertisement - this can be understood from
                                          its story line and the message sought to be conveyed.
                                   ii.    The overall effect of the advertisement - does it promote the
                                          advertiser&#x27;s product or does it disparage or denigrate a rival
                                          product?
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">                                          In this context it must be kept in mind that while promoting its
                                          product, the advertiser may, while comparing it with a rival or a
                                          competing product, make an unfavourable comparison but that
                                          might not necessarily affect the story line and message of the
                                          advertised product or have that as its overall effect.
                                   iii.   The manner of advertising - is the comparison by and large
                                          truthful or does it falsely denigrate or disparage a rival product?
                                          While truthful disparagement is permissible, untruthful
                                          disparagement is not permissible.
</blockquote><p id="p_70">                          41.      It is on the basis of the above principles that this Court needs to
                          ascertain whether the impugned TVC is disparaging or not. Generic
                          disparagement is recognised as disparagement under the law, however, in
                          almost all cases where generic disparagement has been held to be
                          objectionable there has been some reference or some usage or depiction
                          which has clearly led to the conclusion that it is the aggrieved party&#x27;s
                          product or the entire product category is being referred to. For example:

                          depicting superiority, a generic comparison ought to be permitted and
                          creativity cannot be stifled. A television commercial is not to be analysed in
                          a hyper critical manner. A commercial would have to be viewed as a whole
                          from the view of an ordinary consumer or viewer. The message being
                          portrayed in the commercial would have to be seen and if the message is not
                          derogatory, no objection can be raised.

</p><p id="p_77">                          43.    In the opinion of the Court, cases where there is a direct comparison
                          and denigration of the competitor&#x27;s product would fall in a completely
                          different category as against those cases where there are allusions or indirect
                          references. Allegations of disparagement in cases where comparison is
                          alleged with an unrelated category as a whole is also objectionable.
                          However, in the case of generic comparison with a product of related / same
                          category without any direct reference to any competitor, the freedom for
                          advertisers would be greater than those cases falling in other categories. This
                          is because in order to portray a particular product as being superior or better
                          than existing products, a generic comparison highlighting the strength of its
                          own product without launching a negative campaign against its competitors
                          ought to be permissible failing which the strength of the advertisement could
                          itself be considerably diluted. The purpose of advertising any product is for
                          marketing the attributes of that product. Such attributes could be unilateral
                          or relative in a generic manner. It cannot be said that every generic
                          comparison would be referencing to the market leader which would, in the
                          opinion of the Court, be curtailing freedom of advertising to a considerable
                          extent. Mere allusions, in the absence of a decipherable comparison would
                          not be sufficient to make out a case of generic disparagement. An advertiser
                          ought to have the freedom to make advertisements with generic comparison
                          highlighting the features of its own product and if the same is done without
                          an allusion to any market leader, objection cannot be raised unless
                          representation being made is absolutely false or misleading.

                                 (supra),      the   products   concerned   were   &#x27;GOOD      KNIGHT
                                 NATURALS&#x27; and &#x27;ODOMOS&#x27;. There was no overt or direct
                                 reference to &#x27;ODOMOS&#x27; in the entire commercial. The content of the
                                 commercial showed that the competing product was causing rashes,
                                 allergy and was sticky, which was a serious depiction. However, the
                                 ld. Division Bench held that there was nothing in the advertisement to
                                 suggest that the commercial denigrated the products of the Appellant
                                 therein. The observation of the ld. Division Bench are as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">                                        &quot;5. The submission of the Appellant is that its
                                        product Odomos is an extremely popular mosquito
                                        repellant cream and it enjoys over 80% of the
                                        market share all over the country and in some
                                        parts of the country it enjoys a 100% market share.
                                        The sales of the Appellant&#x27;s product run into
                                        crores of rupees and the advertisement and
                                        promotion expenses also run into crores of rupees.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">                                        6. It is averred that the commercial of the
                                        Respondents&#x27; product was telecast on a news
                                        channel on 8th October, 2009. We are told that it
                                        has appeared on several occasions thereafter.
                                        According to the Appellant, the commercial
                                        disparages its product and, therefore, the
                                        Respondent should be injuncted from further
                                        telecasting it. It is submitted that even though
                                        there is no direct or overt reference to the
                                        Appellant&#x27;s product, since the Appellant&#x27;s product
                                        enjoys a huge market share, the commercial is
                                        obviously targeting it. Serious objection was
                                        taken to the suggestion in the commercial that the
                                        Appellant&#x27;s product causes rashes, allergy and is
                                        sticky.</blockquote>

</p><p id="p_81">                                        18. On balance, and by way of a conclusion, we
                                        feel that notwithstanding the impact that a telecast
                                        may have, since commercial speech is protected
                                        and an advertisement is commercial speech, an
                                        advertiser must be given enough room to play
                                        around in (the grey areas) in the advertisement
                                        brought out by it. A plaintiff (such as the
                                        Appellant before us) ought not to be hyper-
                                        sensitive as brought out in Dabur India. This is
                                        because market forces, the economic climate, the
                                        nature and quality of a product would ultimately
                                        be the deciding factors for a consumer to make a
                                        choice. It is possible that aggressive or catchy
                                        advertising may cause a partial or temporary
                                        damage to the plaintiff, but ultimately the
                                        consumer would be the final adjudicator to
                                        decide what is best for him or her.
</p>
<p id="p_82">                                        19. Having said this, we are of the opinion after
                                        having gone through the commercial not only in its
                                        text (as reproduced above) but also having
                                        watched it on a DVD that there is absolutely
                                        nothing to suggest that the product of the
                                        Appellant is targeted either overtly or covertly.
                                        There is also nothing to suggest that the
                                        commercial denigrates or disparages the
                                        Appellant&#x27;s product either overtly or covertly.
                                        There is also no hint whatsoever of any malice
                                        involved in the commercial in respect of the
                                        Appellant&#x27;s product - indeed, there is no
                                        requirement of showing malice.

<p id="p_83">                                        20. Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted
                                        before us that since his client has over 80% of the
                                        market share in the country and a 100% market
                                        share in some States, the obvious target of the
                                        commercial is the product of the Appellant. In
                                        our opinion, this argument cannot be accepted.

                                        The sub-text of this argument is an intention to
                                        create a monopoly in the market or to entrench a
                                        monopoly that the Appellant claims it already
                                        has. If this argument were to be accepted, then no
                                        other mosquito repellant cream manufacturer
                                        would be able to advertise its product, because in
                                        doing so, it would necessarily mean that the
                                        Appellant&#x27;s product is being targeted. All that we
                                        are required to ascertain is whether the
                                        commercial denigrates the Appellant&#x27;s product or
                                        not. There is nothing in the commercial to
                                        suggest a negative content or that there is a
                                        disparagement of the Appellant&#x27;s product. The
                                        commercial merely gives the virtues of the
                                        product of the Respondents, namely, that it has
                                        certain ingredients which perhaps no other
                                        mosquito repellant cream has, such as tulsi,
                                        lavender and milk protein. While comparing its
                                        product with any other product, any advertiser
                                        would naturally highlight its positive points but
                                        this cannot be negatively construed to mean that
                                        there is a disparagement of a rival product. That
                                        being so, whether the Appellant&#x27;s product is
                                        targeted or not becomes irrelevant.

                                       cases, but in view of the law laid down by the
                                       Supreme Court in Tata Press that false,
                                       misleading, unfair or deceptive advertising is
                                       not protected commercial speech, we are of
                                       the opinion that propositions (a) and (b)
                                       above and the first part of proposition (c) are
                                       not good law. While hyped-up advertising
                                       may be permissible, it cannot transgress the
                                       grey areas of permissible assertion, and if
                                       does so, the advertiser must have some
                                       reasonable factual basis for the assertion
                                       made. It is not possible, therefore, for
                                       anybody to make an off-the-cuff or
                                       unsubstantiated claim that his goods are the
                                       best in the world or falsely state that his goods
                                       are better than that of a rival.&quot;

                                 &#x27;PEPSODENT&#x27;. In this case, the commercial clearly depicted
                                 &#x27;COLGATE&#x27; and made a direct comparison with &#x27;PEPSODENT&#x27;.
                                 Customer&#x27;s imagination was not needed to see as to in what manner
                                 the comparison was being made with what product in the said case.
                                 &#x27;PEPSODENT&#x27; claimed to have 130% germ attack power in
                                 comparison with &#x27;COLGATE&#x27;. This was held to be not merely
                                 hyperbole and relying upon <a href="/doc/1013540/" id="a_26">Lakhanpal National v. M.R.T.P

                                          representation that Pepsodent is more effective in
                                          combating germs, 4 hours after brushing, in
                                          comparison with Colgate ST, is correct even then,
                                          prima facie, the advertisement would be
                                          disparaging as it also conveys the message that
                                          Colgate is ineffective and lacks the requisite
                                          quality to maintain oral hygiene and combat tooth
                                          decay and its usage, as depicted by the Colgate
                                          child, would result in the user ending up with a

<p id="p_93">                                          (supra) a trader cannot, while saying that his
                                          goods are better than his competitors&#x27;, say that his
                                          competitors&#x27; goods are bad. If he says so, he really

</p><p id="p_94">                          III.   The most recent decision of the ld. Division Bench of this Court in
                                 <a href="/doc/108915589/" id="a_28">Reckitt Benckiser (India) Pvt. Ltd. v. Hindustan Unilever Limited</a>
                                 (supra) dealt with a case where toilet cleaners &#x27;HARPIC&#x27; and
                                 &#x27;DOMEX&#x27; were being compared in an advertisement. A perusal of the
                                 storyboard in the said case would show that there was a direct
                                 reference to &#x27;HARPIC&#x27; product and it was suggested that &#x27;HARPIC&#x27;
                                 does not address the problem of bad odour. The actual &#x27;HARPIC&#x27;
                                 product was also shown in the said commercial. The commercial also
                                 depicted a child who is expressing displeasure by asking &quot;Toilet se
                                 badbu nahi aayengi?&quot; to enquire about the bad odour which would
                                 emanate if &#x27;HARPIC&#x27; is used. In the said decision, the ld. Division
                                 Bench has held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">                                        &quot;33. On a plain viewing, it is clear that the
                                        message sent by the advertiser is that Harpic does
                                        not address the problem of bad odour. The
                                        astonished expression of the child and his gesture
                                        of holding his nose while asking the question
                                        whether the toilet will not stink and the mother of
                                        the child getting concerned and worried, sends out
                                        a clear message that if you use Harpic, the toilet
                                        will continue to stink because the mother, who is
                                        otherwise regularly using Harpic, has not been
                                        able to address the problem of foul odour
                                        persisting in their toilet. The latter part of the
                                        impugned TVC-1 then shows a toilet bowl with
                                        discolouration possibly reflecting bad odour and
                                        the voice over saying &quot;Kyoki toilet ki badbu se
                                        ladne ke lie DOMEX me hai fresh guard
                                        technology&quot;. The remaining part of the impugned
                                        TVC-1 is about the product Domex and its quality
                                        to combat bad odour for a longer period of time.

</p><p id="p_96">                                      34. The impugned TVC-1 not only projects a
                                      message that Domex fights odour for a longer
                                      period of time, it also sends a clear message that
                                      Harpic does not address the problem of foul smell
                                      that emanates from toilets. The manner in which
                                      the impugned TVC-1 is structured, first, sends a
                                      message that Harpic only cleans without
                                      addressing the problem of bad odour and
                                      thereafter, sends the message that whoever
                                      chooses Harpic would have to live with their
                                      toilets smelling foul. This is a message that
                                      disparages Reckitt&#x27;s product and, in our view,
                                      cannot be permitted.
</p><p id="p_97">                                      35. The finding of the learned Single Judge that the
                                      impugned TVC-1 does not denigrate Reckitt&#x27;s
                                      product is erroneous and cannot be sustained. The
                                      latitude available in advertising is wide but does
                                      not extend to denigrating the product of one&#x27;s
                                      competitor.

                                 has highlighted the difference between embellishing one&#x27;s own
                                 product and calling the competitor&#x27;s products as bad or inferior. The
                                 relevant portion of the said judgment reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">                                     24. In a comparative advertisement, it is open for an
                                     advertiser to embellish the qualities of its products
                                     and its claims but it is not open for him to claim that
                                     the goods of his competitors are bad, undesirable or
                                     inferior. As an illustration, in a comparative
                                     advertisement, it is open for an advertiser to say his
                                     goods are of a good quality but it is not open for an
                                     advertiser to send a message that the quality of the
                                     goods of his competitor is bad. As observed by the

                                     him to denigrate the services of another. Thus, it is not

                                     may be untruthful. However, it is apparent to anyone

                                     comes to statements made by an advertiser in respect
                                     of the goods of his competitors and other persons, the
                                     latitude available to an advertiser is restricted. Whilst
                                     it is open for the tailoring shop to state that it provides
                                     the best tailored suit in the city; it is not open for it to
                                     advertise that the other tailoring shops in the street
                                     lack the necessary skill and their suits are ill tailored.

<p id="p_101">                                     25. A comparative advertisement would always
                                     involve the statement that the goods of the advertiser
                                     are better in some aspects than that of the competitor.
                                     But there is line that an advertiser cannot cross. He
                                     cannot disparage or defame the goods of his
                                     competitor.
</p>
<p id="p_102">                                     26. There may be cases where certain features of an
                                     advertiser&#x27;s product may be demonstrably better than
                                     the features of his competitor. In such cases, it is
                                     permissible for an advertiser to advertise and highlight
                                     these features. The message must clearly be to
                                     highlight the superior features of his product while
                                     ensuring that the product of his competitor is not
                                     disparaged or defamed.

<p id="p_103">                          45.    An analysis of the above three Division Bench judgments of this
                          Court shows that in the case of a commercial which has no direct or overt
                          reference to a competitor&#x27;s product, there cannot be a presumption that the
                          product of the Plaintiff is being targeted. The ld. Division Bench observes in
                          Dabur India Ltd. v Colortek (supra) that where there is no overt or covert
                          reference, merely on the basis of market share it cannot be presumed that the
                          advertisement is directed towards the market leader. In the opinion of this

                          Court, the reasoning and rationale in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_31">Dabur India Ltd. v. Colortek (Supra</a>)
                          fully applies to the facts of the present case. In fact, in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_32">Dabur India Ltd. v.
                          Colortek (Supra</a>) the allegation of qualities being attributed to the
                          competitor&#x27;s product of causing rashes, allergy and stickiness were far more
                          derogatory than the portrayal in the impugned TVC.
</p><p id="p_104">                          46.    Applying the ratio of the judgments discussed above, this Court is of
                          the view that the impugned TVC merely highlights the qualities of the
                          Defendant&#x27;s product and it does not disparage any orange glucose powder
                          drink. Disparagement cannot be a far-fetched inference. In the impugned
                          commercial, the mother asks a probing question as to how when her
                          daughter drank the same orange glucose, the other lady&#x27;s daughter won the
                          race. This is being interpreted by the Plaintiff as a comparison as it leads to
                          an inference that &#x27;DABUR GLUCOPLUS-C ORANGE&#x27; is more effective,
                          hence, superior and the other products including the Plaintiff&#x27;s product are
                          ineffective, hence, inferior - thus disparaging. The Plaintiff&#x27;s case is that the
                          gestures of disappointment and frustration on the face of the mother whose
                          daughter lost the race is sufficient to infer disparagement. This, in the
                          opinion of the Court, is far-fetched. It would not be proper for the Court to
                          flip the coin to conclude - &#x27;mine is better&#x27; as &#x27;yours is bad&#x27;. The comparison
                          being made in the impugned TVC might be unfavourable to the Plaintiff, but
                          it cannot be held to be disparaging. The intent and the overall effect of the
                          advertisement in question seems to be to promote the Defendant&#x27;s product
                          and not to denigrate the Plaintiff&#x27;s or any other manufacturer&#x27;s product.

                          misrepresentation of fact also does not hold ground. The admitted position is
                          that the Defendant&#x27;s product does have 25% more glucose than the

                          Plaintiff&#x27;s product. The impugned advertisement is by and large truthful and
                          there is no falsity involved. Therefore, there is no serious misrepresentation
                          of fact on part of the Defendant in the impugned TVC. The argument of the
                          Plaintiff that more glucose does not translate into higher energy also does
                          not hold ground for two reasons. First, the storyboard of the advertisement
                          merely shows &quot;25% more glucose in every sip&quot;. This is not
                          misrepresentative considering the contents of the Defendant&#x27;s drink.
                          Second, as far as the claims of &#x27;instant energy&#x27; is concerned, the Plaintiff&#x27;s
                          own product packaging, and its advertisements which have been placed on
                          record, show that the Plaintiff&#x27;s own stand is that glucose gives instant
                          energy. The Plaintiff cannot take a different stand for its own product and
                          Defendant&#x27;s product. Moreover, the storyboard shows that in the impugned
                          TVC it has been said &quot;this has 25% more glucose than your glucose
                          powder, which gives more instant energy + 2 times micronutrients&quot;,
                          however, it was brought to the attention of the Court that the impugned
                          TVC, which is Bengali, does not use the phrase &#x27;gives more instant energy&#x27;
                          and merely claims that it &#x27;gives instant energy&#x27;. Thus, the overall message
                          sought to be conveyed by the Defendant vide the impugned TVC is that its
                          product has 25% more glucose which gives instant energy.
</p><p id="p_106">                          48.    In the absence of any disparaging uttering, still or image in the
                          impugned TVC, this Court is unable to arrive at a conclusion merely on the
                          basis of the market share of the Plaintiff that the Plaintiff&#x27;s product is being
                          disparaged or there is any generic disparagement. The impugned TVC when
                          viewed from the perspective of an ordinary viewer does not give the
                          impression of denigration or disparagement but one where the Defendant&#x27;s
                          product is being self-promoted. Moreover, the intelligence of an ordinary

                          Division Bench in <a href="/doc/49436401/" id="a_33">Dabur India v. Colortek</a> (supra) has pointed out that
                          market forces, nature and quality of the products would ultimately be the
                          deciding factors for a consumer to make a choice. It cannot be ignored that
                          the consumers are cognizant of the fact that advertisements are one sided
                          commentary put out by the manufacturers and sellers for the promotion of
                          their own products and are inherently biased in nature. While deciding a
                          disparagement suit, the overall impact of the commercial has to be
                          considered and in the absence of any derogatory remarks, mere use of some
                          expressions cannot lead to an injunction.
