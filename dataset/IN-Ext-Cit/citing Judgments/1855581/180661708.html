1     read   with       Section    104      of         the    Code       of       Civil
Procedure is arising out of the common order dated
18.2.2019 passed by the learned 5th Additional Senior
Civil Judge, Vadodara in Special Civil Suit No. 322
of 2018. Since common             questions of law and facts are
involved in the present appeals, by treating Appeal
From Order No.72 of 2019 as a lead matter,                               all three
appeals were heard together and are being decided by
the present common judgment and                        order.

defendant is a limited company registered under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_1">Companies Act</a>, which is a wholly
owned     subsidiary               of     Ambalal             Sarabhai        Enterprise
Limited      and        is    claiming          to       be    in   possession                of
various parcels               of land as shown in the map enclosed
with the draft memorandums of understanding                                             dated
29.3.2018 and 30.3.2018 admeasuring                                   1260 sq.mtrs.
and 5442 sq.mtrs of City Survey Nos.921 of Village
Subhanpura.         The           defendant        i.e.        Haryana        Containers
Limited was desirous of selling the above parcels of
land with right, title and interest in the name of
the     company         (wholly          owned           subsidiary)          as      stated
above, in all 6702 sq.mtrs. for their personal need
as well as for funds needed for business                                    and to meet
with various financial commitments. In the year 2012,
the defendant had negotiated and struck the deal with
the plaintiff for selling said parcels of land as a
result      of     this,           series         of      meetings,           telephonic
conversations            and        exchange             of    emails       took        place
between Mr. Kartikeya Sarabhai &amp;                                    Director of the
defendant company, Chavla Shastri and                                     Nimish Vasa,
Escrow     Agent,            on    the     side,              and   the     plaintiff's
partner,      Mr.        Ketan          Shah    which         ultimately           resulted
into    the      deal.            The    total       consideration              was       also
fixed, as stated in the plaint, which is roughly
estated       to        Rs.31,81,73,076/Â­.                     According           to       the
plaintiff, the contracts between the plaintiff and
the defendant stood concluded, terms were finalised
after series of negotiations and the final memorandum
of understanding                  and the agreement to sell exchanged
vide     emails          dated          29.3.2018             and    30.3.2018              and

according to the plaintiff, even after acceptance of
the     final       draft        and       after            conclusion           of       the
transaction, vide email dated 30.3.2018, the contract
came into existence and the payment was also made by
token amount of Rs.2.16 crores                              for the whole suit
property       on        10.1.2018.          It       is     the     case        of       the
plaintiff that throughout, the plaintiff was ready
and willing to perform his part of the contract,
however, despite such readiness, the defendant turned
around from the said concluded contract and to the
utter shock of the plaintiff, the defendant backed
out    from      the      deal    by        way        of    sending          email         on
31.1.2018 at about 5.24 p.m. and returned the amount
of Rs.2.16 crores through RTGS. It has come to the
knowledge that after such conduct having been shown
and though the plaintiff has fully managed the entire
amount      of          consideration             to        be     paid,        it        was
apprehended that to defeat such concluded contract,
the defendant is likely to back out and has entered
into a registered agreement to sell with defendant
No.2    i.e.      Neptune        Infraspace            Pvt.      Ltd      of      Special
Civil Suit No. 323 of 2018, as a result of this, the
present      plaintiff        had       to     file         this    suit        for       the
purpose of seeking specific performance of memorandum
of     understanding/agreement                    to        sell/contract               with
respect to the land in question. This suit filed by
the present plaintiff numbered as Special Civil Suit
No. 323 of 2018 appears to have been presented in the
month of October, 2018.

Civil Suit No.              323 of 2018 is filed against two
defendants namely, Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprise Ltd.
and    Neptune          Infraspace       Pvt.        Ltd.    So      far       as      this

Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprise Ltd., original defendant
No.1 of Special Civil Suit No.                        323 of 2018 in which
the facts are almost similar, but parcel of land is
different. In this suit being Special Civil Suit No.
323 of 2018, the plaintiff i.e. K.S.Infraspace LLP
has entered into transaction with the defendant No.1,
which     is     a      Public    Limited            Company          holding            the
ownership and possession of various pieces of land

various funding commitments. The negotiation for that
took place right from 2012 which, according to the
appellant,         has culminated into a concluded contract
through series of meetings, telephonic conversation
and     exchange of emails with Mr. Kartikeya Sarabhai &amp;
Director of defendant company, Chaula Shastri and Mr.
Nimish Vasa, Escrow Agent on the side of defendant
with plaintiff's partner Mr. Ketan Shah. This portion
of     land     was       agreed        to       be    sold    for        a      total
consideration of Rs.58,26,86,984/Â­. According to the
plaintiff, the terms and conditions were finalized
after series of negotiations and the defendant agreed
to sell the aforesaid (A), (B) and (C) immovable
properties described in the schedule and the same
were     reduced in writing finally which was received
by the plaintiff in terms of revised draft memorandum
of understanding                   and agreement to sell vide emails
dated 29.3.2018 as well as 30.3.2018. According to
the     plaintiff             of    this     suit,     on     30.3.2018,             the
contract       came       into       existence        and    token     amount          of
Rs.2.16 crores was already paid on 10.1.2018.                                   It is
the further case of the plaintiff                           of that suit that
throughout, the plaintiff was ready and willing to
perform his part of the contract and was ready and
willing to pay                 the balance amount for which, an
arrangement was already made but later on, defendant
No.1,     even          after        finalizing        the     memorandum              of
understanding                 as well as agreement to sell, has
backed     out          and    entered       into      a    transaction            with

plaintiff,         the     contract        came          to   be      concluded             on
30.3.2018 or at the best on 31.3.2018,                                        defendant
No.1 disowned the concluded contract and has entered
into fraudulently an agreement with defendant No.2
i.e. Neptune Infra Space Pvt. Ltd. which has given
rise to filing of the aforesaid suit for specific
performance             and also for a declaration against the
defendants.

Order No.74 of 2019 filed by original defendant No.2
against the common order dated 18.2.2019 passed in
Special      Civil        Suit     No.     323       of       2018.        The        facts
emanating from this Appeal From Order are identical
in nature which are mentioned hereinabove in Appeal
From Order No.73 of 2019 and hence, the Court need
not repeat the same but this action of the defendants
have given rise to aforesaid two suits which are
filed       for          seeking       declaration                 and          specific
performance in which it appears from the record that
original       plaintiff         has      filed          an    application                for
injunction below Exh.5                    inter alia seeking relief

also prayed that defendant No.2                               be prevented from
creating any further charge or interest or deal with
aforesaid subject matter of the suit. The injunction
below Exh.5 in Special Civil Suit No.                              323 of 2018 is
almost     similar         to    that      of       Exh.5        application                of

Rule 11(d) for rejection of the plaint essentially on
the ground that land in question is a commercial land
exclusively               utilised        for      commercial             purpose            and
looking to the valuation and the nature of the land,
the    suit         itself           is    hit       by     the       provisions               of
Commercial Courts Act and by referring to <a href="/doc/1455010/" id="a_2">section
2(c)</a>       as    well          as    Section       2(c)(vii)           of      Commercial
Courts Act, a contention is raised that suit itself
is not maintainable since the dispute is arising out
of an agreement related to immovable property used
exclusively in trade or commerce, hence, the plaint
be under Order 7 Rule 11(d) or in the alternative,
the same be returned under Order 7 Rule 10 of CPC so
as    to    present            it    before      the       concerned           Commercial
Court.          These two applications i.e. Exh.5 and Exh.18
appear to have been clubbed at the request of learned
advocates and these applications were heard together
and    decided            by    common       judgment           and    order             dated
18.2.2019 by the learned 5th Additional Senior Civil
Judge, Vadodara whereby the application Exh.18 filed
under Order 7 Rule 11                     as well as Order 7 Rule 10 of
CPC came to be rejected whereas application Exh.5
filed under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 came to be allowed
and    the         defendants'              side          was     ordered            to        be

<p id="p_9">7.    Learned          Senior       Advocate,            Mr.      Mihir            Joshi
appearing with learned advocate, Ms.Megha Jani for
the    appellantÂ­Haryana Containers Ltd. has vehemently
submitted that           no contract has been concluded with
the    original         plaintiffÂ­K.S.Infraspace                   LLP        in      any
manner.        It      has   been    submitted           that      there        is      no
specific      prayer         made    in      the        suit     as      to        which
agreement is sought to be specifically performed. A
bare reading of the cause of the suit itself makes it
clear that alternative reliefs are sought in the suit
which are thoroughly vague and on that count alone,
no specific performance even otherwise be granted. It
has been submitted that there is no specific signed
agreement which can even infer the concluded contract
in favour of the plaintiff. Even the                                  emails and
WhatsApp correspondences, which are reflecting on the

record,       are       also   clearly         missing          the     unequivocal
intention of agreement and in the absence of any
unconditional acceptance, the oral agreement of the
contract cannot be inferred. It has been submitted
that when the case is based upon oral agreement, the
heavy burden is lying on the plaintiff to plead and
to establish even a cogent inference of the oral
contract. It is a settled position of law that no
doubt oral agreement is permissible under the law but
the assertion of acceptance must be unequivocal and
must     be       in      clear       terms           and       simply          because
negotiations have taken place, no inference can be
drawn    of     concluded         contract.           If       only     unequivocal
acceptance is reflecting then only the binding effect
can be attached which is completely missing here on
the basis of which, no relief can be granted. The
learned       Senior       Advocate         by       drawing       attention              to
various       averments        contained             in    the    plaint          itself
precisely from paragraphs 4 and 14                                has contended
that prayer itself is also vague since apparently the
plaintiff       has      miserably        failed          in     showing        even        a
single        memorandum        of       understanding                     which          is
confirmed by the defendants. Mere exchange of several
draft agreements would not constitute remotely even
an     oral     contract.         According               to     learned          Senior
Advocate,         Mr.      Joshi,        the              learned        Judge          has
completely          overlooked         the       material           circumstances
which are apparently emerging from the record and
intention of party to be bound is not reflecting at
all     and    no       written      agreement            has     been        actually
signed. Even the required amount of payment has also

not been effected and there is remotely no material
to    allow     the     parties    to     read         down       the     concluded
contract. When that be so, on the basis of mere draft
which is not signed by any of the parties, the same
cannot take place of a concluded                              contract, as a
result of this, no specific performance is possible
and when that be so, the question of granting interim
relief does not arise.
</p>

<p id="p_10">8.     Mr. Joshi, learned Senior Advocate has further
submitted that various drafts have been exchanged and
the    terms      were    not    finalized             and    looking         at      the
aforesaid       material        changes      which       are       taking          place
from time to time are clearly indicating that                                         the
defendants originally have shown an inclination to
meet with the income tax liability latest by 30th
March, 2018 but the same has not been acted upon at
all.     When       several      memorandums             of       understanding
underwent       material        alteration         and       changes        and       the
contract has not resulted into                           finality nor even
signed, it is not open for the plaintiff to treat
these mere drafts as a concluded contract to come out
for    specific         performance.         Mr.        Joshi      has        further
contended        that     it    was     clearly          mentioned            by      the
defendants to the plaintiff on 30.3.2018 itself and
have returned the amount and suit appears to have
been filed after almost a period of seven months and
this delay has not been explained. This injunction
relief     being        essentially      governed            by    the      rule        of
equity,       the       very    conduct           of    the       plaintiff             is
suggesting that the said relief cannot be granted

particularly            in     a    suit        which       has   been       filed         for
seeking      specific              performance.            Various       exchange            of
emails       and        mere       drafts        are      indicating           that        the
plaintiff's request for injunction on both the counts
i.e. on the count of conduct as well as on the count
of   delay      cannot             be    granted          looking      at      the       well
recognized         principle             of     equity.           Even      the      entire
correspondences which have taken place between the
parties are not suggesting even remote acceptance of
the defendants. The Court without looking at it ought
not to have granted relief in favour of the plaintiff
which has got a far reaching consequences. Mr. Joshi
has further submitted that on the contrary, conduct
is suggesting a serious attempt by the plaintiff to
drag     the       defendants              to      a      situation         where          the
defendants          may            be     embarrassed.             The         averments
contained          in     the       plaint           are,    on     the        contrary,
suggesting that the suit itself is not maintainable
and maintainability of the main proceeding since is a
relevant       consideration,                 by       ignoring      the       same,         no
order of injunction could have been                                 granted.             This
being the position, the order in question deserves to
be set aside.

heavily relied upon the averments made in the plaint

is not exactly in a position to show a clear cause of
action      and         upon     which        he       is    seeking            specific
performance, the relief which has been granted by the
court below is nothing but a clear example of nonÂ­
application         of     mind.        Learned         Senior        Advocate            has
further submitted by referring to series of                                     WhatsApp
communications, which are reflecting from pages 101
to 109 of the paper book compilation, that throughout
these       WhatsApp            correspondences,                  not       a       single
circumstance is emerging that there was a complete
agreement         that         the     plaintiff            has      entered            into
transaction         and        which     has     been       concluded.            On      the
contrary, from the beginning, the plaintiff was aware
about       the         fact     that       in         parallel         proceedings,
negotiations were going on with other party as well
and    as    such,        it    is   not      correct        to     conclude            that
behind the back of the plaintiff, something is done
by the defendants. Various WhatsApp exchanges have
been brought to the notice of this Court including
various MOUs              as well as agreement to sell and by
referring to these documents, it has been submitted
that        these       MOUs     and     agreement          to     sell         are     mere
drafts, not attained finality and underwent series of
changes       which        ultimately            have       not      been         finally
concluded and accepted. It has been submitted that
payment of Rs.2.16 crores which has been stated to
have been given in January, 2018 has no connection
with these transaction                    and it was a mere financial
assistance and as such, learned Senior Advocate                                           has
submitted that here is the case in which no final
conclusive        terms        have      been      agreed         upon      which         may

infer   remotely         a     concluded            contract.       Mr.       Joshi,
learned Senior Advocate has further submitted that on
the contrary, for the income tax purpose and its
liability, the inclination was shown to sell some
part of the lands, which was only for the purpose of
mitigating such need which arose to be cleared by
30.3.2018, latest by April, 2018. The learned Senior
Advocate      has further submitted that this transaction
which defendant No.1 took place with defendant No.2
is an agreement by virtue of which the payments which
have    been      made       have      been         directly      appropriated
towards the income tax liability which are clearly
reflecting from page 474 onwards. By referring to
page 474/11, learned Senior Advocate has submitted
that defendant No.2 has entered into a transaction
which   is     registered        on      31.3.2018          and    towards          the
same, payments have also been realized on 30.3.2018
which amount has been appropriated towards the income
tax liability and this was clearly known from the
beginning      that      this    transaction            is   going        to      take
place    to     meet     with        these          liabilities        and        this
negotiation with other party was also well within the
knowledge of the plaintiff and so it is not that some
under dealing has taken place in any manner. He has
drawn      the         attention            towards          the          WhatsApp
correspondences              precisely              communication               dated
18.12.2017 at 12.06 p.m. as well as at 12.14 p.m. By
referring to further communications of 20.12.2017 at
9.26 a.m. and 25.12.2017 at 10.15 a.m., it has been
conveyed          that    it    was        not       that    only       with        the
plaintiff, the transaction was being negotiated and

even the plaintiff was also aware about the fact that
with original defendant No.2 also, the negotiations
were going on. It has been submitted that                                             these
correspondences of WhatsApp went on which has not
attained any finality                    in any form. On the contrary,
the action of the plaintiff of Special Civil Suit No.
323 of 2018 in approaching the Income Tax Department
directly        without        consent           or        without          consulting
defendant No.1 has got the effect of derailing the
negotiation and ultimately a board meeting took place
which    was      also       well    within          the        knowledge         of      the
plaintiff. It was pointed out that since the same was
within the knowledge of the plaintiff, Ascrow agent
Nimish     Vasa              on     26.3.2018              at    10.27        p.m.        has
indicated that if tighter terms are required for good
execution and if any penalty is to be inflicted upon,
then    also      problem         can    be     discussed.             Now      this        is
indicating that defendant No.1 was not inclined to
conclude the contract and the transaction has never
been     finalized.           It    was         submitted           that         on       the
contrary,        Ascrow       agent       for        some        reason       was       more
inclined rather than original plaintiff who was aware
about the ground reality. Learned Senior Advocate has

29.3.2018 as well as 30.3.2018 are closely read, it
would     indicate           that        there         was        no      unequivocal
acceptance of any nature. On the contrary, it was
other way round. In fact, this episode which took
lace on 30.3.2018 is indicating that atleast from
that day, the plaintiff knew about the fact of nonÂ­
inclination             to   move       any     further           in     respect            of

transaction         and    further        the        same    was       specifically
conveyed      by       returning       even      the        amount       of      Rs.2.16
crores which was by way of personal loan according to
defendant      No.1.           The    sum      and      substance            of      these
correspondences which took place on WhatsApp nowhere
is indicating that any final assertion of acceptance
has taken place from the side of the defendants. On
the contrary,           it reflects that               denial was very much
communicated. It is not understandable as to why for
a pretty long period of seven months after getting
back the amount of Rs.2.16 crores, the plaintiff has
remained silent. This delay which is unexplained is
fatal to the case of the plaintiff and at least for
not getting any interim relief, resultantly,                                             the
order at Exh.5 is not tenable.

<p id="p_12">10. Mr.Mihir            Joshi,       learned          Senior        Advocate             has
further submitted that the huge amount is already
passed on to defendant No.1 by defendant No.2 while
entering into a registered agreement to sell and to
intercept these process of transaction in a situation
like this would clearly has got the serious prejudice
and, therefore,               in the absence of any prima facie
case or balance of convenience, no interim relief
could      have        been    granted.              Mr.Joshi         has        further
submitted that apart from this, here is the case in
which, on one side there is a registered agreement to
sell which has already taken place on 31.3.2018 and
on   the    other         side,      there       is     a      mere          draft         of
agreement      to      sell    and      memorandum           of      understanding
which has not even been signed and additionally, the

amount of Rs.2.16 crores was also returned back which
was not even for this transaction. Hence, if the
balance of equity is to be examined, the same is
leaning towards the holder of registered agreement to
sell than that of the plaintiff, hence, no relief
could have been granted in such a situation. Learned
Senior Advocate           has submitted that even on the basis
of    these    material       facts,         which    are    reflecting              on
record, even specific performance of agreement is not
at all possible and the suit itself appears to be
laconic on cause of action and hence, not tenable. In
such a situation, when the main proceedings are also
not possible to be considered in the light of settled
position of law, the question of grant of interim
relief would not arise, as a result of this, since
the     learned Judge has completely misconstrued the
facts, such perversity emerging is required to be
corrected       by      setting       aside         the    impugned          order.
Learned Senior Advocate has submitted that in any
case, there is no prima facie case in favour of the
plaintiff. The balance of convenience and irreparable
aspects       are      also   not      leaning        in    favour         of      the
plaintiff         and even if assuming everything against
the defendant, then also, the relief can be possible
to be compensated in terms of money. The question of
granting interim relief in a situation like this is
nothing but an erroneous exercise of jurisdiction.
Learned Senior Advocate has submitted that as the
registered agreement to sell has already taken place
and the sizable amount has already been passed on, no
injunction can be granted and it is settled position

of law that in all cases, the specific performance
decree        cannot        be     passed           keeping           in       view         the
parameters of <a href="/doc/1009821/" id="a_3">section 20</a> of the Specific Relief Act.
It is a settled position of law propounded by series
of decisions that, to grant a decree for specific
performance, several circumstances are to be analysed
and    even        in       case    where          there        is      a     registered
agreement, then also, if there is a stiff price rise,
there is a change in the background of material facts
and   consistent            readiness           and      willingness              are       the
circumstances               by     virtue               of     which,             specific
performance may not be granted and by giving lump sum
compensation also, the proceedings can be terminated.
So, here is the case in which there is a reliance of
a mere unsigned agreement to sell which is merely a
draft and the terms have been altered from time to
time which also have not attained any finality and
crucial thing is that even till 30.3.2018, there is
no    unequivocal           acceptance            made        by     the      plaintiff.
Hence,       in      such    a     situation,                grant     of       equitable
relief, according to Mr. Joshi, is out of place.

both the persons and Mr. Nimish Vasa, the person
having a link between the plaintiff and the defendant
and who was an interested person.                             It has further
been contended that the transaction was to be done
for    the     purpose          of     business         and      meeting            with
liability      regarding         income         tax    assessment           and       the
last date was 30.3.2018 since 31.3.2018 was a holiday
being Saturday. The chronology of events according to
Mr.    Thakore,         learned       Senior          Advocate        is      clearly
indicating that there is neither any agreement nor
any    concluded         contract          came       into     existence.               To
substantiate this, learned Senior Advocate has drawn
attention       to      WhatsApp        correspondence             of       material
dates along with the time and has submitted as if it
is the trial of the suit and thereby contended that
since there is no concluded contract, there is no
question      of       granting      any      injunction.          It      has      been
submitted that WhatsApp talks/messages reflecting on
page 104 of paper book compilation more particularly
on 26.3.2018 at 1.29 p.m. and the messages reflecting
on page 106 on 30.3.2018 would clearly indicate that
there is no contract came into existence with the
plaintiff. Furthermore, as per the transaction which
took   place       by     his     client        with     the      appellant,              a
sizable amount of Rs.34.00 crores appears to have
been paid by defendant No.2 and this fact is very
much reflecting on page 474/Z. By referring to pages
474/U and 474/J, a submission is made by Mr. Thakore,
learned Senior Advocate                     that this transaction is
essentially meant for clearing income tax assessment

as    the    deadline          was     30.3.2018           and    this        being         a
commercial transaction, one who pays earlier in point
of time can proceed since there was no concluded
contract with the original plaintiff                             in any form and
as such, the grant of injunction would be nothing but
serious prejudice to his client. It has further been
canvassed that from the beginning, the plaintiff was
aware    about          the    fact     that        this    dealing         with        M/s
Neptune is going on in parallel and even a public
notice      was         also    given,              still,       however,           after
unreasonable period of time, the suit came to be
filed particularly after the sizable amount was paid
by defendant No.2                and, therefore, this unexplained
delay in approaching the Court would disentitle the
plaintiff from securing any equitable relief. It has
further      been        contended         that        apart     from       delay         in
approaching         the        court     by     the     original          plaintiff,
there also appears to be no prima facie case at all
and balance             of convenience is also not in favour of
the plaintiff. In fact, if the balance of equity is
to be evaluated, the same would lien in favour of his
client rather than the plaintiff. To strengthen his
submission, learned Senior Advocate has relied upon
the     decision          delivered            by      this      Court          (Coram:
H.K.Gokhale,J.) which is reported in 1996(3) GLR page
536     and the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court which is
reported in (2015)15 SCC page 1 and by referring to
paragraphs 37 and 39 of this judgment, learned Senior
Advocate has submitted that on account of delay and
laches as well, the plaintiff is not entitled to
equitable         relief.         Additionally,                learned            Senior

Advocate, Mr. Thakore has also relied upon paragraph
13 of the written statement and has reiterated his
submissions on the issue of no concluded contract.
Learned Senior Advocate, Mr. Thakore has submitted
that simply because there might be an intention to
enter into the contract, eventually, if it does not
exist, no interference can be drawn about contract
being    concluded.         He     has       relied      upon         yet        other
decisions reported in (1997)3 SCC page 1 in the case
of K.S.Vidyanadam and others Vs. Vairavan,                                   (1990)3
SCC page 1 in the case of Mayawanti Vs. Kaushalya
Devi and (2016) SCC Online Bombay 6784 in the case of
Rohit A. Kapadia Vs. Perviz J. Modi and by referring
to several paragraphs from those judgments, it has
been submitted that in the absence of existence of
any concluded contract,                     there is no question of
granting any interim relief and the                             learned Judge
has materially erred in exercising jurisdiction. By
referring       to      rojkam,    learned           Senior      Advocate            has
submitted that actually, Exh.5 application has never
been heard.             What has been heard is an application
filed under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of CPC                         and, therefore
also, the impugned order which has been passed is in
complete      disregard       to      the          principles        of      natural
justice and hence, the same is required to be quashed
and set aside on this count alone.

<p id="p_15">12. In counter to this submission, learned Senior
Advocate, Mr. Deven Parikh appearing on behalf of the
plaintiff has submitted that                        systematic steps have

contract and then at the                       last moment, returning the
amount     and      entering         into        transaction         with           other
party would be nothing but a clear conduct on account
of which only the injunction has to be given.                                           The
illÂ­intention                on the part the defendant was very
much clear from the WhatsApp correspondences and can
easily infer an intention and the                                learned Judge,
after overall appreciation of material, was pleased
to grant an interim order which is just and proper.
If the steps could be perused closely, it would make
it clear that the contract did take place but a mere
formality of signing was left out and at this interim
stage of the proceedings, no merit could be examined
as it would be an adjudication of the main suit. At
this stage, the Court has to evaluate as to whether
there exists any prima facie case and there exists
any apprehension as to whether the subject matter of
the suit is to be preserved or not. This                                having been
opined     clearly           by   the      court        below,    the       just        and
proper order is passed, according to learned Senior
Advocate,         Mr.        Deven       Parikh           since        the        entire
demonstration from the WhatsApp correspondences and
the   assertion          of       the     plaint        prima     facie         suggest
existence of oral contract at least                              and, therefore,
whether      on     the       basis       of      this    material,           suit        is
maintainable            or    not    and       relief      as    prayed         for       is
possible to be granted or not is a matter of trial of
the suit and that has to be allowed to go on without
any hindrance and                   minute examination is to take
place during the course of trial and as a normal
rule,    subject         matter         of     the      suit    deserves          to      be

protected          and,       therefore,             rightly     the       order         of
injunction was passed. Learned Senior Advocate, Mr.
Parikh has further submitted that from the overall
material, if we look at a just prior circumstance to
the final draft of memorandum of understanding, then
there appears to be a clear existence of the oral
contract and this being a prima facie material which
is    emerging         from    the     record,            the   discretion             has
rightly been exercised. Learned Senior Advocate has
further     submitted          that      the         plaintiff       was       and       is
willing to perform its part of contract                                   even till
last day,       but surreptitiously behind the back of the
plaintiff, this contract in the form of agreement to
sale has        been entered into. Last page of WhatsApp
correspondence            would        clearly             indicate          that          a
systematic design is executed                        against the plaintiff.
All these triable issues are to be adjudicated upon
during the course of trial. Simply because some more
amount is paid by another person and agreement to
sale is registered, that would not disentitle the
plaintiff to seek a remedy of injunction. On the
contrary, it is a settled position of law that mere
agreement       to     sale     would        not      confer       any       absolute
right, as a result of this, no interference deserves
to be made. Apart from this, a close reading of the
material would also indicate that as on 31st March,
2018, the plaintiff was not aware about denial. On
the contrary, till last moment, the plaintiff was
kept under an impression that transaction is to take
place with        the plaintiff. So, even independently, it
has    been     established           that            a    denial       was        never

        C/AO/72/2019                                                 CAV ORDER



communicated          or   conveyed            to      the     plaintiff.           Their
withdrawal       either       on       30th      or     31st    March       from        the
contract is not supported by any valid material and
this being highly                disputed and triable one, the
learned      Judge         has          justifiably             exercised               the
discretion. It is a settled position of law that
whenever     a        surrounding           circumstance            is      emerging,
mere nonÂ­signing may not affect the legitimate right
at this stage of the proceedings. Mr. Parikh, learned
Senior Advocate has further pointed out the conduct
of the defendant and submitted that the stand taken
by the defendant is nothing but a concoction. There
is a clear conflict between their stand which is
reflecting from the written statement on pages 208
and 209 of paper book compilation and                                     under the
provisions of <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_4">Contract Act</a>, there is no prohibition
or embargo about entering into oral contract. So,
whether in the absence of any signature, transaction
can   be   treated         as      a      contract           having      come         into
existence or not is a matter of law and fact which
will have to be examined during the course of trial.
To substantiate his stand, as a part of reiteration,
learned Senior Advocate has drawn the attention to
various contracts of MOUs and then agreement to sale,
copies whereof are given. So much so that map has
also been attached which is a further step in favour
of transaction with the plaintiff                               and, therefore,
the question of reverting back                          was out of place for
the defendant. Not only the terms were modulated and
figures    were        also     altered,            but      even   some        further
details which are material in nature have also been

furnished which is nothing but a clear step on the
part      of        the     respondentÂ­defendant                     about            the
transaction in question. It is completely incorrect
to state that the plaintiff has lost interest during
any portion of time. On the contrary, the amount was
also kept ready which can meet with the consideration
of     the     contract.               When         these    situations               are
prevailing,         it    is     only     then        the    final        draft         of
agreement to sale came to be exchanged and now to
back out from that is a conduct which is                               thoroughly
uncalled for and that is the reason why on such part
only, the matter requires not to be entertained and
the appeals deserve to be dismissed.

<p id="p_16">13. Mr.Deven            Parikh,        learned        Senior      Advocate            has
drawn attention towards paragraphs 115 to 124 of the
paper book compilation and submitted                           that        there is
a clear nexus of transaction about the land with the
plaintiff of Rs.2.16 crores and this was not in any
form regarded as a personal loan but it was all the
way    for     transaction         in    question           and   that        is      the
reason why immediately after entering into agreement
to sale with the other defendant, the amount has been
returned       back       through       RTGS.        Mr.     Parikh,          learned
Senior       Advocate       has     further          submitted          that        this
defendant        is      armed    with        a     legal     team        which         is
systematically out to go on sending various drafts
and    by      referring          to     page        117     of      paper          book
compilation, it is submitted that exchange of final
draft and agreement to sale through Legal Department
is a final stage of entering into transaction                                         and

sending of final draft of agreement to sale is a
concluded step on the part of the defendant which
would easily infer a clear intention to conclude the
contract. It is submitted that as soon the plaintiff
came    to    know        about      the    fact        regarding          return         of
amount       of     Rs.2.16         crores,           immediate      protest            was
lodged and as on 3.4.2018, sufficient balance was
also     maintained           in     the     account       with        a      view        to
complete          their       part     of      the       contract              by       the
plaintiff.              The story which has been tried to be
created        that amount of Rs.2.16 crores was in the
form of personal loan and not about the transaction,
it may be noted that this stand is nothing but a
clear    concoction            and     as     such,       when      this        be      the
situation on record, the                      learned trial Judge                       has
rightly exercised the discretion. According to him,
as WhatsApp exchanges took place with Ketan and not
with the plaintiff, it cannot be inferred to have
been communicated to the plaintiff and in that view
of     the    matter,         the     injunction           has     been         rightly
ordered.       It       has    further        been       contended          that            a
defense has been              raised that by any means they have
to meet with income tax liability, but then while
entering          into     transaction           in      the     form        of       mere
agreement to sale, full amount of income tax is not
yet paid          and, therefore, this story of income tax
appears to have been got up just with a view to see
that     no       injunction          be      made        available            to       the
plaintiff.               According to learned Senior Advocate,
Mr.Parikh,          there      is     a     specific        pleading            of      the
plaintiff with regard to an oral contract which can

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                 Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 03:31:10 IST 2019</span>

be easily culled out from material on record and the
plaintiff is able to analyse stagewise step which
would infer existence of an oral contract. It has
further been contended that here is the case in which
whether      there      exists     the       oral    contract         or       the
concluded contract is a matter of trial but, all
details about various drafts and final exchange of
ATS    and      memorandum        of       understanding           are         the
circumstances          which   require           adjudication.         Even        a
reference is made that once upon a time, stringent
terms were being suggested even after dissolution of
the company           but till the final draft, there was a
complete adÂ­idem between the parties. So, under these
systematic steps, the signing of an agreement has
remained merely as a formality and nothing beyond
that. It is not required that in every injunction,
there must be a written contract. On the contrary,
MMS on page 108 dated 31.3.2018 at 9.11 a.m. has
indicated that confirmation was just worked out on
the previous day          and, therefore, the story which has
been put up that on 30.3.2018, the plaintiff was
informed about nonÂ­entering into or nonÂ­continuing
with   the     transaction             and,       therefore      also,         the
injunction has rightly been given.                       Mr.Parikh has
further submitted that in fact Exh.5 application came
to be decided after giving adequate opportunity and
they have been heard by the                  learned trial Judge. On
the contrary, there is a clear reference in paragraph
4 that both the learned advocates have argued and
thereafter has mentioned in paragraph 7 on page 16
and, therefore,          question of nonÂ­hearing of Exh.5 is

also nothing but an illusion                          in the mind of the
defendant. Mr. Deven Parikh, learned Senior Advocate
has     then     relied      upon        the        judgment     delivered              by
Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.S.Kureshi                            which is part of
paper       book        compilation       on        page    70     and        another
decision which is reported in AIR 1996(8) SC 1028 in
the    case     of      Kollipara      Vs      T.     Aswatha       Narayana            to
suggest that case is not made out by the defendant.
On the contrary, learned Senior Advocate has relied
upon other decisions reported in (2017)9 SCC 622 in
the    case     of       Nadiminti       Suryanarayan            Murthy         (dead)
through Legal Representatives Vs. Kothurthi Krishna
Bhaskara Rao and others, AIR 1990 SC and (2016) SCC
Online Bombay 6784 in the case of Rohit A. Kapadia
Vs. Perviz J. Modi. Yet another decision which has
been relied upon is reported in AIR 2006 SC page 87
and    by    referring       to   the       judgment        of      Hon'ble           Mr.
Justice A.S.Kureshi, a contention is raised that a
case is made out by the plaintiff. Lastly, learned
Senior Advocate has submitted that no case is made
out by the defendant as still the plaintiff is ready
and willing to deposit an amount of Rs.2.16 crores
before the registry of this Court or before the Court
concerned to preserve the interest in the subject
matter of the suit and keeping in view the interest
of the defendant as well within a reasonable time
that     may       be     fixed     by      this       Court.        With         these
submissions, learned Senior Advocate has requested
the Court to dismiss the Appeals From order.

From Order No.74 of 2019 is concerned, with respect
to     another          party     namely,          M/s     Haryana         Containers
Limited, learned Senior Advocate, Mr. Mehul S Shah
has    submitted          that       there         is     a    clear       difference
between prima facie case and prima facie title. Here
is    the   case         in     which      by     execution        of      registered
agreement to sale, a right is created in favour of
the defendant which would be thwarted by grant of
injunction. On the contrary, this prima facie case
and    prima      facie         title      are      distinct       is      very        much
reflecting from a decision reported in AIR 1993 SC

</p><p id="p_19">15. Mr.Mehul S. Shah, learned Senior Advocate has
further contended that no                       doubt the oral contract is
enforceable but the same is to be inferred keeping in
view certain provisions of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_5">Contract Act</a> and for
that purpose, learned Senior Advocate has relied upon
<a href="/doc/420719/" id="a_6">sections 2(a)</a>, <a href="/doc/1845680/" id="a_7">2(b)</a> and <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_8">2(e)</a> of the Contract Act,
1872 for clarifying the situation. It has further
been    submitted             that   a     stand         has    been     taken         that
cancellation of transaction has taken place but then
cancellation itself is suggesting preÂ­existence of a
contract.        Learned         Senior          Advocate        has       vehemently
contended        that         what   would          be    the    effect          if      the
agreement       is       not     signed         and      for    that     purpose,            a
reference is made to a decision which is reported in
(2009)2 SCC 582 and by referring to <a href="/doc/1805300/" id="a_9">section 10</a> of the
Specific      Relief          Act    and      the       explanation          contained
therein, it has been submitted that normal rule is to
decree a specific performance and here is the case in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                        Page 29 of 74</span>

which        at this stage whether to pass a decree or not
is yet to be decided                    and, therefore, at this stage
of the proceedings, when equitable relief is being
sought, the balance has to be struck between both the
sides.        It     has      been      submitted        that       an      amount          of
Rs.2.16         crores        was    throughout         treated          as     part        of
earnest money then why suddenly the same is to be
canvassed as a personal loan. In fact, it appears
that    having             realised     a    situation        of      embarrassment
being created to somehow come out from the rigors of
contract, a story is put up that amount of Rs.2.16
crores was a personal loan and nothing beyond that
and additionally, the story is created that only with
a view to clear the income tax dues, this transaction
of     an      urgent         nature        is    created.         In      fact,          the
plaintiff has maintained a sizable amount of balance
in the account for the transaction itself and no
prudent person would keep such a huge amount separate
without           any        just       reason.         The     readiness                 and
willingness are continued throughout and there was a
sufficient            financial         capacity         to     meet          with        the
consideration.               On   the       contrary,     the        last       talk        is
clearly suggesting that there was no waiver by the
plaintiff and for that purpose, a reference is made
to a decision which is reported in AIR 2017 SC 3608
in the case of Dev Prakash Vs. Indra. Yet another
decision which is referred to and relied upon is
reported in 1983 GLH 538 in the case of Ibrahim Shah

reported in AIR 2005 SC 104 in the case of Maharwal

certain      other           decisions        have     also    been        cited         to

<p id="p_20">16. Having heard the learned advocates appearing for
the parties and having gone through the cases                                            in
detail, certain circumstances are not possible to be
ignored while taking ultimate view in the present
cases. First of all, it is a settled position of law
propounded by the Apex Court in a decision in case of

<p id="p_21">17. A further proposition of law which has been laid
down by Hon'ble Apex Court is reported in (2004) 8
SCC     488    in       the      case      of      Maharwal        Khewaji            Trust
(Regd.), Faridkot Vs. Baldev Dass as also reported in
AIR 2005 SC 104, wherein it has been held that as a
normal rule, status quo during the pendency of the
proceedings has to be preserved unless extraÂ­ordinary
circumstance            is      emerging         and          simply    because           the
litigation will take some more time, same would not
be treated as an exceptional circumstance to alter
the    status       quo.        Keeping       the        aforesaid        proposition
laid    down            by    Hon'ble       Apex         Court,    this       Court         is
examining       the          submissions         in      coÂ­relation          with        the
record as to whether any deviation is possible from
the aforesaid proposition and for that purpose, few
circumstances which are emerging from the record are
not possible to be ignored by the Court.

<p id="p_22">18. From the paper book which was filed in Appeal
From     Order          No.73     of     2019,          both      the     sides         have

the defendant has accepted the revised draft as a

sent with email dated 30.3.2018                                 was the concluded

transaction in question since the sale and purchase
were orally agreed at the relevant point of time and
then   final       drafts        with     certain      modifications               have
been exchanged. It has also been asserted in the
plaint that after acceptance of payment towards part
sale consideration, the defendant                           has provided all
the copies of title deeds and documents as well as
title clearance report of A.C.Damani and company and
then several meetings and deliberations have taken
place. It was specifically averred in the plaint that
the plaintiff was always ready and willing to pay the
balance amount of Rs.27.84 crores as stipulated in
memorandum        of     understanding              dated     30.3.2018,             but
despite memorandum of understanding, the defendant
has cleverly sidelined from the contract and then
through      RTGS,        unilaterally,             without      communicating
denial, returned the amount. It has specifically been
averred in paragraph 9 that on 30.3.2018,                                at around
10.39.54 a.m. IST, one more email was received from
Legal Department of defendant No.1 company stating
that final drafts of MOU and ATS                         are attached and
immediately within few minutes, on that very day, at
10.51.25 a.m. IST, the Legal Department also sent the
land     measurement            summary      along      with       the       payment
schedule which demonstrates conclusively that now the
document is to be executed as a part of formality. It
is also specifically asserted on oath in paragraph
No.9.4     that         all    essential      ingredients           of     a     valid
acceptance by defendant No.1 have clearly suggested
vigil and awareness of various terms and conditions

of MOU and ATS                 and, therefore, a specific stand is
taken to get the relief that even in the absence of
signed agreement of MOU and acceptance, inference of
contract can be drawn from the conduct and exchange
of series of documents and correspondences. It has
further been mentioned that the plaintiff sent an
email on 31.3.2018 at about 11.03.44 a.m. IST stating
the approval of MOUs and ATS and has shown specific
readiness and willingness and then surprisingly, the
defendant backed out from the deed by merely sending
email at about 5.24 p.m. on 31.3.2018 and returned
the amount of Rs.2.16 crores through RTGS by treating
it    as     a    short        term   finance,         though          there        was       a
specific assertion that amount of Rs.2.16 crores was
a    part     of     consideration            for      the       land     of      Ambalal
Sarabhai Enterprise Ltd. and Haryana Containers Ltd.
It has further been specifically averred that                                             the
defendant           company          has     passed          a     resolution               on
26.3.2018 but even after that, exchange of draft of
MOU    and        ATS took place which suggests a fabricated
and concoction on the part of the defendant and by
alleging          that         the    defendant          has        disowned              the
concluded          contract          and    hence,       relief           prayed          for
deserves          to      be     granted.          There         are       few        other
circumstances narrated by way of specific assertion
but in substance, this stand is taken in the plaint.

<p id="p_23">19. Now to substantiate this, series of documents
have been produced on record and since the same are
in bulk, only most relevant documents at this stage
are to be referred to.

which is reflecting from WhatsApp communication is
rather suggesting that till 30.3.2018, the plaintiff
was kept under an impression that they are about to
execute the document.         A perusal of few WhatsApp
exchanges    would   reveal   the     intent   and    conduct           of
parties to the proceedings and as such, the same are

   earliest convenience and FINALIZE long PENDING
   matter of my pending dues. Also your comments
   about commission for D2 is not really business
   like and morally correct but in case you have
   determined to sell it to Krupesh, it really
   then doesn't matter. Only if you still wish to
   continue discussion with Ketan and explore to
   get best possible rate and terms, I insist that
   we meet and clear the issue immediately to
   avoid further misunderstanding in this matter.
   If you are still open to talk to him please let

   with you and Mohal ( if you wish to directly
   call him and fix the meeting, please go ahead

29/03/2018, 5:54 pm Â­ Kartikeya Sarabhai: MOU
was sent in the morning, saying 2 or 3 changes
may come. We had asked that he should read it
and comment. Now both MOU.s sent.

cannot be done. You can't be this dishonest
about your comments.

<p id="p_51">30/03/2018, 5:52 pm Â­ Nimish Vasa: I don't want
to face criminal case of misguiding and
cheating some one deliberately. I am blaming
this situation only on Kartikeya bhai that he
knew all along and plotted for this harming
everyone. Ketan is saying what ever you need to
pay to IT I will pay and will adjust in your
last installment so what is the excuse now

30/03/2018, 5:53 pm Â­ Nimish Vasa: You have to
come out of this situation which is self

<p id="p_54">30/03/2018, 7:18 pm Â­ Nimish Vasa: Kartikey
bhai, as late as this morning you are talking
to me and making him understand that EMI will
kick in. He has also agreed I am told that any
extra amount that you need to pay for Income
tax he will manage and pay and will adjust from
your last installment. I really fail to
understand where has he damaged his credibility
between this morning and today evening unless
all along you have been planning to do this and
use me as a stupid accessory to this kind of
let down. I can't believe it

30/03/2018, 7:18 pm Â­ Kartikeya Sarabhai: I
don't think you should be there. He was not
leaving the office. I said I will see him
tomorrow. However wrong the decision is in your

ahead with the deal with another party.</p><pre id="pre_3">

bhai, As a well wisher and also as an affected
party , I warn you not to take a step which
will triger a strong back lash, will geopardise
the land completely and will also need to face
legal challenge of cheating and fraud by
deliberately misleading. I think this is
infinitely   more  damaging   to  your   family
reputation and your company's only remaining
assets. Knowing krupeshbhai you should judge
that actually if some prevention order against
land deal is obtained how seriously he will
stand by you ??
</p>
<p id="p_56">30/03/2018, 7:49 pm Â­ Nimish Vasa: And then
what will happen to your cash flow requirements
once land is blocked in legal issues ?
</p>
<p id="p_57">30/03/2018, 8:15 pm Â­ Nimish Vasa: Please don't
forget that we have taken token money of 2 Cr
almost several months ago. There onwards there
are at least several drafts of MOU exchanged
between us, many meetings happened between us
to finalize all terms and condition. As late as
this morning you have sent him corrected draft
asking more conditions to be agreed Which he
has. Even your IT related demand he has agreed
to help you out with extra payment if you need
and he is graceful enough to say that he will
adjust this extra payment only in your last
installment there by not disturbing your cash
flow. I have exchanged several emails, SMS,
WhatsApp messages with him over last few months
confirming all these that everything was
decided and agreed upon in my presence and I am
party to this commitment. Now what can I say if
he puts me on stand and asked me to confirm
that deal was already finalized and payment has
started. I think I am already feeling worried
about myself facing consequences , you may be
used to such behaviour of not honouring your
commitment, but I am truly not comfortable with
such an idea and in my dictionary it amounts to
cheating,and fraud. I plead you not to go this
route or it will destroy everything that is

30/03/2018, 9:32 pm Â­ Nimish Vasa: It is just
occurring to me, are you doing it for more
money ?? I really don't see any reason for such
a behaviour unless you have some compulsion or
temptation. I am also now wondering that as per
your nature such a large and complicated deal
could not have been concluded in last one or
two days with other party, so maybe all along
keeping us in dark you were talking to him for
better price and better terms and pretending
with us till you conclude !!! How can you be
such a back stabbing person and as late as this
morning you are talking to me as if I should
reconfirm to you that he is accepting all your
revised terms. And when you see that he has
agreed to all your terms, you are now coming up
with   you    and   board   (!!??)    have   no
confidence ??? Kindly reconsider your decision
or else all of us will face unfortunate
consequences. Good Night.

to say that this is really not an excuse to
break your commitment to me especially after I
have put in several months and till last moment
I have got Ketan to accept every change in
condition that you penciled in. I see no reason
for your saying that decision deal went to
other party. There's no other party once deal
was made and saying that yesterday you were
compelled to break your words to Ketan bhai and
especially me is frankly not acceptable. If you
want more money I can discuss and ask Ketan

bhai to meet your expectations. But simply
saying sorry and giving an excuse that till
Last night we were working to do it with you is
a lie. I am really feeling used, raped and
ethically violated and feel that you have used
me to increase price of your land (earlier also
same thing happened) and all along you were in
dialogue with this party. It is ethically wrong
especially after making full commitment to
break it without any reason. However you have
not shown the courtsey of either taking me in
confidence or honouring the commitment given
keeping me in between Which is a very painful
and disturbing matter. You have all along used
me for your benifit as and when you wanted,
increasing value of your land from 1100 to 1600
, not paying 50 Rs for this land when
commitment was to pay if you get price more
than 1450, Taking my personal guarantee to
Sandesh when he refused to give you money just
on your papers and your guarantee, Not paying
me my dues for 6 years and refusing to pay
interest for delay when written note was given
in 2012, you conveniently kept it with you not
paying, this time also you clearly had an
option to go to other party but pushing with my
help for Ketan to pay you your price and terms,
wasting three months of every one in paper
preparation while all along you negotiated
higher price with other party keeping us in
dark using our name to get better terms. These
are all unethical behaviour and not honouring
your name and family. Now exposing all of us to
unnecessary legal hassle for small benifit
Which any way I can match if you give me a
transparent chance.

continued to be sent even through Kartikeya Sarabhai.
There appears to be a clear indication to Kartikeya
Sarabhai by Nimish Vasa about the admitted act which
may result into serious consequences but then there
is also a clear reference in a talk dated 30.3.2018
at about 5.52 p.m. specifically conveying that Ketan
i.e. the plaintiff has shown readiness to pay even
the income tax dues and the defendant was not left
with     any       excuse       thereafter.           The      next         material
circumstance reflecting from WhatsApp dated 30.3.2018
at 7.12 p.m. is that it was conveyed to the plaintiff
to remain present at 10 a.m. at Baroda but was asking
where. Thereafter, one more material                                circumstance
is getting reflecting from WhatsApp dated 30.3.2018
at   7.18      p.m.       Though       this     talk      is    suggesting              an
indirect       indication          but    then       there       was      no      other
reason      why         the     last     MOU/ATS            is       sent.          Even
confirmation about the terms was also indicated which
is reflecting from Entry dated 30.3.2018                                     at 9.32
p.m. and then there is a reference that decision
finally went              the way it did but this itself is
clearly suggesting that till previous evening, the
working out was taking place. So, these exchanges are
clearly reflecting that after accepting an amount of
Rs.2.16 crores and utilising the same for several
months,       it        seems    that     ultimately           the        defendant
surreptitiously backed out.
</p>

<p id="p_65">22. An attempt is made by the defendant to state
that this amount of Rs.2.16 crores was an amount
taken     as       a     personal        loan       and    not       by      way        of

consideration in part towards the transaction. Now
for that purpose, if this is to be examined prima
facie with page 115, a chart which is attached, it is
reflecting        an   overall        figure          including          Rs.2.16
crores.        This    chart     is      indicating           that       overall
figures tallied with the main consideration as on
30.3.2018 which is reflecting a left out amount of
Rs.27.84     crores.      Now   if     these          figures    are       to      be
tallied with the figures which are mentioned in the
final draft of MOU, they appear to be matching with
the amount shown in the chart on page 116. If the
last column on page 116 is to be compared with the
last modified MOU precisely reflecting on page 125 in
2nd paragraph, it would suggest that there is a clear
inference about Rs.2.16 crores, may be by way of part
sale   consideration        towards             the     transaction            and,
therefore, the story put up of personal finance is
not lending support from the material on record.
</p>

<p id="p_66">23. On the contrary, the final draft which has been
submitted including agreement to sale reflecting on
page 117 appears to have been sent on 30.3.2018 at
10.39.54 a.m. IST. Now if this is to be compared with
a   WhatsApp      entry   dated      30.3.2018          and     the      entries
thereafter, it would suggest that there appears to be
unilateral withdrawal without communication to the
plaintiff. Therefore, keeping the plaintiff                             in dark
till last moment clearly reflects a conduct which
requires to be examined at an appropriate stage of
the suit. This is more particularly in view of the
fact that in a general meeting of the company,                               it is

being          conveyed that decision is taken and some
resolution is passed and even after that, exchange of
documents did take place. So, from this conduct, it
can     be    easily        inferred           that          there     was         a    clear
deviation from the terms which till last moment were
in existence.
</p>

<p id="p_67">24. In        the       context    of       aforesaid           circumstances,                  a
further email reflecting on page 162 dated 31.3.2018
at 7.24.47 p.m. is a prompt reaction on the part of
the    plaintiff          indicating            and          protesting                against
unilateral cancellation and then return of amount of
Rs.2.16 crores is indicated to have been received as
a shortÂ­term finance which is coming up for the first
time.    Now        as    against         that,          there       was       a       balance
certificate             issued     by      Oriental            Bank       of       Commerce
clearing suggesting that as on 31.3.2018, a credit
balance of Rs.29,66,11,326/Â­ was maintained by the
plaintiff which is a left out consideration to be
payable pursuant to the transaction. This certificate
is also part of the record.

reflecting that out of 2777 sq.mtrs. of land from
Survey No.383/1, land admeasuring 2500 sq.mtrs.                                               in

total land admeasuring 13,000 sq.feet but then there
is no explanation coming forthwith as to why even
after this resolution and the decision the MOU, the
land measurement and the agreement to sale have been
continued      to       be    sent       by     Legal       Department            of      the
defendant. From the contents of written statement,
there is a flat denial about receipt of an amount of
Rs.2.16      crores          by    way     of      sale         consideration             and

confirmation           about       proposed           transaction             from        the
plaintiff and then it was conveyed in paragraph 24
that    in        that       situation,              on     30.3.2018            in       the
afternoon,         the       plaintiff           company          was       personally

It is also reflecting that Board of Directors                                             put
their   foot       down       after      appreciating              everything             and
decided not to travel in the direction of proposed
MOU with the plaintiff. But then resolution of the
Board     of      Directors             was      of        previous          date         and
subsequently,           the       drafts      of      MOU        as     well      as      ATS
continued to be sent. A clear stand is taken that the
plaintiff         was     incapable             of     clearing          income           tax
liability of defendant No.1 but then this is clearly
in contrast with the balance certificate which has
been issued by Oriental Bank of Commerce. This stand
of the defendant is to be examined from the documents
which   are       attached         in    the         paper       book     compilation

precisely       page         474/U     dated          3.4.2018         wherein          M/s
Neptune     Infraspace          Pvt.       Ltd.       has       paid       the    amount
towards the assessment of income tax                                  on behalf of
the defendant. All these payments are of 30.3.2018
totaling to around Rs.11,78,10,000/Â­. By that time,
there     was      already       a     balance             available        with        the
plaintiff to meet with even much more amount than
what has been paid by M/s Neptune Infraspace Pvt.
Ltd.    Therefore,            prima      facie        stand        taken         by     the
defendant deserves to be examined at length at the
time of trial. Prima facie maintaining balance is in
direction of readiness and willingness which will be
examined        during        trial.        These          documents         and        the
payment     schedule          are     indicating            that      all     payments
have been made on 30.3.2018                            wherein during that
period, the plaintiff was already having a balance
available       on      hand          and,       therefore,            prima          facie
inability       of      the     plaintiff             as    contended            by     the
defendant        is not possible to be accepted. Further,
there is a           conduct on the part of the defendant on
one hand to pass a resolution to proceed ahead with
M/s Neptune and then there is no other corresponding
explanation available on record as to for what reason
thereafter the drafts of MOUs and ATS were exchanged
so   much     so       that    land       measurement            has       also       been
communicated. This conduct appears to be questionable
at this stage which requires detailed adjudication.
Further,        if     the     figures          contained             in    the       last
exchange     of        MOU     and      ATS      are       to    be    tallied          and

version    and        the    consideration        of    transaction             and
additionally, the plaintiff was very much armed with
a total consideration amount on hand and as such,
prima facie, readiness and willingness is also not in
question reflecting at this stage.
</p>

<p id="p_69">26. In the context of the aforesaid circumstances,
if the version of WhatsApp to be examined as compared
with   other     documentary        material        attached        with        the
paper book, it would suggest that till last moment,
undisputedly,          the     plaintiff         was    kept       under          an
impression that their terms are to be agreed and
formality       of         execution      is      awaiting.         A       selfÂ­
contradictory stand appears to have been taken on one
hand that in the meeting of Board of Directors, a
decision is taken to proceed ahead with plaintiff
whereas      undisputedly           talks         are    emerging               and
reflecting that till previous evening, they continued
to deliberate. Now in the aforesaid situation, which
is prevailing, whether this appears to be an oral
contract or a concluded contract or any remote right
is emerging in favour of the plaintiff to seek an
equitable relief are the questions to be examined at
the stage of trial, in the considered opinion of this
Court. Therefore, it is not an open and shut case
where the moment the agreement to sale took place and
some   amount         is     accepted      from     other      party,           the
contract which was in process of getting materialized
would evaporate. At least at this stage, with no
certainty,       a     clear    conclusion        is    possible          to      be
arrived at. It is further reflecting from record and

        C/AO/72/2019                                              CAV ORDER



the conduct of the defendant that a projection is
given that transaction is taking place with a view to
mitigate the total amount of income tax but the same
appears to be not the conclusion at this stage. The
measurement which is reflecting in the agreement to
sale which has taken place with M/s Neptune is also a
matter of concern and examination and further, the
amount of Rs.2.16 crores is paid by way of token
payment towards transaction or not is also a matter
of   trial,     since       the   said       amount     was       undisputedly
accepted in January, 2018 and then to convey later on
that it was a personal finance, the plaintiff is
definitely entitled to get clear answer which can be
given at the time of trial. This is more so in view
of the fact that the stand and the conduct of the
defendant is questionable since on 31.3.2018 it was
clearly indicated that it was decided to sign the
document on the day previous to 31.3.2018, since in
the late evening the ATS/MOU was received by the
plaintiff with few modification and in that it has
been mentioned clearly by the plaintiff that fund is
also arranged which is substantiated by the balance
certificate of the bank.

<p id="p_70">27. These       are        the    circumstances           which           are        not
possible to be ignored by the Court at this stage of
the proceedings where the subject matter of the suit
is   directed         to   be    preserved         by   the      court         below.
Furthermore, it is not a concluded registered sale
transaction and it is merely an agreement to sale
which would not finally confer a legal right. Had it

been a registered sale transaction, it might have
inferred a crystallized right. But here is the case
in    which       the       defendant         is    dealing         with         both
simultaneously and at convenient point of time backed
out    unilaterally             and, therefore, it appears that
amount of Rs.2.16 crores is paid by the plaintiff
first in point of time than what is being collected
from Neptune by subsequently executing agreement to
sale. Hence, in the considered opinion of this Court,
the competent court is required to be left open for
taking appropriate decision finally as to whether the
relief prayed for in the suit deserves to be granted
or not and till that decision making process, the
subject matter of the suit deserves to be protected.
At this stage, in view of aforesaid circumstances,
whether a relief can be granted only if there must be
a signed agreement or not is not a question debatable
to be tried during the course of adjudication. In
view of the decisions which have been cited by the
respective sides, this question is also to be tried
and cannot be finally decided at this stage. In that
view of the matter, whether order appealed is just
and proper or not is now to be examined by this Court
in the context of aforesaid situation.
</p>

<p id="p_71">28. In the light of aforesaid situation which is
prevailing,            it   clearly        transpires         that         serious
debatable       issues       have      arisen       and     raised         in      the
present       proceedings             which         require         a        proper
adjudication           during    the        course     of     trial.            These

cannot be adjudged at this stage and the Court is not
expected       to       conduct   a    mini        trial    at    the       interim
stage. The manner in which the negotiation went on
even till the previous evening to the agreement to
sell which came to be registered with defendant No.2,
is an indication that on certain terms the parties
have reached over the period of time to a particular
stage where an inclination was shown to enter into a
transaction.            The    fact     that       documents         on       record
indicate         that         proper      balance          of      the          total
consideration was available in the bank                           as certified
by     the   bank        officials      and        WhatsApp       interactions
suggest that the defendant was kept under a lame hope
to arrive at an agreed contract. Prima facie, the
learned       counsel          appearing           for     the      respondent,
Mr.Devan Parikh, has successfully match the amount of
Rs.2.16 crores which has been paid to the appellant
in January,2018, is in response to the transaction in
question.
</p>

<p id="p_72">29. It has further been reflecting from the record
that    triable         issues    are     very      much    involved            which
deserve proper adjudication at the time when the suit
to be conducted. The readiness and willingness is
also visible not only from the fact that an amount of
Rs.2.16 crores has been paid way back on 10.1.2018.
But even an amount of Rs.27.84 crores, a balance
amount, was kept ready to be paid. The manner in
which the Legal Department promptly went on reacting
to the final drafts of MOU and ATS, it suggests that
only a part of formality of execution of document was

           C/AO/72/2019                                                       CAV ORDER



to be effected. That was an impression given by the
Legal Department as it seems. If we see Para.9 it
would reflect that on 30.3.2018 at around 10.39.54
a.m. IST, one more email was received from the Legal
Department of defendant No.1 company indicating that
final      drafts          of    MOU        and       ATS           are     attached             and
immediately on that very day, within few minutes on
10.51.21 a.m. IST, the Legal Department also sent the
land measurement summary along with payment schedule
which has demonstrated an intention to enter into
transaction and then, the plaintiff sent an email on3
31.3.2018         at      about       11.03.44            a.m.        IST      stating           the
approval        of       MOU    and       ATS     and         has     shown        clearly           a
readiness and willingness. But then surprisingly the
defendant backed out by merely sending an email at
5.24 p.m. on 31.3.2018 and unilaterally returned the
amount of Rs.2.16 crores through RTGS by projecting
as   if    the       said       amount        was         a    short       term        finance,
though      the        same     was       specifically                   asserted          as      an
amount of part of sale consideration. This chronology
of   events          and       the    conduct             of       the     defendant             has
indicated         at      length      in        earlier             paragraphs           of      the
present judgment, it requires that this conduct is
also to be examined at length. It is not a simple
case      where      the       plaintiff           has         failed        miserably             in
indicating           prima       facie        case            and    then,         wanted          an
injunction from the Court to intercept the further
steps      of     defendant.              The     conduct            on      the       part        of
defendant         certainly           a     matter            of    trial.         So,       while
considering            the      equitable           principle              in      mind,         the
conduct of the defendant is also not possible to be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_113">                                          Page 56 of 74</span>

ignored. As a result of this, in such a situation
when case is made out of a trial, the subject matter
of the suit deserves to be protected, particularly
when the manner in which the transaction is taking
place and again, the registered agreement to sell has
taken place and not a final concluding transaction
with defendant No.2. This prima facie look of the
circumstance necessitates the Court to preserve the
subject matter even with a view to avoid multiplicity
of proceedings and further alienation as has been
apprehended by the plaintiff.
</p>

<p id="p_73">30. Additionally, the Court is of the opinion that
the    aforesaid       discussion             and    the       respective
submissions made at length, are made as if the Court
is to conduct a mini trial at this stage and as such,
without much opining anything on rival contentions in
detail and concluding which may influence the trial,
the Court desists from commenting anything further,
but is of the opinion that at least the case is made
out where the property in question is required to be
preserved during the course of trial.
</p>

<p id="p_74">31. It is settled position of law that normally,
during the litigating process when a case is made
out, the statusÂ­quo deserves to be granted and simply
because the transaction is of a high value or simply
because the legal proceedings taking some more time,
would not be a circumstance to lift the order of
statusÂ­quo, because ultimately the same would lead to
a   multiplicity      of   proceedings         and   would       seriously

prejudice the ultimate outcome if taking place in
favour of the plaintiff. As a result of this, to save
this situation, the Court is of the opinion that the
order in question of maintaining statusÂ­quo does not
call for any interference and at the best, the suit
will have to be expedited considering the peculiarity
of circumstances reflecting on record.
</p>

<p id="p_75">32. In light of aforesaid situation, keeping in view
the well propounded              proposition of law that at an
interim stage, no mini trial to be conducted as if
the     Court      is    finally     examining          the      case.          Such
proposition of law is propounded in a decision of the
Apex    Court       in   case   of    Anand       Prasad      Agarwalla             v.
Tarkeshwar Prasad &amp; Ors., reported in (2001) 5 SCC

</p><p id="p_77">33. Further, the Court is also of the opinion that
prima facie case and prima facie title cannot be
confused because prima facie will have to be examined
at length during the course of adjudication of the
proceedings and here are the circumstances which are
discussed above are not the circumstances which can
be ignored just to vacate the order of statusÂ­quo.
All     these       issues      which      have       been       raised           are
significant issues depending upon the record and as
such,    the      trial    court     must        be   given     an      adequate
opportunity to examine it at length.

the record is that substantially the learned counsel
appearing for the respective appellants have pointed
out the decisions which are majority after the fullÂ­
fledged     trial       is     over,      wherein      the    Court         had       an
advantage of going through and see the evidence on
record.       Whereas        here     the       suit   is    at       elementary
stage; yet the adjudication is to take place and,
therefore, keeping in view the proposition of law
that slight change in the fact or one additional fact
will    make     a     world    of      difference      in      applying            the
precedent, the Court is dealing with the decisions as
to whether the same to be applied as a straitjacket
formula or not. This is in view of the fact that
earlier discussion which has been noted down from the
record is clearly giving an impression that case is

<p id="p_79">35. The first judgment which has been pointed out by
Mr.Mihir Thakore, learned Senior Counsel appearing
for one of the appellants in cognate Appeal from
Order is         a decision in case of <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_11">Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Ltd. v. Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>.,
reported in (2008) 1 SCC 503, wherein by relying upon
the observations made in Para.19, a contention is
tried    to     be     raised       about        the   principle           of      sub
silentio.        In this particular case, the Apex Court
was dealing with the proceedings wherein the High
Court Judicature at Bombay has set aside the arbitral
award upon proper adjudication and in the background
of that fact, this principle is discussed which stage

has yet not been reached in the present proceedings,
as it would always be available for the appellant to
press into service this principle when the suit is to
be dealt with finally by the court.
</p>

<p id="p_80">36. Yet another decision which has been pressed into
service is a decision of Court of Appeal, decided on
17.4.1986, in which what can be said to be a binding
contract concluded between the parties and by citing
this,    learned        Senior        Counsel          has    indicated            that
herein in the present case on hand, the parties have
not yet signed the contract. Therefore, it could not
have a binding effect. But to derive at that stage if
we look to the order at length, it relates to a
challenge to a final decision and, therefore, in the
present situation when there is a stiff debate on
both the sides about the continuous negotiations and
till    previous        evening,          whether        it    amounts           to      a
binding contract or not is matter of examination and
can be proved and dealt with by leading the evidence
and, therefore, to jump to a conclusion that simply
because the signature is missing, binding effect is
not    emerging        is    a   conclusion          can      be    said        to     be
prejudged which the Court would not like to venture
at this stage of the proceedings, in view                                     of the
fact    that      the       effect      of      oral    contract           is      also
agitated in the present proceedings and, therefore,
if we see the nature of obligation arising out of
which and to see the performance as to whether the
same was rightly inferred or not, is a matter of
adjudication           and here the plaintiff appears to have

paid an amount of Rs.2.16 crores in the month of
January,2018; kept ready the balance amount as per
the bank's certificate and the previous conduct of
the defendant No.1 Legal Department is also a matter
of examination. Therefore, it is not possible for
this Court to straightway apply the principle which
has been brought to the notice of the Court. OfÂ­
course, the said principles are definitely vital when
the suit at length to be adjudicated. Hence, since                                              a
question to be tried during the trial, the Court
would      like      to       desist       from        commenting          anything           in
clear terms and would like to give an opportunity to
both      the     sides         to    lead         the      evidence         and        prove
accordingly.

<p id="p_81">37. Another judgment of the Apex Court in case of
<a href="/doc/756653/" id="a_12">K.S.Vidyanadam &amp; Ors. v. Vairavan</a>, reported in (1997)
3   SCC    1         is       essentially          a      judgment      pressed           into
service for the purpose of canvassing a contention
that      delay          is     disentitling               the       plaintiff            from
equitable jurisdiction and by relying upon Para.11
onwards, it has been submitted that here is a case in
which through RTGS, the amount is returned and for
approximately             7    months,         the        plaintiff        waited,          but
this      brief      period          of    7    months          is   not     such       in      a
situation         like         this       to     oust       the      plaintiff            from
equitable relief, particularly when the reasonable

37.1 From the foregoing discussion as it has been
indicated        that     the      conduct            till    previous            day       of
entering       into      registered           agreement            to     sell        is      a
conduct which requires examination at length, this
brief period of delay is not possible to be construed
as     fatal       which        may        disentitle          any         relief           of
injunction in favour of the plaintiff and as such,
the judgment which has been pressed into service is
not possible to be mechanically applied.
</p>

<p id="p_83">38. The        other      judgments           which          are     pressed            into
service        are       also      again        on      the        issue          whether
correspondence            which         took          place        suggests             that
acceptance was absolute or not where two minds were
ad idem or not with respect to the property to be
sold. But as said earlier the Court reiterates that
such    issues          are   to      be    examined          by      allowing            the
parties to lead the evidence.

in 2016 SCC Online Bom. 6784. But then if we look at
the said judgment, the said judgment was dealing with
the appeal against the suit which was dismissed after
fullÂ­fledged trial, where the court had an advantage
of looking at the effect of evidence which has been
led and hence, as said earlier, this is not the case
where the Court at this stage would like to clearly
opine either the effect of binding nature of the

despite previous day interaction with the original
plaintiffs. All these issues are left it open for
trial to the court concerned. Hence, the Court would
not   like      to      prejudge        these          intricacies          which         are
tried to be projected on the present case on hand.

Laxmandas chanchaldas. It has been contended by
Mr. P. V. Nanavati for the appellants and Mr.
P. G lbesai for respondent Laxmandas. That the
request of plaintiffÂ­ respondent No.1 to get
injunction against him is not justified because
whatever transactions have taken place earlier
and those that would take place in. future
would be subject to right, title and interest
of plaintiffÂ­respondent No.1 and, therefore,
this Court should not grant injunction. A very
serious argument about the valuable right of a
party to dispose of his undivided share in the
property in any way he chooses was advanced and
it was stated that a right of a person to deal
with    his   undivided   share    would    remain
uncontrolled and whatever transaction would be
made by a coÂ­owner visÂ­Â­vis his undivided share
would be subject to right of a person who has
also a share in the property. So far as
principle of law about the undivided share of
coÂ­owner is concerned, no objection can be
raised about it. The court is how ever seized
of the matter pertaining to the property.
Pending   the   litigation,  the    property   was
transferred   and,   therefore   the    respondent
Laxmandas had to come on record. The matter is
still to go back to the trial Court Â­for final
decree. If during that period property would
change hands with any other persons would it
not be necessary either for the plaintiff or
somebody else to bring all parties on record,
meaning thereby, delaying further proceedings
for bringing them on record,' having their say,
etc and thus delaying the passing of final
decree? The Court should 'always lean towards
seeing that there is no multiplicity of
proceedings and also that the proceedings
should go on as far as possible so smooth that
the decision can be arrived at between the
parties who are on record as early as possible.
If injunction is not granted, then probably the
result would be as mentioned by us above and,
therefore, it is in fitness of things that
Civil Application No. 37M of 1982 should be
allowed and the relief prayed for therein is
granted."

      as outlined herein above, we are of the view
      that not only the reasons endeavoured to be
      cited in the impugned order in justification of
      the direction for public auction of the suit
      property   lack   in   persuasion,   those   are
      apparently speculative and illogical, to say
      the least. The direction for disposal of the
      suit property by public auction, in the facts
      and   circumstances   of   the   case,   clearly
      militates against the fundamental precept of
      preservation of subject matter of any dispute
      pending adjudication in a court of law, more
      particularly relatable to a civil litigation,
      to appropriately decide on the rights of the
      parties for administering the reliefs to which
      they would be entitled eventually on the
      culmination of the adjudication. As it is, the
      very essence of the concept of temporary
      injunction and receivership during the pendency
      of a civil litigation involving any property is
      to prevent its threatened wastage, damage and
      alienation by any party thereto, to the
      immeasurable prejudice to the other side or to
      render the situation irreversible not only to
      impact upon the ultimate decision but also to

        the nature of the property to be changed, which
        may include alienation or transfer thereof

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        "ACCEPTANCE : An Objective test - An acceptance
        is a final and unqualified expression of assent

        to   an   offer.  On   this   test,  the   mere
        acknowledgment that an offer has been received

        to whom an offer to sell goods had been made
        accept it merely by replying that it was his
        'intention' to place an order' or by asking for
        an invoice. But an 'acknowledgment' may by its
        express terms or, in a particular context by
        implication, contain a statement that the

        'acknowledgment' of a customer's order in
        website   trading.    Where  the   offer    makes
        alternative proposals, the reply must make it
        clear to which of them the assent is directed.
        In one case an offer to build a freight
        terminal was made by a tender quoting in the
        alternative a fixed price and a price varying
        with the cost of labour and materials. The
        offeree purported to accept 'your tender' and
        it was held that there was no contract as there
        was no way of telling which price term had been
        accepted."

inferred. Now for that purpose, the observations have
been    relied          upon.     But      since        the     said        issue         is
relatable to the trial and adjudication of the suit,
the    Court       would        refrain         itself         from       commenting
anything      on       that     and,     therefore,            not    quoting           the
observations made by the Apex Court. OfÂ­course, the
said case was arising out of fullÂ­fledged trial.

<p id="p_93">46. One decision which is empathetically submitted
by    Mr.Devan         Parikh,     learned            Senior     Counsel,           is      a
decision      of       the    Apex      Court          in    case     of      <a href="/doc/64772/" id="a_18">Maharwal
Khewaji Trust (Regd.) v. Baldev Dass</a>, reported in
(2004) 8 SCC 488 which is again at an interim stage.
The    observations             which      have         been     made       are        very
relevant in the factual matrix of the present case.
Therefore, Para.10 is quoted hereinafter:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">       "10. Be that as it may, Mr. Sachhar is right in
       contending that unless and untill a case of
       irreparable loss or damage is made out by a
       party to the suit, the court should not permit
       the nature of the property being changed which
       also includes alienation or transfer of the
       property which may lead to loss or damage being
       caused to the party who may ultimately succeed
       and may further lead to multiplicity of
       proceedings. In the instant case no such case
       of   irreparable  loss   is   made  out   except
       contending that the legal proceedings are
       likely to take a long time, therefore, the
       respondent should be permitted to put the
       scheduled property to better use. We do not
       think in the facts and circumstances of this
       case, the lower appellate court and the High
       Court   were   justified   in   permitting   the
       respondent to change the nature of property by

        putting up construction as also by permitting
        the alienation of the property, whatever may be
        the condition on which the same is done. In the
        event of the appellant's claim being found
        baseless ultimately, it is always open to the
        respondent   to   claim   damages   or,   in  an
        appropriate case, the court may itself award
        damages for the loss suffered, if any, in this
        regard. Since the facts of this case do not
        make   out   any    extraordinary   ground   for
        permitting    the    respondent   to    put   up
        construction and alienate the same, we think
        both the courts below, namely, the lower
        appellate court and the High Court erred in
        making the impugned orders. The said orders are
        set aside and the order of the trial court is
        restored."

<p id="p_94">47. Similarly,               yet    another           decision      of      the       Apex
Court in case of <a href="/doc/1586081/" id="a_19">Kalavakurti Venkata Subbaiah v. Bala
Gurappagari Guruvi Reddy</a>, reported in (1999) 7 SCC
114 is pressed into service, in which a comprehensive
suit for specific performance of the agreement came
to be filed and what has been observed by the Apex
Court     is      that        the     plaintiff           was      alternatively
entitled to base his claim for specific performance
on the pleaded oral agreement to sell and inasmuch as
there    are      further          reliefs        sought     for,         it      was       a
comprehensive           suit        and,     therefore,          if       the       Court
satisfies then relief of performance can be granted.
So, in substance, there are so many judgments pressed
into    service         by    learned        counsel       for      the       original
plaintiffs in the same manner in which the learned
counsel for the appellants have projected, but the
peculiar background of facts of present case would
independently require to be examined by the trial

court and, therefore, without giving much emphasis on
other        intricacies          which        are       projected          as      stated
above, the Court would like to opine that here is a
case         in      which         fullÂ­fledged              trial            deserves.
Resultantly, the order of statusÂ­quo does not call
for any interference.
</p>

<p id="p_95">48. The relevant decisions which have been pointed
out     to     this      Court        and      emphasized          leading            to      a
conclusion that when the case is made out of a trial,
the statusÂ­quo will have to be maintained which would
meet the ends of justice and maintain the equitable
balance           between        both      the          sides.     Each        case         is
depending           upon     its        own      merit       and       the        factual
background and as such, without much dwelling upon
the minute details of decisions and opining anything
in clear terms, the Court would like to now examine
the scope of appellate jurisdiction.
</p>

<p id="p_96">49. Time and again, it has been observed that no
doubt,       the     appellate          court       had     adequate          power         to
reverse the finding arrived at by the trial court.
But then the same will have to be in a peculiar
situation where the findings are apparently perverse
or     there       may      be    a      manifest          error       or        patently
illegality. In such kind of situation, normally the
appellate court should reverse the order. But as said
earlier, the background of this fact of a peculiar
nature, would lead to a conclusion that during the
pendency of the suit proceedings, the statusÂ­quo what
has been ordered by the court below does not require

<p id="p_97">50.   The Apex Court as well as this Court has well
defined the aspect as to the scope of appeal. Few
decisions    on      the   said   issue       since   the      Court         has
considered, the relevant observations are reproduced
hereinafter:
</p>

<p id="p_98">(1) In the case of Wander Limited versus Antox India
Private Limited reported in 1990 (Supp) SCC 727, the
relevant observations contained in paragraph 9 are
reproduced hereinafter:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">      "(9)    Usually, the prayer for grant of an
      interlocutory injunction is at a stage when
      the existence of the legal right asserted by
      the plaintiff and its alleged violation are
      both contested and uncertain and remain
      uncertain till they are established at the
      trial on evidence.      The court, at this
      stage,   acts   on   certain   well   settled
      principles of administration of this form of
      interlocutory remedy which is both temporary
      and discretionary.      The object of the
      interlocutory injunction, it is stated:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">      "Â­Â­Is to protect the plaintiff against
      injury by violation of his rights for which
      he could not adequately be compensated in
      damages recoverable in the action if the
      uncertainty were resolved in his favour at
      the trial.    The need for such protection
      must be weighed against the corresponding
      need of the defendant to be protected
      against injury resulting from his having
      been prevented 732 from exercising his own
      legal rights for which he could not be
      adequately compensated.     The court must
      weigh one need against another and determine
      where the 'balance of convenience lies.

     "the interlocutory remedy is intended to
     preserve in status quo, the rights of
     parties which may appear on a prima facie
     case.    The court also, in restraining a
     defendant from exercising what he considers
     his legal right but what the plaintiff would
     like to be prevented, puts into the scales,
     as a relevant consideration whether the
     defendant has yet to commence his enterprise
     or whether he has already been doing so in
     which latter case considerations somewhat
     different form those that apply to a case
     where the defendant is yet to commence his
     enterprise, are attracted."

<p id="p_99">[3] In the case of Matrix Telecom Pvt. Ltd. versus
Matrix Cellular Services Pvt. Ltd. reported in 2011
(3) GLR 1951, the relevant observations contained in
paragraphs 6 and 6.1 are reproduced hereinafter:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_8">     "6.0    Before proceeding further it is
     required to be noted that the present appeal
     is against the rejection of interim relief
     and the main suit is still pending. If this
     court elaborately deals with the matter on
     merits it is likely that the same would
     prejudice   the   case   of   either   side.
     Therefore, it is well settled law that this
     Court is not required to go into the merits
     of the entire matter at this stage and what
     is required to be seen is whether the
     appellant plaintiff has made out a prima
     facie case or not for grant of interim
     injunction.

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     6.1     It is required to be noted that it
     is well settled law that the Appellate Court
     may not interfere with the exercise of
     discretion of the court of first instance
     and substitute its own discretion except
     where the discretion has been shown to have
     been exercised arbitrarily, or capriciously
     or perversely or where the court had ignored

       the settled principles of law regulating
       grant    or    refusal    of    interlocutory
       injunctions. An appeal against exercise of
       discretion is said to be an appeal on
       principle. The Appellate Court will not
       reassess the material and seek to reach a
       conclusion different from the one reached by
       the court below if the one reached by the
       court   was  reasonably    possible  on   the
       material. The appellate court would normally
       not be justified in interfering with the
       exercise of discretion under appeal solely
       on the ground that if it had considered the
       matter at the trial stage it would have come
       to a contrary conclusion."
