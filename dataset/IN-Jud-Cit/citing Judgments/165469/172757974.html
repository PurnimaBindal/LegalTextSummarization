RAJIV SHAKDHER, J

</p><p id="p_4">1.      The plaintiffs have instituted the present suit seeking various reliefs against

the defendant, however, at its core is the relief of permanent injunction sought by it,

whereby it seeks to prevent the defendant from using the word mark "WHIP

TOPPING" as part of its trade mark/label "BELLS WHIP TOPPING". The reason

in nut shell is; the plaintiffs‟ belief that the impugned mark masquarades the

plaintiffs‟ registered mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING". Thus in legal terminology

the impugned mark, which is, "BELLS WHIP TOPPING" is deceptively similar to

the plaintiff‟s registered trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING". A perpetual

injunction has also been sought against the defendant to prevent passing off or

infringement of copyright in so far as trade dress, packaging and instructions are

concerned, which according to the plaintiffs, are identical and/or similar to its own

product. Consequential orders in the form of preliminary decree to render accounts,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                             Page 1 of 36</span>
 as also final decree for payment of money found due and payable, and of rendition of

accounts is sought as well. Finally, a decree for delivering to the plaintiffs custody

of all such products, packing material, boxes, cartons, labels, containers e.t.c., which

bear the infringing mark „WHIP TOPPING‟ or the impugned trade dress or get up, is

also prayed for.

the appeal with a direction, based on submissions of counsels for both parties, that

witnesses was filed by both parties. This exercise was completed on 19.08.2009;

whereupon was listed in the category of finals for hearing, and accordingly, heard on

the basis of evidence placed on record.
</p>
<p id="p_9">4.     The case set up by the plaintiffs, both in the plaint and the affidavit of

evidence filed by their witnesses in support of averments made therein, is as follows:

4.1    The plaintiff no. 1 is a company incorporated in the USA in the State of

Deleware. Plaintiff no. 1 has its genesis in a family business which commenced in

1945. Mr Robert E. Rich who is the progenitor of plaintiff no. 1, in a manner of

speaking, responsible for the discovery of vegetable based whipped cream, made

from soya bean. The research carried out under aegis of Robert E. Rich, led to the

discovery that soya bean substance could be frozen, thawed and whipped. Thus

came into existence, what the plaintiffs claim a miracle cream made from soya bean;

a wholly "non-dairy" product.
</p>
<p id="p_10">4.2    The plaintiffs called the miracle cream RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING. Being a

non-dairy topping it spawned various non-dairy products including Rich‟s

Bettercreme Icing and Filling, Rich‟s on Top non-dairy dessert, frozen éclairs and




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                          Page 3 of 36</span>
 cream puffs, coffee Rich; which incidentally is claimed as the first frozen non-dairy

creamer.
</p>
<p id="p_11">4.3     The plaintiffs it appears discovered another new product by the name of

"Freeze Flo". It is claimed that this is an all-natural process for soft foods, so that

they remain soft while frozen, and hence can be served straight from the freezer.

The plaintiffs claim that because of its expertise in manufacture and sale of frozen

foods, non-dairy and baking products including frozen sea-foods specialties, soup

bases, gravy mixes and powdered coffee, it has mustered an annual sales exceeding

U.S. Dollars 1.7 billion, comprising of 2300 products which are available in more

than 75 countries including, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, China, Holland,

Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom, Vietnam and

of course India.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.4     Plaintiff no. 2, i.e., Rich Graviss Products Pvt. Ltd. was incorporated on

16.08.1994 as a result of a joint venture initiated by plaintiff no. 1; for an avowed

purpose of manufacturing products under the trademark of plaintiff no. 1, based on

the technical know-how provided by the plaintiff no. 1. In lieu thereof, plaintiff no.

2 pays royalty to plaintiff no. 1.
</p>
<p id="p_13">5.      The plaintiffs, in so far as the present dispute is concerned, have more

specifically averred that in India "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" was duly registered

w.e.f. 13.11.1991, in class 30 specifically for non-dairy topping, icing, filling, and

generally for other goods in class 30. Presently, though its renewal is pending

consideration before the Registrar of Trade Mark in India.           Furthermore, the

registration is subject to a disclaimer with respect to the letter „S‟ and word

„Topping‟. It is further averred that "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING", has enjoyed brisk

and consistent sale in countries all over the world, since 1945. In particular, in India

the sales have increased exponentially from a figure of approximately Rs 2.1crores in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                           Page 4 of 36</span>
 the year 1997-98, to 15.6 crores in the year 2002-03. It is averred that the plaintiff

no. 1 also maintains two websites being www.richs.com and www.whiptopping.com.

5.1    As a matter of fact the plaintiffs have stated that the trademark "RICH‟S

WHIP TOPPING" as also "WHIP TOPPING" are registered in several countries of

the world such as USA, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland,

Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Pakistan and

Taiwan. It is also averred that the trademark "WHIP TOPPING" in class 29 has

been registered vide registration certificate dated 28.03.2007, which is operative

w.e.f. 27.06.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_14">5.2 It is further averred that the plaintiffs became aware only in April, 2003, that the

defendant, was selling its product under the infringing mark "WHIP TOPPING", in

packaging carrying an identical trade dress with similar user instructions.

5.3    The plaintiffs being aggrieved issued a cease and desist notice dated

23.04.2003 to the defendant.       The defendant, however, refuted the plaintiffs

contention vide their reply dated 13.05.2003. The defendant thereupon, filed a suit

in the Distt. Court at Tis Hazari being suit no. 53/2003, which, I am informed, stands

withdrawn in view of the fact that parties realized that the legal validity of their

respective stands would really get determined in the present proceedings.

</p><p id="p_15">6.     In the background of the aforesaid averments, as stated above, the plaintiffs

have led evidence in support of the same by filing affidavits of eight witnesses.

Briefly, each of the witnesses have stated as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_16">6.1    Mr Jill K. Bond (PW1) has adverted with respect to: the worldwide market

meat; fish; poultry and game; meat extracts; preserved, dried and cooked fruits and

vegetables; jellies; jams; fruit sauces; eggs, milk and milk products; edible oils and

reputation acquired by its trademark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" and the distinctive

red, blue and white colours it has, over the years, acquired immense brand value.

6.3    It is also claimed by PW1 that the said trademark "WHIP TOPPING" and

also made by PW1 to its domain name www.whiptopping.com which is claimed to

be a popular website; extensively visited by consumers and associates of plaintiffs all

</p>
<p id="p_18">6.4    PW1 has adverted to the effect that the defendant by using a deceptively

similar mark and/or packaging, to that of the plaintiffs, is in fact riding on the

plaintiffs‟ goodwill and reputation. It is thus claimed that the defendant‟s action

amount to, not only an infringement of the plaintiffs‟ trademark, but also amount to,

committing a tort of passing off. PW1 has also proved the cease and desist notice

dated 23.04.2003 (Ex. P3) issued to the defendant in that regard, as also the reply of

has adverted to the effect that plaintiff no. 2 was incorporated on 16.08.1994 for

manufacturing products, chiefly „dairy-free topping‟ under the trademark of plaintiff

no. 1 as per technical know-how supplied by plaintiff no. 1. For this purpose PW3

has stated that royalty is paid to plaintiff no. 1. PW3 has also alluded to the fact that

plaintiff no. 2 is involved in production of non-dairy topping which is ultimately sold

to bakers, confectioners, food service outlets, five-star hotels etc. PW3 has also

deposed that defendant‟s trade mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING" is similar to

plaintiff no. 1 trademark "WHIP TOPPING" which forms part of the registered

trademark of plaintiff no. 1 in India. PW3 has further stated that „WHIP TOPPING‟

on its own is registered in countries such as USA, Italy, France, Saudi Arabia, China

 Taj Flight Kitchen, ITC Group, Surya Crowne Plaza, Nirula‟s etc. in Delhi. He has

testified that the quality of the product under the brand of "RICH‟S WHIP

TOPPING" is very good and is in great demand. He has specifically adverted to the

fact that selling the product under the brand name of "BELLS WHIP TOPPING" had

created confusion, in as much as, he verily believed that plaintiff no. 2 had adopted

another trademark by the name of "BELLS WHIP TOPPING".
</p>
<p id="p_25">13.    Mr Shikhil Nagpal (PW8), who is the Operational Manager of Everbake

Bakers Pvt. Ltd, has deposed that they had been in the business since the year 2000.

He has also testified that the plaintiffs trademark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" along

with its trade dress comprising of red, blue and white packaging is "easily

recognizable and eye catching". He further stated that "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING"

is used as a substitute to fresh dairy cream as it has greater shelf life and is easier to

manage.
</p>
<p id="p_26">14.    The defendant, on the other hand, has emphatically refuted the plaintiffs‟

claim of proprietary rights in trademark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" and "WHIP

TOPPING" the trade dress comprising of red, blue and white colour the packaging,

the domain name www.whiptopping.com, and lastly, in the use of the expression of

„whip topping‟ either by itself or in combination with other marks or as suffix or

even as prefix. The defendant‟s stand is that they have been using the expression

"BELLS WHIP TOPPING" honestly and openly in the course of their trade since

1995. It is averred, over the years the defendant has built for itself a valuable

reputation and goodwill in trademark/label. Resultantly, the defendant, it is stated,

has achieved a turnover of Rs 1.75 crores in the financial year 2002-2003. The

defendant also claims that it maintains the highest standard of quality and control;

and towards this end have invested a large sum of money in research and

development.      It claims to be in possession of fully equipped laboratory with

qualified chemists and microbiologists.       It claims that continuous research and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                             Page 9 of 36</span>
 development activities have been undertaken in respect of its new products like

whippable dairy cream and Ultra Heat Treated Desserts, Custards and Sauces etc. It

is averred that research in these areas has been carried out in association with world

renowned companies like G.C. Hann &amp; Co., Germany, Danisco Culator, Denmark,

Orana A/S, Denmark, Stock Germany etc. It is also claimed that defendant has the

state-of-the-art manufacturing and packaging machines.           It claims to cater to

renowned multi-national companies such as Britannia Industries Ltd., Perfetti India

Ltd, Candica (India) Ltd., Nirulas‟ Hotels, Sugar &amp; Spice Restaurants, Taj Sata Air

Catering Ltd, Hyatt Regency Hotel etc.

14.1   In defence of its right to use the mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING" the

defendant has stated that the plaintiffs‟ mark is generic in nature and has no

trademark significance.     It is further averred that, in any event, the plaintiffs

trademark, which is registered as one composite whole is, "RICH‟S WHIP

TOPPING" with a disclaimer in so far as letter „S‟ and the word „Topping‟ is

concerned; therefore, there can be no infringement much less a commission of tort of

passing off by the defendant in using the trade mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING".

This, according to the defendant, is more so in view of the fact that „WHIP

TOPPING‟ is a descriptive expression which alludes to the character and quality of

the product itself and hence, cannot be protected till it can be demonstrated that it has

acquired a "secondary meaning". The defendant has further averred that the product

in issue is „WHIP TOPPING‟ and it cannot be described in any other manner except

by using that expression and especially when it is a manufacturer of the said product.

It is the defendant‟s stand that the said word/expression „WHIP TOPPING‟ is

commonly used in the trade world over.           According to the defendant „WHIP

TOPPING‟ is an imitation dairy product which is commonly used in making

desserts, baked and frozen products by various manufacturers all over the world, and

hence is "publici juris". In this regard example of other manufacturers, which have

</pre><p id="p_27">14.2   According to the defendant the words „Whip Topping‟ are neither distinctive

nor invented being part of common usage in trade, they cannot be protected. The

defendant has refuted the charge of infringement and passing off as it has claims the

use of the word/expression „Whip Topping‟ in conjunction with „BELLS‟ has over

the years had distinctiveness associated with the products manufactured by the

defendant. The packaging and the presentation of the colour scheme also being

different both visually and in presentation, there is no deception or confusion as

alleged or at all in the defendant‟s use of the expression "BELLS WHIP TOPPING"

along with its own trade dress.    The defendant claims the use of the expression

„whip topping‟ is bonafide as it describes the character and quality of the goods

which are manufactured by it and hence, protected by the provisions of <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_1">Section 35</a> of

the Trade Marks Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as „<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks Act</a> 1999‟).

 SUBMISSIONS OF COUNSELS

</p><p id="p_28">15.       Mr A.K. Gupta, learned senior counsel, who appeared for the plaintiff,

elaborated on the challenge laid to the defendant‟s mark in the pleadings by

adverting to the following actions of the defendant which according to him trenched

upon both the statutory as well as common law right of the plaintiff. :

</p><p id="p_29">(i)       first, the use of words/expression "WHIP TOPPING" in the defendant‟s mark

resulted in the infringement of the plaintiffs mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING";

</p><p id="p_30">(ii)      second, the adoption by the defendant of a similar packaging /trade dress;

</p><p id="p_31">(iii)     third, the infringement of copyright in the instructions accompanying the

product; and,

</p><p id="p_32">(iv)      lastly, commission of tort of passing off by the defendant.

</p><p id="p_33">16.       In support of his charge Mr Gupta made the following submissions:

</p><p id="p_34">(i)       Notwithstanding the fact that at the time of registration of the plaintiffs‟

trademark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" a disclaimer was entered with respect to the

letter „S‟ and the word „Topping‟; the defendant‟s mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING",

(which is unregistered) is; deceptively similar to the plaintiffs registered trademark.

</p><p id="p_35">(ii)      plaintiff no. 1 as far back as on 1945 was responsible for inventing a "non-

dairy" product which is capable of being whipped into foam for use in desserts,

salads and confectionaries items e.t.c., which resulted in the product acquiring the

name „whip topping‟. In short it is the invention in which plaintiff no. 1 has legal

rights.
</p>
<p id="p_36">(iii)     In the country of its invention, i.e., U.S.A. „Whip Topping‟ is registered with

the plaintiffs‟ name.
</p>
<p id="p_37">(iii)     In India, the plaintiffs‟ registration of the mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING"

dates back 13.11.1991, and thus carries with it a superior right qua the defendant by

virtue of prior user.

</p><p id="p_39"> (iv)    On discovering the defendant‟s use of the infringing mark in April, 2003, a

notice was issued on 23.04.2003, which, as indicated above, was replied by the

defendant vide its reply dated 13.05.2003. The defendant instituted a suit only

thereafter in the Distt. Court being suit no. 53/2004 in March, 2004. This was

followed by the defendant making an application for registration of its mark only on

29.05.2003. In the defendant‟s application user is claimed from 1995.

</p><p id="p_40">(iv)    The plaintiffs have rights both in the composite as well as a part of the trade

mark, i.e., in both "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" as well as in "WHIP TOPPING".

The defendant‟s use of the infringing mark is violative of the plaintiffs‟ proprietary

right in a registered mark; a violation which squarely falls within the ambit of

<a href="/doc/141193/" id="a_3">Section 29(2)(b)</a> or in the very least in <a href="/doc/1992076/" id="a_4">Section 29(2)(c)</a> of the Trade Marks Act,

1999 (in short the „<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_5">Trade Marks Act</a>‟).
</p>
<p id="p_41">17.     Mr Gupta, in order to buttress his submissions, relied upon the following

what would constitute a deceptively similar mark or trade dress. <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_6">Cadila Health Care

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                          Page 13 of 36</span>
 the defendant, reliance was placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in

<a href="/doc/1247926/" id="a_12">Registrar of Trade Marks vs Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd</a>. AIR 1955 SC 558, and the

judgment of this Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/652828/" id="a_13">Cadbury India Ltd. &amp; Ors. vs Neeraj Food

Products</a> 2007 (35) PTC 95 (Del.).
</p>
<p id="p_44">18.      Mr Gupta further contended that the registration of mark, „Rich‟s Whip

Topping‟ constituted a prima facie evidence of its validity, and since the plaintiff

was the first one to obtains its registration it ought to be protected against the

infringing mark adopted by the defendant. For this purpose reliance was placed on

provisions of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_14">Section 31</a> of the Trade Marks Act and the judgment of Bombay High

court in the case of <a href="/doc/1405951/" id="a_15">Consolidated Foods Corporation vs Bradon &amp; Company Pvt.

Ltd</a> AIR 1965 Bom. 35.
</p>
<p id="p_45">19.      It was further contended that the plaintiffs mark was a "well-known" mark in

India and in accordance with the provisions of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_16">Section 11</a> of the Trade Marks Act

there was every likelihood of defendant‟s mark being refused registration.

</p><p id="p_46">20.      In particular, the learned counsel submitted that the defence under section 35

of the Trade Mark was not available to the defendant for the reason that it protects

word marks which describe the character and quality of goods, that is, are used in

adjectible sense. In the instant case, the learned counsel submitted that the word

mark „whip topping‟ comprises of two words whip and topping, both of which are

nouns.
</p>
<p id="p_47">21.      It was contended that trademark "WHIP TOPPING" is not descriptive since it

relate to a non-dairy product. The learned counsel went on to submit that the word

„whip‟ is essentially used and confined to cream (dairy based product) or egg

(poultry product). It was submitted that for the first time, after the extensive research

and development, plaintiff no. 1 had discovered the product in issue, which was

made out of a non-dairy substance, i.e., soya bean and hence, both the product as

well as the name are associated with the plaintiff. The learned counsel relied upon


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                            Page 14 of 36</span>
 <a href="/doc/813701/" id="a_17">Section 36</a> of the Trade Marks Act to buttress his submission that there is no absolute

bar to registration of a descriptive trademark. It was contended that as a matter of

fact, registration of descriptive trademark is saved under the provisions of <a href="/doc/813701/" id="a_18">Section 36</a>

of the Trade Marks Act, provided: it is not shown that after the registration of the

trademark third parties have been using the descriptive mark in a manner that it has

become well-known and its use is widely established.
</p>
<p id="p_48">21.1   With particular reference to the defendant it was submitted that even though

the defendant had averred that it has been using the infringing mark since 1995 and,

had referred to sales figures of Rs 1.7 crores achieved in 2002-03; no evidence with

respect to the same has been supplied. There is also, according to the learned

counsel for the plaintiff, no evidence of use by any third party of the trademark

within the country. In sum and substance it is submitted that even if it is assumed

without admitting that plaintiff mark is descriptive the same is protected and/or

saved under the provisions of <a href="/doc/813701/" id="a_19">Section 36</a> of the Trade Marks Act.

</p><p id="p_49">22.    It was contended that the defendant‟s use of the infringing mark either in

1995 or anytime thereafter is neither bonafide nor honest and in any event concurrent

use of a mark similar to that of the plaintiff cannot be deemed as honest. A mark,

according to Mr Gupta, can have only one proprietor.      Reliance in this regard was

placed on the judgment of the Supreme court in the case of <a href="/doc/1965879/" id="a_20">Power Control

Appliances vs Sumeet Machines (P) Ltd</a>. (1994) 2 SCC 448.
</p>
<p id="p_50">23.    The claim of the plaintiff to the copyright in the instructions was based on the

provisions of Section 70 of the Copy Right Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as

„<a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_21">Copyright Act</a>‟).
</p>
<p id="p_51">24.    Mr Gupta concluded by submitting that the suit be decreed in terms of the

prayers made in the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_52">15.    Mr. S.K. Bansal, on the other hand, refuted the submissions made by the

learned counsel for the plaintiffs and supported the defendant‟s stand taken in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                          Page 15 of 36</span>
 pleadings by taking recourse to the following arguments: The word or mark „whip

topping‟ is generic as it describes the product. For this purpose reliance is placed on

the plaintiffs‟ own affidavit of evidence and documents where „whip topping‟ has

been described as a product. It was submitted by Mr Bansal that no trademark right

can exist or can be acquired in relation to a product if it cannot be described in any

other manner, even though, it has acquired secondary significance through use and

publicity.   In the alternative it was submitted that the mark „whip topping‟ is

descriptive as it is used to describe the product and does not, therefore, have any

trademark significance. The mark „whip topping‟ is publici juris as it is commonly

used in the trade pertaining to non-dairy products. It was contended that the mark

"RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" has been registered consciously subject to disclaimer,

and that it can be protected only in its composite form, and not when „whip toping‟ is

independently used in conjunction with a prefix or suffix. It was further submitted

that a descriptive trademark could be protected only on proof of secondary

significance. The standard of proof with regard to which is of a high order and/or

nature, and in ascertaining similarity in respect of descriptive trademarks even small

differences in the rival and competing product are enough to obviate the charge of

similarity. It was submitted that ordinarily descriptive marks are not protected as

trademarks as everyone has a right to use such trademarks, and that it would

embarrass the trade or industry if only one manufacturer were to monopolise the use

of such descriptive mark. Furthermore, protection of such descriptive mark has the

tendency to deplete the use of ordinary and commonly used expressions to describe a

product. In order to buttress his submissions the learned counsel submitted that even

in the case of invented products, which are patented; on the expiry of the patent the

name and description given to the product is not permitted to be used as a trademark.

25.1   Mr Bansal submitted that the plaintiff itself has been using the expression

„whip topping‟ in a generic and/or descriptive manner. The learned counsel has cited


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                          Page 16 of 36</span>
 examples where „whip topping‟ has been used conjointly with the word „Rich‟s‟ and

also disjunctively. Mr Bansal contended that a close perusal of the trademark on the

packaging would show that Rich‟s, which is Rich with an apostrophe „s‟ is shown

prominently along with the expression „WHIP TOPPING‟ to signify that „WHIP

TOPPING‟ which is the product is manufactured by and hence, originates from Rich,

which is, in a sense the trademark. To support his submission he cited the example

of Rich‟s Bettercream, icing and filling. A reference has also been made to the

registration certificate issued on 28.03.2007 operative w.e.f. 26.06.2005 vide

registration no. 1366892 in class 30.
</p>
<p id="p_53">26.    Mr Bansal contended that the expression "WHIP TOPPING" is common to

trade and hence, publici juris. It has been used world over by various companies and

businesses.   In this regard examples of Logo, Kraft, Flavor Right, Eligin Dairy,

Morningstar Foods, Hanan Foods etc. were referred to. Mr Bansal contended that

the product by itself cannot be the trademark and in this regard laid stress on the

distinction between the definition of a „mark‟ provided in <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_22">Section 2(1)(m)</a> and

„trademark‟ contained in <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_23">Section 2(1)(zb)</a>. He submitted that the word „mark‟ is

consciously defined in the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_24">Trade Marks Act</a> in wide terms, and has innumerable

possibilities on account of the inclusive nature of the definition. In contradistinction,

he submitted, the definition of "trademark" is narrow being confined to those marks

which are used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating and identifying the

source and the origin of goods.
</p>
<p id="p_54">27.    According to Mr Bansal the remedy of infringement is a statutory remedy,

which is controlled and limited by the provisions of the statute and based on the

mark found in on the register of trademark authority. Reliance in this regard was

placed on the provisions of <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_25">Section 2(1)(w)</a> of the Trade Marks Act. Mr Bansal went

on to contend that infringement is subject to statutory conditions as contained in

<a href="/doc/1580823/" id="a_26">Section 27</a>, <a href="/doc/904165/" id="a_27">28(2)</a>, <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_28">30</a>, <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_29">35</a> and <a href="/doc/1399349/" id="a_30">37</a> of the Trade Marks Act.             Mr Bansal further


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                            Page 17 of 36</span>
 contended that the rights conferred by registration of mark are subject to the

conditions and limitations attached to the registered mark, in the present case the

disclaimers in respect of the letter „s‟ and the expression „Topping‟.     Mr Bansal

referred, in particular, to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_31">Section 30</a>, <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_32">35</a> and <a href="/doc/1399349/" id="a_33">37</a> of the Trade Marks

Act to demonstrate the situation in which a charge of infringement cannot attach to

the defendant. He submitted that <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_34">Section 31</a> of the Trade Marks Act only raised a

prima facie presumption in favour of a registered mark which is subject to rebuttal.

Therefore, in an infringement action a court can determine the validity of a registered

mark which need not be left to be ascertained or enquired into, in a rectification

proceeding. It was contended that there was no deceptive similarity as alleged or at

all between the impugned trade mark and that of the plaintiff in the usage of the

impugned mark by the defendant. For this purpose he referred to the essential

features of trademarks of both the plaintiff and that of the defendant. It was pointed

out: firstly, the main feature in rival marks was Rich‟s and Bell‟s; and secondly, the

art work was different and since, the art work was different the accumulative effect

was that they represented different trade origins. It was his contention that "RICH‟S

WHIP TOPPING" is a combination of different words as is "BELLS WHIP

TOPPING" which signify different origin of the goods, that is, "whip topping".

According to Mr Bansal there was no likelihood of confusion. The reason being, the

consumers of the goods in issue are urban and well-educated; the trademark/labels

are different and not similar; no instances of confusion is cited despite the fact that

the defendant has been in business since 1995; the plaintiff has not acquired any

distinctiveness in respect of the expression „WHIP TOPPING‟; the plaintiff has

accepted disclaimers in India as well as any other jurisdictions across the world; and

lastly, no documents have been filed by the plaintiff to demonstrate substantial

worldwide user of the word mark „whip topping‟ as a trademark.

</p><p id="p_55"> 28.     In sum and substance it was contended that there is no confusion, much less

deception employed, and hence both the charge of infringement as well as passing

off ought to fail.
</p>
<p id="p_56">29.     As regards the plaintiffs claim with respect to copyright in the trade dress and

the art work, Mr Bansal submitted that there are no pleadings which would establish

the right and authorship or originality in the trade dress or the art work; there is only

a bald averment with respect to plaintiffs‟ claim of the copyright in the trade dress

and the artistic work. The plaintiff has no right in the colours red, blue and white;

the trade dress of the plaintiff is undoubtedly different from that of the defendant.

Similar submissions were also made vis-à-vis the instructions on the labels used by

the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_57">30.     Based on the aforesaid submissions Mr Bansal has submitted that there is no

cause of action which one could say had arisen in favour of the plaintiff in order to

enable it to maintain a suit either for infringement of its trademark or violation of

copyright or even in respect of tort of passing off.

<p id="p_59"> REASONS

</p><p id="p_60">31.     I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and considered the evidence

on record. In my view the sum and substance of the dispute is the plaintiffs‟ claim of

proprietary rights in not only its registered trademark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING"

but also in a part of its mark, i.e., „WHIP TOPPING‟. In addition the plaintiff claims

of proprietary rights in trade dress/packaging, which according to it, consists of a

unique colour combination of the colours red, blue and white as also in the

"instructions for use" set out in the packaging for the product. In order to decide the

aforesaid issues, which, according to me are the heart of the matter, let me first

advert to the facts which are not in dispute:
</p>
<p id="p_61">(i)     The plaintiffs‟ registration of its trademark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" in

class 30 was obtained specifically, in respect of non-dairy toppings, icing, fillings,

and generally, in connection with all other goods in class 30;

dated 13.06.2003 which relates back to the date of the application, i.e., 13.11.1991;

</p><p id="p_63">(iii)   the registration referred to in (i) above came with a disclaimer.             The

disclaimers made is with respect to the letter „S‟ and the word „topping";

</p><p id="p_64">(iv)    the plaintiff has applied for renewal of registration mentioned in (i) above

which is pending consideration with the Trade Mark Authority;

</p><p id="p_65">(v)     the plaintiff has also in its possession a registration certificate dated

28.03.2007, once again issued with respect to the trademark "RICH‟S WHIP

TOPPING" which is operative from 27.06.2005, in respect of goods in class 29, i.e.,

meat, fish, poultry and game; meat extracts preserved, dried and cooked fruits and

vegetables, jellies, jams, fruit sauces; eggs, milk and milk products; edible oils and

fats, included in class 29;

the word „trademark‟ which is defined in <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_41">Section 2(1)(zb)</a>, broadly has the following

indices.

is common to the trade or is otherwise of a non-distinctiveness character - the

registration of the mark shall not confer any exclusive right in respect of the matter

In the context of the present case in my view sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_52">Section 28</a> of the

Act provide for various permutation and combinations which constitute an

infringement.     Between clauses (a) to (c) of sub-section 2 of Section 29 various

situations are covered: First, where rival trade marks are identical and the goods and

services are also similar. Second, where rivals trade marks are similar, and goods

and services are dissimilar. Even in such a situation an infringement occurs provided

additional condition provided in clause (c) of sub-section (4) is fulfilled, which is,

that the registered mark has a reputation in India and the use of the mark without due

not be challenged on the ground that it was not registrable trade mark under <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_64">Section

<p id="p_82">33.     A conjoint and harmonious reading of the aforesaid provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_69">Trade

Marks Act</a> is indicative of the following broad scheme of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_70">Trade Marks Act</a>;

</p><p id="p_83">(i)     Statutory rights and remedies with respect to an action for infringement of a

registered trade mark are governed strictly by the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_71">Trade Marks Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_84">(ii)    Notwithstanding the rights and remedies provided under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_72">Trade Marks

Act</a>, the Act itself saves common law right of passing off. [See sub-section (2) of

<a href="/doc/1580823/" id="a_73">Section 27</a>].
</p>
<p id="p_85">(iii)   The rights conferred on a proprietor of a registered trade mark even though

exclusive in nature, are however, subject to the conditions and limitations set out at

the time of registration.
</p>
<p id="p_86">(iv)    A trade mark registration confers on the proprietor exclusive right to use the

trade mark as a "whole".
</p>
<p id="p_87">(v)     There is no exclusivity conferred on the registered proprietor if he chooses to

use only „part‟ of the whole of such registered mark and such "part" is neither a

subject matter of the separate application for registration filed with Registrar of

Trade Marks nor is it registered separately.
</p>
<p id="p_88">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                           Page 25 of 36</span>
</p><p id="p_89"> (vi)    A registered proprietor may be able to protect a "part" of a registered trade

mark if he is able to show it is not common to trade or that it has obtained a

"distinctive character".
</p>
<p id="p_90">(vii)   The presumption of validity of a registered mark under <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_74">Section 31</a> of the

Trade Marks Act (eventhough rebuttable) applies to "whole" or entirety of mark.

The presumption of validity does not ipso facto get attracted to a part of the

registered mark.
</p>
<p id="p_91">(viii) If a mark is registered it matters little whether the infringing mark is relatable

to the goods in issue once it is held to be identical or deceptively similar to the

registered mark, as long as the registered mark has acquired a reputation in India and

the use of the infringing mark is made by the infringer without due cause only to take

"unfair advantage" and/or in a manner which results in detriment to the distinctive

character or repute of the registered trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_92">(ix)    The defendant, can resort to the defence of honest use in accordance with the

practices of the industry or commercial trade as long as the use is not such which

takes either unfair advantage or is detrimental to the distinctive character or repute of

the registered mark.
</p>
<p id="p_93">(x)     A registered mark is not infringed where the use of the registered mark is

only to indicate the kind, quality, quantity, value, intended purpose or geographical

origin or even the time of production of goods and services.
</p>
<p id="p_94">(xi)    A defendant can also adopt the defence of a prior continuous user from a date

prior to the use or registration of the registered mark.
</p>
<p id="p_95">(xii)   The defendant is also not prevented from using the registered mark provided

it is used in a bonafide manner by a person as his own name, place of business or as

a name or place of business of his predecessors in business; or the registered mark is

used genuinely to describe the character and quality of the goods.




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                            Page 26 of 36</span>
</p><p id="p_96"> (xiii) Lastly, if a registered mark contains within it words, which is, a name or

description of an article or substance or services then the right in it ceases the

moment the use becomes „well known‟ and „established‟. It is important to note that

the test of „well known‟ and „established‟ use as provided in <a href="/doc/813701/" id="a_75">section 36</a> of the Trade

Marks Act in respect of a name of description of an article, which forms part of a

trade mark, is not confined to the use in the country or by the defendant in a given

case.
</p>
<p id="p_97">34.     It is now well-settled that in determining whether or not an infringing mark is

deceptively or confusingly similar to a registered mark the courts usually follow the

following parameters:
</p>
<p id="p_98">(i)     they look for similarities rather than dissimilarity. [see Cadila Healthcare

(supra)]

</p><p id="p_99">(ii)    the similarities are not judged by keeping the registered and the infringing

mark alongside [see Parle Products (supra)]

</p><p id="p_100">(iii)   the test of fading memory of a consumer is applied.
</p>
<p id="p_101">(iv)    in the absence of cogent evidence the presiding officer, i.e., the Judge may

resort to an ocular test with regard to the similarities in the registered trade mark and

the infringing mark.
</p>
<p id="p_102">35.     In the instant case it is quite evident that the plaintiff has a registration in his

favour in respect of mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" and not "WHIP TOPPING".

This is a position which obtains even in other jurisdictions such as the USA and New

Zealand, a fact which is evident from the documents referred to above.                 The

registration in India of the trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" is also subject to

disclaimer of the letter „S‟ and the word „Topping‟.              There is definitely no

registration in favour of the plaintiff with respect to the trade dress which is based on

the use of red, blue and white colours. Similarly, while the plaintiffs have statutory

rights in the entire trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" it certainly does not have


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                              Page 27 of 36</span>
 statutory right in a part of the trade mark, that is, „WHIP TOPPING" unless it is able

to demonstrate that it is not common to trade or has attained a distinctive character.

35.1   In my view, in order to come to a conclusion whether or not a given mark

achieved distinctiveness the evidence placed on record will have to be appraised

keeping the following in mind:- First, does the mark remind the consumer of the

trade origin. In other words, does the trade origin get related to the propounder of

the mark and none other. Second, has the mark acquired "sufficiently distinctive

character that the mark has become a trade mark".         The use of a mark does not

automatically translate into distinctiveness.    [See Shredded Wheat Co. Ltd vs.

Kelloggs of Great Britain Ltd. (1940) 57 RPC 137 &amp; British Sugar PLC vs. James

Robertson and Sons Ltd. 1996 RPC 281].
</p>
<p id="p_103">35.2   Evidence on record placed by plaintiffs does not lead to such a conclusion.

There is no evidence of consumers on record which would suggest that use of the

words „WHIP TOPPING‟ brings to mind the product manufactured by the plaintiffs.

PW7 who is the distributor of plaintiff no. 2 has laconically stated that the infringing

mark has created confusion. Being a distributor of plaintiff no. 2 his evidence cannot

be given much weight. Similarly, PW8 has extolled the virtues of the plaintiffs

product as having a greater shelf life, and the fact that the trade dress of the

plaintiffs‟ packaging is „eye catching‟ and easily recognizable. There is no pointed

evidence on the distinctiveness of word mark "WHIP TOPPING". There is no

evidence say in the form of a consumer survey; I must add here that even the purity

of such evidence will depend upon the kind of samples drawn and the questions

asked of consumers.     In such a situation, I am not persuaded to hold that the

defendant in using the trade mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING" has infringed the

registered mark, which is „RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING‟.             The suffix „BELLS‟ by

itself, even if one were to apply the test of the fading memory of a consumer, does

not persuade me to hold that there is any similarity, much less an identity, with the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                           Page 28 of 36</span>
 plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark, which is "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING". Therefore,

in one sense it is not necessary in the instant case for the defendant, in my view, to

bring its case under the provisions of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_76">Section 30</a>, <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_77">35</a> or 36 of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_78">Trade Marks Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_104">36.    Since lengthy submissions were made by both sides with respect to whether

or not "WHIP TOPPING" is a generic and/or a descriptive expression, it may be

necessary to briefly touch upon this aspect of the matter.         The word „generic‟

ordinarily would mean that which has character of or belongs to a genus or class (see

New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition 1993 at page 1074); whereas the

word „descriptive‟ would mean that which seeks to describe, characterized by

description, consist of or concern with description or observable things or qualities

(see New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition 1993 at page 644). Whether

a word or expression is „generic‟ or „descriptive‟ or both is dependent on the facts

and circumstances arising in a particular case. It is quite possible that a word or

expression which is „generic‟, i.e., which refers to a genus or a class is also

descriptive as the word by itself characterize the qualities of the product. The line

dividing the two in certain cases may get blurred. The word „whip‟ by itself means,

in the context of the present case, a light fluffy desert made with whipped cream or

beaten eggs (see New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition 1993at page

3670), while the word „topping‟ means a top layer or garnish put on food (see New

Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition 1993 at page 3342). Similarly, the

word „cream‟ means part of liquid that gathers at the top; froth etc. or a liquid rich in

droplets or particles of the dispersed phase that forms a separate (especially upper)

layer in an emulsion or suspension when it is allowed to stand or is centrifuged (see

New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Edition 1993 at page 543). The words

"Whip Topping", when juxtaposed would, in my view, be representative of toppings

or garnishes for food items which have cream like quality. Therefore, it is, in my

opinion, both „generic‟ as well as „descriptive‟ of the product. The submission of Mr


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                            Page 29 of 36</span>
 Gupta that the words „WHIP TOPPING‟ is distinctive because it relates to a non-

dairy product is not substantiated by any evidence on record which would

demonstrate that the words "WHIP TOPPING" are associated only with a cream

which is not dairy based.
</p>
<p id="p_105">37.    It is not disputed by the learned counsel for the defendant, as it cannot be,

that descriptive words and expression can be registered.         Even if they are not

registered they can be protected, provided it has attained secondary distinctive

meaning by its extensive use and publicity.       In other words use is a question of

degree. What one needs to ask oneself is whether the descriptive mark has become

the trade mark. The defendant can ward off a challenge in respect of a mark in

which the plaintiff claims proprietorship rights and seeks to enforce his rights

whether on the basis of the registration or otherwise; on the ground that the trade

mark is a descriptive word or consists of words which are descriptive of the character

and quality of the product as long as the use is bonafide or that the descriptive word

is well known or used extensively by third parties.
</p>
<p id="p_106">38.    The plaintiff, in order to demonstrate that "WHIP TOPPING" has attained

secondary distinctive meaning, has relied upon the affidavits of PW1 to PW4. The

plaintiffs‟ witnesses attempted to prove the extensive promotion of its trade mark

"RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" through indices such as the world wide turnover of its

product, which included the sales in India, the amount spent on promotional material

and the extensive publicity received over the years in newspapers and journals both

in India and abroad. I have already observed hereinabove the use of the mark by

itself does not translate into distinctiveness. The distinctiveness should be of an order

which displaces the "primary descriptive meaning" of the word. The evidence

placed before me falls well short of this standard. Assuming that one were to accept

the evidence produced as an indicator of the fact that words "WHIP TOPPING",

which is part of the plaintiffs‟ trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING", has attained


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                            Page 30 of 36</span>
 secondary distinctive meaning, the very fact in at least in two jurisdictions i.e., the

USA and the New Zealand the plaintiffs‟ mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" has been

registered with limitation. While the U.S. registration excludes use of the word

„Topping‟; the New Zealand company office has excluded the use of the words

"WHIP TOPPING". Even in India the plaintiffs have of their own accord disclaimed

their right to the letter „S‟ and the word „Topping‟. In these circumstances, I am not

persuaded to hold that the use of the words "WHIP TOPPING" by the defendant in

its trade mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING" would infringe either the statutory rights

vested in the plaintiffs‟ registered trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING", or even

constitute violation of any common law rights that the plaintiffs would have in its

mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" for the reasons given hereinbelow. In the context

of what is said by me above, there is therefore also no necessity for me to deal with

the submission that the defence of "character" and "quality" referred to in <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_79">section 35</a>

of the Trade Marks Act are used in the adjectible sense, though I have doubts about

the tenability of this argument. The example most commonly used, which comes to

my mind, is that of a „soap‟. Can „soap‟ be used by itself as a mark? The answer in

my opinion is clearly in the negative since it describes the product; however, it

nevertheless is a noun.
</p>
<p id="p_107">39.     Consequently, this brings me to the submission of the plaintiffs that the

defendant‟s use of the infringed mark constitutes passing off. In this connection, let

me reiterate the well known parameters of what constitutes passing off.    Passing off

as is ubiquitously held in most jurisdictions subject to usual turn of phrase or change

of phraseology, a tort of false representation, whether intentional or unintentional

whereby, one person attempts to sell his goods or services as those manufactured or

rendered by another which is "calculated" to damage the goodwill of that other

person. Thus, the necessary ingredients which a plaintiff in an action of passing off

is required to prove, is the:

</p><p id="p_110">          The cause of action for passing off are premised on the „classical trinity‟ form

or the extended form. A "classical form" of passing off is one where a person seeks

to trade his goods as those originating from another; thus injuring such person‟s

individual business and goodwill. Extended form of passing off is one where court‟s

seek to protect "shared goodwill" accruing in favour of a class of traders; for

example, on account of geographical connotations.           [see J. Bollinger SA vs Costa

Brava Wine Co Ltd (1960) R.P.C. 16 (in short the 'Champagne case'), Vine

Products Ltd vs Mackenzie &amp; Co Ltd (1969) R.P.C. 1 (in short the 'Sherry case'),

Erven Warnink vs J. Townend &amp; Sons (1980) R.P.C. 31 (HL) (in short the

'Advocaat case') and Reckitt Colman Products Ltd vs Borden (1990) R.P.C. 341

H.L]


39.1      In my view, the defendant cannot be said to have committed the tort of

passing off if the test set out above are applied to the facts obtaining in the instant

case. The defendant‟s trade mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING" when looked at in the

setting in which the mark is affixed, which has a picture of a cake on the cover,

leaves no doubt in my mind that there is not even a slightest attempt to deceive by

the defendant. The defendant on the packaging has prominently alluded to the fact

that the product is being sold by it as „Bell‟s‟ non-dairy „Whip Topping‟. Therefore,

merely because it uses on its packaging a colour scheme comprising of red, blue and

white colours would not, to my mind, be sufficient to constitute a tort of passing off.

</p><p id="p_111">40.       As regards the similarity in the handling instructions and the directions for

use of the product, which form part of the packaging, I tend to agree with the learned

counsel for the defendant that the plaintiffs have not placed any evidence on record

to show that it has a copyright in the said handling instructions/directions for use of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                                Page 32 of 36</span>
 the product.   Though the instructions and the directions may have an element of

similarity, unless the plaintiff is able to adduce evidence to support its claim, which,

as stated above, it did not produce i.e., it is the originator of those instructions; it

cannot seek any rights in respect of the same.
</p>
<p id="p_112">41.    Let me also deal with some of the other submissions made on behalf of the

plaintiffs. The argument of Mr Gupta that the sales shown by the defendant is only

Rs 1.7 crores, that too, in the year 2002-03 which is not supported by requisite

evidence, cannot in my view enure to the benefit of the plaintiffs at the final stage

because the onus of proof with respect to distinctiveness of the mark lay on the

plaintiff, which in my opinion, it has not been able to discharge.

41.1   The other submission of Mr Gupta that the defendant shall not be able to

obtain registration of its mark in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_80">Section 11</a> of the Trade

Marks Act is also predicated on a finding that the plaintiffs‟ mark is "well-known" in

the trade. Priority of use alone shall not suffice for the purposes of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_81">Section 11</a> of the

Trade Marks Act, given the facts and circumstances of this case, and my

observations made hereinabove on "distinctiveness" achieved by the plaintiffs‟ mark.

41.2   On the issue of validity of presumption arising under <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_82">Section 31</a> of the Trade

Marks Act in favour of the plaintiffs in view of its mark having been registered has

already been answered by me while examining the scheme of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_83">Trade Marks Act</a>.

This submission does not need any further elaboration.
</p>
<p id="p_113">42.    In view of the observations above, my answers to the issues framed are as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_114">(i)    In so far as issue no. 1 is concerned my opinion is as follows: While it

cannot be denied that the plaintiff has a proprietary right in the trade mark "RICH‟S

WHIP TOPPING" in relation to goods referred to in the plaint. And these rights

obtain both with respect to those conferred upon the plaintiff under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_84">Trade Marks

Act</a> as well as under common law. The rights of the plaintiffs do not extend to a part


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                           Page 33 of 36</span>
 of the trade mark, i.e., "WHIP TOPPING". Rights in the entire or "whole" does not

necessarily translate into a right in a "part" of the trade mark - as in this case. The

issue is answered accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_115">(ii)    As regards issue nos. 2 and 3 are concerned the plaintiff has not been able to

discharge its onus with respect to trade mark " RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" with

obvious emphasis on "WHIP TOPPING" has acquired secondary distinctive

meaning and, therefore, transborder reputation. The plaintiffs on their own accord

having accepted the limitation both in USA and New Zealand with respect to the

exclusive right to use the word "TOPPING" and "WHIP TOPPING" - both of which

form part of its registered trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING". Similarly, in

India the plaintiff has accepted disclaimer in respect of letter „S‟ and the word

„Topping‟ once again as part of its trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING".

Consequently, both the issues are found against the plaintiffs.

</p><p id="p_116">(iii)   Issue nos. 4 &amp; 5 are answered against the plaintiff and in favour of the

defendant in as much as neither the defendant‟s mark "BELLS WHIP TOPPING"

nor the defendant‟s packaging and/or trade dress is deceptively or confusingly

similar to the plaintiffs trade mark "RICH‟S WHIP TOPPING" or its packaging or

even its trade dress.
</p>
<p id="p_117">(iv)    Issue nos. 7 to 10 are also answered in favour of the defendant and against

the plaintiffs. The word "WHIP TOPPING" which forms a part of the plaintiff‟s

mark are not a coined words but are both generic and descriptive of the product. The

words have not acquired a secondary meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_118">(v)     In view of the observations above, the issue no. 6 is also answered against the

plaintiff. The plaintiffs are hence not entitled to any damages as claimed or at all.

</p><p id="p_119">(vi)    In so far as issue no. 11 and 12 are concerned, I am of the view that both

these issues have to be found in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff is not guilty of

concealment in view of the fact that the document pertaining to disclaimer of letter


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">CS(OS) 246-2004                                                            Page 34 of 36</span>
 „S‟ and the word „Topping‟ had been filed. Even though it is conceded, and I must

say, quite fairly by the learned senior counsel for the plaintiff that the pleadings do

not allude to the aspect of the disclaimer, this, in my view, may have been oversight,

which cannot be termed as an act of concealment. In any event, as submitted by Mr

Gupta, this cannot determine the outcome of the proceeding in the final analysis.

Since, in any event, every issue has been determined on merits this issue has really

been relegated to the background. Accordingly, I find the issue in favour of the

plaintiff and against the defendant.
</p>
<p id="p_120">(vi)   As regards whether the suit is barred on account of delay and latches and

acquiescence, I am of the view that the said issue has to be once again found in

favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant. The reason for the same being that

there is nothing put on record by way of evidence by the defendant to suggest that

the plaintiffs‟ assertion, that it came to know of the defendant‟s use of, what it claims

as infringing mark, i.e., "BELLS WHIP TOPPING‟, only in April, 2003 as false.

The plaintiffs‟ alacrity from then on is documented in the cease and desist notice

dated 23.04.2003 (Ex.P3) issued to the defendant. The reply to the said notice was

received by the plaintiff undisputedly on 13.05.2003 (Ex D4). The instant suit was

filed in March, 2004.     Therefore, while there may have been some delay, and

perhaps some degree of latches in not coming to the court at the earliest, it most

certainly is not a case of acquiescence. It would also perhaps be useful to cull out

the distinction between acquiescence and laches. <a href="/doc/197142526/" id="a_85">See Bihar Tubes Ltd vs Garg
