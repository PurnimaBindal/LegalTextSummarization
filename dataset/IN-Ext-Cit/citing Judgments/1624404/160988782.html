<p id="p_57">16.                 Ld. Senior PP for CBI had argued that  by the documentary 
evidence  and  the  deposition  of  prosecution  witnesses,  the  prosecution 
has been able to prove that the arraigned accused persons entered into a 
criminal   conspiracy   with   each   other   for   purchase/discounting   of   the 
cheques in question, which were recommended for sanction by A­4 and 
sanctioned   for   purchase   by   A­3   beyond   his   discretionary   powers   per 
contra   to   Bank   Norms   laid;   also   the   term   loans   and   working   capital 
facilities   in   question   were   misappropriated,   not   utilized   for   sanction 
purposes;   with   fraudulent   intention  in   conspiracy  the   accused   put   the 
Bank of India to wrongful loss for their correspondingly wrongful gain. 
It   was   also   argued   that   the   credit   limits   were   sanctioned   by   A­3   on 
recommendation  of  A­4 without  any  record    being  available  with  the 
bank   as   regard   to   assets   and   liabilities   of   the   Directors   of   accused 
companies A­5 and A­6. Also was argued that without placing on record 
the collateral securities, cash credit limit was sanctioned by terming it as 
secured loan, which was not permissible. Also was argued that even no 
proposal was sent by A­3 and A­4 to Zonal Office of Bank of India for 
sanction of CC Limit of Rs 20 lakhs and term loan of Rs 30 lakhs to A­5 
company as was required   as per prescribed norms but only   after fire

the conduct of A­1 reflected that he was never having any dishonest or

accused on the other part could be carved out from the evidence led by 
the prosecution and no active or passive role can be attributed to A­2 for 
either criminal conspiracy or cheating and only role attributed to A­2 was 
use of cheques of A­2 for discounting but A­2 had no knowledge of use 
of his cheques for purposes of discounting/purchase with the bank for the 
grant  of  credit. Also was  argued that  A­6 company  did  not  avail any 
general   cheque   purchase   facility   while   from   time   to   time   only 
applications   were   made   for   discounting/purchase   of   specific   cheques

with the Bank of India in the Resolution for opening of accounts of A­6 
as is borne out in Ex PW2/B [part of D­9 (3)], Ex PW2/DA/A­2. It was

A­2 while writings in said cheque are not of A­2 as have been proved by 
Private Handwriting &amp; Forensic Expert DW5, vide his report Ex DW5/A

A­1 for discounting/purchase request and even A­2  was not informed by 
the   Bank   of   India   before   discounting/purchase   of   the   aforesaid   five 
cheques and A­2 only learnt about the discounting of said cheques on

told   the   investigating   officer   about   Memorandum   of   Understanding 
(MoU) between A­1 and A­2, copy of which was retained by A­1 only. It 
was argued that any act of negligence on the part of bank officials in 
performance   of   their   duties   would   not   make   A­2   liable   to   face   its 
consequences as there is no principle of vicarious liability under criminal 
law. It was also argued that Mr Deepak Kumar, other Director  of A­6 as 
well as Mr. Partha Sen Gupta, proprietor of M/s Elpee Consultants, who

<p id="p_65">while on the verge of retirement, A­3 had taken over the charge of Credit 
Department  for  the  first  time   but  the  Credit  Manager  and  other  bank 
officials   gave   wrong   feed   back   to   A­3   for   sanction   of   limits   and 
discounting of cheques, which resulted in misinterpretation of delegatory 
powers   on   the   part   of   A­3   and   A­3   became   victim   of   irregularity   in 
procedure though he had no dishonest intention at any moment of time. It 
was also argued that it was the job of the Credit Department to see about 
powers regarding  sanction of limits and discounting of cheques and A­3 
being   Chief   Manager   was   not   to   see   said   facet   of   the   matter   while 
borrower   was   supposed   to   go   initially   to   Credit   Department,   give 
application there which was to be scrutinized by Credit Department and 
if in order, it was to be either sanctioned if power vested with them or 
else   to   refer   to   authority   have   power.   It   was   also   argued   that   in   the 
banking procedure nothing is done verbally/orally but for every act in the 
bank, there is some writing in the form of vouchers, notes for sanction, 
other purposes; so the version of  PW3 with regards to having told to A­3 
about dishonor of purchased/discounted cheques at any moment of time, 
is nothing else but a bundle of lies. It was argued that infact neither PW3 
nor   A­4   nor   any   other   official   of   Credit   Department   or   any   other 
department ever brought to the notice of A­3 about dishonor of any of 
the purchased/discounted  cheques  at any moment  of time. It was also 
argued that those who had complicity in crime including PW3, auditor, 
Sh   G.K   Banerjee,   Sh   A.C   Arya   were   left   off   the   hook,   not   even 
suspected, what to say of arraigning them as accused despite lapses on

the explanation of A­3 was not in order. Also was argued that infact took

in terms thereof while the investigation was a farce on face of it. Also 
was   argued   that   A­3   had   not   taken   any   financial   benefit   from   the

prosecution  no mens rea for dishonest  intention on the part of A­4 is 
borne out from record. Also was argued that  nothing was recovered from 
A­4.   It   was   also   argued   that   A­4   was   not   sanctioning   authority   for 
discounting/purchase of cheques but   had simply received the cheques 
with purchase request letters for discounting/purchase and had forwarded 
them to sanctioning authority in the bank. Also was argued that A­4 had 
not   monetarily   gained   from   the   transaction   in   question   nor   had   any 
intention to cheat nor was there any evidence of any act done by A­4 in 
furtherance of criminal conspiracy. It was also argued that the procedural 
lapses have been blown out of proportions while there is no evidence 
any prior meeting of minds amongst A­4 with arraigned co­accused nor 
from any proved acts any inference of A­4 to be co­conspirator of the 
conspiracy can be inferred. Also was argued that neither A­4 had any

<p id="p_68">delegated   authority   to   sanction   purchase   of   cheques   nor   any 
recommendation of A­4 for purchase of cheques had a binding force on 
any of his superiors including A­3. It was also argued that even for the 
sake of arguments if it is admitted that A­4 was negligent in any manner 
in the course of his duties but even it cannot be construed that any of 
such acts of A­4 could come in the  ambit of criminal misconduct since 
mere forwarding of the requests for purchase of  cheques or grant of cash 
credit   facilities   cannot   make   out   complicity   of   A­4   for   the   offences 
charged   since   sanctioning   authorities   were   not   bound   by 
recommendations  of  A­4  but  had  to  themselves  check  their  delegated 
powers before according sanction. It was also argued that even DW1, an 
officer of bank, testified that it was not the duty of credit department to 
write   a   note   to   sanctioning   authority   for   having   power   to   purchase 
cheques or otherwise. Also was argued that A­4 did not had any authority 
for  reversal  entries  of  dishonored  purchased  cheques,  which  authority 
vested   with   the   sanctioning   authority.   It   was   also   argued   that   at   no 
moment of time A­4 was informed of dishonor of any of the purchased 
cheques, before purchase of the last cheque in question. Also was  argued 
that even PW3 did not specify the date as to when did she inform A­4 
about dishonor of the purchased cheques. Also was argued that in cross 
examination   PW2   deposed   that   power   of   reversal   entries   vested   with 
Chief Manager A­3. Also was argued that PW5 was responsible to make 
entries in the Jet Clearing Register; lapses of PW5 are borne out in the 
report Ex PW7A/DA of PW7A but he was left scot free. Also was argued

<p id="p_69">that PW3 in the course of her cross examination stated that all inward 
mails   were   received   by   PW3   or   Deputy   Manager   (Administration) 
whereas  A­4  had  no  access  to  inward  mails  nor  A­4  had  any  role  in 
reversal entries nor knowledge of dishonor cheques before dishonor of 
last purchased cheque. It was argued that A­4 considered A­1 as a valued 
customer of the bank as A­1 provided business to bank whereas A­1 was 
in direct touch with Chief Manager A­3 and it was A­3 who took A­1 to 
Zonal Office; so, A­4 had no complicity in the offences charged. It was 
also argued that to garner business for profits of bank, being in credit 
department,   A­4   forwarded   the   cheques   presented   with   purchase 
requests,   since   facilities   of   cheque   purchases   are   instantaneous,   in   a

accused, submitting prosecution has failed to prove its case against A­4

conspiracies are proved by the circumstantial evidence, as the conspiracy 
is seldom an open affair. The existence of conspiracy and its objects are 
usually deduced from the circumstances of the case and the conduct of 
the   accused   involved   in   the   conspiracy.   Criminal   conspiracy   is   an 
independent offence in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_35"> the Penal Code</a>. The unlawful agreement is sine

between two or more persons which may be express or implied or partly 
express   or   partly   implied.   So   was   also   held   in   the   case   of  K.R

                     offences were ultimately committed by some of them, without the

                     them. Criminal offences and punishments therefor are governed by

debit   entry   in   the   account   of   seller   of   cheques   on   dishonor   of   the

making reversal entries on receipt of cheque on dishonour since even if 
she made a reversal entry without their permission, the parties account or 
the account of the seller would never be debited unless or until either of 
them verified the entry in the computer system. PW3 stated that print out 
of entries made in IBP account was not taken daily nor put up before 
A­3. PW3 also stated that she herself had gone once to A­3 and had told

<p id="p_148">It is admitted case of A­2 that the cheques in question (1) Ex PW2/C, (2) 
Ex PW2/D, (3) Ex PW2/F, (4) bearing no. 168679 for Rs 33 lakhs  and 
(5) bearing no. 168680 for Rs 38 lakhs were bearing his signatures. No 
law provides that in case of   any negotiable instrument entire body of 
said negotiable instrument has to be written by maker   or drawer only. 
What  is material  is  the  signature of the drawer  or  maker  and  not the 
writing on instrument; hence, question of body writing of the negotiable 
instrument is almost of no significance. A­2 alleged that these cheques 
were misused by A­1. It was for A­2 to prove such defence in terms of 
law for which he did not lead any defence evidence to prove that  these 
cheques  were given in security to A­1 at the time of entering of said 
MoU   on   date   10/08/2009,   or   these   cheques   were   misused   by   A­1. 
Nothing of the sort was done by A­2 on this count. Such defence of A­2 
accordingly falls flat on the ground since the report Ex DW5/A (colly) of 
private   handwriting   expert   DW5   is   of   no   help   to   A­2   as   it   revolved 
around the writings of body parts of photographs of cheques Ex PW2/C,

related   elicited   debit/credit   vouchers   of   the   cheques   in   question 
purchased   were   bearing   initials   of   A­4   and   sanction   for   purchase   of

any other private bank whereas the entire money collected through the

                   offences   fall   under   the   category   of   offences   involving   moral

Vikram Anantrai Doshi &amp; Ors</a>, 2014 SCC Online SC 745, it was inter 
alia held by Supreme Court that 
                    "Availing of money from a nationalized bank in the manner, as  
                    alleged   by   the   investigating   agency,   vividly   exposits   fiscal  
                    impurity and, in a way, financial fraud. The modus operandi as  
                    narrated in the chargesheet cannot be put in the compartment of  
                    an individual or personal wrong. It is a social wrong and it has  
                    immense societal impact. It is an accepted principle of handling of  
                    finance   that   whenever   there   is   manipulation   and   cleverly  
                    conceived contrivance to avail  of these kind of benefits it cannot  
                    be   regarded   as   a   case   having   overwhelmingly   and  
                    predominantingly   of   civil   character.   The   ultimate   victim   is   the  
                    collective.     It   creates   a   hazard   in   the   financial   interest   of   the  
                    society.  The gravity of the offence creates a dent in the economic  
                    spine   of   the   nation.   The   cleverness     which   has   been   skillfully  
                    contrived, if the allegations are true, has a serious consequence. A  
                    crime   of   this   nature,   in   our   view,   would   definitely     fall   in   the  
                    category of offences which travel far ahead  of personal or private  
                    wrong.   It   has   the   potentiality   to   usher   in   economic   crisis.   Its  
                    implications have its own seriousness, for it creates a concavity in  
                    the solemnity that is expected in financial   transactions. It is not  
                    such a case where one can pay the amount and obtain a "no due  
                    certificate"   and   enjoy   the   benefit   of   quashing   of   the   criminal

                    a serious view of the matter to be taken, instead of soft dealing.  
                    The fact that he has a number of dependents and is going to lose  
                    his job are irrelevant considerations in as much as in almost every  
                    case a person found guilty would have dependents and if he be a  
                    public servant, he would lose his job. The present being the first  
                    offence is also an irrelevant consideration. Though the delay has  
                    some relevance, but as in cases of the present nature, investigation  
                    itself takes time and then the trial is prolonged, because of the type  
                    of  evidence   to   be   adduced   and   number   of   the   witnesses   to   be  
                    examined, we do not think that the fact of delay of about five years  
                    could have been a ground to award the sentence of imprisonment  
                    till rising of the Court, which really makes a mockery of the whole

2004 Cri.LJ 620: MANU/SC/0916/2003 it  was inter alia held that
                     "30. When corruption was sought to be eliminated from the polity  
                     all   possible   stringent  measures   are   to   be   adopted   within   the  
                     bounds   of   law.   One   such   measure   is   to   provide   condign  
                     punishment.   Parliament   measured   the   parameters   for   such  
                     condign punishment and in that process wanted to fix a minimum  
                     sentence   of   imprisonment   for   giving   deterrent   impact   on   other  
                     public   servants   who   are   prone   to   corrupt   deals.   That   was  
                     precisely the reason why the sentence was fixed as 7 years and  
                     directed that even if the said period of imprisonment need not be  
                     given the sentence shall not be less than the imprisonment for one  
                     year.   Such   a   legislative   insistence   is   reflection   of   Parliament's  
                     resolve to meet corruption cases with a very strong hand and to  
                     give   signals   of   deterrence   as   the   most   pivotal   feature   of  
                     sentencing   of   corrupt   public   servants.   All   public   servants   were  
                     warned   through   such   a   legislative   measure   that   corrupt   public  
                     servants have to face very serious consequences. If on the other  
                     hand   any   public   servant   is   given   the   impression   that   if   he  
                     succeeds in protracting the proceedings that would help him to  
                     have the  advantage of  getting  a very light  sentence even if  the  
                     case   ends   in   conviction,   we   are   afraid   its   fallout   would   afford  
                     incentive to public servants who are susceptible to corruption to  
                     indulge in such nefarious practices with immunity. Increasing the  
                     fine after reducing the imprisonment to a nominal period can also  
                     defeat the purpose as the corrupt public servant could easily raise  
                     the fine amount through the same means."

                     lenient   view   is   taken   in   this   case.   The   corruption   by   public  
                     servants   has   become   a   gigantic   problem.   It   has   spread  
                     everywhere. No facet of public activity has been left unaffected by  
                     the stink of corruption. It has deep and pervasive impact on the  
                     functioning of the entire country. Large­scale corruption retards  
                     the nation building activities and everyone has to suffer on that  
                     count. As has been aptly observed in <a href="/doc/398491/" id="a_136">Swatantar Singh v. State of

                     demoralising the honest officers. The efficiency in public service  
                     would improve only when the public servant devotes his sincere  
                     attention   and   does   the   duty   diligently,   truthfully,   honestly   and  
                     devotes himself assiduously to the performance of the duties of his  
                     post.   The   reputation   of   corrupt   would   gather   thick   and  
                     unchaseable   clouds   around   the   conduct   of   the   officer   and   gain
