1.</pre><p id="p_1">    This application is filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 2A of
CPC for taking appropriate action against defendant No.2.
</p><p id="p_2">2.    The case of the plaintiff is that defendant No.2 is guilty of blatant and
willful disobedience and violation of interim order passed by this court on
16.7.2018 and 22.11.2018.

     "IA No.9105/2018
</pre><p id="p_4">            This application is filed under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2
    CPC seeking an interim injunction to restrain the defendants
    etc. from using the plaintiff‟s trademark including supplying,
    selling or offering any products, unless authorised by the
    plaintiff bearing the plaintiff‟s trademark through its website
    www.amazon.in. Other connected reliefs are also sought.
</p><p id="p_5">            The plaintiff‟s case is that it is a worldwide
    manufacturer of goods using the plaintiff‟s trademark/brand
    „Beverely Hills Polo Club'. The details of the registration of the
    trademark of the plaintiff are given in para 18 of the plaint. It is
    pleaded that the plaintiff has emerged as a global lifestyle brand
    and apart from the registration of trademarks in India the brand
    has registrations all over the world. It is pleaded that the
    plaintiff has received information of widespread sale of
    counterfeit products on the website of the defendant No.1 in
    India sometimes in November 2017. There is sale of counterfeit
    products including apparel products, accessories, fragrance
    products, watches belts etc. It is pleaded that the plaintiff do not
    sell or offer for sale all their products on online sales platforms
    with exception to the sale of fragrance/perfumery products sold
    by plaintiff No.3 through an online sales distributor, namely,
    Cloudtail. The plaintiff on coming to know about the counterfeit
    products attempted to find out the name and contact details of
    the actual suppliers of these counterfeit products. However, it is
    pleaded that the customer care assistance module of defendant
    No.1 did not share the details of these counterfeit products. A
    cease and desist notice was issued on 13.12.2017 to defendant
    No.1 requesting defendant No.1 to take down the URLs and
    disclose the name and contact details of the suppliers of these
    counterfeit products. However, defendant No.1 refused to share
    the details including names and contacts of the manufacturer.
    However, they deleted the concerned URLs. Subsequently
    another notice has been sent by the plaintiff on 27.1.2018.
</p><p id="p_6">            Plaintiff has made out a prima facie case. Balance of
    convenience is in favour of the plaintiff. The defendant shall
    remove forthwith from its platform any URLs which are pointed

     out by the plaintiff which are selling products in violation of the
    plaintiff‟s right.
</p><p id="p_7">             Learned counsel for the plaintiff has also pointed out
    that what is happening is that if one of the URLs are removed a
    fresh link spring up on the website of defendant No.1 whereby
    the sale of counterfeit products continues unauthorisedly.
    Accordingly, keeping in view these facts and circumstances of
    the case a direction is passed to the defendants to give all details
    and information to the extent of such information is in its
    possession about the identity of the person who has uploaded
    the URLs which are advertising sale of counterfeit products
    using the trademark of the plaintiff illegally. The defendant
    shall also remove the URLs of the products listed at pages 1 to
    10 of the documents filed by the plaintiff. Defendant will also
    give information about the URLs for which a communication
    has been sent to the defendant earlier also.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">    "IA No.9105/2018
           Defendant No.2 has entered appearance. Let him file a
    reply within two weeks from today.

    Defendant No.2 will also not place any counterfeit products of
    the plaintiffs on the website of defendant No.1.</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">           The learned counsel for defendant No.1 states that costs




CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                         Page 3
        have been paid as directed by the learned Joint Registrar in his
       order dated 31.10.2018.
</p><p id="p_13">             List on 18.01.2019."
</p>
<p id="p_14">3.      Based on the above orders the grievance of the plaintiff is that in
complete defiance of the said orders, defendant No.2 is still offering for sale
and selling counterfeit products bearing the trademarks of the plaintiff on the
website of defendant No.1. It is pleaded that plaintiffs have identified at least
38 URLs of counterfeit products whose sale were fulfilled by defendant
No.2. It is further stated that defendant No.1 is in collusion with defendant
No.2 and is committing continuous contemptuous acts adding to flagrant
breach of the interim orders.
</p><p id="p_15">4.      It is further pleaded that a notice was sent to defendant No.2 on
6.12.2018 to cease the said acts of contempt but to no effect. Hence, the
present application.
</p><p id="p_16">5.      I may note that the notice of this application so far has not been issued
to the defendants.
</p><p id="p_17">6.      Defendant No.2 has also filed a short affidavit in opposition.
Defendant No.2 has also filed written submissions to plead that there is no
willful disobedience of the orders of this court. Defendant No.2 in the
written submissions takes the following pleas:-
</p><p id="p_18">(i)     It is stated that defendant No.2 does not sell or offer for sale any
        counterfeit products.
</p><p id="p_19">(ii)    It is pleaded that products originating from a lawful source are not
        counterfeit products. The plaintiff is, it is pleaded, indulging in a self-
        serving definition of counterfeit. It is stated that assuming that there




CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                           Page 4
         are two proprietors of the same mark/having parallel set of rights
        neither can be said to be counterfeiting the others set of products.
</p><p id="p_20">(iii)   It is further pleaded that in the present case defendant No.2 has
        sourced the products from the proprietor of the mark and brand in
        USA for the full price of the product. These products are genuine,
        lawfully acquired from the proprietor of the mark and are not
        counterfeit. Hence, there is no violation of the interim order passed by
        this court. Reliance is also placed on sections 30(3) and (4) of the
        Trademarks Act, 1999 to plead that where the goods have been
        lawfully acquired the same does not tantamount to infringement. It is
        pleaded that these provisions relate to the principle of International
        Exhaustion which has been adopted and accepted under the Indian
        law. It is pleaded that the principle of international exhaustion
        prevents trademark owner from prohibiting any person to sell
        imported goods in any geographical area on the basis of his trademark
        rights, if such imported goods have been acquired from authorized and
        legitimate source. Reliance is also placed on the judgment of a
        Division Bench of this court in <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_2">Kapil Wadhwa &amp; Ors. vs. Samsung
        Electronics Company Limited &amp; Anr</a>., (2012) 194 DLT 23 (DB).
</p><p id="p_21">(iv)    It is further stated that in the present case there are two proprietors
        having parallel rights in respect of the very same trademark. One
        proprietor is plaintiff No.1. The second is a US entity named BHPC
        Associates LLC. The goods bearing the said trademarks ranging from
        either of the entities are lawfully procured.
</p><p id="p_22">(v)     It is pleaded that defendant No.2 purchased the said branded product
        from the owner of the said trademark in USA. It is also stated that the



CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                             Page 5
        goods sold by defendant No.2 through the website of defendant No.1
       are subject to certain terms and conditions. The terms and conditions
       of the sale provide that the sale takes place in the US and goods are
       imported by the purchaser. It has been further pleaded that the
       purchaser being the importer bears all costs and risk of importation of
       the goods to India. The title of the property in the goods passes to the
       purchaser at the point of sale in USA, no sale takes place in India.
       Hence, there is no violation of any interim orders passed by this court.
</p><p id="p_23">(vi)   It is further stressed that under trademark law if goods have been
       sourced lawfully from anywhere in the world their importation into
       India cannot be injuncted under Trademarks Act except on the ground
       contained under section 30(4) of the Act.
</p><p id="p_24">7.     The plaintiff has also filed written submissions to oppose the pleas of
defendant No.2. In the written submissions of the plaintiffs, the following
salient contentions have been raised:-
</p><p id="p_25">(i)    The goods which are being offered for sale by the defendant No.2
       under the said mark are not authorized by the plaintiffs. Hence, the
       said goods are counterfeit goods. It is admitted fact that the plaintiff is
       the registered proprietor of the said mark in India and the products
       being offered for sale/sold by defendant No.2 on the website of
       defendant No.1 are unauthorized and counterfeit products.
</p><p id="p_26">(ii)   It is stated that the word counterfeit has been defined in TRIPS
       Agreement in Footnote No.14 to <a href="/doc/854952/" id="a_3">Article 51</a> to which India is a
       signatory which reads as follows:-
</p><p id="p_27">       "any goods including packaging bearing without authorization a
       trademark which is identical to the trademark validly registered in




CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                          Page 6
       respect of such goods or which cannot be distinguished in its essential
      aspects from such a trademark and which thereby infringes the rights
      of the owner of the trademark in question under the law of the country
      of importation."
</p>
<p id="p_28">      Based on the above definition it is pleaded that the defendant No.2 is
clearly selling counterfeit goods inasmuch as such goods do not originate
from the plaintiffs. It is further reiterated that the plaintiff is not involved in
the sale abroad and the use of the plaintiffs‟ trademark in that territory would
be a misrepresentation to the public.
</p><p id="p_29">8.    I have heard learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs and learned
counsel for defendant No.2.
</p><p id="p_30">9.    The admitted fact is that defendant No.2 has continued to sell the
goods with the trademark brand Beverly Hills Polo Club on the platform of
defendant No.1 despite the interim orders of the Court dated 16.7.2018 and
22.11.2018.
</p><p id="p_31">10.   However, the defence raised is that there is no disobedience or willful
disobedience of the orders of this court. In this context it is stated that a
direction has been issued that defendant No.2 will not place any counterfeit
products of the plaintiff on the website of defendant No.1. Broadly the
following defence has been sought to be raised, namely,
</p><p id="p_32">(i)   That lawfully acquired goods are those that originate from the
      proprietor of the trademark anywhere in the world. Reliance is sought
      to be placed on the judgment of the Division Bench of this court in the
      case of <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_4">Kapil Wadhwa and Ors. vs. Samsung Electronics Company
      Limited &amp; Anr</a>.(supra). It is further pleaded that in the present case
      there are two proprietors having parallel rights in respect of the very




CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                           Page 7
        same trademark. One of the proprietors is the plaintiff and the second
       is a US entity BHPC Associates LLC. It is pleaded that goods bearing
       the trademark Beverly Hills Polo Club can be acquired from either of
       the two entities lawfully inasmuch as neither of the two entities can
       claim a better right over the other. Such goods which emanate from
       the US entity cannot be termed to be counterfeit goods or as goods
       infringing the trademark.
</p><p id="p_33">(ii)   It is further sought to be urged that the goods sold by defendant No.2
       through the website of defendant No.1 are subject to certain terms and
       conditions without acceptance of which no goods can be purchased. It
       is stated that in terms of the sale, the title of the property in the case
       passes to the purchaser at the point of sale in the US. No sale takes
       place in India. Reliance is sought to be placed on the judgment of the
       Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/126447694/" id="a_5">Arihant Udyog vs. State of Rajasthan &amp;
       Ors</a>., 2017 (8) SCC 220 and other such judgments. Hence, it is
       pleaded that in the present case sale was concluded in USA, defendant
       No.2 is in USA. No part of the transaction was done in India. At best it
       is the Indian purchaser which has imported the goods to India.
</p>
<p id="p_34">11.    Reference may be had to the judgment of the Division Bench of this
court in the case of <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_6">Kapil Wadhwa &amp; Ors. v. Samsung Electronics
Company Limited &amp; Anr</a>.(supra). In that case, the Division Bench was
dealing with the case where the respondents were the „Samsung Electronics
Company Limited‟ and „Samsung India Private Ltd Company‟ incorporated
under the laws of Korea and India, respectively. The business was being
done by the respondents dealing with the trademark „Samsung‟. The Indian




CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                         Page 8
 company had a license to use said trademark. The grievance of the
respondents was that the appellant was purchasing from the foreign market
printers manufactured and sold by respondent No.1 under the same
trademark and after importing the same in India, and were sold in Indian
market under the same trademark. It was alleged that this tantamounts to
infringement of the trademark of the respondents. The Division Bench held
as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "73. It is not the case of the respondents that the appellants are
      changing the condition of the goods or impairing the goods
      which are put in the foreign market by respondent No. 1 or its
      subsidiary companies abroad. What is pleaded is that the
      physical features of the printers sold abroad are different from
      the features of the printers sold in India. But this is irrelevant as
      long as the goods placed in the International market are not
      impaired or condition changed. It is pleaded that the
      respondents have no control pertaining to the sale, distribution
      and after sales services of its goods which are imported by the
      appellants and sold in India. Now, the Principle of International
      Exhaustion of Rights itself takes away the right of the
      respondents to control the further sale and further distribution of
      the goods. With respect to after sales services, since the
      respondents do not warranty anything regarding their goods
      sold abroad, but imported into India and further sold, they not
      being responsible for the warranty of those goods, nothing turns
      thereon, as regards said plea. There may be some merit that the
      ordinary consumer, who is provided with warranties and after
      sales by the appellants, on not receiving satisfactory after sales
      service, may form a bad impression of the product of the
      respondents and thus to said extent one may recognize a
      possible damage to the reputation of the respondents pertaining
      to Samsung/SAMSUNG printers and Samsung/SAMSUNG
      products sold in India after importation. But, this can be taken
      care of by passing suitable directions requiring the appellants to
      prominently display in their shop that the Samsung/SAMSUNG
      printers sold by them are imported by the appellants and that



CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                            Page 9
       after sales services and warranties are not guaranteed nor are
      they provided under the authority and control of the respondents
      and that the appellants do so at their own end and with their
      own efforts. This would obviate any consumer dissatisfaction
      adversely affecting the reputation of the respondents, and thus if
      this is done, the respondents can claim no legitimate reasons to
      oppose further dealing in Samsung/SAMSUNG products in
      India.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">      74. As regards the appellants meta-tagging their websites with
      those of the respondents, the learned Single Judge has correctly
      injuncted the appellants from so doing, which injunction we
      affirm. The argument by the appellants that how else would the
      appellants know about the working of the particular product
      hardly impresses us for the reason the appellants can design
      their website in a manner where they are able, on their own
      strength, without any meta-tagging, to display the relevant
      information."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_35">12.   Further as noted above, the plea of defendant No.2 is that the
transactions have been concluded abroad in view of the terms and conditions
of the sale agreed upon by defendant No.2 from the purchasers of the goods.
Reliance is sought to be placed on the judgment of the <a href="/doc/126447694/" id="a_7">Arihant Udyog vs.
State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors</a>.(supra) where the Supreme Court held that the
sales or transactions take place where it is intended in the contract.
</p><p id="p_36">13.   The defence as noted above by defendant No.2 would need a detailed
examination. At present no notice has been issued to defendant No.2 of this
application. The court does not have a benefit of the detailed reply of
defendant No.2 for complete adjudication of the present application.
</p><p id="p_37">14.   Keeping in view the fact that defendant No.2 continues to sell the
goods under the said trademark on the platform of defendant No.1 despite




CS(COMM.)1015/2018                                                       Page 10
 orders of this court, the said act would prima facie warrant a detailed enquiry
after issue of notice and a reply.

Roster Bench on 16.01.2020.</p><pre id="pre_3">
