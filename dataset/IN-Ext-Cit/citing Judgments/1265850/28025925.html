<p id="p_4">GENESIS OF THE DISPUTE

</p><p id="p_5">2.      The case set up by the plaintiff in the plaint is as follows:
2.1     The plaintiff company, which is incorporated in Japan, is the
registered proprietor of the trademark &#x27;AIWA&#x27; in various classes, including
Class 9 (televisions and audio equipment).
</p><p id="p_6">2.2     The wordd &#x27;AIWA&#x27; also forms part of the trading style, both as the
corporate name as well as the email address of the plaintiff.
2.3     The plaintiff holds registration of the word mark &#x27;AIWA&#x27; with effect
from 19th October, 1982 and the stylized versions of the aforesai
                                                         aforesaid

trademarks                     and               in Class 9 with effect from 12th
September, 1991 and 29th January, 2003 respectively.
2.4     The plaintiff&#x27;s trademark &#x27;AIWA&#x27; has been included in the list of
well-known
     known marks maintained by the Trademark Registry since the year
2007.
</p><p id="p_7">2.5     The plaintiff holds worldwide trademark registrations in respect of its
trademark &#x27;AIWA&#x27; and its formative marks and the goods of the plaintiff
have acquired a tremendous reputation and goodwill throughout the world.
2.6     In August, 2022, the plaintiff became aware of the defendant no.1
using the word mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; and the stylized version of the same i.e.,

                     through its brochure, both as a trademark in relation to its
goods and as a part of its corporate name. The defendant no.1 was using not
only the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27;
              &#x27;AIV    but had also copied the stylized manner adopted by


                                                              Signature Not Verified

the plaintiff i.e.,                   . As per the brochure, the defendant no.1

claimed to have registration in respect of the mark                           with
the alphabet &#x27;R&#x27; placed in a circle on the top right corner to denote
registration
      ration of the mark.
</p><p id="p_8">2.7    The plaintiff conducted a search in the Trademark Registry in the
relevant class which revealed that there was no registration of the said mark
in the name of the defendant no.1 or the defendant no.2.
2.8    The plaintiff arranged for the purchase of a TV set sold by the
defendant no.1 and found that apart from the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27;, the defendants

are also using the marks                     ,           and                        .
</p><p id="p_9">The defendant no.2 was also involved in selling the aforesaid infringing
products.
</p><p id="p_10">3.     Accordingly, the present suit has been filed seeking the relief of
permanent injunction restraining the defendants from using the trademarks

&#x27;AIVVA&#x27; /                    /                   /                /     &#x27;AIVVA

the trademarks of the plaintiff or constituting passing off by use of the
trademarks or any part of the trade name, corporate name or domain name of
the plaintiff and other ancillary reliefs.

<p id="p_13">SUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANTS

</p><p id="p_14">6.     The counsel for the defendants made the following submissions:
6.1    It has wrongly been stated in the plaint that the plaintiff learnt of the
defendants&#x27; use of the impugned marks in August, 2022 and have
approached the Court without any delay. As is evident from the legal notice
dated 17th August, 2020, the plaintiff was aware of the user of the mark
&#x27;AIVVA&#x27; in August, 2020 by the defendants no.1 and 2, who were selling
and marketing their products under the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; and the said products
are also available for purchase on e-commerce platforms like IndiaMART.
6.2    The plaintiff has deliberately not disclosed the legal notice or its reply
in the plaint.</p><pre id="pre_2">

well as the registrations of the trademark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; in his favour in the year
2015.
</p><p id="p_16">6.4     The aforesaid legal notice was copied to a Hong Kong based entity,
Nu-World Global, which has been described in paragraph 2 of the aforesaid
notice as an entity to which rights to manufacture and sell products under the
&#x27;AIWA&#x27; trademark have been assigned by the plaintiff. Further, the
aforesaid Nu-World Global assigned the rights in favour of Aiwa Consumer
Products LLP, a partnership firm in India on whose behalf the aforesaid
legal notice was sent. Therefore, the plaintiff cannot claim ignorance of the
aforesaid legal notice. This fact has also been stated in paragraph 5 (ii) of
I.A. 16402/2022 and no specific denial thereto has been made on behalf of
the plaintiff.
</p><p id="p_17">6.5     It has further been stated in the aforesaid legal notice that the
defendants no.1 and 2 are acting in connivance with Mr. Ajjaay Advani. The
aforesaid legal notice was duly replied to on behalf of Mr. Ajjaay Advani,
wherein it was stated that the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; has been registered by him
under Classes 7, 9 and 11 as far back as in December, 2015. It was also
stated in the reply that the domain name &#x27;www.aivva.com&#x27; has been
registered by Mr. Ajjaay Advani in February, 2017.
6.6     The plaintiff was aware of the registration of the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; in
favour of Mr. Ajjaay Advani but has failed to challenge the same. Despite
alleging connivance between Mr. Ajjaay Advani and the defendants, Mr.
Ajjaay Advani has not been made a party in the suit.
6.7     In the affidavit filed on behalf of Mr. Ajjaay Advani filed along with
the written statement, it has been stated that Mr. Ajjaay Advani has given

permission to the defendants no.1 and 2 to use the trademark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27;.
6.8   No written authorization was required to be given by a registered
proprietor of a trademark for use of the aforesaid trademark. Reliance in this
regard is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1265850/" id="a_1">Cycle
Corporation of India Ltd. v. T.I. Raleigh Industries Pvt. Ltd. and Ors</a>.,
(1996) 9 SCC 430.
</p><p id="p_18">6.9   It has wrongly been stated in the plaint that the defendants have been
selling TVs under the mark &#x27;AIWA&#x27; as the defendants have only been
selling TVs under the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27;. Reliance has been placed on the
various invoices of the defendants from May, 2016 in this regard.
6.10 No documents have been filed on behalf of the plaintiff showing user
of the trademark &#x27;AIWA&#x27; prior to the user of the defendants. On the other
hand, defendants have filed invoices to show their user of the trademark
&#x27;AIVVA&#x27; since 2016.

</pre><p id="p_34">10.   Since the case of the defendants is primarily premised on the legal
notice dated 17th August, 2020, I propose to deal with the same first.
</p><p id="p_35">11.   The aforesaid legal notice has been sent on behalf of one Aiwa
Consumer Products LLP, a partnership firm having its corporate office at A-
62, Naraina Industrial Area, Phase-I, New Delhi-110028. There is nothing
on record to suggest any connection of the aforesaid entity with the plaintiff
company or the fact that the plaintiff company was aware of sending of the
aforesaid legal notice.
</p><p id="p_36">12.   Counsel for the defendants has vehemently submitted that the term
&#x27;my client&#x27; in the aforesaid notice would include the principals of the entity
sending the notice. However, nothing has been placed on record to show that
the plaintiff company is the principal of the aforesaid entity. Merely because
the entity sending the legal notice uses the name &#x27;AIWA&#x27; or that the plaintiff
company has not initiated any legal action against the aforesaid entity for
having sent the legal notice using the name of the plaintiff company, it
cannot be contended that the aforesaid notice was sent with the knowledge
and consent of the plaintiff company. It was for the defendants to show that
there was a connection between the said entity and the plaintiff company or
that the plaintiff company was aware of the aforesaid legal notice.
</p><p id="p_37">13.   Once again, the fact that the aforesaid legal notice is copied to Nu-
World Global, who is stated to be an assignee of the plaintiff company,
would not be sufficient to attribute knowledge of the aforesaid legal notice
to the plaintiff company. To make good the allegations of suppression and
concealment, the defendants would have to show that it was within the
knowledge of the plaintiff company that the aforesaid legal notice was sent
on their behalf. This has not been done in the present case and therefore, I do

not find merit in the submission of the defendants that the plaintiff was
aware of the legal notice or that they had deliberately suppressed the
aforesaid legal notice in order to obtain an ex parte ad interim injunction
against the defendants.
</p><p id="p_38">14.   In view of the above, there is no reason to disbelieve the submission
made in the plaint that the plaintiff company became aware of the
defendants no.1 and 2 infringing its trademark only in August, 2022, upon
coming across the brochure of the defendants and soon thereafter, the
present suit was filed. In other words, there is no basis to contend that the
interim order passed by this Court on 2nd September, 2022 was passed on the
account of concealment and suppression on behalf of the plaintiff or that
there was any delay on behalf of the plaintiff in filing the present suit. In
view thereof, the judgments relied upon by the defendants in respect of
concealment i.e., Micolube India Ltd. (supra), Thukral Mechanical Works
(supra), Standipack Private Limited (supra) and Kent Ro System Ltd.
(supra) would not have any application to the facts and circumstances of the
present case. Further, the judgment in B.L. and Co. (supra) in respect of
delay would also be of no aid to the defendants.
</p><p id="p_39">15.   A perusal of the Company Master Data in respect of the defendant
no.1 and 2 companies, as available on the website of Registrar of Companies
(ROC), would show that Mr. Ajjaay Advani is neither a Director, nor a
shareholder of the defendant companies. Nor have the defendants placed any
license or other document assigning the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; in their favour from
Mr. Ajjaay Advani so as to justify their use of the said mark. Therefore, the
reliance placed by the defendants on the registration granted in favour of Mr.
Ajjaay Advani is completely misplaced.</p><pre id="pre_5">

16.   The defendants
          defenda    have submitted that they were permitted to use the
</pre><p id="p_40">mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; by Mr. Ajjaay Advani, the registered proprietor thereof. In
this regard, reliance is placed on an affidavit dated 29th September, 2022
allegedly affirmed by Mr. Ajjaay Advani, the register
                                             registered proprietor of the
trademark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; under Classes 7, 9 and 11. The relevant part of the
affidavit is extracted below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">      &quot;4.    That I have granted permission to M/s. Aivva Enterprises

                      Thane 421003, Maharashtra (which are group
             companies) to use my aforesaid said trademark &quot;AIVVA&quot;
             in relation to said goods and business from the very
             beginning.

<p id="p_41">17.   In my considered view, the aforesaid affidavit cannot form the basis
of the defendants using the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; since 2016. The defendants have
failed to place any contemporaneous document executed by Mr. Ajjaay
Advani in their favour that authorized
                            authorized them to use the aforesaid trademarks
from the year 2016. Further, the defendants have wrongly projected
themselves in their brochure as being the registered proprietors of the

trademark                         by using the symbol of the letter &#x27;R&#x27; in a
circle. Even if it is assumed that they were permitted by Mr. Ajjaay Advani
to use the aforesaid trademarks, the brochure should have indicated that the
user was on the basis of permission or license granted by Mr

Advani. By way of the aforesaid affidavit, a right cannot be created in
favour of the defendants to use the trademark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; retrospectively.
Clearly, the aforesaid affidavit has been executed at this belated stage only
to support the defendants in the present case. In this regard, reference may
be made to <a href="/doc/493060/" id="a_8">Section 2(1)(r)(ii)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, which defines

registered trademark to be founded on the written consent of the registered
proprietor, which condition was not contemplated under the old Act.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_19">20.   There is merit in the submissions of the counsel for the plaintiff that
the judgment in Raleigh Industries (supra) is not applicable in the present
case as the same was in the context of the definition of &quot;permitted use&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_43">under the old Act, wherein the permitted use did not include written
agreement. Therefore, the defendants have failed to show that they are either
the registered proprietors of the trademark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; or are permitted users
thereof since 2015. Further, there is no justification for the defendants to
use the stylized marks             and            in respect of which there is
no registration in favour of the defendants or Mr. Ajjaay Advani.
</p>
<p id="p_44">21.   The contention of the defendants that the plaintiff has filed the present
suit without conducting any search of the Trademark Registry, which would
have shown that the mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; is already registered, is also completely
misplaced. The plaintiff company has duly averred in paragraph 14 of the
plaint that the aforesaid mark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27; is registered in the name of Mr.
Ajjaay Advani and has also filed the Trademark Registry search report in
this regard.

party to make a party in the suit. In the present case, the grievance of the
plaintiff is against the defendants no.1 and 2 for selling TVs infringing the
trademarks of the plaintiff
                  plaintiff and therefore, it cannot be said that Mr. Ajjaay
Advani was a necessary or a proper party in the present suit.
</p><p id="p_46">23.   Counsel for the defendants has contended that the plaintiff has
wrongly stated in the plaint that the defendants are using the trademark

                in respect of its products, whereas the defendants have only
used the trademark &#x27;AIVVA&#x27;. However, a perusal of the listing of the
products of the defendants on the website &#x27;www.indiamart.com
                                          &#x27;www.indiamart.com&#x27; clearly
shows that the TVs being sold by the defendants bear the trademark

                of the plaintiff (page 16 of the additional documents filed by
the plaintiff company). The dishonest conduct of the defendant no.1 is writ
large inasmuch as the defendant no.1 is using the word &#x27;aiwa&#x27; as part of its
email address as shown in its product catalogue (page 29 of the documents
filed by the defendants). Therefore, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has
wrongly stated that the defendants are using the trademark &#x27;AIW
                                                           &#x27;AIWA&#x27;.
</p><p id="p_47">24.   A comparison of the marks of the defendants with those of the
plaintiff shows that the marks being used by the defendants are visually and
phonetically similar to the plaintiff&#x27;s marks. The products being sold by the
defendants are similar to the products
                              products of the plaintiff. The plaintiff has
placed on record various trademark registrations obtained in different
jurisdictions including India. On account of the publicity and long use of
the &#x27;AIWA&#x27; mark and its stylized versions by the plaintiff and the ex

the plaintiff has acquired enormous goodwill and reputation worldwide. The

plaintiff has also placed on record sufficient material to demonstrate prior
use of the trademarks in India. The defendants&#x27; use of the impugned marks
is prima facie dishonest and nothing but attempt to ride on the goodwill and
reputation of the plaintiff&#x27;s marks as also to cause confusion in the market.

its favour. Balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff. Irreparable
harm would be caused not only to the plaintiff but also to the public if the
