<p id="p_1">M.M.Kumar, CJ  
</p><p id="p_2">1. This letters patent appeal under Clause 12 of the Letters
patent is directed against the order dated 04.07.2014 rendered
by a learned Single Judge of this Court upholding the order
dated 11.05.2013 passed by learned 1st Additional District
Judge, Jammu. The aforesaid order was challenged by 
invoking the provisions of Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India read with Sections 103 and 104 of the
Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. It is further appropriate to
notice that the learned Additional District Judge was hearing an
appeal against interim order dated 31.12.2010 passed by
Munsiff, Akhnoor in a suit for declaration-cum-permanent
prohibitory injunction. In accordance with the interim order the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">2</span>
parties were asked to maintain status quo, which was set aside
by the learned 1st Additional District Judge. That order has been
further upheld by the learned Single Judge.
</p><p id="p_3">2. Mr. Vijay Gupta, learned counsel for the respondent, at
the outset has raised a preliminary objection by submitting that
the appeal under Clause XII of the Letters Patent is not
maintainable as it emerges from an order of a Single Judge
passed under supervisory jurisdiction. He further submitted that
in any case intra Court appeals under Clause XII of the Letters
Patent are now barred by virtue of the amendment made in the
Code of Civil Procedure by adding Section 100-A.
</p><p id="p_4">3. In order to decide the aforesaid issue it would not be
necessary to notice the facts. In any case facts in detail have
been noticed by the learned Single Judge and no repetition
would be necessary particularly in view of the legal issue raised
before us.
</p><p id="p_5">4. Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the respondents, has
placed reliance on a judgment of the Full Bench of Gujrat High
Court rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/1728981/" id="a_1">Gujrat State Road Transport
Corporation v. Firoze M. Mogal and another</a>, AIR 2014 Gujarat
</p><p id="p_6">33. According to Mr. Gupta, the Full Bench has taken into
consideration a large number of judgments of Honble the
Supreme Court and has rightly reached the conclusions, which  3
are summed up in para 258 of the judgment. Learned counsel 
has maintained that the aforesaid conclusions reached by the
Full Bench of Gujrat High Court do not leave any manner of
doubt that the present letters patent appeal would not be
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_7">5. Mr. O.P.Thakur, learned counsel for the appellant has,
however, submitted that when petition is filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_2">Article 227</a>
of the Constitution of India in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction
then an original order is passed by issuing a writ of certiorari
directing the subordinate Courts to function within their bounds.
In that regard learned counsel has placed reliance on a
judgment of Honble the Supreme Court rendered in the case of
<a href="/doc/1016548/" id="a_3">Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai</a>, AIR 2003 SC 3044. On the   
basis of the aforesaid analogy Mr. Thakur has argued that the
basic function of exercising supervisory jurisdiction by the High
Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Article 227</a> is to correct errors of jurisdiction.
According to the learned counsel, if the Courts below have
exceeded jurisdiction or refused to exercise jurisdiction vested
in it or there is grave illegality committed then the High Court
may issue an appropriate writ. Applying the aforesaid
principles, Mr. Thakur has argued that the refusal to exercise
jurisdiction by the learned Single Judge has resulted in passing
of an order on original side, which would be amenable to letter
patent appeal. Mr. Thakur has also placed reliance on two other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">4</span>
judgments of Honble the Supreme Court rendered in the cases 
of <a href="/doc/1373037/" id="a_5">M/s M.M.T.C. Limited v. Commission of Commercial Tax</a>,  
AIR 2009 SC 1349 and <a href="/doc/1243718/" id="a_6">M/s Lokmat Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. v.   
Shankarprasad</a>, AIR 1999 SC 2423, wherein it has been held 
that if a Single Judge has exercised jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article
226</a>, a letters patent appeal would be maintainable. If
jurisdiction is exercised under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_8">Article 227</a>, such an appeal
would not be maintainable. However, it has been submitted that
if the Single Judge of High Court while considering the petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Article 226</a> or 227 fails to indicate under which provision
he has decided the matter then the matter may be considered 
in its proper prospective in an Letters Patent Appeal. Therefore,
Mr. Thakur has submitted that the appeal would be
maintainable if it is viewed from that aspect.
</p><p id="p_8">6. On merits, Mr. Thakur has argued that a substantial
question of law for determination of this Court would arise as to
whether any right could emerge from an agreement to sell in
respect of immovable property. The Courts below have
answered the aforesaid question one way or the other.
</p><p id="p_9">7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after
perusing the record with their able assistance, we are unable to
persuade ourselves to take the view that the instant appeal
under Clause XII of the Letters Patent is maintainable. The
order of the learned Single Judge impugned in this appeal by  5
no stretch of imagination can be regarded as the one passed
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India read with Section
103 of the Constitution of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. The only
possibility is that such an order could be passed by exercising
supervisory jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_11">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
India read with Section 104 of the Constitution of Jammu &amp;
Kashmir. It has also remained undisputed that the jurisdiction
conferred by <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_12">Article 227</a> or Section 104 is not an original
jurisdiction. It is well settled proposition of law as opined by
various Courts. (<a href="/doc/426329/" id="a_13">See Hudi Goshaon v. Sudi Goshaon</a>, AIR 1962  
Punjab 467; <a href="/doc/680916/" id="a_14">Sukhendu Bikash Barua v. Hare Krishan De</a>, AIR  
1953 Cal 636 and In re v. Tirupuliswamy Naidu ,AIR 1955
Madras 287). At this stage it would be profitable to read Clause
XII of Letters Patent, which is set out below in extenso:-
And we do further ordain that an appeal shall lie to the
said High Court of Judicature from the judgment (not being a
judgment passed in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a
court subject to the superintendence of the said High Court,
and not being an order made in the exercise of revisional
jurisdiction, and not being a sentence or order passed or
made in the exercise of the power of superintendence) of
one Judge of the said High Court or one Judge of any
Division court and that notwithstanding anything
hereinbefore provided an appeal shall lie to the said High
Court from a Judgment of one judge of the said High Court
or one Judge of any Division Court, consistently with the
provisions of Civil. P.C. made in the exercise of appellate
jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the
exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to the
superintendence of the said High Court where the judge who
passed the judgment declares that the case is a fit one for
appeal but that the right of appeal from other judgments of
the judges of the said High Court or of such Division Court
shall be to us, Our Heirs or successors and be heard by our
board of Judicial Advisers for report to us.  6
</p><p id="p_10">8. The aforesaid Clause XII of the Letters Patent is akin to
the Clause incorporated in the Letters Patent governing such
proceedings in other High Courts. Once it is concluded that the
learned Single Judge while passing the impugned order had
exercised jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_15">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of
India read with Section 104 of the Constitution of Jammu &amp;
Kashmir then it is not difficult to hold that the letters patent
appeal would not be maintainable. The issue is no longer res
integra. Honble the Supreme Court in categorical terms has
opined in numerous judgments that letters patent appeal would
not be maintainable against an order passed by a learned
Single Judge in exercise of power of superintendence under
<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_16">Article 227.</a> In that regard reliance may be placed on judgments
rendered in the cases of <a href="/doc/1673900/" id="a_17">Ramesh Chandra Shankla v. Vikram  
Cement</a> (2008) 14 SCC 58, <a href="/doc/508653/" id="a_18">Kesho Ram v. Hem Raj</a> (2008) 17    
SCC 96, <a href="/doc/667104/" id="a_19">Mohd. Saud and another v. Dr. (Maj) Shaikh Mahfooz  
&amp; others</a> (2010) 13 SCC 517 and <a href="/doc/1668065/" id="a_20">Shalini Shyam Shetty &amp;  
another v. Rajendra Shankar Patil</a>, (2010) 8 SCC 329.
</p><p id="p_11">9. In the case of Mohd. Saud (supra) it has been held that
against an interim order no letters patent appeal would be
maintainable. The view of Honble the Supreme Court is
discernible from the following paras, which are extracted in
extenso:-
</p><p id="p_12">13. While at first glance this argument may appear
plausible but when we go deeper into it, we will realize that  7
it has no merit. It would be strange to hold that while two
appeals will be maintainable against the interlocutory
orders of a District Judge, only one appeal will be
maintainable against a final judgment of the District Judge.
</p><p id="p_13"> 14. It may be noted that there seems to be some
apparent contradiction in Section 100-A as amended in
2002. While in one part of Section 100-A it is stated where
any appeal from an original or appellate decree or order is
heard and decided by a Single Judge of a High Court
(emphasis supplied), in the following part it is stated no
further appeal shall lie from the judgment and decree of
such Single Judge. Thus while one part of Section 100-A
refers to an order, which to our mind would include even an
interlocutory order, the latter part of the section mentions
judgment and decree. 
</p><p id="p_14"> 15. To resolve this conflict we have to adopt a
purposive interpretation. The whole purpose of introducing
Section 100-A was to reduce the number of appeals as the 
public in India was being harassed by the numerous
appeals provided in the statute. If we look at the matter
from that angle it will immediately become apparent that
the LPA in question was not maintainable because if it is
held to be maintainable then the result will be that against
an interlocutory order of the District Judge there may be
two appeals, first to the learned Single Judge and then to
the Division Bench of the High Court, but against a final
judgment of the District Judge there can be only one
appeal. This in our opinion would be strange, and against
the very purpose of the object of Section 100-A, that is, to
curtail the number of appeals.
</p><p id="p_15">16. It is well settled that the modern method of
interpretation is purposive vide <a href="/doc/1013766/" id="a_21">Directorate of Enforcement
v. Deepak Mahajan</a> (1994) 3 SCC 440, <a href="/doc/1353651/" id="a_22">Hindustan Lever  
Ltd. v. Ashok Vishnu Kate</a> (1995) 6 SCC 326 (vide SCC 
pp. 347-48:JT P.631) and <a href="/doc/794165/" id="a_23">Workmen v. American Express   
International Banking Corpn</a>. (1985) 4 SCC 71.
</p><p id="p_16">17. We are of the opinion that the apparent contradiction in
Section 100-A as amended in 2002 was only due to bad  
drafting, and not much can be made out of it once we
understand the purpose of Section 100-A.
</p><p id="p_17">18. For the reasons given above, we are of the opinion that
the Full Bench of the High Court has taken a correct view.
Thus there is no force in these appeals, which are
accordingly dismissed. No costs. (emphasis added) 
</p><p id="p_18">10. In the case of Ramesh Chandra Shankla (supra) similar
view has been taken, which is discernible from the following
observations:-  8
48. In our considered opinion, however, on the facts and
in the circumstances of the present case, the petitions
instituted by the Company and decided by a Single Judge 
of the High Court could not be said to be original
proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. We are
clearly of the view that the learned Single Judge had
decided the petitions in exercise of power of
superintendence under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_25">Article 227</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_19">49. We have already referred to the facts of the case.
According to the Company, voluntary retirement was
accepted by the employees. They thereafter challenged
the action on the ground that the acceptance was not
voluntary but they were compelled to opt for the scheme
and were paid some amount which was not in consonance   
with law and the action of not allowing them to continue in
the employment amounted to removal from service. They, 
therefore, approached Labour Court for an appropriate
relief. The Labour Court entertained complaints and issued
notice.
</p><p id="p_20">50. The Company appeared and raised preliminary 
objections. Issues were framed and a prayer was made by 
the Company to decide issues of law as preliminary
issues which prayer was rejected by the Labour Court. The
Company approached Industrial Court which also did not
interfere with the order of the Labour Court. That order was
again challenged by the Company by filing petitions in the
High Court and the learned Single Judge dismissed the
petitions. In view of the aforesaid facts, we have no
doubt that the learned Single Judge was exercising power
of superintendence over a Court/Tribunal subordinate to it
under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_26">Article 227</a> of the Constitution. Obviously, a remedy
of intra court appeal was not available. We, therefore, hold
that the Division Bench was right in coming to the
conclusion that intra court appeals filed by the Company
were not maintainable. We see no infirmity in that part of
the order. The contention of the appellant Company is,
therefore, rejected. (emphasis added)
 In the case of Shalini Shyam Shetty (supra), their
Lordships of the Supreme Court took the view that jurisdiction
under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_27">Article 227</a> is neither original nor it is appellate. It is for
both administrative and judicial superintendence. A proceeding
under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_28">Article 227</a> could never be governed under the original
side rules of the High Court. In the cases where the High Court
exercises jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_29">Article 227</a>, it is entirely  9
discretionary and it cannot be claimed as a matter of right and
no appeal would be maintainable from an order passed by a
Single Judge of a High Court in exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_30">Article
227</a>, which remedy is available in respect of an order passed by
learned Writ Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. (See
paras 46 to 48).
</p><p id="p_21"> Their lordships of Honble the Supreme Court has still
taken a similar view in the case of Kesho Ram (supra) in which
appeal was filed against an order of the High Court of Jammu &amp;
Kashmir. A Division Bench of this Court had held that no letter
patent appeal against an order passed in exercise of revisional
jurisdiction would be available. Accordingly appeal was
dismissed which led to the filing of further appeal to Supreme
Court. The view of the Supreme Court is discernible from paras
6, 7 and 8, which read thus:-
</p><p id="p_22">6. Dr. Singhvi, on the other hand, has pointed out that
an order rejecting an application in review was not
appealable and the only remedy for having such an order
set aside was to file an application for review under order
47 Rule 7(2), but when such an application had been
dismissed, no further application could be entertained by
virtue of Order 47 Rule 9 CPC. He has also stressed that a
perusal of Clause 12 of the Letters Patent also spelt out
that an order in revision was not appealable under the said
clause and that in any case, it was open to the appellant to
challenge the order dated 8-9-1987, in appeal.
</p><p id="p_23"> 7. We have heard the learned counsel for the
parties very carefully. We find substance in Mr. Singhvis
argument based on Order 47 Rule 7(2) but as of today, the
prime issue before us is with regard to the maintainability
of the letters patent appeal. A bare perusal of Clause 12
reveals that an appeal against an order in revision is not
maintainable.
</p><p id="p_24"> 8. We are, therefore, of the opinion that all the
observations/findings recorded by the Letters Patent Bench
were non est being completely unauthorized in law. We  10
have therefore no hesitation in dismissing the present
appeal as well. IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII..
</p><p id="p_25">IIIIIII.. We, however, dismiss the appeal. No
costs. (emphasis added) 
</p><p id="p_26">11. The aforesaid authoritative pronouncements by Honble
the Supreme Court have binding effect under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_32">Article 141</a> of the
Constitution of India as it is law declared by the Supreme Court.
Therefore, the conclusion is evident that the appeal is not
maintainable. The judgment of the Division Bench rendered in
the case of Sudershana Gupta and another v. Girdhari Lal
(2013) 3 JKJ 547 or any other judgment to the contrary on
which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the
appellant are held to be per incuriam and cannot have a binding
force.
</p><p id="p_27">12. Clause XII of the Letters Patent came up for
consideration before another Division Bench of this Court in the
case of The J&amp;K Co-operative Bank v. Shams-ud-din Bacha,  
AIR 1970 J&amp;K 190. The Division Bench also took the view that
the Letters Patent Appeal was not maintainable against an
order passed in exercise of jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_33">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India or Section 104 of the Constitution of J&amp;K
and proceeded to observe as under:-
</p><p id="p_28">The above provision of the Letters Patent clearly
excludes an appeal from an order made by a Single judge
of the court in exercise of his revisional jurisdiction, as also
an appeal from a sentence or order passed or made by 
him in exercise of his power of superintendence. An order
passed under S.104 of the Constitution of Jammu and 
Kashmir is nothing but an order made in exercise of the
supervisory jurisdiction conferred on the court by the  11
Constitution. In these circumstances, Cl. 12 of the Letters
patent excludes appeals from such orders. (emphasis
added) 
</p><p id="p_29">13. The view of the Division Bench is consistent with the view
taken by Honble the Supreme Court in various judgments
referred above. <a href="/doc/1668065/" id="a_34">In Shalini Shyam Shetty and another v.
Rajendra Shankar Patil</a>, AIR 2010 SCW 6387, their Lordships 
of the Supreme Court proceeded to hold that the letters patent
appeal against the order passed under revisional/supervisory
jurisdiction was not maintainable. In fact the practice of
entertaining petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> by Bombay High Court
has been deprecated. After considering its earlier judgments
including the one cited by Mr. O.P.Thakur, their Lordships of
the Supreme Court formulated various principles to conclude
that dispute relating to property seeking declaration cum
permanent prohibitory injunction would involve disputed
questions of fact and such dispute cannot be entertained by the
High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_36">Article 226</a> or under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_37">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India. Even if it is presumed that the learned
Single Judge has passed the order under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_38">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution then the proper remedy for the appellant would be
to file Special Leave Petition instead of invoking Clause XII of
the Letters Patent.
</p><p id="p_30">14. In the present case learned Single Judge was necessarily
hearing a petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_39">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">12</span>
and has upheld the order dated 11.05.2013 passed by the 
learned 1st Additional District Judge, who had set aside the
order of status quo passed by the learned Munsiff, Akhnoor
directing maintenance of status quo in a suit for declarationcum-
permanent prohibitory injunction. It is true that the view
taken by the learned Single Judge upholding the order of
learned Additional District Judge in stricto sensu is not an order
passed on appeal, yet the learned Single Judge was
necessarily hearing a petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_40">Article 227</a> of the
Constitution of India read with Section 104 of the Constitution of
Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Such an order of the learned Single Judge 
cannot be subjected to letters patent appeal.
</p><p id="p_31">15. We further place reliance on some of the following
conclusions recorded in para 258 by the Full Bench of Gujrat
High Court in the case of Gujrat State Road Transport
Corporation (supra).
</p><p id="p_32">In view of our aforesaid analysis, we proceed to record our
conclusion in seriatim.
</p><p id="p_33">i) A power to issue the writ is original and the jurisdiction
exercised is original jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_34">ii) Proceedings under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_41">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
India are in exercise of original jurisdiction of the High
Court whereas the proceedings initiated under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_42">Article 227</a>
of the Constitution are supervisory in nature.
</p><p id="p_35">iii) IIIIIIIIIIIIIII..
</p><p id="p_36">iv) IIIIIIIIIIIIIII.
</p><p id="p_37">v) IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</p><p id="p_38"> vi) IIIIIIIIIIIIIII..  13
</p><p id="p_39">vii) IIIIIIIIIIIIIII..
</p><p id="p_40">viii) IIIIIIIIIIIIIII.
</p><p id="p_41">ix) IIIIIIIIIIIIIII.
</p><p id="p_42">x) IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</p><p id="p_43">xi) If the learned Single Judge, in exercise of a purported
power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_43">Article 227</a> of the Constitution sets aside the
order of Tribunal or Court below and at the same time, the
essential conditions for issue of writ of certiorari are
absent, no appeal will be maintainable against such order
in view of the specific bar created under Clause 15 of the
Letters Patent itself and such an order can be challenged
only by way of a Special Leave Petition before the
Supreme Court. 
</p><p id="p_44">To put it very explicitly, take a case where a petition is only
under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_44">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, invoking
superintending powers of the High Court and not under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. After examining the
matter, if the court finds substance in the petition and sets
aside the order of an authority, court or a tribunal, then
against such an order, an LPA would not lie on the
argument that since the court has set aside the order it has
decided the matter on merits having found substance in the
same. 
</p><p id="p_45">IIIIIIIIIIIIIII..
</p><p id="p_46">xii)If a learned Single Judge, in exercise of a purported
power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_46">Article 227</a> of the Constitution modifies the
order of Tribunal/Authority or Court below and thereby
partly allows a petition to a certain extent, then in such
circumstances, it could not be said that the Court exercised
its certiorari jurisdiction and no appeal will be maintainable
against such order in view of the specific bar created under
Clause 15 of the Letters Patent itself However, if a learned
Single Judge, in purported exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_47">Article
226</a> of the Constitution of India, issues a writ of certiorari,
although the same is not maintainable, an appeal under
Clause 15 of the Letters Patent would nevertheless be
maintainable against such order.

</p><p id="p_48">IIIIIIIIIIIIII...
</p><p id="p_49">xiii) IIIIIIIIIIII...
</p><p id="p_50">xiv) IIIIIIIIIIII...
</p><p id="p_51">xv) When a remedy for filing the Revision under Section
115 of the Civil Procedure Code has been expressly
barred, then in such a case, a petition under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_48">Article 227</a> of  14
the Constitution of India would lie and not a writ petition
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_49">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. When the
Parliament has thought fit to restrict the powers under
Section 115 of the Code with a definite object, then, under
such circumstances an order which is not revisable under
Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be
challenged by way of filing a Writ Petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_50">Article 226</a>
of the Constitution invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of the
High Court and that too an interlocutory order passed by
the Civil Court in a Regular Suit proceedings. (emphasis
added) 
</p><p id="p_52">16. A close scrutiny of the aforesaid principles culled out by
the Full Bench of Gujrat High Court would lead us to conclude
that the letters patent appeal would not be maintainable as it is
primarily directed against the order of 1st Additional District
Judge who was hearing an appeal against the order of Munsiff,
Akhnoor. In cases where a revision petition is barred, a petition
under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_51">Article 227</a> would lie in appropriate cases. Once no
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_52">Article 226</a> of the Constitution would be
entertainable
particularly when the Parliament has thought fit to restrict
the powers under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure
with a definite object, then an order which is not revisable under
Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure would equally not
be a challengeable by filing a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_53">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India read with Section 103 of the
Constitution of Jammu &amp; Kashmir; and particularly when an
interlocutory order passed by the Civil Court in a regular suit
proceedings is subject matter of challenge. There is, thus, no
scope to conclude that the appeal is maintainable and complete

answer has been provided by various judgments of Honble the
Supreme Court as well as a Division Bench of this Court. The
Full Bench of the Gujrat High Court in the case of Gujrat State
Road Transport Corporation (supra) has also placed reliance
on various judgments of Honble the Supreme Court and has 
thus concluded that letters patent appeal against an order
passed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_54">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India would not
be maintainable as <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_55">Article 227</a> confers supervisory jurisdiction,
which cannot be regarded as original jurisdiction.

O.P.Thakur, learned counsel for the appellant but refrain from
doing so as we are satisfied that most of those judgments stand
considered by Honble the Supreme Court in the above referred
cases.

is not maintainable and the same is dismissed as such.
