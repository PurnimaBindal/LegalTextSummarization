          During her stay at her sasural, she had begotten three children aged

          about three and half years, two year, one years. Since after marriage,

          husband Manoranjan Thakur, brother in-law Ranjeet Thakur and

          mother in-law (named not known) have advanced their demand of

          Rs.1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac) in cash and a motorcycle in lieu of

          dowry. He, being a poor peasant was unable to fulfil the same.

          Whenever his sister made protest, she was assaulted by aforesaid

          three persons as well as she was also regularly mentally tortured. On

          20.10.2010 in the evening hours, he received call from an unknown,

          divulging the fact that after murder of his sister her dead body has

          been concealed by her ‗Sasuralwala'. After getting this information,

          he along with his mother Indira Devi came to Hisua and then had

          gone to sasural of his sister. They found lock hanging. On query

          from neighbours, he came to know that Ranjan Thakur had gone

          along with children after locking the house in the morning of

          16.10.2010, but was not accompanied by his sister as well as one

          child. In the aforesaid background, the informant formed opinion

          with regard to murder of his sister along with child in the

          background, non-fulfilment of demand of dowry as well as getting

          dead body concealed/ disposed of.

          in-law and followed with the investigation. After completing the

          same, charge sheet was submitted only against the appellant while

          the investigation has been kept opened with regard to other co-

          accused. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nawadah took

          cognizance of an offence against the appellant consequent thereupon

          the trial commenced and concluded in a manner, the subject matter

          of instant appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                             4. The defence case as is evident from mode of cross-

          examination as well as statement recorded under <a href="/doc/1780550/" id="a_8">Section 311</a> of the

          Cr. P. C. is of complete denial of occurrence. It has also been

          pleaded that deceased was carrying illicit relationship with PW-4

          Shyamal Kishore Thakur and on having exposure of the aforesaid

          intimate relationship, it is he (PW-4) who had murdered her.

          Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the marriage was

          solemnized in the year 2002 and not in the year 2005, as divulged by

          the prosecution. On that very score, apart from examination of two

          DWs, a Lagan Patri (Exhibit-A) has also been brought up on record.

</p><p id="p_7">                             5. While assailing the judgment of conviction and

          sentence, it has been submitted on behalf of appellant that first of all

          the prosecution should have come with positive, concrete,

          trustworthy evidence with regard to death of deceased. It has also

          been submitted that plea of defence should not be taken into account

          because of the fact that the onus in terms of <a href="/doc/462524/" id="a_9">Section 113(B)</a> of the

          Evidence Act will shift only when prosecution succeeds in proving

          all the ingredients so prescribed with regard to <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_10">Section 304(B)</a> I.P.C.

</p><p id="p_8">                             6. It has been submitted that a dead body was

          recovered which was completely decomposed and was not

          identifiable which is itself evident from the evidence of Doctor (PW-

</p><p id="p_9">          3) Paragraph-3 and on account thereof, it was bounded duty of the

          prosecution to have substantiated with the cogent, conclusive

          evidence that the dead body, which was recovered, was the dead

          body of Suprita Devi and for that at least ‗DNA' test should have

          been carried out. More particularly, when the defence had

          categorically suggested prevalence of intimate relationship amongst

          PW-4 with deceased and further suggesting that it was PW-4 at

          whose instance, at whose involvement there happens to be

          disappearance of Suprita Devi, so submitted that the first ingredient

          of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_11">Section 304(B)</a> of the Indian Penal Code on account of non-

          identification of deceased, is found deficient one as controversy still

          persist regarding death of Suprita.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                             7. It has then been submitted that as per prosecution

          version the date of marriage has been shown as 03.07.2005 which

          the appellant had categorically challenged. Prosecution could not be

          able to bring forward any supportive documents by way of

          corroboration of the oral evidence contrary to it, apart from

          suggesting each and every PWs, also examined two DWs as well as

          had also exhibited Lagan Patri as Exhibit-A. Hence, the version of

          the defence looks more plausible than that of prosecution and

          counting there from, the barrier having been prescribed therefor is

          found safely crossed. That means to say, period of seven years,

          mandated under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_12">Section 304(B)</a> of the Indian Penal Code is found

          not proved.
</p>
<p id="p_11">                             8. Now coming to the demand of dowry, it has also

          been submitted that from the evidence of PW-2, the informant, it is

          apparent that the case was instituted after duly consultation and that

          happens to be reason behind introduction of certain allegations in the

          fard-bayan otherwise, the evidence of prosecution witnesses on that

          very score is found full of contradiction, embellishment as well as

          due development is also perceived. Consequent thereupon, the

          demand of dowry is found a patch work while proceeding with the

          prosecution version.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                             9. With regard to torture exhorted upon the deceased

          soon before the occurrence, another limb of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_13">Section 304(B)</a> of the

          Indian Penal Code has also been controverted by the learned counsel

          for the appellant. On this score, it has been submitted that from the
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.853 of 2012 dt.19-02-2014                      6




          evidence of all the PWs inconsonance with the evidence of PW-6

          (Investigating Officer), material contradictions in the evidence of

          witnesses on this score is found duly exposed and as such, the

          prosecution utterly fails.
</p>
<p id="p_13">                             10. Apart from this, it has also been submitted that

          own brother in-law (Bahnoi) of PW-2 and at whose instance the

          marriage was finalized while being examined as PW-5 had gone

          volte-face to the prosecution. It has also been submitted that there

          happens to be inordinate delay in launching the prosecution and on

          that very score, there happens to be conflicting version of PW-1

          mother of deceased as well as PW-2, informant as well as brother of

          deceased. This crucial aspect is indicative of the fact that on one

          pretext or the other the appellant has been victimized without any

          rhyme and reason.
</p>
<p id="p_14">                             11. It has further been submitted that from the

          evidence of PW-6, the Investigating Officer, it is apparent that he

          had not conducted investigation of this case in impartial manner.

          After going through evidence, it is apparent that he had not gone

          inside the house of the appellant. He had not examined neighbours

          of the appellant who could have exposed the actual event and in

          likewise manner none were cited as prosecution witnesses. So, by

          his illegal activity or incompetency he had blurred the fate of the
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.853 of 2012 dt.19-02-2014                      7




          appellant side by side by his defective or collusive investigation

          interest of the appellant is found prejudiced. Therefore, it has been

          submitted that prosecution has not succeeded in proving its case

          beyond all reasonable doubt. As such, the judgment of conviction

          and sentence so recorded by the learned trial Court happens to be

          bad, illegal, perverse and is fit to be set aside.

</p><p id="p_15">                             12. On the other hand, the learned Additional Public

          Prosecutor while supporting the finding so recorded by the leaned

          trial Court submitted that "falsus in uno falsus in omnibus" is not

          applicable and that happens to be reason behind prevalence of theory

          of separating the chaff from brain that means to say separate the

          truth from the falsehood and for that, an obligation has been put over

          shoulder of courts to discharge their functions under such manner

          while appreciating the evidence of a witness. It has further been

          submitted that from the fard-beyan itself it is apparent that

          prosecution witnesses are resident of far-far away from P.O. village,

          which the defence had himself tested by cross-examining PW-2 and

          on account thereof, the delay whatever may be is not at all found to

          be hazardous to the prosecution case. Then it has been submitted

          that from the evidence of prosecution witnesses including PW-6 the

          Investigating Officer, none of the family members of the appellant

          including the appellant along with his children, wife (deceased) was

          traced out at the time of their presence at the place of occurrence

          instead thereof the house was properly locked and that happens to be

          circumstance which the accused should have explained.

</p><p id="p_16">                             13. Now coming to demand of dowry as well as

          torture meted out by the deceased soon before her death is itself

          found incorporated right from fard-beyan. Mere not stating the

          incidence in a way as incorporated under statement in terms of

          <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_14">Section 161</a> of the Cr. P. C. may be a logical contradiction but not a

          material contradiction, in some and circumstance, and which is itself

          found from the evidence of PW-6. Therefore, there happens to be no

          material contradiction which could go to the root of the prosecution

          case.
</p>
<p id="p_17">                             14. It has further been submitted that neither PW-6

          was cross-examined on the score that the dead body was not that of

          Suprita Devi nor the Doctor (PW-3) was ever cross-examined that

          the dead body was not identifiable. Not only this, the inquest report

          on this very score has also not been challenged more so when the

          ocular evidence so stated by PW-1 and PW-2 claiming to have

          identified the dead body that of deceased. It has further been

          submitted that accused was very much conscious on this very score

          and that happens to be reason behind while suggesting PW-2, he was

          suggested that on account of illicit relationship with PW-4 Shyamal

          or at the instance of Shyamal Kishore Thakur who had got her dead

          body concealed and in the aforesaid background, it has also been

          submitted that the controversy so raised on behalf of appellant

          regarding death as well as identification of dead body vanished. At

          the present juncture, it has also been submitted that deceased being

          one of the inmates of appellant and was being cared thereby was

          under obligation to explain that in what manner deceased had gone

          missing from his place.
</p>
<p id="p_18">                             15. Then it has been submitted that in similar manner

          the controversy with regard to date of marriage as propounded by

          the appellant is nothing but an event so brought up by the appellant

          out of despairing condition. To support the same, it has been

          submitted that two DWs have been examined. The first one who had

          got not connection with the family affairs of appellant while the

          second one also carrying similar status proved formal by way of

          exhibiting Lagan Patri. Having no evidence of having been prepared

          in his presence after performing rituals as well as having no

          evidence of being served with a copy thereof on prosecution party,

          so submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case, the

          interference.

          information report, post mortem report etc. it is also evident from the

          lower court record that altogether six PWs have been examined out

                                  shows that there must be material to show

<p id="p_31">                                  The expression ―soon before‖ is very
                                  relevant      where        <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_29">Section   113-B</a>    of   the

                                  pressed into service. The prosecution is
                                  obliged to show that soon before the
                                  occurrence there was cruelty or harassment
                                  and only in that case presumption operates.
                                  Evidence in that regard has to be led in by
                                  the prosecution. ―Soon before‖ is a relative
                                  term and it would depend upon the
                                  circumstances         of     each    case    and   no
                                  straitjacket formula can be laid down as to
                                  what would constitute a period of soon
                                  before the occurrence. It would be hazardous
                                  to indicate any fixed period, and that brings
                                  in the importance of a proximity test both for
                                  the proof of an offence of dowry death as
                                  well as for raising a presumption under

                                  Section113-B of the Evidence Act is present
                                  with the idea of proximity test. No definite
                                  period has been indicated and the expression
                                  ―soon before‖ is not defined. A reference to
                                  the expression ―soon before‖ used in Section
                                  114 Illustration (a) of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_33">Evidence Act</a> is
                                  relevant. It lays down that a court may
                                  presume that a man who is in the possession
                                  of goods soon after the theft, is either the
                                  thief who has received the goods knowing
                                  them to be stolen, unless he can account for
                                  his possession. The determination of the
                                  period which can come within the term
                                  ―soon before‖ is left to be determined by the
                                  courts,       depending       upon      facts    and
                                  circumstances          of   each     case.   Suffice,
                                  however, to indicate that the expression
                                  ―soon before‖ would normally imply that the
                                  interval should not be much between the
                                  cruelty or harassment concerned and the
                                  death in question. There must be existence of
                                  a proximate and life link between the effect
                                  of cruelty based on dowry demand and the
                                  death concerned. If the alleged incident of
                                  cruelty is remote in time and has become
                                  stale enough not to disturb the mental
                                  equilibrium of the woman concerned, it
                                  would be of no consequence.‖

                                  the most significant expression used in the
                                  section is ―soon before her death‖. In our
                                  view, the expression ―soon before her death‖
                                  cannot be given a restricted or a narrower
                                  meaning. They must be understood in their
                                  plain language and with reference to their
                                  meaning in common parlance. These are the
                                  provisions relating to human behaviour and,
                                  therefore, cannot be given such a narrower
                                  meaning, which would defeat the very
                                  purpose of the provisions of the Act. Of
                                  course, these are penal provisions and must
                                  receive strict construction. But, even the rule
                                  of strict construction requires that the
                                  provisions have to be read in conjunction
                                  with other relevant provisions and scheme of
                                  the Act. Further, the interpretation given
                                  should be one which would avoid absurd
                                  results on the one hand and would further the
                                  object and cause of the law so enacted on the

                                  the concept of reasonable time is the best
                                  criteria to be applied for appreciation and
                                  examination of such cases. This Court in

                                  of time by employing the words ―soon before
                                  her death‖ is to emphasize the idea that her

                                  aftermath ofsuch cruelty or harassment. In
                                  other words, there should be a reasonable, if
                                  not direct, nexus between her death and the
                                  dowry related cruelty or harassment inflicted
                                  on her.
</p><p id="p_40">                                         21. Similar view was expressed by this
                                  Court in <a href="/doc/280401/" id="a_41">Yashoda v. State of M.P</a>., where this
                                  Court stated that determination of the period
                                  would depend on the facts and circumstances
                                  of a given case. However, the expression
                                  would normally imply that there has to be
                                  reasonable time gap between the cruelty
                                  inflicted and the death in question. If this is
                                  so, the legislature in its wisdom would have
                                  specified any period which would attract the
                                  provisions of this section. However, there
                                  must be existence of proximate link between
                                  the acts of cruelty along with the demand of
                                  dowry and the death of the victim. For want
                                  of any specific period, the concept of
                                  reasonable period would be applicable. Thus,
                                  the cruelty, harassment and demand of
                                  dowry should not be so ancient, whereafter,
                                  the couple and the family members have
                                  lived happily and that it would result in
                                  abuse of the said protection. Such demand or
                                  harassment may not strictly and squarely fall
                                  within the scope of these provisions unless

                                  definite evidence was led to show to the
                                  contrary. These matters, of course, will have
                                  to     be     examined          on   the    facts    and

</p><p id="p_41">                                          23. The Court cannot ignore one of the
                                  cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence
                                  that a suspect in the Indian law is entitled to
                                  the     protection         of   <a href="/doc/655638/" id="a_42">Article    20</a>   of   the
                                  Constitution of India as well as has a
                                  presumption of innocence in his favour. In
                                  other words, the rule of law requires a person
                                  to be innocent till proved guilty. The concept
                                  of deeming fiction is hardly applicable to the
                                  criminal jurisprudence. In contradistinction
                                  to this aspect, the legislature has applied the
                                  concept of deeming fiction to the provisions
                                  of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_43">Section 304-B</a>. Where other ingredients of

                                  husband or all relatives shall be deemed to
                                  have caused her death. In other words, the
                                  offence shall be deemed to have been
                                  committed by fiction of law. Once the
                                  prosecution proves its case with regard to the
                                  basic ingredients of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_45">Section 304-B</a>, the Court
                                  will presume by deemed fiction of law that

                                  has caused her death. Such a presumption
                                  can be drawn by the Court keeping in view

</p><p id="p_60">                             18. Keeping with the aforesaid principle in mind,

          now the factual aspect of case is to be judged.

</p><p id="p_61">                             19. From the evidence on record, it is evident that

          marriage of Suprita Devi with the appellant is not at all denied.

          Appellant has raised controversy with regard to date of marriage.

          According to prosecution, the date of marriage happens to be

          03.07.2005 while according to the appellant marriage had

          consummated in the year 2002. Therefore, first of all, the evidence

          on this very score adduced on behalf of rival parties is to be looked

          into. PW-1, mother of Suprita Devi had disclosed that she was

          married with Manoranjan Thakur @ Ranjan Thakur in the year

          2005. During her cross-examination, it is evident that she was not at

          all cross-examined on that very score nor she was suggested on this

          score contrary to whatever being deposed by her.

</p><p id="p_62">                             20. PW-2, informant who happens to be brother of

          Suprita Devi had disclosed that she was married with Manoranjan

          Thakur @ Ranjan Thakur on 03.07.2005. During cross-examination,

          he was also not cross-examined on that very score however as is

          evident from paragraph-3 of his cross-examination, he was

          suggested that it is not a fact that her marriage was solemnized in the

          year 2002 and not on 03.07.2005. In likewise manner PW-4 had also

          deposed disclosing therein that Suprita Devi was married with
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.853 of 2012 dt.19-02-2014                     24




          Manoranjan Thakur @ Ranjan Thakur on 03.07.2005. Again this

          witness was not cross-examined on that very score, save and except,

          under paragraph-4 of his cross-examination by way of suggestion

          which he had denied regarding solemnization of marriage in the year

          2002. It has further been suggested that during course of his

          statement before the police, he had not disclosed the date of

          marriage as 03.07.2005. From the evidence of PW-6 (Investigating

          Officer) paragraph-5, it is apparent that this PW had not disclosed

          before the police regarding date of marriage of Suprita Devi as

          03.07.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_63">                             21. PW-5 though declared hostile although happens

          to be brother in-law of deceased and was middleman during course

          of negotiation had disclosed the date of marriage as 03.07.2005 that

          part had about been cross-examined. PW-6 at paragraph-3 of his

          cross-examination had denied presentation of any short of document

          at the end of appellant disclosing the year of marriage as 2002.

</p><p id="p_64">                             22. On this score, the defence had also examined two

          DWs. DW-1 is Putul Devi, co-villager who has admitted marriage,

          however in the year 2002. During cross-examination, it is evident

          that she had not been specifically cross-examined on that very

          aspect, but she happens to be outsider having no concern with the

          affair of family is itself stated by her. DW-2 is Shambhu Pandey
 Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.853 of 2012 dt.19-02-2014                     25




          who is resident of different village and happens to be formal in

          nature who has simply exhibited the Lagan Patri allegedly prepared

          by one Brajesh Nandan Pandey @ Birja Pandey and a copy thereof

          was sent to the family of deceased. His status in that capacity loosen

          authenticity because of the fact that neither the document was

          prepared in his presence nor a copy thereof was sent to the bride

          family. As such, having analytical approach of the evidence of rival

          parties the date of marriage is found to be conclusively proved and is

          accordingly held as 03.07.2005.
</p>
<p id="p_65">                             23. The next circumstance is to be seen whether the

          death was within the seven years of marriage. At the present

          moment it looks pertinent to consider the suggestion given by the

          appellant to the prosecution witnesses. The necessity for

          appreciation of aforesaid theme at a first count has arisen on account

          of controversial stand taken up by the appellant while cross-

          examining the individual witnesses more so, did not deny presence

          of Suprita Devi at his place during course of occurrence so alleged.

          During suggestion given to PW-1 under paragraph-6, it was

          suggested that it is not a fact that her daughter had not died, but she

          was residing at a place away from Sasural having within their full

          knowledge. PW-2 was suggested that it is not a fact that his sister

          was characterless and had developed illicit relationship with

          Shyamal Kishore Thakur and used to flee from her Sasural under

          such pretext and it appears that during course thereof, some

          unknown miscreants raped her and then committed murder. PW-4

          was suggested under paragraph-6 of his cross-examination that he

          had fallen under illicit relationship with her and perhaps she used to

          stay on account of which there was dispute and in the aforesaid

          background he had committed murder of deceased. PW-5 did not

          depose on that very score so was declared hostile.

</p><p id="p_66">                             24. After institution of the case, dead body was

          recovered during course of investigation which was identified that of

          Suprita Devi by the witnesses, inquest report was prepared. The

          dead body was sent for post mortem having absolute identification.

</p><p id="p_67">                             25. PW-3 had conducted post mortem examination

          following ante mortem injuries.

          to shock and haemorrhage caused due to hard and blunt objects.

          Time elapsed since death 5 to 8 days. During course of examination,

          there happens to be complete absence of cross-examination over

          status of body being unidentifiable.
</p>
<p id="p_75">                             26. PW-6 the Investigating Officer had prepared

          inquest report after recovery of dead body belonging to deceased

          Suprita Devi. It is evident that these two witnesses were not at all

          cross-examined on the score whether the body was decomposed and

          on account thereof, it was not fit for identification.

</p><p id="p_76">                             27. PW-1 had stated that dead body of her daughter

          was traced out by the police near Tilaiya river. She had identified the

          dead body through hair, teeth, face etc. During cross-examination at

          paragraph-4, she had stated that probably the dead body was

          recovered on 28.10.2010. At the time of recovery of dead body, she

          was present there. Dead body was buried. Skin was present. PW-2

          had not spoken on that very pretext and in likewise manner he was

          not cross-examined and that happens to be also the status of PW-4.

          Hence after considering the material available on record it is now

          found manifestly clear that the dead body so recovered was of

          Suprita Devi, deceased. Therefore, the death of deceased is found to

          be within seven years of marriage and on that very score the

          evidence of prosecution is found creditworthy as well as being

          additionally supported by defence itself.

</p><p id="p_77">                             28. Now, the remaining ingredients happens to be

          demand of dowry as well as torture inflicted upon deceased soon

          before her death. On that very score, it is evident right from fard-

          beyan that husband, brother in-law (Dewar) and mother in-law have

          advanced demand of Rs. One lac cash as well as a motorcycle. From

          the evidence of PW-1 paragraph-1, she had stated with regard to

          demand of Rs. One lac and a motorcycle. During cross-examination

          at paragraph-2, she had stated during cross-examination that while

          deceased along with her husband and brother in-law (Nandosi) had

          come to her place, there was dispute with regard to demand of

          dowry, but she had not lodged any case at the police station on the

          assurance given by her daughter that she will manage the thing.

          Nothing more has been cross-examined on that very score.

</p><p id="p_78">                             29. PW-2 had stated in his examination in-chief that

          they (accused) have demanded Rs. One lac and a motorcycle which

          they were unable to fulfil on account of their meager economic

          condition. Few days before the occurrence, they have threatened

          over mobile phone that either arrange the same or they will murder

          the deceased. He had talked and further a day before occurrence his

          deceased sister had disclosed that they are threatening to kill. During

          cross-examination at paragraph-2, he had admitted that he had not

          reported either before Mukhiya or Sirpanch or Police Station

          regarding demand as well as torture whereunder deceased was

          subjected for fulfilment of dowry. He had further disclosed that for

          the first time he has deposed like so. He had further disclosed that it

          was demanded in the year 2005 itself in presence of his parents as

          well as they have also demanded over telephone. He had further

          stated that neither any demand was made nor torture was affected in

          presence of outsider. In paragraph-4, he had stated that he had

          divulged before the police official that few days before the alleged

          date of occurrence her Sasuralwala had threatened that the demand

          should be fulfilled otherwise she will be murdered. PW-4 had also

          stated that the mother in-law, brother in-law (Dewar) and husband

          demanded Rs. One lac and a motorcycle which could not be fulfilled

          on account of poor financial condition and for that, the deceased was

          subjected to torture. During cross-examination at paragraph-3, he

          had stated that he had got no documentary proof with regard thereto.

          He had not informed anybody regarding demand of Rs. One lac as

          well as a motorcycle.
</p>
<p id="p_79">                             30. From the evidence of PW-6, the Investigating

          Officer, it is apparent that some short of illegality has been

          committed by the learned trial Court during course of recording of

          evidence because of the fact that the contents of fard-beyan was to

          be confronted by the informant only who happens to be the maker of

          the documents and not by the Investigating Officer. He had

          incorporated the same under paragraph-3 of cross-examination.

          Moreover, after going through the fard-beyan, it is evident that there

          happens to be specific disclosure with regard to demand of dowry as

          well as treating the deceased with cruelty as well as torturing her. It

          is also evident from the PW-2 that few days before of death of

          deceased the accused persons have threatened that they will kill his

          sister otherwise arrange the money and that part, as is evident from

          paragraph-3 of PW-6 is not a contradiction. Nay the defence has

          been above to deface even cross-examining him under paragraph-2

          of the cross-examination. Therefore, demand of dowry as well as

          torture subjected upon deceased soon before her death is found

          coherent from the evidences of PWs.

          under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_54">Section 313</a> of the Cr. P. C. did not satisfy the mandate of law.

          From perusal of the same, it is apparent that the learned lower Court

<p id="p_95">                                      33. The requirement of law happens to be that every

                   sort of incriminating article so persisting on the record having

                   brought up by the prosecution should be confronted to the accused

                   so that he be able to explain the circumstances properly. As stated

                   above, as the learned lower Court had not discharge his function on

                   that very score in accordance with law, did not justify its

                   concurrence. Hence, the judgment impugned is set aside. Appeal is

                   allowed. The matter is remitted back to the learned lower court to

                   proceed afresh from the stage of recording of statement and will pass

                   a judgment in accordance with law.
