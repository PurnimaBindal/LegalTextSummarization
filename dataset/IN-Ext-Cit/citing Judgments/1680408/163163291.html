</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              appellant and the learned counsel for the State .

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                           2. In this appeal, the basic question that has been

              raised is as to whether Government can terminate the service

              of its illegally appointed employees, after the lapse of

              substantial period of service. The petitioner has challenged

              the validity of the order dated 16th          September 2000,

              Annexure-1 to the writ petition issued by the District

              Education Officer, Banka whereby he asked the petitioner-</blockquote><p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">              appellant to produce his Service Book, appointment letter,

              order of payment of salary and the certificates in respect of

              his educational qualification, in view of the report submitted

              by the District Education Officer, Bhagalpur to the effect

              that the petitioner-appellant was appointed without following

              the procedure of appointment and by this letter, payment of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                          2</span>




salary of the petitioner-appellant was stopped. The appellant

challenged the aforesaid order in the present writ petition and

during the pendency of        the case, the District Education

Officer, Banka vide order dated 12th April 2007, terminated

the services of the petitioner-appellant and the same was

affirmed by the Director, Secondary Education, Govt. of

Bihar by his order dated 26th March 2008. The petitioner

challenged the order of termination, including the order

passed by the Director, Secondary Education, vide I.A.No.

2332 of 2008.
</p>
<p id="p_7">            3. It will be relevant to mention from the facts

on the record that the Government vide letter dated 3rd

December     1980   clearly    laid   down   that   all   public

appointments have to be made only after publishing the

advertisement   giving opportunity to all the eligible

candidates and after holding due selection process, roster

clearance etc. For verification of the aforesaid fact about the

mode of appointment and to check his educational

qualification, petitioner was issued notice vide Annexure-1

by the District Education Officer, Banka to submit relevant

papers.
</p>
<p id="p_8">            4. It appears from the record of the writ Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          3</span>




that the Assistant Director, Secondary Education, vide letter

no.3530 dated 24th October 1991 had directed the District

Education Officer, Bhagalpur to appoint the petitioner as

clerk against the vacant post, at the instance of letter of

Minister, Human Resources Department, Govt. of Bihar,

bearing No. 3712 dated 12th August 1991 and in pursuance

thereof, the District Education Officer, vide Memo No.

7086-88 dated 1st November 1991 appointed the petitioner as

clerk in the High School, Athamaha in the basic pay scale of

Rs.1,200 - 1,800/- (Annexure-3). It is apparent from the

aforesaid letter that the petitioner-appellant was appointed as

a clerk at the behest of Minister through        the Assistant

Director, Secondary Education, Government of Bihar, Patna.

</p><p id="p_9">              5.   Learned counsel for the appellant has

pointed out that the order passed by the District Education

Officer Banka was overturned        by the Regional Deputy

Director of Education, Bhagalpur by his order dated 20 th

April 2007 (Annexure-9 to the           I.A.). The Director,

Secondary Education, Bihar by order dated 26th March

2008has also held the order passed by the Regional Deputy

Director, Education to be invalid and the order of the

District Education Officer was restored.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                          4</span>




</p><p id="p_10">            6. According to the case of the petitioner-

appellant, he joined the post and was allowed to work, but on

receipt of report of the District Education Officer, Bhagalpur

vide letter No.571 dated 28th May 2000, the Director,

Secondary Education, vide letter No. 977 dated 11 th August

2000 asked for action to be taken against the writ petitioner

and others, who were appointed illegally. In pursuance of

letter No. 983 dated 15th September 2000 issued by the

District Education Officer, Banka, the In-charge Head

Master of the School submitted         papers regarding the

educational qualification of petitioner but could not produce

any material to show that the petitioner was appointed to the

post of clerk after following the due procedure for

appointment, such as, advertisement of the post, appearing

before any Selection Board and selection for appointment.

The District Education Officer, Bhagalpur, vide his letter

dated 27th October 2000, on consideration of his explanation

and considering the material which was produced by the

petitioner-appellant to the District Education Officer,Banka

after due consideration and after examination of the records

has come to a positive finding that the appointment of the

petitioner-appellant was made illegally, as the conditions laid
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                          5</span>




down vide letter No. 16440 dated 3rd December 1980 were

not followed and on this finding he has issued the show cause

as to why the services of the petitioner be not terminated.

The District Education Officer, Banka again vide letter No.

405 dated 26th March 2001 issued a letter to the appellant to

file his show cause. When the District Education Officer did

not receive any show cause, he again, vide letter No. 822

dated 25th July 2001 and letter no.1395 dated 17th November

2001 sent reminders.
</p>
<p id="p_11">            7. On consideration of the aforesaid facts, it

appears that the petitioner-appellant could not produce any

material with regard to mode of his appointment as a clerk.

The onus was upon the petitioner-appellant to produce the

materials to show that he was validly appointed after

following the   due process of law. When the petitioner-

appellant did not respond, ultimately the District Education

Officer, Banka vide his letter No. 506 dated 12th April 2007,

terminated his services on the ground of illegal appointment,

as the appointment was made dehors the Rules. The order of

the District Education Officer was approved by the Director,

Secondary Education, Bihar, Patna vide letter No. 88 dated

26th March 2008 and the order of Regional Deputy Director
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                            6</span>




was overturned.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             8. The District Education Officer, Banka as well

as the Director, Secondary Education while passing the

impugned orders have considered every aspect of the matter

and have come to a finding that the appointment of the

petitioner was completely illegal and violative of Articles 14

and 16 of the Constitution of India, which view has been

challenged in the writ petition and the learned single Judge

after due consideration, affirmed the orders.

</p><p id="p_13">             9. The primary question that has been raised by

the learned counsel for the petitioner-appellant is that the

petitioner-appellant has continued in service      for a long

period and after lapse of such a long period, the procedure

adopted for his appointment should not come under scrutiny

at such a belated stage.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             10. In this case, the appellant neither before the

writ Court nor before us has brought any material to show

that he was appointed after following the due process of

appointment, such as, issuance of advertisement. calling the

names of candidates from the Employment Exchange,

appearance before any Selection/Interview Board, rather the

facts show that he along with some other persons had been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                           7</span>




appointed at the behest of Minister, Human Resources

Department, Govt. of Bihar. In these circumstances,

appellantâ€Ÿs appointment cannot be said to be legal or

irregular, rather it is out and out an illegal appointment.

</p><p id="p_15">             11. Learned Senior counsel for the petitioner in

support of his contention has relied on an unreported

judgment of this Court in the case of Chandra Mauleshwar

Singh Vs. The State of Bihar (C.W.J.C.No. 759 of 2009. It

has been contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner

that the fact and law decided by this Court completely covers

the case of the petitioner-appellant and, as such, the relief

granted to the aforesaid petitioner should also be granted to

the present appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_16">             12. He has further placed reliance on another

judgment reported sin (2010)9 SCC 247 (AIR 2010 SC 2587)

state of Karnataka Vs. M.L.Kesari.
</p>
<p id="p_17">             13. The learned counsel for the State supported

the order passed by the learned single Judge and said that

State Authorities have rightly taken action, because a person

appointed illegally cannot have right to continue in service

and he can be terminated at any stage of service as he does

not have right to hold the post. In order to examine the issue
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                            8</span>




at hand, it would be proper to examine cases decided by

Honâ€Ÿble Supreme Court dealing with this aspect of the

matter.
</p>
<p id="p_18">            14.   The    Supreme    Court    in   the   case   of

R.Vishwanatha Pillai Vs. State of Karnataka, (2004)2 SCC

105 has held that any appointment obtained by fraud and

deceit is void from its inception and the beneficiary of such

appointment cannot claim the protection of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_1">Article 311</a> of the

Constitution of India. In the aforesaid case, the petitioner had

obtained appointment by a false certificate and considering

the same, the        Supreme Court has held that since the

petitioner of that case had played fraud, hence he cannot

take advantage of his own fault. It will be apt to quote the

following passage from the aforesaid judgment as under :

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                   "Unless the appellant can lay a claim to the

          post on the basis of his appointment, he cannot claim

          the constitutional guarantee given under <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_2">article 311</a>

          of the Constitution. As he had obtained the

          appointment on the basis of a false caste certificate,

          he cannot be considered to be a person who holds

          the post within the meaning of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_3">Article 311</a> of the

          Constitution of India. The position, therefore, is that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                   9</span>




the appellant has usurped the post which should have

gone to a member of the Scheduled Castes. In view

of the finding recorded by the scrutiny committee

and upheld upto this Court, he has disqualified

himself to hold the post. The appointment was void

from its inception. It cannot be said that the said void

appointment would enable the appellant to claim that

he was holding a civil post within the meaning of

<a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_4">Article 311</a> of the Constitution of India. As the

appellant had obtained the appointment by playing a

fraud, he cannot be allowed to take advantage of his

own fraud in entering the service and claim that he

was holder of the post entitled to be dealt with in

terms of <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_5">Article 311</a> of the Constitution of India or

the Rules framed thereunder. Where an appointment

in a service has been acquired by practicing fraud or

deceit, such an appointment is no appointment in

law, in service and in such a situation <a href="/doc/47623/" id="a_6">Article 311</a> of

the Constitution is not attracted at all.</blockquote><p id="p_19">

</p><p id="p_20">          The appellant obtained the appointment

against a post meant for a reserved candidate by

producing a false caste certificate and by playing a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                          10</span>




        fraud. His appointment to the post was void and

        nonest in the eye of law. A person who seeks equity

        must come with clean hand. He who comes to the

        court with false claim, cannot plead equity nor would

        the court be justified to exercise equity jurisdiction in

        his favour. A person who seeks equity must act in a

        fair and equitable manner. Equity jurisdiction cannot

        be exercised in the case of a person who got the

        appointment on the basis of a false caste certificate

        by playing a fraud. No sympathy and equitable

        consideration can come to his rescue. We are of the

        view that equity or compassion cannot be allowed to

        bend the arms of law in a case where an individual

        acquires a status by practicing fraud."
</p>
<p id="p_21">         15. In a similar case, the <a href="/doc/1680408/" id="a_7">State of Manipur Vs.

V.Y.Toten Singh</a>, (2007)5 SCC 65, the Apex Court held that

any appointment made dehors Articles 14 &amp; 16 of the

Constitution is a nullity. In that case the Commissioner of

Revenue made the appointment in violation of Articles 14 &amp;

16 of the Constitution and later on the same was cancelled on

the ground that the appointment was made without the

knowledge of the Revenue Department of the State and no
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                         11</span>




records were available with the State. In that case the

Supreme Court held that appointment issued in favour of

persons concerned is a forged appointment and the State

cannot be compelled to pay salary to them from the State

Exchequer and any action which has not been taken by the

authority competent therefore is      complete violation of

constitutional and legal frame of law which would not be

binding on the State. It has further been held that

discretionary power cannot be exercised in arbitrary manner

and further held that if the appointment of the person

concerned is nullity, the question of observance of principles

of natural justice would not arise. It was the duty of the

competent authority making appointment to follow the

constitutional schemes as enumerated in Articles 14 and 16

of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_22">             16. The Supreme Court while considering the

case of R.S.Garg Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, 2006 Lab. I.C.

2996, has considered the decision in the case of State of

Karnataka Vs. Uma Devi (2006)4 SCC 1 and while

considering the fact that the appointment should be made

following the constitutional provisions of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Article 14</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_9">16</a>

of the Constitution, held that and any appointment made,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                         12</span>




without following the Rules of selection has to be

categorized as â€žillegal appointmentâ€Ÿ. It has further been held

that any rule made by the Executive under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_10">Article 309</a> of the

Constitution which is not in consonance with Articles 14 &amp;

16 of the Constitution cannot be sustained. The Apex Court

has held that appointment made in violation of mandatory

provisions of the Rules for appointment has to be categorized

as an illegal appointment. The Supreme Court in Para-21 of

the judgment observed that      the appointments dehors the

rules would render the same as illegal and not irregular and

has quoted passage from the judgment of Uma Devi(supra) in

the following terms:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                "Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule

        of equality in public employment is a basic feature of

        our constitution and since the rule of law is the core

        of our Constitution, a Court would certainly be

        disabled from passing an order upholding a violation

        of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_11">Article 14</a> or in ordering the overlooking of the

        need to comply with requirements of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_12">Article 14</a> read

        with <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_13">Article 16</a>      of the Constitution. Therefore,

        consistent with the scheme for public employment,

        this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                  13</span>




to hold that unless the appointment is in terms of the

relevant rules and after a proper competition among

qualified persons, the same would not confer any

right on the appointee.</blockquote><p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">         It has also to be clarified that merely

because a temporary employee or a casual daily

wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term

of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be

absorbed in regular service     or made permanent,

merely on the strength of such continuance, if the

original appointment was not made by following a

due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant

rules. It is not open to the court to prevent regular

recruitment at the instance of temporary employees

whose period of employment has come to an end or

of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their

appointment, do not acquire any right. High Courts

acting under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,

should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption,

regularization, or permanent continuance unless the

recruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of

the constitutional scheme."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                          14</span><p id="p_25">




</p><p id="p_26">           17. The Supreme Court in another case Ashok

Kumar Sonkar Vs. Union of India, (2007)4 SCC 54 has held

that if the appointment has been made without following the

provisions of Articles 14 &amp; 16 of the Constitution and the

statutory rules were not followed, the appointment is illegal.

In that circumstance, it has further been held that if the

appointment is irregular that can be regularized but if it is

illegal, it is nonest in the eye of law which renders the

appointment a nullity.
</p>
<p id="p_27">           18. The Supreme Court has considered the status

of a person who was appointed through back-door manner

and the status of illegal appointment. In this connection also

the Honâ€Ÿble Supreme Court in the case of State of Bihar Vs.

Upedra Narayan Singh, 2009(4) PLJR (SC) 73 has

elaborately dealt with the mode to be applied while making

employment in public office. The Court has also considered

the spoil system which was prevalent in the Unites States of

America. While deciding this issue, the Apex Court held that

in the matter of public appointment, every public employer

is duty bound     to notify the vacancy to the concerned

Employment Exchange so as to enable it to sponsor the

names of eligible candidates and also to advertise the same in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                          15</span>




the News-papers having wider circulation, Employment

News Bulletin, getting announcements made on Radio/ Tele-

vision and consider all eligible candidates whose names may

be forwarded by the concerned Employment Exchange and

who may apply pursuant to the advertisement published in

the News-papers or pronouncement made on Radio/Tele-

vision. While dealing with the matter, the Court has held that

a huge    illegal employment market has developed in the

country adversely affecting the legal and constitutional right

of lakhs of meritorious members of younger generation of the

country who are forced to seek intervention of court and

wait for justice for years together. The Court has further held

that the person appointed or regularized through illegal

method cannot be allowed to continue in service and at any

stage a Government can take appropriate step to terminate

their services. In this case the Court has also dealt with a

situation when the scheme is made on the basis of discretion.

The Court has held that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_15">Article 14</a> of the Constitution is a

positive concept which cannot be inferred in negative

manner. When any authority is      shown to have committed

any illegality or irregularity in favour of any individual or

group of individuals, similar illegal favourable     treatment
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                           16</span>




cannot be granted to others. In this connection, the following

paragraphs will be apt to be quoted as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">               "The illegal employment market continued to

      grow in the country and those entrusted with the

      power of making appointment and those who could

      pull strings in the corridor of power manipulated the

      system to ensure that their favorites get employment in

      complete and contemptuous disregard of the equality

      clause enshrined in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_16">Article 16</a> of the Constitution and

      Section 4 of the 1959 Act. However, the Courts

      gradually realized that unwarranted sympathy shown

      to the progenies of spoil system has eaten into the

      vitals of the service structure of the State and public

      bodies and this is the reason why             relief of

      reinstatement and/or regularization of service has been

      denied to illegal appointees/back-door entrants in large

      number of cases."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">           19. A Division Bench of this Court in the case of

Ashok Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar, 2009(3) PLJR 201 has

considered the same situation and held that the illegal

appointee has no right to continue in service, as the

appointment through back-door method without following
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                          17</span>




the procedure of appointment is void.</blockquote><p id="p_28">

</p><p id="p_29">           20. In another case a similar view has been taken

by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of State of

Bihar Vs. Sheo Shankar, 2008(3) PLJR 363.
</p>
<p id="p_30">           21. Learned counsel for the petitioner-appellant

has stated that the appellant has continued in service for   a

long time and after lapse of such a long period, issue of

illegality or irregularity should not be       opened as the

appellant was appointed against a sanctioned post and was

having the requisite qualification. He has further submitted

that the judgment of the Constitution Bench in the case of

State of Karnataka Vs. Uma Devi, (2006)4 SCC 1 has been

watered down in the State of Krnataka Vs. M.L. Kesari and it

has been submitted that in this case the Court has held that if

the person has been appointed against a sanctioned post

having minimum requisite qualification,        it will not be

considered as an illegal appointment and the Honâ€Ÿble Apex

Court explained the judgment in the case of Uma Devi and

did not interfere with the employment of the employee who

had completed 10 years of service having requisite

qualification and having been appointed against a sanctioned

post.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                          18</span><p id="p_31">




</p><p id="p_32">           22. Recently the Honâ€Ÿble Supreme Court in

another case had the occasion to consider this issue of rights

of a person having      been appointed through back-door

method in Union of India Vs. Arulmozhi Iniarasu, 2011(4)

PLJR 83(SC). The Supreme Court while considering the

right of a person appointed illegally has considered the

earlier judgments, except that of M.L.Kesari (supra) and has

held that the person appointed through back-door method has

no right to continue in service. While deciding the issue, the

Supreme Court held as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                "Para:13 Bearing in mind the aforenoted

         principle of law, we now refer to the decision in

         Nagendra Chandra. It is plain from as bare reading

         of the said decision that the question which fell for

         consideration before a Bench of three learned

         judges of this Court was as to whether the

         appointments of the appellants in that case were

         illegal or irregular. This Court opined that since the

         appointments made were not only in infraction of

         the recruitment rules but also violative of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_17">Article

         14</a><a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_18">&amp; 16</a> of the Constitution of India, these were

         illegal. It was thus, held that the appellants will not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                   19</span>




be entitled to get the benefits of the directions

contained in Umadevi case. In the said decision it

has clearly been held that the courts are not

expected     to        issue   any   direction    for

absorption/regularization or permanent continuance

of temporary, contractual, casual, daily wagers or

ad hoc employees merely because such an

employee is continuing for a long time beyond the

term of his appointment. It has also been held that

such an employee would not be entitled to be

absorbed in regular service or made permanent

merely on the strength of such continuance, if the

original appointment was not made by following a

due process of selection as envisaged by the

relevant rules. Therefore, in our opinion, the said

observation cannot be said to be an exposition of

general principle of law on the point that a long

length of service de hors the relevant recruitment

rules for the post, is relevant factor for the waiver

or relaxation of any illegibility criterion including

age limit, for future regular selection for the post.

</blockquote><p id="p_33">Obviously the observation, general in nature, was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                          20</span>




         made by this Court in exercise of this jurisdiction

         under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_19">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India and,

         therefore, cannot be treated as a binding precedent.

         It has to be confined to the peculiar facts of that

         case.
</p>
<p id="p_34">              Para-23: Lastly, as regards the submission that

         the action of the appellant is highly discriminatory

         inasmuch as some similarly situated persons have

         been appointed/absorbed as Sepoys, the argument

         is stated to be rejected. It is well settled that a writ

         of mandamus can be issued by the High Court only

         when there exists a legal right in the writ petitioner

         and corresponding legal obligation in the State.

         Only because an illegality has been committed, the

         same cannot be directed to be perpetuated. It is trite

         law that there cannot be equality in illegality."

</p><p id="p_35">          23. In view of the latest judgment of the Honâ€Ÿble

Supreme Court, the consistent view that has been taken by

the Apex Court is that the appointment of a person       dehors

the established procedure of appointment        in violation of

Articles 14 &amp; 16 of the Constitution has to be treated as

â€žillegal appointmentâ€Ÿ and such appointee cannot derive the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                               21</span>




      right to continue in service and at any stage the Government,

      if it finds that the appointment has been made through illegal

      method, can terminate the service under a void appointment.

</p><p id="p_36">                 24. Hence, the contention raised by the writ-

      petitioner-appellant is rejected. The view taken by the

      learned single Judge is correct and in accordance with the

      view taken by the Honâ€Ÿble Apex Court and hence requires no

      interference.
</p>
<p id="p_37">              25. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed. No costs.
