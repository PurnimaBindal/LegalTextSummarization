<p id="p_1">1.     The plaintiff before this Court is engaged in the business of manufacturing

and sale of boots, shoes and slippers, which he is selling under the trademark

„KHAZANA‟. The plaintiff claimed to be using the aforesaid mark since 1.1.1990

and also claims that his products are well known for their intrinsic quality and

enjoy tremendous goodwill and reputation in the market. The plaintiff is also the

proprietor of the registered trademark KHAZANA, registered vide registration

number 1070231 in Class: 25 in respect of boots, shoes and slippers.

</p><p id="p_2">       The defendants applied for trademarks „Khadim‟s Sriman KHAZANA

(label), „Khadim‟s Girls KHAZANA‟ (label), „Khadim‟s Srimati KHAZANA‟



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                    Page 1 of 31</span>
 (label) and „Khadim‟s Boy KHAZANA‟ (label) under applications numbers

1312611, 1312619, 1312623 and 1312621 respectively in class 25 for clothing,

footwear and headgear which were opposed by the plaintiff. The defendants, while

seeking registration of the above referred marks, claimed user since 18.09.2004,

whereas the plaintiff has been using the mark KHAZANA since 1.1.1990. The

defendants filed two other applications bearing number 1365971 and 1365977 for

registration of the trademark Khadim‟s Baby KHAZANA and Khadims Boy

KHAZANA for clothing including boots, shoes, hawai chappals and slippers and

headgear included in class 25. In these applications also the defendants claimed

user since 18.9.2004. The plaintiff had filed opposition to these applications as

well. The plaintiff has accordingly sought an injunction restraining the defendants

from using the trademark KHAZANA or any other mark which is identical or

deceptively similar to that of the plaintiff‟s mark. The plaintiff has also claimed

damages to the extent of Rs.20 lac, besides delivery up of the infringing material

and rendition of accounts.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.     The defendants have contested the suit. It has been stated in their counter

affidavit/ written statement that defendant no.1 has no independent juristic

existence, it being only an outlet owned by defendant no.2 and even that outlet is

not functioning any more. It is further alleged that plaintiff did not apply for

registration of the word mark KHAZANA and sought registration only in a stylized



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                    Page 2 of 31</span>
 manner in which the word KHAZANA has been represented in the Trademark

Journal and the application for registration. It was also alleged that defendant no.2

was in the process of applying for rectification of the registration obtained by the

plaintiff. It is also alleged that defendants have at all material times representing

the mark KHAZANA with the prefix KHADIM‟S so as to distinguish their mark

from other marks. It is also claimed that use of prefix KHADIM‟S is sufficient to

distinguish the goods of the defendants from the goods of the plaintiff. It is also

stated in the written statement/ counter affidavit that the defendant No.2 intend to

sell the goods with KHAZANA suffix from its own departmental stores and,

therefore, there is no possibility of any confusion amongst public. It is further

alleged that the sale of the defendants from KHAZANA product was

Rs.121,251,927/- as against the plaintiff‟s sale of Rs.11,87,830/- in the year 2005-

06 and the defendants incurred publicity expenses amounting to Rs.32,49,666/-, in

respect of the mark KHAZANA for the year 2005-06.
</p>
<p id="p_4">       The defendants have placed on record attested photocopies of as many as

five registrations in class 25 in respect of boots, shoes, hawai chappals, slippers and

headgears. In three of them, the word KHAZANA in conjunction with other

word(s) has been used on the labels which have been registered by Trademark

Registry. The remaining two are word mark registration of the words „KHADIM‟S

KHAZANA‟ and „KHADIM KA KHAZANA‟. The defendants were directed to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                       Page 3 of 31</span>
 file legal proceedings certificates in respect of the aforesaid registrations. On

21.04.2011, the learned counsel for the plaintiff stated that the plaintiff proposed to

challenge registration/ application Nos.1365976, 1341765, 1281371, 1276320 and

1339523, all in Class 25, before the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. The

plaintiff was accordingly given three months‟ time to apply to the Intellectual

Property Appellate Board, for rectification of the registration of the aforesaid

trademarks. An additional issue was also framed on that date. Vide subsequent

order dated 10.10.2001, the trial of the suit was stayed by this Court in terms of

Section 124(2) of the Trademarks Act till final disposal of the rectification

proceedings which the plaintiff had filed on 21.07.2011, in respect of the said

registrations in favour of defendant no.2. However, during the course of hearing in

FAO(OS) No.289 of 2012, the learned counsel for the defendants stated that the

defendants were not relying on those registration certificates and the controversy in

the present suit was limited to the issue as to whether there was an infringement/

passing of qua the mark of the plaintiff KHAZANA by reason of the defendants

using the trademark KHADIM‟S KHAZANA and other prefixes. Therefore, the

aforesaid registration in favour of the defendants has to be excluded from

consideration, while deciding this suit.

<p id="p_5">3.     On 17.01.2011, the following issues were framed in this case:

</p><p id="p_7">       The parties stated that since there was no dispute on facts, they do not

same is liable to be struck off in view of the statement made by the learned counsel

for the defendants in FAO(OS) 289/2012.
</p>
<p id="p_8"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">ISSUE NO.1 to 3</span>

</p><p id="p_9">4.     A perusal of the registration certificate number 01070231 dated 31.12.2001

issued by Trademark Registry would show that the trademark registered in favour

of the plaintiff is the word KHAZANA inside a rectangular box. The contention of

the defendants is that the word „KHAZANA‟ for which registration has been

obtained by the plaintiff has been written in a stylized manner, whereas the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                         Page 5 of 31</span>
 contention of the plaintiff is that the word KHAZANA has been written in a

particular font and not in a stylized manner. However, the fact remains that there is

neither any additional word nor any logo/ monogram etc in the rectangular box in

which the word KHAZANA has been written in the registration of the plaintiff. In

the certificate issued by Trademark Registry the trademark of the plaintiff has been

described as a label/ device and not as a word or mark.
</p>
<p id="p_10">5.      Relying upon Section 17 of the Trademarks Act, 1999, the learned counsel

for the defendants has contended that since the plaintiff did not seek separate

registration in respect of the word KHAZANA, he is not entitled to injunction

against user of the word KHAZANA and the right available to him is confined to

the word KHAZANA written in a particular stylized form, in a box. The contention

of learned counsel for the plaintiff on the other hand is that the plaintiff is entitled

to exclusive use of the word KHAZANA irrespective of the fact whether it is

written in a stylized form or in a designer font or using ordinary letters of the

language in which the word is written.
</p>
<p id="p_11">6.     Section 17 of the Trademarks Act, 1991 reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">              "17. Effect of registration of parts of a mark.-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">              (1) When a trade mark consists of several matters, its
              registration shall confer on the proprietor exclusive right to the
              use of the trade mark taken as a whole.
</blockquote>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                        Page 6 of 31</span>

              proprietor for registration as a trade mark; or

              trade mark; or
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">              (b) contains any matter which is common to the trade or is

              thereof shall not confer any exclusive right in the matter
              forming only a part of the whole of the trade mark so
              registered."
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       A careful analysis of the abovereferred provision would show that sub-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">section (2) would apply only to a mark which contains more than one parts, which

are capable of being separately registered as a trademark. If a trademark does not

constitute more than one part capable of separate registration, sub section (2) of

section 17 would not apply to such a mark. To take an example, if a registered

trademark constitutes of a wordmark as well as a logo, the proprietor of the

trademark would be entitled to exclusive right to use the trademark taken as a

whole, but would not be entitled to protection of the logo and the wordmark when

they are used separately from each other. To demonstrate it by way of an example,

if a registered trademark compromises of the word „Lotus‟ and picture of a flower



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                    Page 7 of 31</span>
 inside a box, he would be entitled to injunction if another person uses the mark as a

whole but would not be entitled to an injunction against the use of the word „Lotus‟

or the picture of the flower unless he has submitted separate applications for

registration of the word „Lotus‟ and the picture of the flower. This is so because

the flower as also the word „Lotus‟ are capable of separate registrations. To take

another example, if there is a mark comprising of the word „Delhi Khata Mitha‟

inside a box or otherwise, the registered proprietor of the trademark would be

entitled to use of the trademark „Delhi Khata Mitha‟ as a whole. He would be

entitled to protection against use of the trademark „Delhi Khata Mitha‟ as a whole

and not if the word „Delhi‟ is used without the word „Khatha Mitha‟ or „Khatha

Mitha‟ is used without the word „Delhi‟, unless the proprietor of the trademark has

separately sought registration of the words „Delhi‟ and „Khatha Mitha‟. This is for

the reason that the word „Delhi‟ as well as the word „Khatha Mitha‟ are capable of

separate registration.
</p>
<p id="p_13">7.     However, in the case before this Court, there is absolutely nothing except the

word KHAZANA inside a box/ on the label registered in favour of the plaintiff.

There would be nothing left in the box/ on the label if the word KHAZANA is

taken out of the box /label. Therefore, it cannot be said that the registered

trademark of the plaintiff comprised two distinct parts which were capable of

separate registrations. Therefore, sub-section (2) of Section 17 does not apply to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                      Page 8 of 31</span>
 the registration obtained by the plaintiff. During the course of the arguments, the

learned counsel for the plaintiff gave yet another apt example. He contended that if

the registration trademark comprises of a picture of an apple, can it be said that use

of the word „apple‟ would not constitute infringement of the trademark merely

because no separate registration for the word „apple‟ was sought. The answer,

according to the learned counsel, has necessarily to be in the negative since the

very purpose of obtaining registration of the picture of apple would be frustrated, if

others are also allowed to use the word „apple‟ in respect of the same product

which are the subject matter of the registered trademark i.e. picture of an apple.

</p><p id="p_14">8.     The learned counsel for the defendants placed heavy reliance upon the

judgment of Madras High Court in Three-N-Products Private Limited v Emami

Limited [GA No.2951 of 2007; GA No.3976 of 2007 in CS No.204 of 2007)]

decided on 26.08.2008 as well as the judgment of Division Bench of Madras High

Court in an appeal filed against the order of learned Single Judge in that case. In

the case before the Madras High Court, the plaintiff before the High Court asserted

its exclusive rights over a word mark „Ayur‟, on the strength of a black and white

label registration, showing the word „Ayur‟ in an unremarkable font with an

elliptical band around it. The defendant before the High Court had applied for

registration of the word „Ayucare‟ in class 5 and class 3 of the word mark

„Ayucare‟ in class 3 and class 42. The plaintiff before the Madras High Court was



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                       Page 9 of 31</span>
 also the registered proprietor of the word mark „Ayu‟ in class 5, covering medicinal

and like products. On the strength of the word „Ayur‟ being the most prominent

part of plaintiff‟s label registration and its proprietary rights to the word „Ayu‟

plaintiff sought injunction against the defendants before the Madras High Court.

Rejecting the case of the plaintiff, the learned Single Judge, inter alia, held as

under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">              "32. The registration of a device or label would entitle the
              proprietor to protection against the use of such device or label
              by a rival in trade if the rival's use is identical or similar to the
              registered trademark and the use is in connection with identical
              or similar goods or service covered by such registered
              trademark and it appears to the Court that the rival's mark is
              likely to cause confusion or is likely to have an association with
              the registered mark.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">              34.   The right that the owner of a device or label mark
              obtains is, loosely speaking, somewhat similar to copyright. It
              is as much the writing or etching in a device or label, and the
              design and colour combination thereof, over which the
              registered proprietor gains rights as the manner of depiction
              thereof. It is possible that a registered mark is made up of
              several components which are distinctive and notwithstanding
              separate registrations in respect of such distinctive parts not
              having been obtained by the owner of the registered mark, such
              proprietor is entitled to cite one distinctive part as being

               inseparable from the registered whole or such distinctive part
              being the most outstanding attribute of the mark and thus assert
              a right over the distinctive part. But in view of Section 17(2)(a)
              of the 1999 Act, such assertion has to be as in passing off and
              may not be made in aid of a case of infringement. Section 17(2)
              and the world beyond the statute that is recognized in Section
              27 of the 1999 Act has a combined effect of permitting the
              registered owner to claim exclusivity of a part of the whole of
              the registered mark, but only on a cause of action of passing
              off.

<blockquote id="blockquote_17">              35.    The words "the registration thereof shall not confer any
              exclusive right" towards the end of Section 17(2) have to be
              understood in the context. The import of such words is that the
              registration of the composite mark will not ipso facto confer
              any exclusive right as to the parts of the composite mark. But if
              the owner can establish exclusivity aliunde, the owner can
              assert the exclusivity. The registered owner is entitled to
              protection of its goodwill in such prominent feature as in an
              action for passing off unless the registered owner seeks to rely
              of Section 17(2) (b) of the Act in respect of a distinctive matter
              not common to the trade."</blockquote><p id="p_15">

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">               18.   So far infringement of the registered trademark is
              concerned, it appears that the plaintiff is the registered
              proprietor of the trademark 'Ayu' and 'Ayur' in Class 5 for
              medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations and is the
              proprietor of registration of a "device" or "label" 'Ayu' and
              'Ayur' written in a "particular design". It is settled law that the
              registration of a device or label would entitle the proprietor to
              protection against the use of such device or label by a
              competitor in trade if the rival's use is identical or similar to the
              registered trademark and the use is in connection with identical

              two marks are identical and the goods and services covered by
              either mark are also identical, there is a presumption that there
              is violation of the registered mark and the Court in such
              circumstances is entitled to grant a temporary injunction. The

<p id="p_18">9.     With due deference to the decision of Madras High Court, I find myself

unable to take the view that registration of a word on a label/ in a box without there

being anything else on the label/ inside the box would not entitle the plaintiff to

seek injunction against use of that word in a suit based on infringement. In my

view, sub section (2) of Section 17 of the Act cannot be applied unless the

trademark constitute of more than one parts which are capable of independent

registrations and this is made abundantly clear by use of the word „contains any

part which is not the subject of a separate registration‟ in clause (a) of sub section.

 plaintiff before this Court was selling and manufacturing Ayurvedic medical

preparations under the trademark „Liv.52‟, which is a liver tonic prescribed for

liver disorder and to protect the liver against various dysfunction, damage and

hepato-toxins. The trademark „Liv.52‟ was registered in class 5 as a medical

preparation. The „Liv.52‟ label was also registered in class 5 as medical,

pharmaceutical and Ayurvedic preparation and substances. The defendants were

found to be using the mark „Liv.52‟ for similar products, which were

Homoeopathic preparations. This Court, while refusing the injunction to the

plaintiff, noted that there were about 100 registrations in the market using the

preparation Liv made out of the word „Liver‟, an organ of human body, as a

constituent of the name of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations with some

prefix or suffix and thus the word 'LIV' is, therefore, a generic and common to the

trade name, describing the medicines associated with the treatment of liver. It has

become public juris. It was held that the word being descriptive in nature and

common in usage, nobody can claim' an exclusive right to the use of 'Liv' as a

constituent of any trade mark. It was held that the class of customers dealing with

medicines would distinguish the name of the medicines by ignoring 'Liv' and by

assigning weight to the prefix or suffix, so as to associate the name with the

manufacturer and the possibility of deception or confusion is reduced practically to

nil, in view of the fact that the medicine will be sold on medical prescription and by

 licensed dealers well versed in the field and having knowledge of medicines. This

Court further held that there was no phonetic similarity between Liv-52 and Liv-T.

This judgment does not help the defendants before this Court for the simple reason

that there is no evidence or even averment that the word KHAZANA was being

used as a trade name for shoes, boots, etc. nor can it be said to be a generic term as

far as boots, slippers etc are concerned. Also, there is no evidence or even

allegations that this word was being used by others in the market, along with some

prefix or suffix.
</p>
<p id="p_20">11.    It was next contended by the learned counsel for the defendants that since

they are using the word KHAZANA in conjunction with the word „KHADIM‟S

and that at the time of filing of this suit, the size of the word „KHADIM‟S on their

packaging was smaller than the word KHAZANA, they are ready to reduce the size

of the word KHAZANA so as to make it smaller than KHADIM‟S and, therefore,

the plaintiff is not entitled to any injunction against use of the mark „KHADIM‟S

KHAZANA‟. The learned counsel for the plaintiff, on the other hand, maintained

that the defendants cannot use the word KHAZANA either alone or in conjunction

with any other word by way of suffix or prefix since any such use would clearly

constitute infringement of the registered trademark of the plaintiff.

adopted a mark which was identical to plaintiff‟s trademark „VELO‟. It was held

by this Court that the plaintiff was entitled to injunction restraining the defendants

              defendant is not identical to the mark of the plaintiff, it would
              be necessary for the plaintiff to establish that the mark being
              used by the defendant resembles his mark to such an extent that
              it is likely to deceive or cause confusion and that the user of the
              impugned trademark is in relation to the goods in respect of
              which the plaintiff has obtained registration in his favour. It
              will be sufficient if the plaintiff is able to show that the
              trademark adopted by the defendant resembles its trademark in
              a substantial degree, on account of extensive use of the main
              features found in his trademark. In fact, any intelligent person,
              seeking to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of a well-
              established trademark, would make some minor changes here

              trademark, ownership of which vests in some other person.

              would not deprive the plaintiff of injunction in case

              According to Karly‟s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names
              (9th Edition Paragraph 838) "Two marks, when placed side by
              side, may exhibit many and various differences, yet the main
              idea left on the mind by both may be the same. A person
              acquainted with the one mark, and not having the two side by

              exact details of the marks upon the goods with which they are

              general impressions or by some significant detail than by any
              photographic recollection of the whole. Moreover, variations

              that in order to come to the conclusion whether one mark is
              deceptively similar to another, the broad and essential features
              of the two are to be considered. They should not be placed side

              if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one
              design from being mistaken for the other. It would be enough if
              the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the

              Madras and Anr</a>., AIR 1970 SC 146, the respondents were the

              containing a device of a goddess Sri Ambal seated on a globe
              floating on water enclosed in a circular frame with the legend
              "Sri Ambal parimala snuff" at the top of the label, whereas the
              other mark consisted of expression "Sri Ambal". The appellant
              before Supreme Court was seeking registration of a label
              containing three panels. The first and the third panels
              contained equivalents of the words "Sri Andal Madras Snuff",

              separate divinities. The question before the Court was whether
              the proposed mark of the appellant was deceptively similar to
              the respondents‟ mark. Noticing that the word Ambal was an
              essential feature of the registered trademarks, the Court was of



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">CS(OS)2392/2006                                                         Page 23 of 31</span>
               the view that the name Andal proposed to be used by the
              appellant did not cease to be deceptively similar because it was
              used in conjunction with a pictorial device. Supreme Court
              referred to the case of De Cordova and Ors. v. Vick Chemical
              Coy. (1951) 68 R.P.C.103 where Vick Chemical Coy were the
              proprietors of the registered trade mark consisting of the word
              "Vaporub" and another registered trade mark consisting of a
              design of which the words "Vicks Vaporub Salve" formed a
              part.   The defendants advertised their ointment as 'Karsote
              vapour Rub" and the Court held that the defendants had
              infringed the registered marks.      The view taken by Lord
              Radcliffe that "a mark is infringed by another trader if, even
              without using the whole of it upon or in connection with his
              goods, he uses one or more of its essential features" was
              affirmed by the Supreme Court. The appeal was accordingly
              dismissed by Supreme Court, despite the fact that the words
              Ambal and Andal had distinct meanings. In the case before this
              Court, the defendants have used the words "TOTAL
              EFFECTS" without even attempting any change in those
              words, as an essential component of their trademark "JOY
              ULTRA LOOK TOTAL EFFECTS". The infringement by the
              defendants, therefore, is more serious than the infringement in

               defendant was found selling cycles under the trademark
              "ROYAL STAR". The stand taken by the defendant was that
              the word trademark ROYAL STAR was not likely to cause
              confusion or deception or was not any infringement of
              appellant‟s trademark EASTERN STAR since the word STAR
              was common to the trade and was being used by several cycle
              manufacturers. It was observed by this Court that when the
              words EASTERN STAR and ROYAL STAR are uttered, a person
              of average intelligence and imperfect memory was likely to
              remember only the sound and word STAR and those likely to be
              deceived or confused between the two names or mark and,
              therefore the two marks had an overall structural and phonetic
              similarity and consequently, their use in respect of the same
              kind of goods viz. cycles will cause confusion or deception

used by the defendants incorporates whole of the trademark KHAZANA of the

plaintiff. Thus, virtually the whole of the trademark of the plaintiff is subsumed in

the trademark being used by the defendants. Admittedly, the defendants are using

the mark KHADIM‟S KHAZANA in respect of the shoes, boots, slippers, etc., for

which registration has been obtained by the plaintiff. It is not the case of the

defendants that they have been using the impugned trademark prior to use of the

trademark KHAZANA by the plaintiff. Hence, the provisions of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_12">Section 34</a> of

trademark „Bajaj‟. The defendants before the High Court adopted identical mark,

the only dissimilarity being that the first letter in the trademark of the defendants

was „B‟ is in capital letter as against the word „b‟ in the trademark of the plaintiff

and the mode of writing letter „B‟ was slightly different and all the words were

joined, which was not the case in the trademark of the plaintiff. It was held by the

Bombay High Court that the plaintiff was entitled to injunction against the use of

the impugned trademark by the defendants.

and „I‟ were written in same size whereas the letter „I‟ in between, was about three

times bigger in length as compared to other letters S, and I. At the top of this very

letter „I‟ it had been intersected with word „Genuine‟ (all the letters in black colour

with yellow base) whereas in the label of defendants‟ „SAINI‟ was written in red

KHADIM‟S is bigger, equal or smaller than the word KHAZANA. There is a

strong possibility of customers findings the shoes and boots etc. being sold under

confusing the same with the trademark of the plaintiff on account of use of the

word KHAZANA in the trademark of the defendants. Moreover, a customer of

average intelligence may presume that it is the product of the plaintiff which is

being sold in the stores of the defendants and that is why the word KHAZANA is
