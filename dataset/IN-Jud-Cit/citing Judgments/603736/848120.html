HEADNOTE:
The appellants are : (i) an establishment with less than  20
employees  and	which  was  not	 a  factory;  and  (ii)	  an
establishment  in  the	public	sector.	  On  the  question,
whether	 in view of the non-applicability of the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_8">Payment  of
Bonus Act</a>, 1965, to the two appellants-in the first case  by
reason of exclusion under<a href="/doc/217904/" id="a_9"> s. 1(3)</a> and in the other by reason
of  exemption  under <a href="/doc/1195762/" id="a_10"> s.  32(x)</a>-the  employees	of  the	 two
appellants were entitled to claim bonus dehors the Act.
HELD  :	 Considering  the history of  the  legislation,	 the
background  and	 the  circumstances in	which  the  Act	 was
enacted	 the  object of the Act and its scheme,	 it  is	 not
possible  to accept the construction suggested on behalf  of
the   respondents  (employees)	that  the  Act	is  not	  an
exhaustive  Act	 dealing comprehensively with  the  subject-
Matter of bonus in all its aspects, or that Parliament still
left  it  open to those to whom the Act does  not  apply  by
reason	of  exclusion or exemption to raise a  dispute	with
regard	 to   bonus  dehors  the  Act	through	  industrial
adjudication  under  the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_11">Industrial Disputes Act</a>,  1947,  or
other corresponding laws.
(1)  The  Court is justified in looking into the history  of
the  legislation and the statement of objects  and  reasons,
not  for  the  purpose of construing the Act,  but  for	 the
limited	  purpose  of  ascertaining  the   background,	 the
conditions  and circumstances which led to its passing,	 the
mischief  it  was  intended to prevent	and  the  remedy  it
furnished to prevent such mischief. [372 B-C]
Heydon's  case,	 76 E.R. 637, <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_12">Bengal Immunity  Co.  Ltd.  v.

S.C.R. 833 referred to.
Until  the  enactment  of the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_18">Payment of  Bonus	 Act</a>,  1965,
payment of bonus was not a statutory obligation on the	part
of the employer nor was it a statutory right of an employee.
It was originally a voluntary payment.	Under the Full Bench
formula,  evolved  by  the Labour  Appellate  Tribunal	with
respect	 to  disputes  for payment of bonus  in	 the  Bombay
Textile	 Industry, it acquired the character of a  right  to
share  in  the surplus of profits  enforceable	through	 the
machinery  of the Industrial Dispites Act, 1947,  and  other
corresponding  Act.  Under that Act, workmen  of  industrial
establishments could raise an industrial dispute and
367
demand	by way of bonus a proportionate share in profits  on
the  principle that both capital and labour had	 contributed
to the making of profits and therefore both were entitled to
a  share therein.  As a result of the observations  of	this
Court  in <a href="/doc/290317/" id="a_19">Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v.  Its  Workmen</a>,
[1959] S.C.R. 925 and in <a href="/doc/587016/" id="a_20">Ahmedabad Miscellaneous  Industrial
Workers'  Union	 v. The Ahmedabad Electricty Co</a>.,  [1962]  2
S.C.R.	934, the Government of India appointed a  Commission
to   make  recommendations  with  respect   to	 legislation
regarding  bonus.  The Government accepted the	majority  of
the Commission's recommendations and sponsored the enactment
of  the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_21">Payment of Bonus Act</a>.  Under this Act. liability  to
pay  bonus has now become a statutory obligation imposed  on
employers.  In providing such statutory liability Parliament
has  laid down a statutory formula on which bonus  would  be
savable	 irrespective  of  whether  the	 establishment	had,
during	a  particular accounting year, made profit  or	not.
Parliament further laid down that the formula it had evolved
and the statutory liability it provided, shall apply only to
certain	  establishments   and	 not  to   all.	   In	such
circumstances,	Parliament  has not to	provide	 by  express
words  that henceforth no bonus shall be payable  under	 the
industrial  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_22">Disputes  Act</a> or other  corresponding  Acts,  as
those Act never conferred any statutory right to bonus. [373

(2)  <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_29">The  Payment  of  Bonus  Act</a>  was	intended  to  be   a
comprehensive  and  exhaustive law dealing with	 the  entire
subject	 of bonus.  The fact that the preamble	states	that
the Act shall apply only to certain establishments and	that
s.  1(3) of the Act excludes establishments where less	than
20  persons ape employed, from the application of  the	Act,
does not necessarily mean that Parliament ras not dealt with
the subject-matter of bonus and the persons to whom it shall
apply  comprehensively in the Act.  Even where an Act  deals
comprehensively	  with	a  particular  subject-matter,	 the
Legislature  can provide that it shall apply  to  particular
persons	 or  group of persons or to  specified	institutions
only, and so, Parliament can lay down as a matter of  policy
that it will exclude from the application of the Act certain
types  of establishments and also provide for  exemption  of
certain other types of establishments which would  otherwise
fall within the scope of the Act. [380 C-H; 385 H]
(3)  Since the Payment of Bonus Art is an exhaustive statute
dealing	 with subject of bonus, one of the  consequences  is
that  under<a href="/doc/217904/" id="a_30"> s. 1(3)</a> of the Act, employees in  establishments
engaging    less than 20 Persons would get no  bonus  either
under this Act or under industrial adjudication provided for
by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_31">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and other corresponding Acts.
Under <a href="/doc/83101285/" id="a_32"> s. 1(3)</a>Parliament has excluded  petty  establishments
with  less than 20 employees in view of the  recommendations
of   the  Commission  in  that	regard,	 namely,  that	 the
application of the Act to such establishments would lead  to
harassment of petty proprietors and disharmony between	them
and  their  employees.	 To  hold  that	 employees  in	such
establishments would still be entitled to bonus, though	 not
under  the Act, would lead to the anomaly that if there	 are
two  establishments  in	 the  same  trade  or  industry	 one
engaging  more than 20 persons and the other  engaging	less
than 20 person, then, in the former case the employer  would
be
368
liable to pay bonus at the rate laid down in the Act,  while
in the latter, the employer would be liable to pay bonus  on
the basis of the Full Bench formula which may be at a higher
rate depending upon the quantum of profits in the particular
year. [382 C-F; 384 C-E]
(4)  Under  <a href="/doc/1195762/" id="a_33"> s.	  32(x)</a>	 of  the  Payment  of	Bonus	Act,
establishments	in the public sector are exempted  from	 the
application  of	 the Act.  Therefore,  employees  in  public
sector concerns would not be entitled to bonus, either under
the Act or which they might otherwise have got by raising  a
dispute	  under	 the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_34">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>	 and   other
corresponding statutes.	 The exemption is a limited one	 and
in  granting it, Parliament had a definite policy  in  mind,
namely,	 not  to  subject  such	 establishments	 which	 are
conducted  without any profit motive and are run for  public
benefit, to the burden of bonus.  To hold that even in these
exempted  cases, the employer would still be liable  to	 pay
bonus if the employees of such institutions were to raise  a
dispute under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_35">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and claim bonus in
accordance  with the Full Bench formula would also  lead  to
the  anomaly that the Legislature would be giving  exemption
with  one  hand	 and  taking it away  with  the	 other.	  If
Parliament wanted to retain the right to claim bonus by	 way
of  industrial	adjudication in the case  of  establishments
which are either excluded or exempted from the Act it  would
have  made an express saving provision to that effect as  it
has done for employees of coal mines. [382 F-H; 383 F-H; 384
A-C]
(5)  There  is	no question of a right to  bonus  under	 the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_36">Industrial  Disputes Act</a> or other corresponding	 laws  being
saved under<a href="/doc/1669461/" id="a_37"> S. 39</a> of the Payment of Bonus Act, because :
(a)  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_38">Industrial Disputes Act</a> or the corresponding	laws
though	they  confer substantial rights on  a  workman	with
regard	to lay off, retrenchment compensation, etc., do	 not
provide for a statutory right to payment of bonus; and	[385
C-G]
(b)  the  definition  of  'employee under<a href="/doc/806121/" id="a_39"> s.  2(13)</a>  of	 the
Payment	 of Bonus Act is wider than that of 'workman'  under
the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_40">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.  Therefore, a dispute  between
an employer and his employees, in relation to bonus may	 not
be  an	industrial dispute.  <a href="/doc/1412130/" id="a_41">Section 22</a> of  the	 Payment  of
Bonus  Act,  by	 fiction,  makes  such	disputes  industrial
disputes  and  applies	the  provisions	 of  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_42">Industrial
Disputes Act</a>.  <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_43">But the Payment of Bonus Act</a> does not provide
any  machinery	or  procedure  for  the	 investigation	 and
settlement of disputes which may arise between employers and
employees,  such  as  a dispute as  to	the  computation  of
allocable  surplus, or quantum of bonus or as to whether  an
establishment in the public sector is liable to pay bonus in
view of<a href="/doc/634859/" id="a_44"> s. 20</a> of the Act.  Therefore,<a href="/doc/1669461/" id="a_45"> s. 39</a>, which  provides
that  the  provisions  of the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_46">Payment of Bonus	Act</a>  are  in
addition to and not in derogation of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_47">Industrial Disputes
Act</a> and other corresponding laws, became necessary in  order
that  the  machinery of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_48">Industrial Disputes Act</a>  may  be
available  for	adjudication  of  such	disputes  under	 the
<a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_49">Payment of Bonus Act</a> F377 H; 378 A-G; 379 B-D]

</p><p id="p_9">The  Judgment of the Court was delivered by
Shelat, J. In Civil Appeal No. 1630 of 1967, workmen engaged
by  certain chilies and kirana shops in Madras and who	were
members	 of the respondent Union made a demand	on  December
13,  1965 for bonus for the year 1964-65 equivalent to	four
months' wages.	Conciliation proceedings having failed,	 the
dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Madras.  In
Civil  Appeal  No. 1721 of 1967,  the  appellant-company  is
admittedly  an establishment in public sector to which	sec.
20  of	the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_50">Payment of Bonus Act</a>, 21  of  1965	(hereinafter
referred  to  as  the Act) does not apply.   In	 both  these
cases, the Tribunals held that though the Act did not apply,
in the first case by reason of sec. 1(3) and in the other by
reason	of sec. 32(x), the employees were entitled to  claim
bonus  and  awarded their claims in C.A. No. 1630  of  1967.
The  appeals by special leave challenge the  correctness  of
the  view taken by the Tribunals as to the scope and  nature
of the Act.
</p><p id="p_10">The question for decision in both the appeals is whether  in
view of the non-applicability of the Act to  establishments,
not  being factories and which employ less than	 20  persons
therein	 as the appellants in appeal No. 1630 of  1967	are,
and the exemption of employees in an establishment in public
sector	though	employing  more	 than  20  persons  as	 the
appellant-company  in appeal No. 1721 of 1967 is under	sec.
32(x) of the Act, the employees in both these establishments
could  claim  bonus, dehors the Act.  The  question  depends
upon  the true view of certain provisions and the  scope  of
the  Act.  But before we take upon ourselves the  burden  of
construing  these,  provisions,	 it is	necessary  to  refer
briefly	 to the history of the question of bonus, the  back-
ground	and the circumstances in which the Act	was  passed.
This Is Permissible for the limited purpose of	appreciating
the mischief Parliament had in mind and the remedy which  it
wanted	to provide for preventing that mischief,and not	 for
the purpose of aiding us in construing the provisions of the
Act.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">370</span>
<p id="p_11">As early as 1584, in Heydao's case(1) it was said that	"for
the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general"
four  things are to be considered: (i) What was	 the  common
law before the making of the Act, (ii) What was the mischief
and  defect for which the common law did not provide,  (iii)
What  remedy the Parliament hath resolved and  appointed  to
cure  the  disease of the Commonwealth, and  (iv)  the	true
reason of the remedy.  <a href="/doc/608874/" id="a_51">In Bengal Immunity Company Limited v.
The  State  of	Bihar</a>(2) this Court  approved  the  rule  in
Heydon's  case(1)  and	in  construing	<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_52">Art.  2865</a>  of	 the
Constitution observed at p. 633 as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">		In   order   to	  properly   interpret	 the
	      provisions  of that Article it is,  therefore,
	      necessary	 to  consider how the  matter  stood
	      immediately before the, Constitution came into
	      force, what the mischief was for which the old
	      law  did not provide and the remedy which	 has
	      been provided by the Constitution to cure that
	      mischief'.
</blockquote><p id="p_12">In the Corporation of the City of Nagpur v. Its	 Employee(3)
the question was as to the meaning of the word "industry" in
sec.   2(14)  of  the  C.P.  &amp;	Berar  Industrial   Disputes
(Settlement) Act (23 of 1947).	This Court said that "if the
word  were  to	be construed in	 its  ordinary	sense  every
calling, service, employment of an employee or any business,
trade  or calling of an employer would be an industry.	 But
such  a	 wide meaning appears to overreach  the	 object	 for
which  the Act was passed".  The Court, therefore, found  it
necessary to limit the scope of the said word having  regard
to the aim, scope and the object of the Act.  Relying on the
four   tests  laid  down  in  Heydon's	case(1)	 the   Court
considered  the	 fundamental  basis  of	 the  definition  of
industry, viz. relationship between employees and employers,
the  long  title and the, preamble of the  Act	showing	 the
object	of  passing the Act  the historical  background	 for
passing	 it and held that "it is manifest that the  Act	 was
introduced as an important step in achieving social justice,
to  ameliorate	the conditions of service of the  labour  in
organised activities than to anything else and therefore the
Act was not intended to reach the personal services which do
not depend on the employment of labour force".	Similarly in
<a href="/doc/725224/" id="a_53">R.  M.	D. Chamarbaugwalla v. The Union of  India</a>  (4),	 the
question arose whether looking to the general words used  in
sec.  2(d)  of the <a href="/doc/654270/" id="a_54">Prize Competitions Act</a>, 42  of  1955	 the
words  'prize competition' included not merely	competitions
of  a  gambling	 nature	 but also  those  in  which  success
depended  to a substantial degree on skill.   In  construing
the said definition, the Court gave a restricted meaning  to
the  words "prize competition" as meaning only	competitions
as  were  of  a gambling` nature.  In doing  so,  the  Court
approved the
(1)[1955] 2 S.C.R.603. (2) 76 E.R. 637. (3) [1960] 2  S.C.R.
942 (4) 1957 S.C.R. 930.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">371</span>
<p id="p_13">principles of construction stated in the case of the  Bengal
Immunity Ltd.(1) and held that "in interpreting an enactment
the Court should ascertain the intention of the	 legislature
not merely from a literal meaning of the words used but also
from  such  matters as the history of the  legislation,	 its
purpose	 and  the  mischief  it	 seeks	to  suppress".	 For
considering the intention of Parliament not merely from	 the
literal meaning of the definition in sec. 2(d) but also from
the  history  of the legislation the Court looked  into	 the
Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competitions Control and <a href="/doc/6749/" id="a_55">Tax Act</a>,
1948,  how  it could be and was evaded by the  promoters  of
lotteries  by  shifting the venue of their business  to	 the
neighbouring State of Mysore, the concerted action taken  by
the adjoining States, the resolutions passed by each of them
calling	 upon Parliament to undertake legislation, the	fact
of  Parliament	having	passed	the  law  and  its  preamble
reciting the fact of the State legislatures having asked  it
to pass such a law.  Having done that, the Court observed at
p. 938
	      "Having  regard  to  the	circumstances  under
	      which the resolutions came to be passed, there
			    cannot  be any reasonable doubt that
the,  law
	      which the State legislatures moved  Parliament
	      to enact under <a href="/doc/282696/" id="a_56">Art. 252(1)</a> was one to  control
	      and regulate prize competitions of a  gambling
	      character.   Competitions	 in  which   success
	      depended substantially on skill could not have
	      been  in the minds of the	 legislatures  which
	      passed those resolutions.	 Those	competitions
	      had not been the subject of any controversy in
	      Court.   They  had not done any  harm  to	 the
	      public  and had presented no problems  to	 the
	      States  and  at  no time had  there  been	 any
	      legislation directed to regulating them".
Though the Court refused to look at the statement of objects
and  reasons  for the, purpose of construing sec.  2(d),  it
held that "having regard to the history of the	legislation,
the declared object thereof and the wording of the  statute"
the words had to be, given a restricted meaning.  <a href="/doc/384084/" id="a_57">In Central
Bank  of India v. Their Workmen</a> (2 the Court  in  construing
sec.  10(1)  (b) of the <a href="/doc/444965/" id="a_58">Banking Companies Act</a>, 10  of  1949,
again looked at the legislative history to ascertain Jr	 the
object	of  passing the Act and the mischief  it  sought  to
remedy,but  declined  to use the statement  of	objects	 and
reasons	 to  construe  the section on the  -round  that	 the
statement  could  not control the actual words used  in	 the
section.  (Cf.	also  <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_59">State  of	 West  Bengal  v.  Union  of

<p id="p_17">Muslim	University (Amendment) Act, 19 of 1965 as  violating
<a href="/doc/1687408/" id="a_62">Art.  30(1)</a>  of the Constitution. this Court went  into	 the
history of the establishment of the University to  ascertain
whether	 it  was set up by the Muslim minority and  as	such
entitled  to rights under <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_63">Art. 30</a> and held that it  was	 not
set  up	 by  the minority but in  fact	established  by	 the
Government of India by passing the <a href="/doc/892594/" id="a_64">Aligarh Muslim University
Act</a>, 1920 of.  Crawford on Statutory Construction (3rd	Ed.)
pages  482-483].  There is thus sample authority  justifying
the  Court in looking into the history of  the	legislation,
not  for  the  purpose of construing the  Act  but  for	 the
limited	  purpose  of  ascertaining  the   background,	 the
conditions  and the circumstances which led to its  passing,
the  mischief it was intended to prevent and the  remedy  it
furnished  to  prevent	such mischief.	 The,  statement  of
objects	 and  reasons  also can	 be  legitimately  used	 for
ascertaining  the object which the legislature had in  mind,
though not for construing the Act.
</p><p id="p_18">What were the conditions prevailing at the time when the Act
was  passed and what was the object which Parliament had  in
mind  in  passing it ? Bonus was originally  regarded  as  a
gratuitous  payment  by an employer to his  employees.	 The
practice  of  paying bonus as an ex gratia payment  had	 its
early roots in the textile industry in Bombay and Ahmedabad.
In  1917  and 1918 an increase of 10 and 15%  of  wages	 was
granted	 as  War  bonus	 to  the  textile  workers  by	 the
employers.   In October, 1920, a Committee appointed by	 the
Bombay Millowners recommended to the member mills payment of
bonus  equal  to  one  month's	pay.   Similarly  bonus	 was
declared  in  1921  and	 1922.	 It  appears  that   trading
conditions  in the industry having deteriorated,  the  mill-
owners	declared in July 1923 that they would be  unable  to
pay  bonus for 1923.  Thereupon a strike began which  became
general towards the end of January 1924.  In February  1924,
a bonus dispute Committee was appointed by the Government of
Bombay	to  consider the nature of, the conditions  and	 the
basis  of bonus which had been granted to the  employees  in
the  textile mills and to declare whether the employees	 had
established  any  enforceable  claim,  customary,  legal  or
equitable.  The Committee held that they had not established
any enforceable claim, customary, legal or equitable, to  an
annual	payment of bonus which could be upheld in  a  court.
The  years  that followed were years of	 depression  and  no
major dispute about bonus arose, although bonuses were given
on  ad hoc basis by a few industrial  undertakings.   During
the Second World War, managements of textile mills paid cash
bonus  equivalent  to a fraction of the surplus	 profit	 but
this  was also voluntary payment to keep  labour  contented.
Disputes  for payment of bonus for the years 1948  and	1949
arose  in the Bombay textile industry.	On the said  dispute
having	been  referred to the Industrial Court,	 that  Court
expressed  the	view  that since  both	labour	and  capital
contributed to the profits of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">373</span>
industry  both were entitled to a legitimate return  out  of
the profits and evolved a formula for charging certain prior
liabilities on the gross profits of the accounting year	 and
awarded	  a  percentage	 of  the  balance  as  bonus.	 The
Industrial Court excluded the mills which had suffered	loss
from  the  liability to pay bonus.  In appeals	against	 the
said awards, the Labour Appellate Tribunal approved  broadly
the  method of computing bonus as a fraction of the  surplus
profit.	  According  to this formula, which has	 since	been
referred to as the Full Bench formula, the surplus available
for distribution is to be determined after debiting  certain
prior  charges	from gross profits, viz. (1)  provision	 for
depreciation  (2) reservation for rehabilitation (3)  return
of 6% on paid-up capital, and (4) return on working  capital
at  a  rate lower than the one on the paid-up  capital.	  <a href="/doc/1681654/" id="a_65">In
Muir  Mills Company v. Suti Mills Mazdoor Union</a>,  Kanpur(1),
<a href="/doc/1685938/" id="a_66">Baroda	Borough	 Municipality v. Its Workmen</a>(2),  <a href="/doc/512619/" id="a_67">The  Shree
Meenakshi  Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen</a>(3) and <a href="/doc/641562/" id="a_68">The  State  of
Mysore v. The Workers of Gold Mines</a>(4) this Court laid	down
(1)  that bonus was not a gratuitous payment nor a  deferred
wage,  and  (2) that where wages fall short  of	 the  living
standard and the industry makes profit part of which is	 due
to the contribution of labour, a claim for bonus may legiti-
mately be made by the workmen.	The Court, however, did	 not
examine the propriety nor the order of priorities as between
the several charges and their relative importance nor did it
examine	 the desirability of making any alterations  in	 the
said  formula.	These questions came to be examined for	 the
first  time  in	 <a href="/doc/290317/" id="a_69">Associated Cement  Companies  Ltd.  v.	 Its
Workmen</a>(5)  where the said formula was	generally  approved.
Since  that  decision, this Court has  accepted	 in  several
cases  the  said formula.  The principal feature,,,  of	 the
formula	 are that each year for which bonus is claimed is  a
self-contained	unit,  that bonus is to be computed  on	 the
profits	 of  the establishment during that  year,  that	 the
gross profits are to be determined after debiting the  wages
and dearness allowance paid to the employees and other items
of  expenditure against total receipts as disclosed  by	 the
profit and loss account, and that against such gross profits
the  aforesaid	four  items  are to  be	 deducted  as  prior
charges.   The formula was not based on any legal  right  or
liability, its object being only to distribute profits after
reasonable allocations for the aforesaid charges.   Attempts
were  thereafter  made from time to time to  have  the	said
formula	 revised  but they were rejected first	in  A.C.C.'s
case(5) and again in <a href="/doc/587016/" id="a_70">The Ahmedabad Miscellaneous  Industrial
Workers	 Union	v. The Ahmedabad Electricity  Co.  Ltd</a>.	 (6)

therefore,  suggested  that  the question  of  revising	 the
formula	 should	 be "comprehensively considered	 by  a	high
powered	 Commission".  Taking up  the-aforesaid	 suggestion,
the  Government	 of India appointed a:	Commission,  by	 its
resolution  dated December 6, 1961, the terms  of  reference
whereof were, inter alia,
</p><p id="p_20">	      1.    to	define the concept of bonus  and  to
	      consider in relation to industrial  employment
	      the  question  of payment of  bonus  based  on
	      profits	 and   recommend   principles	 for
	      computation  of  such  bonus  and	 methods  of
	      payment;
</p><p id="p_21">	      2.    to	determine  what	 the  prior  charges
	      should  be in different circumstances and	 how
	      they should be calculated.
</p><p id="p_22">	      3.    to	determine  conditions  under   which
	      bonus   payment  should  be,  made   unitwise,
	      industrywise and industry-cum regionwise;
</p><p id="p_23">	      4.    to	consider  whether there	 should	 be,
	      lower   limits   irrespective   of   loss	  in

	      over a prescribed period; and

	      method for settlement of bonus disputes.
</p><p id="p_25">	      After  an	 elaborate enquiry,  the  Commission
	      made    the    following	  -amongst     other
	      recommendations :
</p><p id="p_26">	      1.    That  bonus was paid to the	 workers  as
	      share  in the prosperity of the  establishment
	      and that the basic scheme of the bonus formula
	      should  be  adhered to viz.  determination  of
	      bonus as a percentage of gross profits reduced
	      by  the following prior charges,	viz.  normal
	      depreciation allowable under the Indian Income
	      Tax  including  multiple	shifting  allowance,
	      income  tax  and	super  tax  at	the  current
	      standard	rate  applicable for  the  year	 for
	      which  tax is to be calculated but  not  super
	      profits tax, return on paid up capital  raised
	      through  preference shares at the actual	rate
	      of dividend payable, on other paid-up  capital
	      at  7% and on reserves used as capital at	 4%.

	      rehabilitation.
</p><p id="p_28">	      2.    That 60% of the available surplus should
	      be  distributed as bonus and excess should  be
	      carried forward and taken into account in	 the
	      next  year; the balance of 40%  should  remain

	      in  the  prior charges, annual  provision	 re-
	      quired for redemption of debentures, etc.
</p><p id="p_30">	      3.    That  the distinction between the  basic
	      wages  and dearness allowance for the  purpose
	      of  arriving  at the bonus quantum  should  be
	      done away with and bonus should be related  to
	      wages and dearness allowance taken together;
</p><p id="p_31">	      4.    That  minimum bonus should be 4% of	 the
	      total  basic wage and dearness allowance	paid
	      during  the year or Rs. 40 to  each  employee,
	      whichever	 is  higher,  and  in  the  case  of
	      children	the minimum should be equivalent  to
	      4% of their basic wage and dearness allowance,
	      or Rs. 25	 whichever is higher;

	      corresponding  Act  provided that	 quantum  of
	      bonus payable to employees drawing total basic
	      pay and allowance over Rs. 750/p.m. should  be
	      limited  to what it would be if their pay	 and
	      dearness allowance were Rs. 750 p.m.
</p><p id="p_34">	      7.    That the formula should not apply to new
	      establishments  until they recouped all  early
	      losses	including    arrears	of    normal
	      depreciation  subject to the time limit  of  6
	      years; and

ttlements
	      had been reached or decisions had been given.
The fact that the Government of India accepted the  majority
of  the	 Commission's  recommendations	is  clear  from	 the
Statement of objects and reasons attached to Bill No. 49  of
1965  which  they sponsored in Parliament.   The  Statement,
inter alia, states that a "tripartite Commission was set  up
by the Government of India by resolution dated 6th  December
1961  to  consider in comprehensive manner the	question  of
payment	 of bonus based on profits to employees employed  in
establishments and to make recom-
</p><p id="p_36">37 6
mendations to the Government.  The Commission's report	con-
taining	 the recommendations was received by the  Government
on  24th January, 1964.	 By resolution dated 2nd  September,
1964,  Government announced acceptance of  the	Commission's
recommendations	 subject  to  a few  modifications  as	were
mentioned therein".  To implement these recommendations	 the
Payment of Bonus Ordinance, 1965 was promulgated on May	 29,
1965.	Since the Ordinance was replaced by the present	 Act
published  on  September  25, 1965,  it	 is  unnecessary  to
examine its provisions.	 Thus, bonus which was originally  a
voluntary payment acquired under the Full Bench formula	 the
character  of  a  right	 to share  in  the  surplus  profits
enforceable through the machinery of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_72">Industrial Disputes
Act</a>,  1947  and	 other corresponding Acts.   <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_73">Under  the	 Act</a>
liability to pay bonus has now become a statutory obligation
imposed	  on  the  employers.	From  the  history  of	 the
legislation  it	 is clear (1) that the Government set  up  a
Commission  to consider comprehensively the entire  question
of  bonus  in all its aspects; and (2) that  the  Commission
accordingly Considered the concept of bonus, the, method  of
computation,  the machinery for enforcement and a  statutory
formula	  in  place  of	 the  one  evolved   by	  industrial
adjudication.
</p><p id="p_37">We  proceed next to examine some, of the provisions  of	 the
Act and its scheme.
</p><p id="p_38">The  preamble  of the Act states that it is to	provide	 for
payment	 of bonus in certain establishments and for  matters
connected  therewith.  <a href="/doc/217904/" id="a_74">Section 1(3)</a> provides that  it  shall
apply  "save as otherwise provided in the Act" to (a)  every
factory	 and  (b) every other establishment in which  20  or
more  persons are employed on any day during the  accounting
year.	We  may note that this subsection is  in  consonance
with one of the Commission's recommendations, viz. that	 its
bonus  formula	should	not be applied to  small  shops	 and
establishments which are not factories and which employ less
than 20 persons.  Having made clear that the Act is to apply
only  to  those establishments mentioned in  sub.-sec.	(3),
sub.-sec.  (4)	provides that the Act shall have  effect  in
respect	 of  the accounting year 1964 and  every  subsequent
year.  "Allocable surplus" under<a href="/doc/1711044/" id="a_75"> S. 2(4)</a> means 67% in  cases
falling	 under	cl.  (a)  and 60%  in  other  cases  of	 the
available surplus.  Sec. 2(6) defines 'available surplus' to
mean available surplus as computed under sec. 5. Sec.  2(15)
defines "establishment in private sector" to mean any estab-
lishment other than an establishment in public sector.	Sec.
2(16)  defines "establishment in public sector"	 as  meaning
</p><p id="p_39">(a)  a	Government  company  as defined in <a href="/doc/1430621/" id="a_76"> S.	617</a>  of	 the
Companies Act, 1956, and (b) a Corporation in which not less
than  40%  of  it-- capital is held  by	 Government  or	 the
Reserve	 Bank of India or a Corporation owned by  Government
or  the Reserve Bank of India.	"Gross profits" a-,  defined
by sec. 2(18) means oross profits cal-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">377</span>
<p id="p_40">culated under sec. 4. Sees. 4 and 5 provide for	 computation
of  gross  profits  and available  surplus  after  deducting
therefrom the sums referred to in sec. 6 viz.,	depreciation
admissible under 32(1) of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_77">Income Tax Act</a> or the relevant
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_78">Agricultural   Income	Tax  Act</a>,  development	 rebate	  or
development  allowance Admissible under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_79">Income  Tax	 Act</a>
and such other sums as are specified in the third  Schedule.
Sec. 7 deals with calculation of direct tax.  Sees. 8 and  9
deals	with  eligibility  of  and   disqualification	from
receiving bonus.  Sees. 10 to 15 deal with minimum and maxi-
mum  bonus  and the provisions for 'set off' and  'set	on'.
Sees. 18, 19, and 21 to 31 deal with certain procedural	 and
allied	matters.  Sec. 20 deals with certain  establishments
in  public  sector to which the Act is	made  applicable  in
certain events.	 Sec. 32 exclude from the application of the
Act   certain	categories   of	  employees   and    certain
establishments therein specified.  Sec. 34 provides for	 the
overriding effect of the Act notwithstanding anything incon-
sistent	 therewith contained in any other law for  the	time
being  in  force  or  in  terms	 of  any  award,  agreement,
settlement or contract of service made before May 29,  1965.
Sec.  35 saves the provisions of the Coal  Mines,  Provident
Fund  and  Bonus  Schemes  Act,	 1948  or  any	scheme	made
thereunder.   Sec.  35 empowers	 an  appropriate  Government
having	regard to the financial position and other  relevant
circumstances	 of   any   establishment   or	 class	  of
establishments	if it is of opinion that it would not be  in
public interest to apply all or any of the provisions of the
Act  thereto, to exempt for such period as may be  specified
by it such establishment or class of establishments from all
or  any of the provisions of the Act.  Sec. 39	provides  as
follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">	      "Save  as	 otherwise expressly  provided,	 the
	      provisions of this Act shall be in addition to
	      and  not	in  derogation	of  the	  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_80">Industrial
	      Disputes	Act</a>, 1947 or any  corresponding	 law
	      relating	to investigation and  settlement  of
	      industrial disputes in force in a State".
</blockquote><p id="p_41">It  will be noticed that sec. 22 provides that where a	dis-
pute  arises between an employer and his employees (1)	with
respect	 to  the bonus payable under the Act,  or  (2)	with
respect to the application of the Act, such a dispute  shall
be deemed to be an industrial dispute within the meaning  of
the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_81">Industrial Disputes Act</a>, 1947 or any corresponding	 law
relating  to  investigation  and  settlement  of  industrial
disputes in force in a State and the provisions of that	 Act
and  such law, as the case may be, shall, save as  otherwise
expressly   provided,  apply  accordingly.   An	  industrial
dispute under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_82">Industrial Disputes Act</a> would be between a
workman	 as  defined in that Act and his  employer  and	 the
dispute can be an industrial dispute if it is one as defined
therein.   But	the definition of an "employee"	 under	sec.
2(13)  of this Act is wider than that of a  "workman"  under
the Industrial Disputes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">378</span>
Act.   A  dispute;  between an	employer  and  an  employee,
therefore,  may not fall under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_83">Industrial  Disputes	 Act</a>
and in such a case the Act would not apply and its machinery
for  investigation  and settlement would not  be  available.
That  being  so,  and  in  order  that	such  machinery	 for
investigation  and settlement may be available, sec. 22	 has
been  enacted  to  create a legal  fiction  whereunder	such
disputes  are  deemed to be industrial	disputes  under	 the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_84">Industrial Disputes Act</a> or any other corresponding law.	 For
the  purposes  of  such	 disputes  the	provisions  of	 the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_85">Industrial   Disputes  Act</a>  or	such  other  law  are	made
applicable.   The effect of sec. 22 thus is (1) to make	 the
disputes referred to therein industrial disputes within	 the
meaning	  of   the   <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_86">Industrial	 Disputes   Act</a>	  or   other
corresponding  law  and	 (2) having so	done  to  apply	 the
provisions  of	that  Act or  other  corresponding  law	 for
investigation  and  settlement of such	disputes.   But	 the
application of sec.  22 is limited only to the two types  of
disputes  referred  to therein and not to  others.   <a href="/doc/1022486/" id="a_87">Section
39</a>,  on	 theother  hand, provides that	"save  as  otherwise
expressly  provided" the provisions of the Act shall  be  in
addition  to  and  not	in  derogation	of  the,  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_88">Industrial
Disputes   Act</a>	 or  any  corresponding	 law   relating	  to
investigation and settlement of industrial disputes in force
in a State.  Except for providing for recovery of bonus	 due
under a settlement, award, or agreement as an arrear of land
revenue	 as laid down in sec. 21, the Act does	not  provide
any  machinery	for  the  investigation	 and  settlement  of
disputes between an employer and an employee.  If a dispute,
for  instance,	were  to arise as  regards  the	 quantum  of
available  surplus,  such a dispute not	 being	one  falling
under  sec.  22,  Parliament had to  make  a  provision	 for
investigation and settlement thereof.  Though such a dispute
would  not  be	an  industrial dispute	as  defined  by	 the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_89">Industrial Disputes Act</a> or other corresponding Act in  force
in a State, sec. 39 by providing that the provisions of this
Act  shall  be in addition to and not in derogation  of	 the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_90">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a> or such  corresponding  law  makes
available the machinery in that Act or the corresponding Act
available  for	investigation and settlement  of  industrial
disputes thereunder for deciding the disputes arising  under
this  Act.  As already seen sec. 22 artificially  makes	 two
kinds  of disputes therein referred to	industrial  disputes
and having done so applies the provisions of the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_91">Industrial
Disputes Act</a> and other corresponding law in force for  their
investigation and settlement.  But what about the  remaining
disputes  ?  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_92">As the Act</a> does not provide any  machinery	 for
their  investigation and settlement, Parliament by  enacting
sec. 39 has sought to apply the provisions of those Acts for
investigation  and  settlement of  the	remaining  disputes,
though such disputes are not industrial disputes as  defined
in  those  Acts.  Though, the words "in force  in  a  State"
after  the  words  "or any  corresponding  law	relating  to
investigation  and settlement of industrial disputed  appear
to qualify the words "any corresponding law" and not the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">379</span>
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_93">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>, the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_94">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>  is
primarily a law relating to investigation and settlement  of
industrial   disputes  and  provides   machinery   therefor.
Therefore  the distinction there made between that  Act	 and
the  other  laws does not seem to be of much point.   It  is
thus clear that by providing in<a href="/doc/1022486/" id="a_95"> s. 39</a> that the provisions of
this  Act shall be in addition to and not in  derogation  of
those  Acts,  Parliament wanted to avail of those  Acts	 for
investigation  and  settlement of disputes which  may  arise
under  this Act.  The distinction between sec. 22  and	sec.
39, therefore, is that whereas sec. 22 by fiction makes	 the
disputes referred to therein industrial disputes and applies
the  provisions	 of the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_96">Industrial Disputes  Act</a>  and  other
corresponding  laws  for the  investigation  and  settlement
thereof,  Sec.	39  makes  available for  the  rest  of	 the
disputes  the  machinery  provided in  that  Act  and  other
corresponding  laws  for adjudication  of  disputes  arising
under this Act.	 Therefore, there is no question of a  right
to  bonus  under  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_97">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>  or   other
corresponding Acts having been retained or saved by sec. 39.
Neither	 the  Industrial Disputes Act nor any of  the  other
corresponding laws provides for a right to bonus.  Item 5 in
Schedule  3  to	 the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_98">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>	 deals	with
jurisdiction  of tribunals set up under<a href="/doc/1150040/" id="a_99"> ss. 7</a>, <a href="/doc/658901/" id="a_100">7A</a> and <a href="/doc/835880/" id="a_101">7B</a>  of
that Act, but does not provide for any right to bonus.	Such
a  right is statutorily provided for the first time by	this
Act.
</p><p id="p_42">Mr. Ramamurti and Mr. Gokhale for the respondents,  however,
sought to make the following points :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">	      1.    <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_102">The	  Act</a>	applies	 only	to   certain
	      establishments and its preamble and sec.	1(3)
	      show  to	which of them it is  expressly	made
	      applicable;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">	      2.    Under   sec.  1(3),	 the  Act  is	made
	      applicable to all factories and establishments
	      in  which	 20  or more  persons  are  employed
	      except those "otherwise provided in the  Act".
	      It  means that the Act does not apply  (i)  to
	      factories	   and	 establishments	   otherwise
	      provided	  in   the   Act,   and	  (ii)	  to
	      establishments which have less than 20 persons
	      employed.	  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_103">The  Act</a>,  therefore,	 is  not   a
	      comprehensive   Act   but	 applies   only	  to
	      factories	 and establishments covered by	sec.
	      1(3);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_5">	      3.    There is no categorical provision in the
	      Act  depriving the employees of factories	 and
	      establishments  not  covered by  or  otherwise
	      saved in the Act of bonus which they would  be
	      entitled to under any other law;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">	      4.    That   being   so,	the   employees	  of
	      establishments  to which the Act is  not	made
	      applicable  would still be entitled  to  bonus
	      under  a law other than the Act although	they
	      are not entitled to the benefit of the Act;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">	      380</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">	      5.    Parliament	was aware of the  fact	that
	      employees	 in establishments other than  those
	      to  which, the Act aplies were  getting  bonus
	      under adjudication provided by the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_104">Industrial
	      Disputes	Act</a> and other similar Acts.   If  it
	      intended to deprive them of such bonus  surely
	      it would have expressed so in the Act;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">	      6.    Sec.  39 in clear terms saves the  right
	      to  claim bonus under the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_105">Industrial  Disputes
	      Act</a> or any corresponding law by providing that
	      the  provisions  of  this	 Act  shall  be	  in
	      addition	to  and	 not in	 derogation  of	 the
	      provisions of those Acts.
</blockquote><p id="p_43">It  is	true  that the preamble states that the	 Act  is  to
provide for payment of bonus to persons employed in  certain
establishments	and  sec. 1(3) provides that the Act  is  to
apply, save as otherwise provided therein, to factories	 and
every  other establishments in which 20 or more persons	 are
employed.  Sub-sec. (4) of sec. 1 also provides that the Act
is  to	have  effect  in  relation  to	such  factories	 and
establishments	from the- accounting year commencing on	 any
day in 1964 and every subsequent accounting year.  But these
provisions  do not, for that reason, necessarily  mean	that
the  Act  was  not  intended  to  be  a	 comprehensive	 and
exhaustive law dealing with the entire subject of bonus	 and
the  persons  to whom it should apply.	Even  where  an	 Act
deals comprehensively with a particular subject-matter,	 the
Legislature  can  surely  provide that	it  shall  apply  to
particular  persons  or groups of persons  or  to  specified
institutions  only.  Therefore, the fact that  the  preamble
states	that the Act shall apply to  certain  establishments
does  not necessarily mean that it was not intended to be  a
comprehensive  provision dealing with the subject-matter  of
bonus.	 While dealing with the subject-matter of bonus	 the
Legislature can lay down as a matter of policy that it	will
exclude from its application certain types of establishments
and  also  provide for exemption of certain other  types  of
establishments	 even  though  such   establishments   would
otherwise  fall within the scope of the Act.  The  exclusion
of establishments where less than 20 persons are employed in
sec.  1(3)  therefore  is not a	 criterion  suggesting	that
Parliament  has not dealt with the subject-matter  of  bonus
comprehensively in the Act.
</p><p id="p_44">As  already seen, there was until the enactment of this	 Act
no  statute  under which payment of bonus  was	a  statutory
obligation on the part of ,in employer or a statutory  right
therefore  of  an employee.  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_106">Under the	Industrial  Disputes
Act</a>,   1947  and  other	 corresponding	Acts,	workmen	  of
industrial establishments as defined therein could raise  an
industrial   dispute   and  demand  by	way   of   bonus   a
proportionate  share  in profits  and  Industrial  Tribunals
could  under those Acts adjudicate such disputes and  oblige
the  employers	to  pay bonus on  the  principle  that	both
capital and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">381</span>
labour	had  contributed to the making of the  profits	and,
therefore, both were entitled to a share therein.  The right
to  the payment of bonus and the obligation to pay it  arose
on  principles	of  equity and	fairness  in  settling	such
disputes under the machinery provided by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_107">Industrial Act</a>s
and  not as a statutory right and liability as provided	 for
the  first  time  by the present  Act.	 In  providing	such
statutory  liability, Parliament has laid down	a  statutory
formula on which bonus would be calculated irrespective,  of
whether	  the  establishment  in  question  has	  during   a
particular  accounting	year  made profit or  not.   It	 can
further	 lay  down that the formula it has evolved  and	 the
statutory liability it provides in the Act shall apply	only
to  certain establishments and not to all.  Since there	 was
no  such statutory obligation under any previous Act,  there
would  not  be any question of Parliament having  to  delete
either	such  obligation or right.  In	such  circumstances,
since	Parliament  is	providing  for	such  a	 right	 and
obligation  for the first time, there would be	no  question
also  of  its  having  to insert  in  the,  Act	 an  express
provision  of  exclusion.   In other words, it	has  not  to
provide	 by express words that henceforth no bonus shall  be
payable	 under	the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_108">Industrial Disputes Act</a>  or	 other	cor-
responding  Acts as those Acts did not confer any  statutory
right to bonus.
</p><p id="p_45">It  will be noticed that though the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_109">Industrial Disputes	 Act</a>
confers	 substantive  rights on workmen with regard  to	 lay
off, retrenchment compensation, etc., it does not create  or
confer	any  such statutory right as to	 payment  to  bonus.
Bonus was so far the creature of industrial adjudication and
was  made  payable  by the  employers  under  the  machinery
provided under that Act and other corresponding Acts enacted
for   investigation  and  settlement  of   disputes   raised
thereunder.  There was, therefore, no question of Parliament
having	to delete or modify item 5 in the third Schedule  to
Industrial  '<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_110">Disputes Act</a> or any such provision in any	cor-
responding Act or its having to 'exclude any right to  bonus
thereunder by any categorical exclusion in the present Act.
But  the argument was that if the Act were to be held as  an
exhaustive statute dealing with the subject of bonus,  three
results	 would follow which could never have  been  expected
much less G intended by Parliament.  These results would  be
: (1) that employees in establishments engaging less than 20
persons	 would get no bonus at all either under the  Act  or
under industrial adjudication provided for by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_111">Industrial
Disputes  Act</a>  and  other corresponding	 Acts.	 Since	such
employees  were	 so  far  getting  bonus  as  a	 result	  of
industrial   adjudication,  Parliament	could	never	have
intended  to  deprive  them  of	 such  benefit;	 (ii)	that
employees in public sector Corporations and Companies  would
get  no bonus either under the Act or under  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_112">Industrial
Disputes Act</a> or other corresponding law; and (iii) that such
a construction would have
</p><p id="p_46">-12 Sup CI/68-10
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">382</span>
the,   effect  of  impliedly  repealing	 and  negating	 the
provisions   of	 the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_113">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>	 and   other
corresponding laws.
</p><p id="p_47">Though sec. 1(3) excludes an establishment other than a fac-
tory  having less than 20 employees from the application  of
the Act, all establishments which are factories irrespective
of   the  number  of  persons  employed	 therein   and	 all
establishments which are not factories but are having 20  or
more  employees	 are covered by the  Act.   Therefore,	only
small establishments having less than 20 employees and which
are  not factories are excluded.  Even in such cases if	 any
establishment  were  to	 have 20 or  more  persons  employed
therein	 on  any day in any accounting year, the  Act  would
apply  to  such an establishment.  It is,  therefore,  clear
that  Parliament by enacting sec. 1(3) excluded	 only  petty
establishments.
</p><p id="p_48">We  are	 not impressed by the argument	that  Parliament  in
excluding such petty establishments could not have  intended
that employees therein who were getting bonus under the Full
Bench  formula	should	lose that  benefit.   As  aforesaid,
Parliament  was	 evolving  for the first  time	a  statutory
formula	 in  regard to bonus and laying down  a	 legislative
policy	in regard thereto as to the classes of	persons	 who
would  be  entitled to bonus thereunder.  It laid  down	 the
definition  of	an  'employee'	far  more  wider  than	 the
definition of a 'workman' in the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_114">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and
the  other  corresponding  Acts.  If,  while  doing  so,  it
expressly  excluded  as	 a matter of  policy  certain  petty
establishments	 in  view  of  the  recommendation  of	 the
Commission in that regard, viz., that the application of the
Act  would  lead  to harassment	 of  petty  proprietors	 and
disharmony  between them and their employees, it  cannot  be
said that Parliament did not intend or was not aware of	 the
result	 of   exclusion	  of   employees   of	such   petty
establishments.
</p><p id="p_49">It is true that the construction canvassed on behalf of	 the
appellants leads, as argued by counsel for the	respondents,
to  employees  in public sector concerns being	deprived  of
bonus which they would be getting by raising a dispute under
the   <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_115">Industrial  Disputes  Act</a>	 and   other   corresponding
statutes.   But such a result occurs in consequence  of	 the
exemption  of establishments in public sector from the	Act,
though	such  establishments but for sec. 32(x)	 would	have
otherwise fallen within the purview of the Act.	 It  appears
to  us	that  the exemption is	enacted	 with  a  deliberate
object,	 viz.,	not to subject such  establishments  to	 the
burden	of  bonus  which are conducted	without	 any  profit
motive	and  are run for public benefit.  The  exemption  in
sec. 32(x) is, however, a limited one, for, under sec. 20 if
a public sector establishment were in any accounting year to
sell goods produced or manufactured by it in IF	 competition
with an establishment in private sector and the income	from
such  sale is not less than the 20% of its gross income,  it
would  be liable to pay bonus under the Act.  Once again  it
is clear
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">383</span>
that  in exempting public sector establishments,  Parliament
had a definite policy in mind.
</p><p id="p_50">This  policy  becomes  all the	more  discernible  when	 the
various other categories of establishments exempted from the
Act by sec. 32 are examined.  An insurer carrying on general
insurance  business  is exempted under cl. (i)	in  view  of
certain	 provisions  of	 the <a href="/doc/1656199/" id="a_116">Insurance	Act</a>,  1936  and	 the
<a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_117">Insurance   (Amendment)	 Act</a>,  1950.   In  view	  of   these
provisions  the Full Bench formula could not be and was	 not
in  fact  applied at any time to such  insurance  establish-
ments.	The Life Insurance Corporation of India is  exempted
under  clause  (1)  because of its  being  a  public  sector
concern	 having	 no Cl. (ii) of sec. 32	 profit	 motive	 and
conducted  in  public  interest.exempts	 shipping  companies
employing  seamen  in view of sec.. 159(9) of  the  <a href="/doc/681709/" id="a_118">Merchant
Shipping  Act</a>, 1958 under which the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_119">Industrial Disputes	 Act</a>
was  inapplicable  to such seamen,  the	 disadvantages	that
Indian	 Shipping  Companies  vis-a-vis	 foreign   companies
engaged in shipping would be put to if they were made to pay
bonus  and the obvious difficulties in applying the  Act  to
such   foreign	companies  engaging  Indian   seamen.	 The
exemption  in respect of stevedore labour contained  in	 cl.
</p><p id="p_51">(iii)  also seems to have been provided for in view  of	 the
peculiar   nature   of	employment,,   the   difficulty	  of
calculating  profits  according to the	normal	methods	 and
other  such  difficulties.  The rest of	 the  categories  of
establishments	set  out  in sec. 32  appear  to  have	been
exempted on the ground of (a) absence of any profit  motive,
</p><p id="p_52">(b) their being of educational, charitable or public nature,
and (c) their being establishments in public sector  carried
on in public interest.	Building contractors appear to	have
been exempted because of their work being contract job work,
the unfeasibility of applying the formula evolved in the Act
and the problem of employees of such contractors being	more
of  evolving  and enforcing a proper wage  structure  rather
than of payment of bonus to them.
</p><p id="p_53">It seems to us that if we were to accept the contention that
the. object of sec. 32 was only to exempt the establishments
therein enumerated from the application of the bonus formula
enacted	 in  the  Act,	but  that  the	employees  of  those
establishments	were left at liberty to claim and get  bonus
under the machinery provided by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_120">Industrial Disputes	 Act</a>
and  other corresponding Acts, them very object of  enacting
sec.  32 would be frustrated.  Surely, Parliament could	 not
have intended to exempt these establishments from the burden
of  bonus payable under the Act and yet have left  the	door
open for their employees to raise industrial disputes and ,-
,get  bonus  under  the	 Full Bench  formula  which  it	 has
rejected by laying down a different statutory formula in the
Act.  For instance, is it to be contemplated that though the
Act by sec. 32 exempts institutions such as the Universities
or the Indian Red Cross Society or hospitals, or any of	 the
establishments	set  out in cl. (ix) of that  section,	they
would still be liable to pay bonus if the employees,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">384</span>
of  those  institutions were to raise a	 dispute  under	 the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_121">Industrial  Disputes Act</a> and claim bonus in accordance	with
the Full Bench formula ? The legislature would in that	case
be  giving exemption by one hand and taking it away  by	 the
other, thus frustrating the very object of sec. 32.   Where,
on the other hand, Parliament intended to retain a  previous
provision of law under which bonus was payable or was  being
paid  it  has expressly saved such provision.	Thus,  under
sec. 35 the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Schemes Act,
1946  and  any	scheme	made  thereunder  are  saved.	 If,
therefore,  Parliament wanted to retain the right  to  claim
bonus  by way of industrial adjudication for those  who	 are
either excluded or exempted from the Act it would have	made
an  express saving provision to that effect as it  has	done
for employees in Coal Mines.
</p><p id="p_54">Besides,  the  construction  suggested	on  behalf  of	 the
respondents, if accepted, would result in certain anomalies.
Take  two establishments in the same trade or industry,	 one
engaging 20 or more persons and the other less than 20.	 <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_122">The
Act</a> would be applicable to the former but not to the latter.
If the respondents were to be right in their contention	 the
employer in the former case would be liable to, pay bonus at
the  rates  laid  down by the Act, i.e. at the	rate  of  4%
minimum	 and  20% maximum, but in the latter  case  the	 Act
would  not apply and though his establishment is  a  smaller
one, on the basis of the Full Bench formula there would be a
possibility of his having to pay bonus at a higher rate than
20%,  depending	 upon  the quantum of profit  made  in	that
particular accounting year.
</p><p id="p_55"><a href="/doc/592257/" id="a_123">Section	 32(vii)</a> exempts from the applicability of  the	 Act
those employees who have entered before May 29, 1965 into an
agreement or settlement with their employers for payment  of
bonus  linked  with production or productivity	in  lieu  of
bonus  based  on profits and who may enter after  that	date
into  such agreement or settlement for the period for  which
such  agreement	 or settlement is in operation.	 Can  it  be
said  that  in	cases where there is such  an  agreement  or
settlement  in	operation,  though  this  clause   expressly
excludes  such employees from claiming bonus under  the	 Act
during	such period, the employees in such cases  can  still
resort to the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_124">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and claim bonus on the
basis of the Full Bench formula ? The answer is obviously in
the negative for the object in enacting cl. (vii) is to	 let
the  parties work out such an agreement or  settlement.	  It
cannot	be that despite this position,	Parliament  intended
that those employees had still the option of throwing  aside
such  an agreement or settlement raise a dispute  under	 the
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_125">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and claim bonus under the Full Bench
formula.   The	contention, therefore,	that  the  exemption
under  sec. 32 excludes those employees from claiming  bonus
under the Act only and not from claiming bonus under the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">385</span>
<a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_126">Industrial  Disputes Act</a> or such other Act is  not  correct.
This  conclusion is buttressed by the provisions of sec.  36
which  empower	the appropriate Government to exempt  for  a
specified period an establishment or class of establishments
from the operation of the Act, if it is of. the opinion that
it  is	not in public interest to apply all or	any  of	 the
provisions  of	the Act to such establishment  or  class  of
establishments.	 Since the appropriate Government can exempt
such  an establishment or establishments from the  operation
of the Act on the ground of public interest only, it  cannot
surely be that Parliament still intended that the  employees
of  such exempted establishment or establishments can  claim
bonus  through industrial adjudication under the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_127">Industrial
Disputes Act</a> or any such corresponding law.
We  are also not impressed by the contention that  the	fact
that sec. 39 provides that the provisions of this Act are in
a  addition  to	 and not in  derogation	 of  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_128">Industrial
Disputes  Act</a>  or  any other corresponding  law	 shows	that
Parliament did not wish to do away with the right to payment
of bonus altogether to those who cannot either by reason  of
exclusion  or exemption from the Act claim bonus  under	 the
Act.   Such  a	construction is fallacious  on	two  ground.
Firstly	 because  it  assumes wrongly  that  the  <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_129">Industrial
Disputes  Act</a> or any other law corresponding to it  provided
for  a statutory right to payment of bonus.  All that  those
Acts provided for, apart from rights in respect of lay	out,
retrenchment   etc.,  a	 machinery  for	 investigation	 and
settlement  of	disputes arising between workmen  and  their
employers.   It	 is, therefore, incorrect to  say  that	 the
right  to bonus under this Act is in addition to and not  in
derogation   of	 any  right  to	 bonus	under  those   Acts.
Secondly, sec. 39 became necessary because the Act does	 not
provide	 any  machinery or procedure for  investigation	 and
settlement of disputes which may arise between employers and
employees.  In the absence of any such provision  Parliament
intended  that the machinery and procedure under those	Acts
should	be made available for the adjudication	of  disputes
arising	 under	or  in the operation of the  Act.   If,	 for
instance,  there  is  a dispute as  to	the  computation  of
allocable  surplus or as to quantum of bonus, or as to	whe-
ther in view of sec. 20 an establishment in public sector is
liable	to  pay bonus, such a dispute is to  be	 adjudicated
under the machinery provided by the <a href="/doc/500379/" id="a_130">Industrial Disputes	 Act</a>
or other corresponding Acts.
</p><p id="p_56">Considering  the history of the legislation, the  background
and  the  circumstances in which the Act  was  enacted,	 the
object	of  the Act and its scheme, it is  not	possible  to
accept	 the  construction  suggested  on  behalf   of	 the
respondents  that the Act is not an exhaustive	Act  dealing
comprehensively with the subject-matter of bonus in all	 its
aspects	 or that Parliament still left it open to  those  to
whom  the  Act does not apply by reason	 of  its  provisions
either as to exclusion or exemption to raise a dispute	with
regard to bonus

to  the Act by the Tribunals was not correct and the  orders
