     witnesses, police used force (Dabka). There were no





     telltale signs on the spot of crime and dead body so

     so recovered from the accused, was not sealed by the





     police on 2.3.2010; in the memo of personal search (Ex.

<p id="p_41">     PW-1/C), there is no mention of seizure of memory card

     of the mobile, which was sealed only on 9.3.2010, hence

     mention of Memory Card, which was recovered only on




     7.3.2010, as is evident from Ex.PW-19/A. Hence, in the

                not be stretched morbidly to embrace every

        how strong, cannot and must not be permitted
        to take place of proof. This is for the reason that
        the mental distance between "may be" and
        "must be" is quite large, and divides vague





        conjectures from sure conclusions. In a criminal
        case, the court has a duty to ensure that mere
        conjectures or suspicion do not take the place of
        legal proof. The large distance between "may
        be" true and "must be" true, must be covered





        by way of clear, cogent and unimpeachable
        evidence produced by the prosecution, before
        an accused is condemned as a convict, and the
        basic and golden rule must be applied. In such
        cases, while keeping in mind the distance

        between "may be" true and "must be" true, the

        court must maintain the vital distance between
        mere conjectures and sure conclusions to be
        arrived at, on the touchstone of dispassionate
        judicial scrutiny, based upon a complete and
        comprehensive appreciation of all features of


        the case, as well as the quality and credibility of
        the evidence brought on record. The court must
        ensure, that miscarriage of justice is avoided,
        and if the facts and circumstances of a case so




        demand, then the benefit of doubt must be
        given to the accused, keeping in mind that a
        reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or





        a merely probable doubt, but a fair doubt that is

<p id="p_121">     Thus, from the testimony of prosecution witnesses, we

     find the prosecution to have established the fact that




     immediately prior to the occurrence of incident/death,

     only deceased was in the company of the accused. He





     misled and misinformed his father and also refused his





     help. Thus, conduct of the accused in the instant case is

     another circumstance, which stands proved by the

     prosecution against him.

        under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_72">Section 27</a> as it stands in order to render
        the evidence leading to discovery of any fact
        admissible, the information must come from
        any accused in custody of the police. The

        requirement of police custody is productive of

        extremely anomalous results and may lead to
        the exclusion of much valuable evidence in
        cases where a person, who is subsequently
        taken into custody and becomes an accused,
        after committing a crime meets a police officer


        or voluntarily goes to him or to the police
        station and states the circumstances of the
        crime which lead to the discovery of the dead
        body, weapon or any other material fact, in




        consequence of the information thus received
        from him. This information which is otherwise
        admissible becomes inadmissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_73">Section





        27</a> if the information did not come from a
        person in the custody of a police officer or did
        come from a person not in the custody of a





        police officer. The statement which is
        admissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_74">Section 27</a> is the one which is
        the information leading to discovery. Thus, what
        is admissible being the information, the same
        has to be proved and not the opinion formed on
        it by the police officer. In other words, the exact
        information given by the accused while in
        custody which led to recovery of the articles has




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                               ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 17:31:39 :::HCHP</span>
                       ...37...
</p>
<p id="p_139">        to be proved. It is, therefore, necessary for the
        benefit of both the accused and prosecution
        that information given should be recorded and
        proved and if not so recorded, the exact




                                                .
</p><p id="p_140">        information must be adduced through evidence.
</p>




<p id="p_141">        The basic idea embedded in <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_75">Section 27</a> of the
        Evidence Act is the doctrine of confirmation by
        subsequent events. The doctrine is founded on
        the principle that if any fact is discovered as a





        search made on the strength of any information
        obtained from a prisoner, such a discovery is a
        guarantee that the information supplied by the
        prisoner is true. The information might be
        confessional or non-inculpatory in nature but if





        it results in discovery of a fact, it becomes a
        reliable information. It is now well settled that
        recovery of an object is not discovery of fact
        envisaged in the section. Decision of Privy
        Council in <a href="/doc/254739/" id="a_76">Pulukuri Kotayya v. Emperor</a> (AIR

        1947 PC 67), is the most quoted authority for

        supporting the interpretation that the "fact
        discovered" envisaged in the section embraces
        the place from which the object was produced,
        the knowledge of the accused as to it, but the
        information given must relate distinctly to that


        effect. [See: <a href="/doc/168777417/" id="a_77">State of Maharashtra v. Danu
        Gopinath Shinde</a>, (2000) 6 SCC 269]. No doubt,
        the information permitted to be admitted in
        evidence is confined to that portion of the




        information which "distinctly relates to the fact
        thereby discovered". But the information to get
        admissibility need not be so truncated as to





        make it insensible or incomprehensible. The
        extent of information admitted should be
        consistent     with    understandability.    Mere





        statement that the accused led the police and
        the witnesses to the place where he had
        concealed the articles is not indicative of the
        information given."      (Emphasis supplied)

                 not necessary in this case to consider if this
                 section qualifies, to any extent, Sec. 24, also. It
                 will be seen that the first condition necessary
                 for bringing this section into operation is the
                 discovery of a fact, albeit a relevant fact, in
                 consequence of the information received from a
                 person accused of an offence. The second is

<p id="p_145">        to. The third is that at the time of the receipt of
        the information the accused must be in police
        custody. The last but the most important
        condition is that only "so much of the

</p><p id="p_146">        information" as relates distinctly to that fact





        thereby discovered is admissible. The rest of
        the information has to be excluded. The word
        "distinctly" means "directly", "indubitably"
        "strictly", "unmistakably". The word has been





        advisedly used to limit and define the scope of
        the     provable    information.     The    phrase
        "distinctly" relates "to the fact thereby
        discovered" is the linchpin of the provision. This
        phrase refers to that part of the information





        supplied by the accused which is the direct and
        immediate cause of the discovery. The reason
        behind this partial lifting of the ban against
        confessions and statements made to the police
        is that if a fact is actually discovered in

        consequence of information given by the

        accused, it affords some guarantee of truth of
        that part, and that part only, of the information
        which was the clear, immediate and proximate
        cause of the discovery. No such guarantee or
        assurance attaches to the rest of the statement


        which may be indirectly or remotely related to
        the fact discovered.

        "fact discovered" in the section is restricted to a
