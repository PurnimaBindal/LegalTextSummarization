PRADIP MOHANTY,J. Is the instant writ appeal, filed against the judgment of the
           learned Single Judge rendered in a writ petition in which direction for
           further investigation in a criminal case was sought for, maintainable?
           This is the short question required to be answered in the reference.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           2.          When the writ appeal came up for hearing before a Division
           Bench of this Court, the State Government raised serious objection
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                     -2-</span>




regarding its maintainability. Feeling that the question of maintainability
may have a far reaching effect, the Division Bench was inclined to
examine the matter in depth and accordingly vide order dated
20.08.2014 appointed Mr. Goutam Mishra as amicus curiae to assist the
Court. As the learned amicus curiae apprised the Court that there are
divergent views by different High Courts on the issue, vide order dated
11.09.2014 the Division Bench of this Court referred the matter to the
Full Bench.     Hence, this Full Bench has been constituted and called
upon to answer the following question:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "Whether any decision rendered by a Single Judge of
              this Court vis-Ã -vis a criminal matter in exercise of the
              writ jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
              of India is appealable under Clause-10 of the Letters
              Patent before a Division bench of this Court or not?"
</blockquote>

<p id="p_3">3.            While Mr. Sarkar, learned counsel for the            appellant
contended that an appeal under clause 10 of the Letters Patent is
maintainable against a judgment passed by the learned Single Judge in
a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Article 226</a>, according to Mr. Misra, learned Advocate
General appearing for the State an appeal under clause 10 of Letters
Patent Appeal is not maintainable against the judgment of learned Single
Judge even when passed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a>, if the power is exercised
under criminal jurisdiction.
</p>

<p id="p_4">4.            It is worthwhile to mention here that at the commencement
of the 20th Century, Bengal Presidency was a vast province including
Assam, Bihar and Orissa. Administrative exigencies required separation
of such areas which originally did not form part of Bengal. Bihar and
Orissa were separated from Bengal Presidency to form new province of
Bihar. By a notification dated 22.03.1912 new province of Bihar and
Orissa was formed. However, still the said new province of Bihar and
Orissa   was     under    the   jurisdiction   of   Calcutta   High   Court.

<p id="p_5">On 09.02.1916, in exercise of the powers under section 113 of the
Government of India Act, 1915, the King of England issued Letters
Patent constituting High Court of Patna. Orissa was placed under the
jurisdiction of Patna High Court..On 01.04.1936 Orissa was made a
separate province but no separate High Court was provided for it. ..In
exercise of the powers conferred by Section 229(1) of the Government of
India Act, 1935, the Government of India, on 30.04.1948, issued Orissa
High Court Order, 1948 declaring that from 05.07.1948 there shall be a
Court of the Province of Orissa which shall be a Court of Record.
Subsequently by Orissa High Court (Amendment) Order, 1948 issued on
08.06.1948, the date of establishment of High Court was changed from
05.07.1948 to 26.07.1948. Hence, on 26.07.1948 Orissa High Court was
inaugurated by H.J.Kania, the then Chief Justice of the Federal Court of
India.   Since the bifurcation of Orissa High Court, the Letters Patent
Appeals (present writ appeals) are being filed under Clause 10 of the
Letters Patent Constituting the High Court of Judicature at Patna read
with <a href="/doc/1015123/" id="a_4">Article 4</a> of the Orissa High Court (Amendment) Order, 1948, which
provided inter alia that the law in force regarding practice and procedure
in the High Court in Patna shall be applicable to the Orissa High Court.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.           Clause-10 of the Letters Patent Constituting the High Court
of Judicature at Patna, under which the writ appeal has been filed, reads
thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "Clause-10. And we do further ordain that an appeal shall
          lie to the said High Court of Judicature at Patna from the
          judgment (not being a judgment passed in the exercise of
          appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in
          the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a Court subject to
          the superintendence of the said High Court, and not being
          an order made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction and
          not being a sentence or order passed or made in the
          exercise of the power of superintendence under the
          provisions of Section 107 of the Government of India Act, or
          in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction) of one Judge of
          the said High Court or one Judge of any Division Court,
          pursuant to section 108 of Government of India Act and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                     -4-</span>




         that notwithstanding anything hereinbefore provided an
         appeal shall lie to the said High Court from a judgment of
         one Judge of said High Court or one Judge of any Division
         Court, pursuant to Section 108 of the Government of India
         Act, made [on or after the first day of February one
         thousand nine hundred and twenty nine] in the exercise of
         appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in
         the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a Court subject to
         the superintendence of the said High Court where the Judge
         who passed the judgment declares that the case is a fit one
         for appeal; but that the right of appeal from other
         judgments of Judges of the said High Court or of such
         Division Court shall be to Us, Our Heirs or Successors in
         Our or Their Privy Council, as hereinafter provided."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_7">From a bare reading of the clause, as quoted above, it would be evident
that a Letters Patent appeal can be laid to a Division Bench of this High
Court from a judgment of a learned Single Judge, if it is not covered by
the excluded category of cases as specified in the bracketed portion of the
clause. In other words, filing of intra-Court appeal to a Division Bench of
this Court is debarred against judgment of learned Single Judge if it is
passed in exercise of (i) revisional jurisdiction, (ii) the power of
superintendence and (iii) the criminal jurisdiction. Therefore, it is to be
seen whether the impugned judgment passed by the learned Single
Judge comes under any of these three excluded categories.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.          During the course of hearing, learned counsel for both the
parties in support of their respective submissions placed reliance upon a
large number of judgments of various High Courts in India. Mr. Goutam
Mishra, learned amicus curiae also placed before this Court the
judgments wherein conflicting views have been expressed by different
High Courts.   Before delving into those judgments, it is pertinent to
mention here that Clause-10 of the Letters Patent Constituting the High
Court of Judicature at Patna, which is applicable to Orissa High Court,
is pari materia to the corresponding clause followed in the respective
High Courts.

<p id="p_9">7.            The controversy that a writ proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of
the Constitution of India is a "civil proceeding" or "criminal proceeding"
was considered at great length by the Constitution Bench of the apex
Court in <a href="/doc/1102942/" id="a_6">S.A.L. Narayan Row v. Ishwarlal Bhagwandas</a>, AIR 1965 SC
1818.      In the said case, the apex Court opined that whether the
proceedings are civil or not depends upon the nature of the right violated
and the appropriate relief which may be claimed and not upon the
nature of the Tribunal which is invested with authority to grant relief.
While so opining, the apex Court in Para-8 of the judgment observed as
follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        ".........The expression "civil proceedings" is not defined in
        the Constitution, nor in the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_7">General Clauses Act</a>. The
        expression in our judgment covers all proceedings in which a
        party asserts the existence of a civil right conferred by the
        civil law or by statute, and claims relief for breach thereof. A
        criminal proceeding on the other hand is ordinarily one in
        which if carried to its conclusion it may result in the
        imposition of sentences such as death, imprisonment, fine or
        forfeiture of property. It also includes proceedings in which
        in the larger interest of the State, orders to prevent
        apprehended breach of the peace, orders to bind down
        persons who are danger to the maintenance of peace and
        order, or orders aimed at preventing vagrancy are
        contemplated to be passed...."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                        (Emphasis Supplied)

From the aforesaid it follows that a civil proceeding is one in which a
person seeks to redress by appropriate relief the alleged infringement of
his civil rights against another person or the State.             A criminal
proceeding is one in which the proceeding, if ultimately carried to its
conclusion, may result in imposition of sentences such as death,
imprisonment, fine or forfeiture of property. The term "criminal
proceeding" has also been defined in Black's Law Dictionary as "one
instituted and conducted for the purpose either of preventing the
commission of crime, or for fixing the guilt of a crime already committed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                                     -6-</span>




and punishing the offender; as distinguished from a "civil proceeding",
which is for the redress of a private injury."

<p id="p_10">8.           Referring to the above Constitution Bench judgment of the
apex Court in S.A.L. Narayan Row (supra), the High Court of
Judicature at Gujarat in <a href="/doc/1155023/" id="a_8">Sanjeev Rajendrabhai Bhatt v. State of
Gujarat</a>, 1999 Cr.L.J. 338 came to hold as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">       "80. In our considered opinion, in the instant case, the
       proceedings can be said to be criminal proceedings
       inasmuch as, carried to its conclusion, they may result
       into imprisonment, fine etc. as observed by the Supreme
       Court in Narayana Row.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">       81. From the totality of facts and circumstances, we have
       no hesitation in holding that the learned single Judge has
       passed an order in exercise of criminal jurisdiction. At the
       cost of repetition, we reiterate what we have already stated
       earlier that the proceedings were of a criminal nature.
       Whether a criminal Court takes cognizance of an offence
       or sends a complaint for investigation under Sub-section
       (3) of <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_9">Section 156</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
       does not make difference so far as the nature of
       proceedings is concerned. Even if cognizance is not taken,
       that fact would not take out the case from the purview of
       criminal jurisdiction.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       82. In our judgment, a proceeding under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_10">Article 226</a> of the
       Constitution arising from an order passed or made by a
       Court in exercise or purported exercise of power under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_11"> the
       Code</a> of Criminal Procedure is still a 'criminal proceeding'
       within the meaning of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. A
       proceeding seeking to avoid the consequences of a criminal
       proceeding initiated under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_12"> the Code</a> of Criminal Procedure
       will continue to remain 'criminal proceeding' covered by
       the bracketed portion of Clause 15 of the Letters Patent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       83. As Clause 15 of the Letters Patent expressly bars an
       appeal against the order passed by a single Judge of the
       High Court in exercise of criminal jurisdiction, LPAs are
       not maintainable and deserve to be dismissed only on that
       ground. We accordingly hold that the Letters Patent
       Appeals are not maintainable at law and they are liable to
       be dismissed."

<p id="p_11">9.         The issue raised herein also fell for consideration before a
Division Bench of Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/403219/" id="a_13">M/s Nagpur Cable Operators
Association v. Commissioner of Police Nagpur</a> reported in AIR 1996
BOM 180. The said Division Bench, after taking note of various cases
decided by other High Courts and the apex Court, observed thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      "21. ....Applying the tests laid down by the Apex Court in
      Narayan Row's case (supra), we are of the view that if the
      writ petition/application under Articles 226 and/or 227 of
      the Constitution arises out of or relates to a proceeding in
      which, if carried to its conclusion ultimately it may result in
      sentence of death or by way of imprisonment, fine or
      forfeiture    of    the     property     then      such     writ
      petition/application under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
      India and / or under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_15">Article 227</a> of the Constitution, should
      be treated as a "criminal writ petition" and styled as such.
      For hearing and decision of such petition, it should be listed
      before the Division Bench allocated such business by
      Hon'ble the Chief Justice or if it pertains to the single Judge
      jurisdiction, before the Bench assigned such work. As
      regards petitions/applications under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> of the
      Constitution seeking writs or orders in the nature of habeas
      corpus, Rule 1 of Chapter XXVIII of Appellate Side Rules,
      also provides only allocation of such writ petitions to the
      Division Bench taking criminal business of the Appellate
      Side of the High Court. Obviously, since the
      petitions/applications under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_17">Article 226</a> of the Constitution
      of India for issuance of writs of habeas corpus arise out of
      the unlawful detention, in its very nature, such petitions
      too should be styled as criminal writ petitions. Criminal writ
      petitions would also cover those writ petitions which arise
      out of the orders and the matters relating to prevention or
      breach of peace or maintenance of peace and order or such
      orders aimed at preventing vagrancy contemplated to be
      passed. 'Criminal writ petition' shall also take in its
      embrace the petitions/applications under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_18">Article 226</a> or 227
      of the Constitution of India if it arises out of or relates to
      investigation, enquiry or trial of the offences either under
      special or general statute.... However, such cases are to be
      distinguished from the cases where an act may be
      prohibited or commanded by the statute in such a manner
      that the person contravening the provision is liable to
      pecuniary penalty and such recovery is to be made a civil
      debt. In such type of cases the contravention would not be

       a crime and, therefore, petitions/applications* under
       Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India arising
       therefrom would not be criminal proceeding."

              maintainability held that an appeal under the Letters

              of the Constitution praying for issuance of Habeas

<p id="p_16">              On careful perusal of these judgments, this Court finds that
the view taken by the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in
Gangaram Kandaram (supra) is not acceptable inasmuch, as the same
is not in consonance with the ratio laid down in the case of S.A.L.
Narayan Row (supra).       Similarly, since in the case of Bholanath Rout
(supra) the question of maintainability was not raised and in the case of
Adishwar Jain (supra) dealt with habeas corpus petition, those
judgments are not relevant for the purpose of the present reference.

<p id="p_17">12.           From the above analysis of the decisions of the apex Court

question, whether an order passed by learned Single Judge in a writ
petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_27">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is a proceeding

<p id="p_19">relief asked for in a writ petition is against exercise of power under
criminal law or the proceeding would be a criminal proceeding, or the
proceeding if carried to its conclusion ultimately may result in sentence
of death or imprisonment or fine or forfeiture of property, such writ
petition should be treated as filed against a proceeding under criminal
jurisdiction. In such a case, the Letters Patent Appeal/Writ Appeal is not
maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_20">13.         In view of the above settled position of law, it is to be seen
whether the writ petition, from which this appeal arises, was filed
invoking the "criminal jurisdiction" of this Court and/or the impugned
order was passed "in exercise of criminal jurisdiction". As it appears
from the records produced before this Court, the appellant being the
informant filed a writ petition {W.P.(Crl.) No.1066 of 2013} challenging
the action of the I.I.C., Khaira Police Station, Balasore. His grievance
was that he lodged an FIR, which was registered as Khaira P.S. Case
No.61 of 2011 under <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_28">Sections 498-A</a>, <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_29">302</a>, <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_30">304-B</a> and <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_31">34</a>, <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_32">I.P.C</a>. read
with <a href="/doc/1023340/" id="a_33">Section 4</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act. But, the I.I.C. filed charge-
sheet deliberately omitting three other accused persons named in the
FIR. Therefore, alleging that the investigation conducted by the IIC was
not fair and proper, the appellant in the aforesaid writ application
prayed for further investigation. The learned Single Judge ultimately
found that there was no serious irregularity or mala fides in the
investigation and was pleased to dismiss the writ petition vide order
dated 06.03.2014. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant has filed
this appeal. If this appeal is allowed and relief sought for in the writ
petition is acceded to, it would amount to directing further investigation
to Khaira P.S. Case No.61 of 2011. In such event, it may lead to filing of
charge-sheet by the Investigating Officer, framing of charge and can
result in conviction and order of sentence. Therefore, in terms of the
ratio laid down in S.A.L. Narayan Row (supra), it can be safely held
that in the instant case the writ petition was filed invoking "criminal

<p id="p_22">    jurisdiction" of the learned Single Judge and the learned Single Judge
    has passed the impugned order "in exercise of criminal jurisdiction". As
    such, the instant writ appeal clearly comes under the third excluded
    category of Clause-10 of the Letters Patent which bars filing of a writ
    appeal.

<p id="p_23">    14.         For the foregoing discussions, the reference is answered in
    negative and the writ appeal is required to be dismissed as not
    maintainable.

    place on record its appreciation for the assistance rendered by learned
    amicus curiae Mr. Goutam Mishra in deciding the reference.
