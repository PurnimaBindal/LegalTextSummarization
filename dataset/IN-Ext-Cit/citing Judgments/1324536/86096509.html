    THIS   APPEAL   COMING   ON  FOR  FURTHER
ARGUMENTS THIS DAY, K.N.KESHAVANARAYAN J., THE
COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING:-

                         JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">   This appeal by the sole accused is directed against the

judgment and order dated 15.04.2005 passed by the Fast

Track Court III, Kolar in S.C.No.146/2004, convicting him

for the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_2">Section 302</a> IPC and

sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for life and also to

pay fine of Rs.1,000/- for the said offence.

</p><p id="p_2">   2. The case of the prosecution in brief is as under:

Deceased Narayanaswamy is the maternal uncle of the

appellant / accused.     They were resident of Keelukuppa

Village in Bangarpet Taluk, and were coolies by profession.

On   28.04.2003     at   about       9.00   p.m.   the   deceased

Narayanaswamy was sleeping inside the house, at that time

the accused came near house of the deceased, and started
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                3</span>


kicking the door; that on the deceased opening the door, the

accused picked up quarrel with him with regard to the

payment of coolie / wages; that during the quarrel the

accused picked up wooden reaper from the heap of firewood

stored by the side of the house, assaulted the deceased on

the head repeatedly as a result of which the deceased

sustained bleeding injuries and met instantaneous death.

P.W.14 Chinna Guruva, the neighbour of deceased and an

eye witness to the incident of assault on deceased,

immediately telephoned to the jurisdictional police, and

waited at the scene of occurrence for the arrival of the

jurisdictional police.   However, the police did not arrive at

the spot, therefore, P.W.14 himself rushed to the police

station and lodged a report as per Ex.P-6 at about 10.45

p.m., on the same day based on which, the police registered

the case and took up investigation. During the investigation

the Investigating Officer visited the scene of occurrence,

conducted inquest over the dead body, and later sent the

dead body to the hospital for post mortem examination.

Thereafter, Investigating Officer arrested the accused and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               4</span>


recovered the weapon used for the commission of the offence

at the instance of accused, and recorded statements of

witnesses.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">  3. On completion of investigation, police laid the charge

sheet. When accused was produced before the magistrate,

he was remanded to the judicial custody and thereafter, he

was released on bail on 21.10.2003. On committal of case,

the appellant / accused appeared before the Learned

Sessions Judge, pleaded not guilty for the charge leveled

against him and claimed to be tried.      The prosecution in

order to bring home the guilty of the accused, examined PWs

1 to 19 and relied on documentary evidence marked as

Exs.P-1 to P-15 and material objects MOs 1 to 9.      During

examination under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_3">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. by the learned

Sessions Judge, the accused denied all the incriminating

circumstances appearing against him in the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses. However, he did not chose to lead

any defence evidence. The defence of the accused was one of

total denial and that of false implication. It was his further
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               5</span>


defence that the deceased under intoxication of liquor fell

into the drainage and sustained injuries, as a result of which

died on the spot and that he was not responsible for the

death of deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_5">

</p><p id="p_6">  4. The learned Sessions Judge after hearing both the

sides and on appreciation of materials on record, by the

judgment under appeal held that the prosecution has proved

that the death of the deceased was homicidal and by placing

reliance on the evidence of P.W.14, held that the prosecution

has proved beyond reasonable doubt the complicity of the

accused for the homicidal death of deceased. Having regard

to the fact that the deceased had sustained four head

injuries resulting in crushing of skull bones, the learned

Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the act

committed by the accused amounted to murder punishable

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">section 302</a> of IPC. Learned Sessions Judge rejected

the argument of the defence that the act committed by the

accused would be culpable homicide not amounting to

murder punishable under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_5">Section 304</a> of IPC. Consequently,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                6</span>


learned Sessions Judge convicted the appellant/accused for

the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a> of IPC and

sentenced him to undergo imprisonment for life and also to

pay fine. Aggrieved by the said judgment of conviction and

order of sentence, the appellant is before this Court.



</p><p id="p_7">   5. We have heard Sri G.M.Sreenivasa Reddy, for Sri

Y.R.Sadasiva Reddy, learned counsel appearing for the

appellant / accused and Sri K.R.Keshavamurthy, learned

Addl. SPP appearing for respondent - State.       Perused the

records secured from the Trial Court as well as the judgment

under appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">   6. Sri Sreenivasa Reddy, learned counsel appearing for

the appellant / accused contended that the judgment under

appeal suffers from perversity and illegality for the reasons

that the learned Sessions Judge has failed to consider that

the evidence of P.W.14 is not cogent and consistent as such

not worthy of acceptance. He further contended that from

the evidence of P.W.14 it is clear that he cannot be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                               7</span>


considered as an eye witness and       in the absence of any

other evidence to connect the accused to the death of

deceased, the learned Sessions Judge has committed grave

error in holding the appellant guilty of the charge leveled as

such the judgment under appeal is perverse and is liable to

be set aside and the accused is entitled to be acquitted. In

the alternative the learned counsel for the appellant

contended that the alleged act by the accused would not

amount to murder punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_7">Section 302</a> of IPC, but

it would be culpable homicide not amounting to murder

punishable under Part II of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_8">Section 304</a> IPC. According to

the learned counsel the circumstances brought on record

would indicate that there was no preparation on the part of

the accused to commit murder nor the appellant had any

intention to kill the deceased, therefore, the learned Sessions

Judge is not justified in convicting the appellant for the

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">Section 302</a> IPC and on other

hand, the learned counsel for appellant submits that the

alleged act, at best may fall under Part II of <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_10">Section 304</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                 8</span>


<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_11">IPC</a>. Therefore, he sought for modification of the judgment

of conviction, and order of sentence.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">   8. In support of his arguments the learned counsel for

the appellant placed reliance on the following decisions:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">      1.    Order dated 03.11.2008 passed by this Court in
            Crl.A.No.555/2002:      <a href="/doc/1808929/" id="a_12">State   of   Karnataka   vs.

</p><p id="p_14">      9.    Per contra, Sri K.R.Keshavamurthy, learned

Addl. SPP contended that the learned Sessions Judge on

proper assessment of the oral and documentary evidence

and by assigning cogent reasons, has found that the

evidence of P.W.14 is consistent and cogent and that there is

no circumstance to discard the testimony of P.W.14.          He

further contended that the presence of P.W.14 at the scene

of occurrence being quite natural, since he is resident of the

house opposite to the house of deceased, therefore, he is a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                9</span>


natural witness. He further contended that the evidence of

P.W.14 clearly establishes that there was sufficient light at

the place of occurrence for him to witness the incident and

the overtact on the part of accused, as such the learned

Sessions Judge is justified in accepting the evidence of

P.W.14. He further contended that the evidence on record

indicates that the deceased was assaulted repeatedly on the

head with wooden reaper which resulted in instantaneous

death of deceased and this clearly indicates that the act of

assault was done with an intention to cause such bodily

injuries, which are likely to cause death, therefore, learned

Sessions Judge is justified in holding that the act committed

by the accused amounts to murder punishable under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">Section 302</a> IPC. Therefore, he sought for dismissal of the

appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
</p><p id="p_16">       10.   In the facts and circumstances of the case and in

the light of the submissions made by the learned counsel for

the parties, the points that would arise for our consideration

are:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   10</span><p id="p_17">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     i.    Whether the learned Sessions Judge is justified

           in holding the death of deceased as homicidal

           and   that       the    appellant   /   accused   was

           responsible for the homicidal death of the

           deceased?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     ii.   Whether the learned Sessions Judge is justified

           punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_16">Section 302</a> IPC?</blockquote><p id="p_18">


</p><p id="p_19">     11.   As per the evidence on record placed by the

prosecution, the incident of assault on the deceased

occurred at about 9.00 p.m. on 28.04.2003, while the report

of the incident was lodged by P.W.14 at about 10.45 p.m on

the same day. P.W.14 in his oral evidence has stated that

immediately on seeing the incident he informed the police

over phone and waited for the arrival of the police.

According to him when the police did not arrive at the scene

of occurrence, he himself went to the police station and

reported the matter to the police. This part of the evidence
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                              11</span>


of P.W.14 has not been seriously challenged.     It is in the

evidence of P.W.18 M.R.Muduvi, Police Sub Inspector,

Bangarpet Police Station, that while he was discharging duty

as SHO of the police station, at 10.45 p.m. on 28.04.2003,

P.W.14 appeared before him and lodged oral report, which

was reduced into writing as per Ex.P.6 and after reading out

the contents of same, P.W.14 subscribed his signature to the

same in his presence based on which he registered the case

and rushed to the scene of occurrence.      This part of the

evidence of P.W.18 is also not seriously challenged by the

defence. This shows that there was no delay in lodging the

report.
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21">      12.   The evidence of P.W.18 further indicates that on

registration of the case, he went to the scene of occurrence,

saw the dead body lying there and since it was dark he could

not proceed with the investigation and thereafter, by

deputing the staff for dead body watch, he went back to the

head quarters and on the next day morning at 8.00 a.m. he

conducted inquest over the dead body in the presence of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              12</span>


witnesses and thereafter, sent the dead body to post mortem

examination. P.W.13 - Dr.Mahadevaiah, in his evidence has

stated that he conducted the post mortem examination on

the dead body of Narayanaswamy between 11.20 a.m. to

1.00 p.m. and noticed following injuries on the dead body.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">     "1)   lacerated wound over left infrascapular
           region 1" x ½" x 2 cms; 5½ inch from
           midline.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">     2)    lacerated wound 3" x ½" x ½" over occipital

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">     4)    incised like lacerated wound on left frontal
           region 2" x ½" x ½", 21/2" from left
           eyebrow, ½" from midline; and,
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">     5)    lacerated wound on parietal region 2" x ½"
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">           x ½" from midline on right side, 9" from
           root of nose."</blockquote><p id="p_22">


</p><p id="p_23">     13.   He has further opined that the death was due to

shock as a result of laceration of brain and intra-cranial

haemorrhage due to head injury. This part of the evidence

of P.W.13 and the contents of post mortem report have not

been challenged by the defence. Thus, evidence placed on

record by the prosecution establishes that the death was due
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                              13</span>


to intra-cranial haemorrhage. Though the defence has

contended that death was due to fall and intoxication, there

is no circumstance to indicate that the deceased was

intoxicated nor there was any proof to indicate that the

deceased fell into drain. Number of injuries sustained by the

deceased over the head and his instantaneous death would

clearly demolish the defence put forth by the accused.

Therefore, the learned Session Judge is justified in holding

that the death of deceased was homicidal.
</p>
<p id="p_24">
</p><p id="p_25">     14.   According to the case of prosecution P.W.1 -

Muniyappa, the brother of the accused, P.W.2, the father of

the accused, PW5-Narayanappa, PW15-Munivenkatappa,

cousin brother of the deceased and PW14 Chennaguruva are

the eye-witnesses.   However, during the trial of the case

except PW14 other witnesses did not support the case of the

prosecution as to the complicity of the accused. Therefore,

the evidence of other witnesses are of no assistance to the

prosecution.   PW14-Chennaguruva in his oral evidence has

supported the case of the prosecution.       Reading of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                             14</span>


evidence of PW14 indicates that he was residing in the house

opposite to the house of the accused and by the side of the

house of the accused.    According to PW14, the incident

occurred at about 9.00 p.m. on 28.04.2003.     According to

him, at that time he was in the house and after hearing the

sounds of quarrel from the side of the house of deceased

Naryanaswamy he came out and there he saw both the

accused and the deceased quarreling with each other

verbally. He has further stated that there was street light

glowing at that place and also the electrical light in the

house of the deceased. According to him he saw at that time

the accused picking up a wooden reaper from the heap of

fire wood stored therein and assaulting the deceased on the

head repeatedly. According to PW14, the accused assaulted

thrice on the head of the deceased, as a result of which the

deceased collapsed and had sustained severe bleeding injury

on the head, and after assaulting the deceased, the accused

along with the reaper went towards the high school building.

He has further stated that immediately, he went near the

place where Narayanaswamy was lying and found him dead.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                               15</span>


The fact that PW14 is the resident of the house opposite to

the house of the deceased is not disputed. The fact that the

incident occurred at about 9.00 p.m. on 28.04.2003 is also

not seriously challenged by the accused.        Therefore, the

presence of PW14 in his house at that time is quite natural,

as such, he cannot be termed as a chance witness.           The

evidence of PW14 that on hearing the sound of galata he

came out of the house is quite natural and it is consistent

with the normal human conduct. The evidence of PW14 that

there was sufficient light for him to identify the assailant and

the overt-acts has not been challenged in the cross-

examination. The evidence of PW14 is consistent with the

contents of his earlier statement made in Ex.P6, since, no

contradiction or inconsistency or omission is brought out in

the cross-examination. No circumstance is brought out in

the cross-examination to discredit the testimony of PW14.

Under these circumstances, we are of the considered opinion

that the learned Sessions Judge is justified in placing

reliance on the testimony of PW14. It is now well settled by

catena of decisions of the Apex Court that conviction can be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                16</span>


based on the testimony of a sole eye witness provided if such

testimony is credit worthy and does not suffer from any

inconsistency.   The evidence of PW14 in our opinion is

consistent, cogent and has been rightly accepted by the

learned Sessions Judge to base conviction.       Therefore, the

finding recorded by the learned Sessions Judge that the

accused    was   responsible   for   the   homicidal   death   of

deceased, is sound and reasonable as such it does not

warrant interference.
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">     15. The next question required to be considered is as

to whether the act committed by the accused would amount

to murder or would it be an act attracting culpable homicide

not amounting to murder as contended by the learned

counsel.   Of course, as rightly contended by the learned

counsel for the appellant, the circumstances on record does

not indicate that the accused had any premeditation in

causing the death of the deceased. There also appears to be

no intention on the part of the accused to commit murder.

Nevertheless, the intention of causing death would not be
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                              17</span>


the only criteria to attract the offence punishable under

<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_17">Section 302</a> of IPC. <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_18">Section 300</a> defines murder, which sets

out four circumstances under which culpable homicide

would constitute murder punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_19">Section 302</a> IPC.


</p><p id="p_28">     According to the first circumstance the culpable

homicide would be murder if the act by which the death is

caused with intention of causing death,


     The second circumstance is if it is done with the

intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender

knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom

the harm is caused.
</p>
<p id="p_29">
</p><p id="p_30">     The third circumstance is if it is done with the

intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the

bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the

ordinary course of nature to cause death.
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><p id="p_32">     16. In our considered opinion the act committed by the

accused, as established from the evidence of PW14, would

fall within the 2nd or 3rd circumstance of <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_20">Section 300</a> of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                               18</span>


<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_21">IPC</a>.   According to the evidence of PW14 there was only a

verbal quarrel between the deceased and the accused with

regard to the payment of wages. It is not brought out in the

evidence of PW14 that there was any kind of scuffle between

the two and during the course of scuffle the blow was

inflicted. It is not the case of the defence that the accused

intended to inflict blow on a non-vital part and during the

scuffle the blow fell on the vital part. On the other hand, the

circumstance indicates that the accused after picking up a

wooden reaper from the heap of fire wood, assaulted the

deceased on the vital part viz., the head repeatedly resulting

in four injuries. Crushing of the skull bone and pieces of the

skull bone having lacerated the brain indicates the force

with which the accused has dealt the blows, which resulted

in instantaneous death.    This repeated assault on the head

with a weapon like wooden reaper would indicate that the

accused had an intention to cause such bodily injury, which

is likely to cause death of a person and such injury is

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of

the deceased. It is reasonable to infer that the accused had
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                              19</span>


knowledge that if he assaults the deceased with a wooden

reaper on the head repeatedly, it would result in the death.

Under these circumstances, we are of the considered opinion

that the act committed by the accused was culpable

homicide amounting to murder punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_22">Section

302</a> of IPC.   We find absolutely no      circumstance which

indicate that the act committed by the accused was

culpable homicide not amounting to murder falling under

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_23">Section 304</a> of IPC. In this view of the matter, we are of the

considered opinion that the learned Sessions Judge is

justified in convicting the accused for the offence punishable

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_24">Section 302</a> of IPC. Though learned the counsel for

the appellant placed reliance on several decisions, as noticed

supra, in our considered opinion none of the decisions would

apply to the facts of this case. It is well settled that each

criminal case will have to be decided on the basis of the

evidence placed on record of that case. The precedent law in

criminal cases would play minimal role. The case laws relied

on by the learned counsel have been decided having regard

to the peculiar facts and circumstances of that case.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                              20</span>


Therefore, we need not refer to those decisions in detail

except saying that those decisions have no application to the

facts of this case and are distinguishable on facts.   In this

view of the matter, we find no ground to interfere with the

well reasoned judgment of the trial Court.     The judgment

under appeal does not suffer from any perversity or illegality

warranting interference by this Court.    In this view of the

matter, appeal lacks merit and accordingly, the same is

dismissed.     The judgment of conviction and order of

sentence passed by the Trial Court is hereby confirmed.
