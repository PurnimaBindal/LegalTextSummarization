</p><p id="p_4">  1. To become a mother is the most natural phenomenon in the

     life of a woman. Whatever is needed to facilitate the birth of

     child to a woman who is in service, the employer has to be

     considerate and sympathetic towards her and must realise

     the physical difficulties which a working woman would face in

     performing her duties at the workplace while carrying a baby

     in the womb or while rearing up the child after birth.

     J, speaking for the Supreme Court in the matter of <a href="/doc/808569/" id="a_1">Municipal

     Corporation of Delhi v. Female Workers (Muster Roll</a>) and

     another1 aptly and squarely applies to the facts of the

     present case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">  3. The superb question of law that emanates for consideration

     is whether a female Government servant/mother is entitled to

     avail maternity leave under Rule 38 of the Chhattisgarh Civil

     Services (Leave) Rules, 2010 (for short 'the Rules of 2010'),

     though she begets child through the surrogacy procedure .

</p><p id="p_8">  4. The above-stated question of law arises in this petition on the

     following factual backdrop: -
</p>
<p id="p_9">  5. The petitioner is Lecturer working in Government Girls Higher

     Secondary School, Utai. She performed marriage with Shri

     Chhatradhari Agrawal as per the Hindu rites.              After

     completion of marriage of 26 years, she could not conceive

     and deliver a baby. Thereafter, the petitioner on consultation

     with her husband, decided to have a child through surrogacy

     procedure.      In furtherance of said desire, in the month of

     June, 2015, an embryo was successfully transplanted in the

     womb of a surrogate mother. On 15-3-2016, the surrogate

     mother went into labour and the petitioner and her husband

     reached to the Indore Hospital.        The surrogate mother

     delivered twin babies and the said twin babies were
1 (2000) 3 SCC 224
                                                 W.P.(S)No.4927/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                          Page 3 of 24</span>

  immediately placed in the hands of the petitioner and her

  husband on the same day. It is pertinent to mention here that

  the petitioner has incurred expenses of more than Rs.8 lakhs

  in the surrogacy procedure.       In order to take care of the

  newly born twin babies, the petitioner applied for maternity /

  child care leave to the Principal of Government Girls Higher

  Secondary School, Utai for maternity leave, as according to

  the petitioner, she is entitled for maternity leave in view of the

  provisions contained in Rule 38 of the Rules of 2010 which

  provides that maternity leave may be granted to a female

  Government servant with less than two surviving children up

  to a period of 135 days from the date of its commencement.

  It further provides that during such period, she will be entitled

  to leave salary equal to pay drawn immediately before

  proceeding on leave. The said application was considered

  by the Principal of the petitioner's college and by letter dated

  29-7-2016, it has been held that there is no provision in the

  Rules of 2010 to grant maternity leave to female Government

  servant who begets child by surrogacy procedure and also

  sought further instructions from the District Education Officer,

  Durg. The petitioner finding that the time is running fast and

  it is necessary to look after the twin babies, she decided to

  file this writ petition claiming that she is entitled for maternity

  leave as provided in Rule 38 of the Rules of 2010.

</p><p id="p_10">6. Mr. Ajay Shrivastava, learned counsel for the petitioner,
                                                 W.P.(S)No.4927/2016

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                         Page 4 of 24</span>

  would submit that Rule 38 of the Rules of 2010 makes no

  difference between natural mother, biological mother and a

  woman    who    has    become       mother   through   surrogacy

  procedure and as such, distinction cannot be made, the

  object being welfare and upliftment of newly born child and to

  develop a bond between the child and the mother which may

  be either a natural mother, a biological mother or a mother

  who   has   begotten    a   child     by   surrogacy   procedure.

  Therefore, the State is absolutely unjustified in dealing the

  grant of maternity leave to the petitioner, as on 15-3-2016,

  she has begotten child by surrogacy procedure and only after

  four months, on 19-7-2016 it has been held by the Principal

  of the petitioner's school that there is no such provision in

  Rule 38 of the Rules of 2010.
</p>
<p id="p_11">7. On the other hand, Mr. Gary Mukhopadhyay, learned Deputy

  Govt. Advocate, and Mrs. Astha Shukla, learned Panel

  Lawyer, appearing on behalf of the State/respondents would

  submit that Rule 38 of the Rules of 2010 does not expressly

  include the female Government servant who has begotten

  child by surrogacy procedure. The legislature ought to have

  expressly included such a female Government servant who

  has become mother by surrogacy procedure. Since such a

  class of mother has not been included expressly within Rule

  38 of the Rules of 2010, the State Government is absolutely

  justified in holding that the petitioner is not entitled for the
                                                   W.P.(S)No.4927/2016

     privilege of maternity leave and therefore the writ petition

     deserves to be dismissed.

<p id="p_12">  8. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and also

     considered their rival submissions made therein and gone

     through the available documents with utmost circumspection.

</p><p id="p_13">  9. At this stage, it would be appropriate to notice certain

     constitutional provisions in this regard.        Part-III of the

     Constitution provides for fundamental rights.         <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_2">Article 14</a>

     before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the

     discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion,

     race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. Clause (3) of

     that the labour to whichever sector it may belong in a

     particular region and in a particular industry, will be treated

     on equal basis.

             Which is now treated as authoritative12. Lord
             Wilberforce said:      "In interpreting an Act of
             Parliament it is proper, and indeed necessary, to
             have regard to the state of affairs existing, and
             known by Parliament to be existing, at the time. It
             is a fair presumption that Parliament's policy or
             intention is directed to that state of affairs.
             Leaving aside cases of omission by inadvertence,
             this being not such a case when a new state of
             affairs, or a fresh set of facts bearing on policy,
             comes into existence, the courts have to consider
             whether they fall within the parliamentary
             intention. They may be held to do so, if they fall
             within the same genus of facts as those to which
             the expressed policy has been formulated. They
             may also be held to do so if there can be
             detected a clear purpose in the legislation which
             can only be fulfilled if the extension is made.
             How liberally these principles may be applied
             must depend on the nature of the enactment, and
             the strictness or otherwise of the words in which it
             has been expressed. The courts should be less
             willing to extend expressed meaning if it is clear
             that the Act in question was designed to be
             restrictive or circumscribed in its operation rather
             than liberal or permissive. They will be much less
             willing to do so where the new subject matter is
             different in kind or dimension from that for which
             the legislation was passed. In any even there is
             one course which the courts cannot take under
             the law of this country: they cannot fill gaps; they
             cannot by asking the question, 'What would
             Parliament have done in this current case, not
             being one in contemplation, if the facts had been
             before it?' attempt themselves to supply the
             answer, if the answer is not to be found in the
             terms of the Act itself13".

             in social conditions produces a novel situation,
             which was not in contemplation at the time when
             a statute is first enacted, there can be no a priori
             assumption that the enactment does not apply to

             as is often said, words are not static vehicles of
             ideas or concepts. As the content of the ideas or
             concepts conveyed by respective words expand,
             so does the content of the words keep pace with
             the said expanding content of the ideas or

             public interest which the section wants to

             comparatively modern. The principle is thus
             explained by Subbarao, J.: "It is perhaps difficult
             to attribute to legislative body functioning in a
             static society that its intention was couched in
             terms of considerable breadth so as to take within
             its     sweep      the     future      developments
             comprehended by the phraseology used. It is
             more reasonable to confine its intention only to
             the circumstances obtaining at the time the law
             was made. But in modern progressive society it
             would be unreasonable to confine the intention of
             a Legislature to the meaning attributable to the
             word used at the time the law was made, for a
             modern Legislature making laws to govern
             society which is fast moving must be presumed to
             be aware of an enlarged meaning the same
             concept might attract with the march of time and
             with the revolutionary changes brought about in
             social, economic, political and scientific and other
             fields of human activity.        Indeed, unless a
             contrary intention appears, an interpretation
             should be given to the words used to take in new

     after the child's birth.   If maternity means motherhood, it

     would not be proper to distinguish between a natural and

     biological mother and a mother who has begotten a child

     through surrogacy. The object of maternity leave is to protect

     the dignity of motherhood by providing for full and healthy

     maintenance of the woman and her child. Maternity leave is

     intended to achieve the object of ensuring social justice to

     women.     Motherhood and childhood both require special

     attention. Not only are the health issues of the mother and

     the child considered while providing for maternity leave but

     the leave is provided for creating a bond of affection between

     the two.

         result in insulting womanhood and the intention of
         a woman to bring up a child begotten through
         surrogacy, as her own. A commissioning mother
         like the petitioner would have the same rights and
         obligations towards the child as the natural
         mother. Motherhood never ends on the birth of
         the child and a commissioning mother like the
         petitioner cannot be refused paid maternity leave.
         A woman cannot be discriminated, as far as
         maternity benefits are concerned, only on the
         ground that she has obtained the baby through
         surrogacy. Though the petitioner did not give
         birth to the child, the child was placed in the
         secured hands of the petitioner as soon as it was
         born. A newly born child cannot be left at the
         mercy of others.       A maternity leave to the
         commissioning mother like the petitioner would
         be necessary. A newly born child needs rearing
         and that is the most crucial period during which
         the child requires the care and attention of his
         mother.      There is a tremendous amount of
         learning that takes place in the first year of the
         baby's life, the baby learns a lot too. Also, the
         bond of affection has to be developed. A mother,
         as already stated hereinabove, would include a
         commissioning mother or a mother securing a
         child through surrogacy. Any other interpretation
         would result in frustrating the object of providing
         maternity leave to a mother, who has begotten

   <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_38">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India includes the right to

   motherhood and also the right to every child to full

   unjustified in refusing maternity leave to the petitioner who

   Accordingly, the impugned order rejecting the application of

   the petitioner for grant of maternity leave is set aside and it is
