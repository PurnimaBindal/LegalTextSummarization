FOLLOWING:

                        ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">     Petitioners are knocking at the doors of Writ Court

for assailing the order dated 09.08.2019 made by the

Competition    Commission       of    India    (hereafter

&#x27;Commission&#x27;) whereby in exercise of powers under

<a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_2">Section 26(1)</a> of the Competition Act, 2002 (hereafter

&#x27;2002 Act&#x27;) an investigation as to whether their warranty

policy has (i) potentially resulted in denial of market

access to parallel importers &amp; resellers of Boxed Micro-

Processors for Desktop and Laptop PCs &amp; (ii) the risk of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                 3</span>



higher pricing for the said articles in India. The relevant

portion of said order at paragraph 43 reads as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              &quot;43. Based on the above analysis of the
        facts and materials presented by the
        Informant and Intel, the Commission is of the
        prima facie opinion that the new differentiated
        India specific warranty policy of Intel in
        regard to its Boxed Micro-Processor is in
        contravention of <a href="/doc/132031/" id="a_3">Section 4(2)(a)(i)</a> of the Act.
        The same also prima facie results in limiting
        or restricting the market for Boxed Micro-
        Processors for Desktop and Laptop PCs in the
        territory of India in contravention of <a href="/doc/987819/" id="a_4">Section
        4(2)(b)(i)</a> of the Act as well as results in
        denial of market access to parallel importers
        in contravention of <a href="/doc/958762/" id="a_5">Section 4(2)(c)(i)</a> of the
        Act. Consequently, under the provision of
        <a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_6">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act, the Commission
        directs the Director General (&#x27;DG&#x27;) to cause an
        investigation into the matter and submit an
        investigation report within a period of 150
        days of this order.&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_2">

interim order dated 14.11.2019 had stayed the impugned

order and that the same has been continued from time to

time.        After service of notice, the Commission has

entered appearance through its Panel Counsel has filed

its   Statement     of   Objections.   Similarly,   the   private

respondent having been represented by their Advocate
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                               4</span>



too has filed its. Learned Senior Advocates appearing for

the petitioners and the learned ASG appearing for the

Commission have made elaborate submissions; learned

advocate representing the private respondent too has

forth his contentions in justification of the impugned

order and the reasons on which it has been founded.


</p><p id="p_4">     3.    BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE:
</p>
<p id="p_5">     (A)    CASE OF THE PETITIONERS:
</p>
<p id="p_6">     (i) The 1st petitioner is a private limited company

incorporated in 1997 under the provisions of erstwhile

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_7">Companies Act</a>, 1956. It is stated to be an &#x27;indirectly

held, wholly owned subsidiary of 2nd petitioner&#x27; which is

based in the United States of America. They are inter alia

engaged in the business of manufacturing integrated

circuits for computing &amp; communications. Their products

include    microprocessors,       chipsets,   motherboards,

wireless components and a range of software products.

1st Petitioner states that it does not manufacture or sell

any microprocessors or other products in India but only
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                5</span>



provides certain &#x27;marketing support services&#x27; for such

products as well as for the research &amp; development

(R&amp;D) activities.
</p>
<p id="p_7">
</p><p id="p_8">     (ii)   The     1st   Petitioner-Intel   on    25.04.2016

restructured      its     &#x27;warranty    policy&#x27;    for   boxed

microprocessors in India to the effect that &quot;...only Intel

products sold by Intel Authorized Distributors in India

and purchased in India are eligible for warranty sale

within India...For Intel products purchased from other

sources, please contact your purchases for warranty

services...&quot;. This, it claims to have done in the light of

Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court decision in <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_8">KAPIL WADHWA vs.

SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO. LTD1</a> and Commission&#x27;s

decision in <a href="/doc/140907210/" id="a_9">ASHISH AHUJA vs. SNAPDEAL2</a>. It is the case

of the petitioners that consistent with their new policy, no

warranty is given for Intel Products that are not sold by

Intel Authorized Distributors in India.

     (B)   CASE OF THE RESPONDENTS:
</p>
<p id="p_9">     (i)   The        case        of   2nd      Respondent:        The     2nd

Respondent is a company (Matrix Info Systems Pvt. Ltd.)

incorporated     in    2015        under        the   provisions    of     the

<a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_11">Companies Act</a>, 2013. It is also engaged in the import &amp;

sale of information technology products namely storage

solutions (RAM &amp; hard disks), security hardware (CCTV

cameras), computers (desktops &amp; laptops) &amp; display

solutions (TFT, computer monitors). Between March 2017

and January 2018, it imported about 4000 &#x27;boxed&#x27;

microprocessors        of    Intel     claiming       warranty      in     five

instances for as many as 34 units of microprocessors. In

three of the five instances, claims for warranty were

stated to have been &#x27;raised in Dubai, UAE and the same

were honored&#x27;. However, in so far as the claim for

warranty   in    India       is    concerned,         the   1st   petitioner

informed   the        respondent           to   contact     the    point    of

purchase, in view of its revised &#x27;warranty policy&#x27; of April

2016.

</p><p id="p_11">        (ii)    The 2nd Respondent lodged the information

with the Commission on 11.02.2019 u/s 19(1)(a) of the

2002 Act alleging that petitioner&#x27;s &#x27;warranty policy&#x27; is in

contravention of <a href="/doc/1330413/" id="a_12">Section 3</a> &amp; <a href="/doc/1587602/" id="a_13">4</a> of the 2002 Act in as

much as they were refusing to provide the warranty in

India for boxed microprocessors which are imported from

authorized sources abroad but not those sourced from

the Intel authorized dealers in India. This came to be

registered      by     the    Commission    as   Case      No.5/2019

between <a href="/doc/152783562/" id="a_14">MATRIX INFO SYSTEMS PVT. LTD vs. INTEL

CORPORATION</a>. On preliminary inquiry done u/s 26(1) of

2002 Act, the Commission having been satisfied as to

prima facie case, instructed the Director General to cause

an investigation into the matter and submit report

thereof within a period of 150 days. The same is put in

challenge in this petition.

<p id="p_12">
</p><p id="p_13">        (iii)     It is relevant to mention that the interim

order     of    stay    was    put   in   challenge   in    S.L.P.(C)

No.12643/2020 which came to be disposed off by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                  8</span>



Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court vide order dated 26.10.2020

observing that the Writ Petition itself to be expeditiously

disposed off within a period of six weeks from the date

an   application   is   filed.   However,   another   learned

Coordinate Judge of this Court vide order dated 2.7.2021

found it prudent to await the decision of a Division Bench

in W.A.Nos.562-563/2021 between FLIPKART INTERNET

PVT LTD AND ANOTHER Vs. COMPETITION COMMISSION

OF INDIA, because its outcome had a great relevance to

the final adjudication of this Writ Petition.The relevant

part of observations read as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     &quot;...In that view of the matter this Court is of a
     considered opinion that it would be prudent
     for the Court and the parties to await the
     decision of the Division Bench. Hence, list this
     matter after pronouncement of the Judgment
     in the aforementioned writ appeal.&quot;

<p id="p_14">The said Writ Appeals came to be dismissed by a

common order dated 23.07.2021 which aspect will be

discussed infra. Even SLP (C) No.11615/2021 against the

said order also met the same fate on 9.8.2021.

    (C) AS TO DELAY BROOKED IN DISPOSING THIS
WRIT PETITION:
</p>
<p id="p_15">     This   court   apologetically   states   that   the    Writ

Petition could not be disposed off as desired by the Apex

Court in a time bound manner inter alia because of

pendency of the aforesaid Writ Appeals and Special Leave

Petitions. Thereafter, the second wave of COVID-19

pandemic intervened and there were constraints for the

functioning of courts. Even the counsel appearing for the

petitioners was also struck with COVID - 19. Several

Judges, including the one in this case, were also infected

with COVID in series and as a consequence, there was

heavy   workload     on   the    available    hands.       Some

adjournments were taken by both the sides and several

by the side of petitioners on health &amp; other grounds.

Then came the Summer Vacation, 2022. Thereafter, the

matter was heard on several dates, the last one being

10.08.2022.

PETITIONERS:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                              10</span>



</pre><p id="p_17">        The impugned order being in derogation of earlier

decisions of the Commission and Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High

Court, is not sustainable. It violates the principles of

&#x27;precedent    and   legal   certainty&#x27;   and   defeats   their

legitimate expectation inasmuch as they had reframed

their warranty policy in the light of observations made in

the said decisions involving comparable factual &amp; legal

matrix. Modification of warranty policy consistent with

observations made in similar cases is part of normal

business practice and therefore, cannot be termed as

abuse of dominance. The impugned order apart from

being violative of principles of natural justice is arbitrary

&amp; discriminatory. Investigation of the kind has serious

consequences &amp; implications on the business reputation

and therefore, could not have been casually directed by

invoking draconian provisions of the 2002 Act. Petitioners

pressed into service several Rulings in support of their

case.

<p id="p_18">    5. CONTENTIONS PUT FORTH ON BEHALF OF
RESPONDENTS:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                11</span><p id="p_19">



</p><p id="p_20">     (a)     The Respondent-Commission represented by

the learned ASG contended that: case of the petitioners

as sought to be made out is only a figment of

imagination. The decision of Commission in ASHISH

AHUJA and        Delhi High Court in KAPIL WADHWA, supra

did not involve comparable fact matrices and therefore,

reliance    on    them   is   misconceived.   The   so   called

reframing of warranty service policy has nothing to do

with the said decisions and therefore, the doctrine of

legitimate expectation does not come to their aid. The

new warranty policy prima facie involves abuse of

dominance. What is being challenged is only an order

directing   investigation,    there   being   several    stages

following the same. The impugned order was made after

hearing the petitioners. Matters of this kind do not merit

deeper examination at the hands of Writ Courts, there

being no coercive action, impugned order being more

administrative in nature.

</p><p id="p_22">     (b)   The learned counsel appearing for the 2nd

respondent adopted the submissions of learned ASG and

added   that   an   investigation   into   the   activities   of

petitioners is necessary in &#x27;public interest&#x27;, regard being

had to the abuse potential of warranty policy and of

market dominance. The impugned order per se does not

result into any prejudice to the petitioners. The said

order only finds the matter &#x27;investigation worthy&#x27; and

therefore, directs investigation at the hands of the

Director General, they will have full opportunity of

participation in the investigation process and can lay a

challenge to the investigation report if &amp; when made

adverse to their interest, by filing appeal u/s 53B before

the NCLT; and there is also a second appeal to the

NCLAT as provided u/s 53T of the 2002 Act.

respondent banked upon certain Rulings supportive of

their common case.

</p><p id="p_25">      6.   Having heard the learned counsel appearing for

the parties and having perused the Petition Papers &amp;

relevant of the Rulings cited at the bar, this court

declines indulgence for the following reasons:

</p><p id="p_26">    A. A SKELETAL DESCRIPTION OF SCHEME OF
THE COMPETITION ACT, 2002:
</p>
<p id="p_27">      (i) Prior to the present competition law regime, the

Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969

(hereinafter &#x27;1969 Act&#x27;) was the primary instrument that

dealt with competition, in the light of Directive Principles

of State Policy enshrined in the Constitution. Prof. Aditya

Bhattacharjea3 contextualises the enactment of 1969 Act

and 2002 Act as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">      &quot;...The MRTP Act was passed in a context of
      growing evidence of concentration in Indian
      industry, manifested in the absolute size and
      dominance of family-owned business groups.</blockquote><p id="p_28">
</p><p id="p_29">      It drew its inspiration directly from the
      Directive Principles of State Policy in Articles
      38 and 39 of the Constitution...Its core
      chapter on concentration of economic power
      singled out &quot;large&quot; undertakings (those whose
      assets,   together    with   those    of   their
      &#x27;interconnected undertakings&#x27; exceeded a
      certain size) and &#x27;dominant&#x27; undertakings
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">3</span>

India and Canada Compared&#x27;, Vol. 5(1), Trade L. &amp; Dev, (2013)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                             14</span>



     (those whose market share exceeded one-
     third). After the adoption of economic reforms
     in 1991, several official committees in the late
     1990s suggested that India needed a new
     competition law to replace the MRTP Act.
     Although, a draft Bill was drawn up in 1999,
     the <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_15">Competition Act</a> was passed only at the
     end of 2002&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_30">     (ii)   Given the central place of competition in the

market economy, the Raghavan Committee Report4 laid

emphasis on the need to harmonize competition policy

with other governmental policies. Pursuant to same, the

2002 Act came to be enacted. Its preamble reads as

under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      &quot;An act to provide, keeping in view of the
     economic development of the country for the
     establishment of a Commission to prevent
     practices     having    adverse     effect   on
     competition,    to   promote      and    sustain
     competition in markets, to protect the
     interests of consumers and to ensure freedom
     of trade carried on by other participants in
     markets, in India, and for matters connected
     therewith or incidental thereto.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p id="p_31">The regulatory provisions of the Act can broadly be

divided into three categories; (i) prohibition of horizontal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                 15</span>



and vertical anti-competitive agreements, (ii) abuse of

dominant position by an enterprise; &amp; (iii) regulation of

combinations that are likely to have an &#x27;appreciable

adverse effect&#x27; on competition in India, which Chapter II

of the Act addresses. A former CJI Altamas Kabir5,

succinctly elucidates the objectives &amp; structure of this

Chapter as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">     &quot;... Chap. II of the Competition Act may be
     referred to as the soul of the <a href="/doc/1113485/" id="a_16">Competition Act</a>
     as it spells out the raison d&#x27;etre for the
     promulgation thereof. It deals with the
     prohibition of certain agreements, abuse of
     dominant     position   and    regulation   of
     combinations, each of which is anathema to
     the concept of competition and contrary to the
     objects to be achieved in terms of the
     Preamble and Arts. 38 and 39 of the
     Constitution...&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_32">

</p><p id="p_33">     (iii)   The   2002     Act      also   provides     for   the

establishment of the Competition Commission of India as

its primary regulatory body. It comprises of a chairman

minimum.     All   they   are   appointed     by   the    Central

    B.  AS TO CONTENTION OF PRECEDENT &amp;
LEGAL CERTAINTY IN VIEW OF DECISION IN
ASHISH AHUJA CASE AND KAPIL WADHWA CASE:

Learned Sr. Advocates appearing for the petitioners

submitted that the impugned order made under <a href="/doc/475292/" id="a_30">section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                              20</span></a>



<a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_31">26(1)</a> of 2002 Act directing investigation runs counter to

what    the    Commission   had    said   &amp;   done   in     Case

No.17/2014 between <a href="/doc/140907210/" id="a_32">ASHISH AHUJA vs. SNAPDEAL.COM</a>

decided on 19.05.2014 and the Delhi High Court decision

in   KAPIL    WADHWA,     supra.   They   argued     that    the

petitioners had reframed their &#x27;warranty service policy&#x27; as

a part of their normal business practice consistent with

the observations made in the said cases, which have

since attained finality and therefore, the impugned order

being repugnant to principles of precedent &amp; legal

certainty, is liable to be voided. This is controverted by

the learned ASG appearing for the Commission. Let me

examine the said cases:
</p>
<p id="p_38">       IN RE ASHISH AHUJA CASE:
</p>
<p id="p_39">       (i)    The &#x27;informant&#x27; Ashish Ahuja had purchased

certain products from the SanDisk in the open market

and not from its authorized distributors and sold them on

Snapdeal which had stopped sale of informant&#x27;s products

through its portal stating that it is only the authorized

partners of SanDisk who could sell items through
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                            21</span>



Snapdeal. The informant was asked to obtain an NOC

from SanDisk for selling its products through Snapdeal

which had circulated a letter representing that it would

offer warranty services only on those products that are

sourced from its four authorized distributors. The said

letter was the subject matter of the &#x27;information&#x27; treated

by the Commission which at paragraphs 19 &amp; 20 of its

order dated 19.05.2014 said as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">     &quot;19. The Commission observes that the
     insistence by SanDisk that the storage devices
     sold through the online portals should be
     bought from its authorized distributors by
     itself cannot be considered as abusive as it is
     within its rights to protect the sanctity of its
     distribution channel. In a quality-driven
     market, brand image and goodwill are
     important concerns and it appears a prudent
     business policy that sale of products
     emanating                                  from
     unknown/unverified/unauthorized sources are
     not encouraged/allowed&quot;.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     20. The Commission further observes that,
     vide its circular, SanDisk had only clarified
     that the full range of all India after sales and
     warranty services offered by it is limited to
     those products brought from its authorized
     national distributors. The conduct of SanDisk
     in issuing such circular can only be considered
     as part of normal business practice and
     cannot be termed as abuse of dominance...&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_40">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                               22</span>




</p><p id="p_41">     (ii)   There is force in the contention of learned ASG

that the case of the petitioners is substantially different

from that of ASHISH AHUJA inasmuch as the 2nd

respondent was importing &#x27;boxed&#x27; microprocessors from

petitioners&#x27; authorized distributors abroad, whereas in

AHUJA&#x27;s     case,   the   products   were   purchased   from

unauthorized sources. What is significant to note is: Prior

to 25.04.2016, the very same microprocessors were

covered under petitioners&#x27; warranty policy for India.

However, under the amended policy, the microprocessors

purchased only from an authorized Indian distributor of

Intel within India are eligible for warranty service in

India. In other words, if a purchase is made from

anywhere else on the globe even from authorized

distributors of the petitioners warranty on those products

would not avail in India, but may be claimed from the

place of purchase. This becomes evident from what is

stated on Intel&#x27;s website which begins with the heading

&#x27;How to obtain warranty service&#x27;. It specifically reads
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                              23</span>



&quot;...only   Intel   products     sold   by   Intel   Authorized

Distributors in India and purchased in India are eligible

for warranty sale within India. The list of Intel Authorized

<p id="p_42">
</p><p id="p_43">      IN RE KAPIL WADHWA CASE:
</p>
<p id="p_44">     (iii) Petitioners&#x27; heavy reliance on the decision of

Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in KAPIL WADHWA, supra would

not come to their aid and reasons are not far to seek: the

said case involved issues arising out of the Trademarks

Act, 1999 and they were outside the penumbra of the

2002 Act. At paragraph 73, the Court said as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">     &quot;What is pleaded is that the physical features
     of the printers sold abroad are different from
     the features of the printers sold in India. But
     this is irrelevant as long as the goods placed
     in the International market are not impaired
     or condition changed. It is pleaded that the
     respondents have no control pertaining to the
     sale, distribution and after sales services of its
     goods which are imported by the appellants
     and sold in India... With respect to after sales
     services, since the respondents do not
     warranty anything regarding their goods sold
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                             24</span>



     abroad, but imported into India and further
     sold, they not being responsible for the
     warranty of those goods, nothing turns
     thereon, as regards said plea. There may be
     some merit that the ordinary consumer, who
     is provided with warranties and after sales by
     the appellants, on not receiving satisfactory
     after sales service, may form a bad
     impression of the product of the respondents
     and thus to said extent one may recognize a
     possible damage to the reputation of the
     respondents... But, this can be taken care of
     by passing suitable directions requiring the
     appellants to prominently display in their shop
     that ... printers sold by them are imported by
     the appellants and that after sales services
     and warranties are not guaranteed nor are
     they provided under the authority and control
     of the respondents and that the appellants do
     so at their own end and with their own efforts.
</blockquote><pre id="pre_3">     This     would    obviate    any     consumer
     dissatisfaction   adversely    affecting    the
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_12">     reputation of the respondents, and thus if this
     is done, the respondents can claim no
     legitimate reasons to oppose further dealing ...
     in India.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_45">It is a well settled position of law that a case is an

authority for the proposition that it actually lays down in

a given fact matrix and not for all that which logically

follows from what is so laid down as observed by Lord

Halsbury in the celebrated case of QUINN vs. LEATHEM7.

Therefore, much cannot be drawn from the said fact -

specific - decisions. For the same reason, the doctrine of

legitimate expectation which the petitioners argued to

falter the impugned order does not much come to their

support, even if they had formulated their warranty

service policy on their understanding of the observations

in the said decisions.

    C. AS TO CONTENTION OF RES JUDICATA IN
VIEW OF ASHISH AHUJA AND KAPIL WADHWA
CASES:
</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><p id="p_48">        (i) Learned Senior Advocates appearing for the

petitioners submitted that, their clients have restructured

their warranty service policy on the basis of the what has

been observed by the Commission in ASHISH AHUJA and

by the Delhi High Court in KAPIL WADHWA, in the course

of their business and that they can justify the same on

the basis of what is decided in those cases; they plead

res judicata. Before considering this contention, it is

profitable to peruse what SIR WILLIAM DE GREY in THE

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                   26</span>



DUCHESS OF KINGSTON&#x27;S CASE8 had said about true

meaning &amp; scope of the doctrine. It is as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">        &quot;...From the variety of cases relative to
        judgment being given in evidence in civil
        suits, these two deduction seem to follow
        generally true; first, that judgment of a court
        of concurrent jurisdiction, directly upon the
        point, is, as a plea, a bar, or as evidence
        conclusive, between the same parties, upon
        the same matter, directly in question in
        another court; secondly that the judgment of
        a court of exclusive jurisdiction, directly on
        the point, is, in like manner, conclusive upon
        the same matter, between the same parties,
        coming incidentally in question in another
        court, for a different purpose. But neither the
        judgment of a court of concurrent or exclusive
        jurisdiction is evidence of any matter which
        came collaterally in question, though within
        their    jurisdiction, nor    of  any matter
        incidentally cognizable, nor of any matter to
        be inferred by argument of the judgment...&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_49">

</p><p id="p_50">        (ii)   The above decisions which the petitioners

heavily banked upon had different fact matrices and

years have rolled since they were decided. They are not

justified in contending for the progressive transformation

of    questions    of    fact   involved   in   those   cases   into

propositions of law favorable to them. The decisions in

ASHISH AHUJA &amp; KAPIL WADHWA are not the evidence

    (1776) 1 Leach 146
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                 27</span>



of   any   matter    which     come   collaterally   within   the

jurisdiction of Commission, nor of any matter incidentally

cognizable or can be inferred by the arguments from the

said decisions. Added, in ever changing matters of

commerce &amp; industry of the kind, the doctrine of res

judicata ill suits. What the Division Bench observed at

paragraph     42    of   the   decision   FLIPKART,    assumes

importance:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">      &quot;In the considered opinion of this Court, the
      order passed in the case of AIOVA does not
      help the present appellants. The order was
      passed by the CCI on 6.11.2018 directing
      closure of the case under <a href="/doc/1182170/" id="a_33">Section 26(2)</a> of the
      Act of 2002. The present order has been
      passed by the CCI under <a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_34">Section 26(1)</a> of the
      Act of 2002 on 13.1.2021, meaning thereby
      after a lapse of considerable long time it has
      been passed and in a competitive market
      various agreements are executed, new
      practices are adopted every day and merely
      because some other issue has been looked
      into by the CCI earlier, it does not mean that
      on the ground of res judicata the CCI cannot
      look into any information subsequently
      against the appellants. The principle of res
      judicata has no application in the matter
      under the Act of 2002 in the peculiar
      facts and circumstances of the case. The
      market place is by its very nature a constantly
      evolving and dynamic space. The market
      forces can evolve even in the course of a few
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                            28</span>



     months and therefore, by no stretch of
     imagination, it can be held that the appellants
     should be out of bound for all times and no
     action can be taken against them only
     because at some point of time the matter has
     been looked into by the CCI....&quot;

<p id="p_51">This decision attained finality after further a challenge

thereto in SLP (C) No.11615/2021, has been negatived

vide order dated 09.08.2021.
</p>
<p id="p_52">     (iii) The purpose of filing information before the

Commission is only to set the ball rolling as per the

provisions of 2002 Act. As already mentioned above, the

scheme of <a href="/doc/27675/" id="a_35">section 26</a> envisages layered proceedings and

the impugned order is only a step in aid of that. The

scope of inquiry is much broader and not restricted to the

material placed on record by the parties only. The

directions issued by the Commission in its order under

<a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_36">section 26(1)</a> of the Act are not parties specific but

address the alleged &#x27;anti - competitive practices&#x27; in the

industry in general, the punitive or corrective action

being confined only to the parties, notwithstanding.

Added, the Commission too having satisfactorily treated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                   29</span>



this &#x27;differential aspect&#x27; of the matter at paragraph 38 of

the impugned order observed as under:

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">           &quot;...The Commission however, observes that
           the facts of the said case are entirely different
           from the present case. In that case, it was not
           the situation that SanDisk would not produce
           warranty services on products purchased from
           authorized distributors of SanDisk merely
           because the purchases are made from outside
           India. Further, in that case, SanDisk did not
           limit its warranty policy in any particular
           country/ies ...&quot;

<p id="p_53">   D. AS TO PROCEEDINGS UNDER 2002 ACT BEING
&#x27;IN REM&#x27;:
</p>
<p id="p_54">     (i)      The submission of learned Senior Advocate,

Mr.Sajan Poovayya appearing for the petitioners that

pursuant to the observations of the Apex Court at

paragraph 15 of <a href="/doc/65191688/" id="a_37">SAMIR AGRAWAL vs. COMPETITION

COMMISSION OF INDIA9</a>, &#x27;the proceedings under the Act

are proceedings in rem which affect the public interest...&#x27;

and therefore, his clients are entitled to take the benefit

of    observations      made    in   ASHISH    AHUJA    &amp;   KAPIL

WADHWA cases and therefore, the impugned order is

vulnerable for challenge, is bit difficult to agree with. The

term &#x27;in rem&#x27; as defined by Bower10 is one which

&#x27;declares, defines or otherwise determines the status of a

person, or of a thing; that is to say, the jural relations of

the     person    or   thing   to    the   world   generally.   The

jurisprudential basis for a judgment being one &#x27;in rem&#x27; is

that in matters of public policy, where a large number of

people would ordinarily be affected, the entire world may

be regard as a party to the suit which was pronounced,

i.e., the judgment settles the destiny of the res itself. In

other words, even those who were not parties eo nomine

to the earlier proceedings are res judicated.


</p><p id="p_55">     (ii)   With the above background, the term &#x27;in rem&#x27;

occurring in paragraph 15 of the said decision needs to

be viewed. It was only intended to highlight the wide

impact of the proceedings under the Act, on &#x27;public

interest&#x27; as distinguished from their impact on individual

interest of the parties concerned. This becomes evident

from the language of paragraph 21 of SAMIR AGRAWAL

which reads as under:

      Clearly, therefore, given the context of the Act
      in which the CCI and the NCLAT deal with
      practices which have an adverse effect
      on competition in derogation of the interest of
      consumers, it is clear that the Act vests powers
      in the CCI and enables it to act in rem, in public
      interest. This would make it clear that a
      &quot;person aggrieved&quot; must, in the context of the
      Act, be understood widely and not be
      constructed narrowly, as was done in Adi
      Pherozshah Gandhi, supra...&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_57">In this light, what Justice B.S. Chauhan11, wrote as

to the foundational nature of competition law, is

worth adverting to:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">      &quot;...As Lord Denning rightly observed, &#x27;People
      who combine to keep up prices, do not shout
      it from the house tops. They keep it quiet;
      they make their own arrangement in cellars
      where no one can see. They will not put
      anything in writing not even into words. A nod
      or wink will do.&#x27; Competition law targets these
      forms of economic conduct which interfere
      with the effective operation of competitive
      markets, which are aimed to deceive the
      unaware, innocent buyers. At the same time,
      competition law eliminates obstacles to
      innovation,     expansion     and     promotes
      competition as a value. Competition law tries
      to ensure that the interest of an individual or
      a group of individuals should not subvert the
      broader community interest...&quot;

the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in

Where a statute or the like is struck down by the

constitutional courts, the same may operate &#x27;in rem&#x27;

though it is not done in any of these four jurisdictions, is

true. However, that is not the case here. Even the

adjudication     of   electoral          disputes     in    which       the

constituency     concerned         is    vitally   interested     in    the

Therefore, it does not follow from the public character of

</p><p id="p_63">        (v)     After all, a judgment of the court cannot be

construed      as      a   statute.    The        rules   for   construing

judgments        are       different       from     the     interpretative

techniques       used       for   construing          a    statute    vide

HERRINGTON vs. BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD16. The

Apex Court in SAMIR AGARWAL, had used the term &#x27;in

rem&#x27; while explaining the broadened locus standi and

expanse of the powers of the Commission in proceedings

under <a href="/doc/1081742/" id="a_40">section 19(1)</a> of the Act in the light of 2007

Amendment which becomes clear by the observations at

paragraph 15 of the said decision:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">        &quot;A look at <a href="/doc/1081742/" id="a_41">section 19(1)</a> of the Act would show
        that the Act originally provided for the
        &quot;receipt of a complaint&quot; from any person,
        consumer or their association, or trade
        association. This expression was           then
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">16</span>
     [1972] A.C. 877
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                            35</span>



     substituted with the expression &quot;receipt of any
     information in such manner and&quot; by the 2007
     Amendment. This substitution is not without
     significance. Whereas, a complaint could be
     filed only from a person who was aggrieved
     by a particular action, information may be
     received from any person, obviously whether
     such person is or is not personally affected.
     This is for the reason that the proceedings
     under the Act are proceedings in rem which
     affect the public interest. That the CCI may
     inquire into any alleged contravention of the
     provisions of the Act on its own motion is also
     laid down in <a href="/doc/1081742/" id="a_42">section 19(1)</a> of the Act. Further,
     even while exercising suo motu powers, the
     CCI may receive information from any person
     and not merely from a person who is
     aggrieved by the conduct that is alleged to
     have occurred. This also follows from a
     reading of <a href="/doc/1753275/" id="a_43">section 35</a> of the Act, in which the
     earlier expression &quot;complainant or defendant&quot;
     has been substituted by the expression,
     &quot;person or an enterprise,&quot; setting out that the
     informant may appear either in person, or
     through one or more agents, before the CCI
     to present the information that he has
     gathered.&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_64">


</p><p id="p_65">     (vi)   There is yet another aspect of the matter,

namely, the nature of orders made under <a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_44">section 26(1)</a>

of 2002 Act. The decision of the Apex Court in SAIL supra

lays down the threshold/scheme of this section as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     &quot;At the stage of <a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_45">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act, the
     CCI is expected to examine the information
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                            36</span>



     and other material on record; On the basis of
     such examination, the CCI must form an
     opinion whether there exists a prima facie
     case of contravention of the provisions of the
     Act; Such opinion must be recorded in the
     prima facie order of directing an investigation,
     which order must show expression of an
     opinion in &quot;no uncertain terms&quot;; The opinion
     must be &quot;substantiated&quot; in the order with
     reasons. Though the CCI may not record
     detailed reasons, it is required to give
     &quot;minimum reasons&quot; and yet most importantly,
     such    reasons   should     substantiate    the
     &quot;formation of an opinion&quot; and should do so in
     &quot;no uncertain terms&quot;. These requirements
     make it apparent that the need for
     substantiation and the determination in no
     uncertain terms are peremptory. Minimal
     reasons is only a matter of length and never
     of weight of reasons; Such an opinion must be
     made with reference to the material on
     record; The CCI is required to give reasons on
     every issue raised before it whilst passing an
     order under <a href="/doc/1405658/" id="a_46">Section 26(1)</a> of the Act.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_66">A perusal of the impugned order shows that it

perfectly accords with the above observations.


</p><p id="p_67">      (vii) As already discussed above, the argument of

petitioners&#x27; that what has been observed in ASHISH

AHUJA by the Commission and KAPIL WADHWA by the

Delhi High Court do operate as res judicata and they

have precedential value, supportive of their case, is not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                37</span>



convincing to say the least: In matters like this, that too

at the preliminary stage, the doctrine of res judicata or of

precedent, cannot be invoked, no &#x27;case&#x27; having been

decided by the Commission in virtue of impugned order.

What is observed in BALDEVDAS SHIVLAL VS. FILMISTAN

DISTRIBUTORS (INDIA) PVT. LTD.17 at paragraph 20

becomes instructive in this regard:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">        &quot; A case may be said to be decided, if the Court
        adjudicates for the purposes of the suit some
        right or obligation of the parties in controversy;
        every order in the suit cannot be regarded as a
        case decided within the meaning of s. 115 of
        the Code of Civil Procedure.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_68">That being the position, the reliance of Mr. Poovayya on

Salmond&#x27;s Jurisprudence, (4th Edition, § 66 &amp; 67) which

discusses the doctrine of precedent and a bit of res

judicata, their scope &amp; application, would not much come

</p><p id="p_74">        (iii) It would once again be fruitful to advert to the

foundational philosophy of competition law. The central

concern...is that firm or firms can harm competition and

inflict harm on customers and ultimately end consumers

where they possess some degree of market power20. This

central concern arises from &#x27;market power&#x27; a particular

firm holds; the concept of market power being &quot;...the

ability to reduce output or capacity, to raise prices, to

reduce the quality of products, to limit the choice

without fear of a damaging competitive response by

other     firms...&quot;21       The   aim     of   2002   enactment       is:

preventing practices which have an &#x27;adverse effect&#x27; on

the competition; promoting &amp; sustaining competition in

the markets, in order to protect the interest of the

consumers; and ensuring that freedom of trade is

maintained in the given &#x27;relevant market&#x27;. By extension,

this freedom of trade also holds within it the freedom of

choice, i.e., lower switching costs and proper information

systems for the consumers to make the right choice.

balances against the abuse of power vested in the

Commission which comprises of experts and qualified

persons        as   its   constituent    members.      Commission&#x27;s

stature and track record as can be ascertained from

several rulings of the Apex Court and various High

Courts, is also a fair assurance against the abuse of
