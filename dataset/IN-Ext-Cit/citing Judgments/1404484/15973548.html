         believe that there was impartiality in his investigation and an impartial 

         investigation is   an essential bedrock for any   successful prosecution. 

         The complainant being the Investigating   Officer of the case is legal 

         infirmity which demolishes the case of the prosecution.     For in such 

         case   the   accused     will   be   deprived   of   their   valuable   rights   of

                     the case, it appears to us that there is discrepancy in  
                     the depositions of the PWs. 2 and 3 and in the absence  
                     of   any   independent   corroboration   such   discrepancy  
                     does not inspire confidence about the reliability of the  
                     prosecution   case.     We   have     also   noted   another  
                     disturbing feature in this case. PW3 Siri Chand, head  
                     Constable   arrested   the   accused   and   on   search   being  
                     conducted   by   him   a   pistol   and   the   cartridges   were  
                     recovered from the accused. It was  on his complaint a  
                     formal first information report was lodged and the case  
                     was initiated.   He being complainant should not have  
                     proceeded with the investigation   of the case.   But   it  
                     appears to us that  he was not only the complainant in  
                     the case   but he carried on with the investigation and  
                     examined  witnesses under S.161 <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_25">Cr.PC</a>. Such practice,  
                     to  say  the least, should not be resorted to so that there  
                     may not be any occasion to suspect fair and impartial

                  Superintendent   of   Police,   was   not   authorised   to

                  importance   to   that   fact,   as   that   may   not   affect   the  
                  validity of the conviction.  The infirmity which we are  
                  pointing   out   is   not   an   infirmity   arising   from  
                  investigation by an officer not authorised to do so, but  
                  an   infirmity   arising   from   investigation   by   a   Head  
                  Constable who was himself the person to whom the  
                  bribe   was   alleged   to   have   been   offered   and   who  
                  lodged   the   first   information   report   as   informant   or

      Crl</a>. Appeal No.1400/2010  decided on 19.04.2011 are also relevant to 

      the facts of this case. It is held in para 7 as under:­

               " But the facts remains that appellant was not lodged  
               in jail and was kept in Police Station Lodhi Colony  
               itself   on   the   ground   that     jail   authorities   had  
               declined to accept the appellant since it was late in  
               the evening.  On 7th April, 2000 when appellant was  
               produced   before   the   court,   he   had   categorically  
               stated   that   he was  shown  to  4­5  persons  while  in  
               police custody. Refusal of appellant to participate in  
               TIP   was,   thus,  for justifiable  reason  since  he  had  
               been   shown   to  the  complainant.  Thus,   no   adverse  
               inference   can   be   drawn   on   account   of   refusal   of  
               appellant   to   participate   in   TIP.   Accordingly  
               identification of appellant by  PW1, after about one  
               year   of   incident,   is   valueless   more   so,   when  
               complainant   has   admitted   in   his   deposition   that  
               whole incident took place after the sunset and was  
               over within 40 seconds."
