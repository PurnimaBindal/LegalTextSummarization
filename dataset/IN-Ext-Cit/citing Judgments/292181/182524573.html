    as of 22nd  April, 1996, the Defendant cannot be said to be unaware of the

    have examined the Plaint, its annexures, the product of the Plaintiff bearing its 
           


    registered   mark   SPASGAN   and   the   product   of   the   Defendant   bearing   the 
        



    impugned mark SPASGAN and the affidavit-in-reply of the Defendant and the 

    documents produced by the Defendant and also the affidavit-in-rejoinder filed 





    by the Plaintiff. The impugned mark is identical to the registered mark of the 

    Plaintiff. The impugned mark SPASGAN is used by the Defendant in respect of 

    pharmaceutical goods which fall in Class 5 in which the mark of the Plaintiff is 





    registered.   The   Defendant   has   admitted   the   use   of   the   mark   in   respect   of

    on behalf of the Defendant that since the Plaintiff's name is not recorded in the

    by the registered proprietor.  If such argument is accepted then the provisions

    and use any mark which is applied for by the competitor and start use of the 

    same prior to actual use of the mark by the registered proprietor and claim 

    rights adverse to the registered proprietor.   This kind of situation will render 





    the registration of the mark itself meaningless.  In the present case apart from

    registration of the mark SPASGAN in the name of the Plaintiff relates back to 

    22nd April, 1996.  The alleged use of the mark SPASGAN by the Defendant is 




                                                       
    from 1998 which is admittedly subsequent to the date of registration of the 
                                   
    mark   of   the   Plaintiff   i.e.   22nd  April,   1996,   and   therefore   the   conditions   of

    <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_20">Section 34</a> of the Act in my view, makes it clear that in order to avail the 

    benefit of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_21">Section 34</a> of the Act, the use of a trademark by a person other than  
         


    the registered proprietor, must be prior to the date of use by the registered 
      



    proprietor or the date of the registration, whichever is earlier.  As far as the 

    provisions of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_22">Section 34</a> (a) of the Act are concerned, the defence taken by the  





    Defendant does not fall within the ambit of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_23">Section 34</a> (a) of 

    the Act because the principle of deemed public user shall apply even when the 

    claim of  prior user is to be considered. Therefore, no case is made out by the 





    Defendant to take benefit of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_24">Section 34</a> of the Act and  seek 

    protection thereunder.

    user   of   the   registered   mark   commences   on   the   date   of   the   application   for 

    registration of the registered mark. Therefore, in the present case the prior 

    user of the mark SPASGAN shall be of the Plaintiff and not the Defendant.  In 




                                                       
    any event, the registration of the Plaintiff's mark is of a date prior to the date 
                                    
    on which the Defendant commenced use of the impugned mark.   Therefore, 
                                   
    the submission of the learned Advocate for the Defendants that the Defendant 

    is entitled to prior rights in the mark by reason of its claim that the use of the  

    mark by the Defendant is prior to the actual use of the mark by the Plaintiff in 
         


    commerce, cannot be accepted. Hence, the Plaintiff is entitled to claim use of 
      



    the mark from the date of the application for registration of the mark though 

    the actual commercial use of the mark is subsequent.

    its goods bearing the mark in India and the use is only in respect of export of  

    the goods bearing the mark SPASGAN, there is no use of the mark in India to  





    maintain the present action against the Defendant.

    sue for infringement under the Act is the registration of the mark.   Once the 
                               
    mark is registered under the Act, then a suit for infringement will certainly lie 
                              
    under the Act without requiring the registered proprietor to show the actual 

    commercial use of the mark. The principle of deemed public user of the mark 

    by virtue of prior registration will also apply in the present scenario and the 
        


    Suit for infringement of trade mark will be maintainable.

<p id="p_52">          Our attention was not invited to any other judgment under the

<p id="p_53">          51. It is admitted that the appellant applies the impugned mark to  
                             
          the goods in India which are thereafter exported. The impugned  
          mark has thus been applied  to the appellant's goods within the  
                            
          meaning of <a href="/doc/1356592/" id="a_31">section 56</a>. Had the mark been applied in relation to  
          goods   to   be   sold   within   India,   it   would   undoubtedly   have  
          constituted use of the trade mark in India. By virtue of <a href="/doc/1356592/" id="a_32">section 56</a>,  
       

          the application in India of the trade mark, although to goods to be  
          exported from India, is deemed to constitute use of the trade mark  
    



          in relation to the said goods "for any purpose for which such use is  
          material under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_33">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999, or any other law". The  
          plain language of <a href="/doc/1356592/" id="a_34">section 56</a>, therefore, constitutes the application  





          in India of trademarks even to goods to be exported from India as  
          use of the trade mark in relation to those goods for any purpose  
          for which such use is material under the Act or any other law.
</p>




<p id="p_54">          The use of a trade mark is relevant for more than one reason. It is  
          relevant to a party seeking to establish goodwill and reputation in  
          a mark in an action for passing off. It is also relevant, even if it is  
          not necessary, to establish the act of infringement or passing off.

          manner   provided   by   the   Act.   <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_37">Section   29</a>   enumerates   various  
          circumstances   that   would   constitute   infringement   of   registered

          use the same. For instance, <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_38">Section 29</a> of the Act provides that a  
                                
          registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a  
          registered proprietor or a person using by way of a permitted use,  
                               
          "uses" in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with or  
          deceptively   similar   to   the   registered   trade   mark.   <a href="/doc/773798/" id="a_39">Section   29(2)</a>  
          provides that a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who  
       

          not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of a  
          permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark which because of  
    



          the factors enumerated therein is likely to cause confusion on the  
          part of the public or which is likely to have an association with the  
          registered trade mark. <a href="/doc/1482778/" id="a_40">Section 29(6)(c)</a> expressly provides that for  





          the purpose of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_41">section 29</a>, a person uses a registered mark if he,  
          inter-alia, imports or exports goods under the mark.
