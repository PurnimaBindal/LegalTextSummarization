Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB). Thus, the appeal. Parties to

the lis, hereinafter, shall be referred to by their original position in the suit.

</p><p id="p_2">2.            Briefly, the case set out by the plaintiff is that he is the sole

proprietor of the firm, namely, M/S MOHUN'S BAKERY PRODUCTS.

Plaintiff is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling various

kinds of biscuits, cakes, dry fruit cakes, pastries, buns etc. since 1975.

Plaintiff firm had adopted a distinctive trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″(in label

form) in the year 1975.       Subsequently, in the year 1978, plaintiff firm

adopted the trade mark " MOHUN's " in another distinctive label. Since

then, plaintiff has been regularly using the trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″in

respect of the aforesaid goods, and has made it popular and distinctive

among the members of the trade/business, and public at large. Firm of the

plaintiff was/is registered under the <a href="/doc/1939811/" id="a_2">Punjab Vat Act</a>, 2005, as also under the

<a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_3">Central Sales Tax Act</a>, 1956. Plaintiff's trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″forms a

prominent part of his trade name M/S MOHUN'S BAKERY PRODUCTS,

which are synonymous to each other. On account of prior adoption and

extensive use of the said trade mark, plaintiff has gained such an enviable

goodwill and reputation, that good of the same kind and/or description,

and/or any other cognate/allied goods, bearing the aforesaid trade mark or

any identical/deceptively similar trade mark are considered and deem to be

belonging to the plaintiff firm. Thus, plaintiff is the first and prior adopter,

user, promoter and the lawful proprietor of the trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″.

And, has thus acquired proprietary rights as regard its usage under the

Common Law. Further, with a view to acquire the statutory rights, plaintiff

also secured registration (Registered TM No.396139, dated 07.10.1982) of

his trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″, under the Trade and Merchandise Marks
           For Subsequent orders see CM-16925-CII-2016

Act, 1958. And, later in association with his registered trade mark, and in

respect of the enlarged specification of the goods, plaintiff moved a fresh

application, dated 10.10.2008, seeking registration of his afore-indicated

trade mark, claiming user since 01.01.1978, under the Act. Application of

the plaintiff was advertised, and for no opposition proceedings were lodged,

the Registrar of Trade Marks registered the mark of the plaintiff (Registered

TM No.1741875) vide certificate dated 10.10.2008, relating back to the date

of his application i.e. 10.10.2008. And, the said registration still persists and

is valid. That being so, no one else is authorized to use the plaintiff's

registered trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″and/or identical/deceptively similar

trade mark in relation to the goods for which plaintiff's trade mark is

registered, without leave or consent of the plaintiff. However, in April, 2014,

plaintiff came to know that defendant's firm M/s Salty Food Products has

also commenced business of same kind/description of goods i.e. biscuits,

namkeens, variety of packaged snacks etc., falling under Class 30, under an

identical/deceptively similar trade mark i.e. ‶ MOHAN'S ″. That adoption

and use of the identical and/or deceptive/similar trade mark by the defendant

for the same description of goods, is a slavish imitation of the plaintiff's

prior used and registered trade mark, which amounts to infringement under

<a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_4">Section 29</a> of the Act. Further, the defendant by mala fide adoption and use

of an identical and/or deceptively similar trade mark, is not only passing off

his goods and business as those of the plaintiff, but also diluting plaintiff's

goodwill and reputation. Thus, the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.            In defence, it was pleaded, inter alia, by the defendant that he

was/is trading under the name and style: M/s Salty Food Products, a

proprietorship concern, which has its office at WZ-413/B, Sri Nagar, Rani

Bagh, Delhi. Defendant is a manufacturer and merchant/trader of packaged

bakery food products such as rusks, biscuits, cookies, other confectionery

items and namkeen. Defendant is using the mark ‶ MOHAN'S ″ in respect

of variety of packaged snacks and products, falling under Class 30, in a very

distinct packaging. Defendant had conceived, adopted and applied for its

brand/mark ‶ MOHAN'S ″from his name Man Mohan Sharma. Earlier,

the defendant had applied for registration of his mark MOHAN'S under

application No.865401, dated 13.07.1999, claiming user since 01.01.1999, in

respect of "Namkeens of all Kind in class 30". Since then, his business grew,

and now defendant is manufacturer/ trader/ exporter of biscuits, namkeens,

rusks, sohan papdi, gulab jamun, rasgulla etc. in India as well as abroad.

Defendant has also acquired the mark MOHAN'S under trade mark

application No.1774982, dated 16.01.2009, in Class 30 by way of

assignment deed dated 22.05.2014, claiming user since 17.12.1990. The

assignment request of the defendant was granted and the said application has

since been advertised in the name of the defendant in the Trade Mark

Journal.
</p>
<p id="p_4">              Plaintiff has instituted the suit on the purported infringement of

his trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″, however, the defendant has challenged the

registration of the said mark, vide rectification application No.ORA

No.208/2014/TM/DEL, which is pending before the IPAB. Thus, the suit is

required to be stayed. The mark/expression ‶ MOHAN'S ″was/is

inherently non-distinctive, and thus there was no question of its acquiring a

secondary meaning qua the products of the plaintiff. And, plaintiff was/is not

the prior user/adopter of the impugned mark, for the trade mark containing

identical expression "MOHUN'S" i.e. MOHUNS PURE MALT VINEGAR

(Registered TM No.262401) and MOHUNS TOMOTO Ketchup (Registered

TM No.262402) were applied for the first time, in Class 30, by Mohan

Meakin Limited on 05.02.1970, claiming user since September, 1963. The

impugned mark was registered in grave contravention of the provisions of

the Act, for the restrictions subject to which it was to be advertised were

never fulfilled. Further, nothing was placed on record to show that mark

‶ MOHUN'S ″was ever adopted or put to use by the plaintiff. Therefore,

the suit be dismissed with exemplary costs.
</p>
<p id="p_5">4.            On an analysis of the material on record, the trial court arrived

at a conclusion that establishment of the plaintiff was registered as a Small

Scale Industrial Unit by the Department of Industries, Punjab, and a

certificate, dated 22.03.1978, was issued in this regard by the Director

Industries. To begin with, the plaintiff-firm; MOHUN'S BAKERY

PRODUCTS, Amritsar was a partnership firm, and was registered as such

by the Registrar of Firms, Punjab on 11.03.1982. Although, subsequently,

the firm was dissolved, but in terms of the dissolution deed dated

31.03.1990, the trade mark of the firm was assigned to the plaintiff-Manjit

Singh, who thereafter continued the business of the firm, as its sole

proprietor. The record showed that, vide letter dated 16.10.1985, permission

was granted to the plaintiff by the Northern Railways, for sale of Mohun's

Fruit Cakes at railway stations. Copies of invoices on record revealed that

plaintiff had supplied its goods to various railway stations in the country

under its trade name MOHUN'S BAKERY Products. Earlier, the partnership

firm had secured registration, (Registered TM No.396139, dated

07.10.1982), for its trade mark 'MOHUN'S' Fruit Cakes, in class 30, under

the then Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_5">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958. And, thereafter, the trade

mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″ was registered (Registered TM No.1741875) in the

name of plaintiff-Manjit Singh, in class 30, in respect of biscuits, cakes,

pastry, dry-fruit cakes, rusks, buns, breads, patties, dry-fruit pastries, and all

other bakery products, cereal and edible preparations, claiming user since

01.01.1978, which is valid upto 10.10.2018.
</p>
<p id="p_6">              Whereas, the defendant too was/is dealing in the same set of

goods i.e. bakery products, under the name and style 'Wah MOHAN'S'.

The bakery items like biscuits, fruit cakes, dry-fruit cakes etc. are used by

the public at large, and are identified by the masses from its label, device,

and trade name. Whereas, the manner of presentation of plaintiff's as also

the defendant's label is such that they almost look alike.

to be considered. For, they are not required to be placed side by side to

enough if the impugned mark bears overall similarity to the registered mark.

deceptively similar in relation to the goods or services which are identical or

it observed that when a person gets his trade mark registered, he acquires

valuable rights to the use of the trade mark in connection with the goods in

respect of which it is registered. And, in the event of any invasion of his

rights by any other person using a mark which is identical or deceptively

similar to his trade mark, he could protect his mark by an action for

infringement and obtain injunction. And, accordingly, concluded:


</p><p id="p_9">              "25. The       word          'MOHUN'S'   and   'MOHAN'S'      are

              phonetically, structurally and visually similar. The label is

              also of similar type. By simply putting word 'A' in place of

              'U' or by putting word 'Wah' before mark 'MOHAN'S' and

              that too in small font is not going to make any difference.

              The consumer is going to be deceived by the appearance of

              are so deceptively similar that a common man will not be

              able to make distinction between the two. All these

              circumstances make the trade mark of the defendant to be

              deceptively similar to the trade mark, word, label and

              device of the plaintiff. When plaintiff claims the user of the

              mark MOHUN'S since 1978 which is also supported by

              documentary evidence, claim of user by defendant since

              1990 does not hold ground and it cannot be said that the

              trade mark registered in the name of plaintiff is invalid.

              out in favour of the plaintiff. The balance of convenience

              also lies in favour of the plaintiff. The plaintiff will suffer

              irreparable loss and injury if the defendant is allowed to

              continue to sell his goods with the trade mark MOHAN'S',

              which is deceptively similar to the trade mark of the

              plaintiff. Thus, the application under Order 39 Rules 1 and

              2 Civil Procedure Code filed by the plaintiff is allowed..."

a trade mark, if the defendant pleads that the registration of the plaintiff's

trade mark is invalid or vice-versa, and if before the institution of the suit,

the IPAB was already seized of the rectification proceedings, the court shall

have to stay the suit. But, in the event, no such proceedings were pending,

but the court is satisfied that the plea of invalidity set up by the defendant or

the plaintiff, as the case may be, is prima facie tenable, the court shall

adjourn the suit for a specified period to enable the party concerned to move

the IPAB for rectification of the register. And, if indeed such an application

is moved, within the stipulated time, the trial of the suit shall stand stayed in

terms of <a href="/doc/1530005/" id="a_17">Section 124(2)</a> of the Act. In the matter in hand, he submits that, no

rectification proceedings were pending before the institution of the suit, for

the defendant indeed moved the IPAB subsequently, and that too without

any order of the court under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_18">Section 124(1)(ii)</a>. But, that is inconsequential,

for the right to invoke the jurisdiction of the Board is not dependent upon

any prima facie determination of the plea of invalidity by the civil court. In

reference to paragraph 64(1)(a) of the decision of the Full Bench of Delhi

High Court in <a href="/doc/69071842/" id="a_19">Data Infosys Ltd. And Ors. v. Infosys Technologies Ltd</a>.,

2016(65) PTC 209, he submits that IPAB has the exclusive jurisdiction to

decide upon the plea of invalidity of registration of a trade mark, and <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_20">Section

124</a> does not control the choice of a litigant to seek rectification of the

register. That is how, he asserts, the trial court being cognizant of the plea of

invalidity set up in defence, pendency of the rectification proceedings before

the IPAB, and on consideration of the specific application, under <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_21">Section

124</a>, moved by the defendant, stayed the suit, which implies that court found

the invalidity plea to be prima facie tenable. For, otherwise the suit could

never be stayed under <a href="/doc/1530005/" id="a_22">Section 124(2)</a> of the Act. Thus, he asserts, once the

trial court found the plea of invalidity to be prima facie tenable how could, it

still hold that there also exists a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff,

and grant injunction.

              In the alternative, in reference to <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_23">Section 9</a> of the Act, he

submits that there is an absolute bar to register a mark, which is devoid of

any distinctive character, unless it has acquired a secondary meaning, as a

result of consistent usage or is a well known trade mark. Whereas, the

impugned mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″is a common name, incapable of acquiring

any distinctive character and, therefore, ought not to have been registered.

Particularly, for nothing was placed before the registration authorities to

show that the said mark had indeed acquired a secondary meaning. Further,

prior to its registration, plaintiff's trade mark was ordered to be advertised,

but subject, however, to certain restrictions, which were never satisfied, and

yet the mark was registered. It is urged that although the plea of invalidity

was specifically set out, but the trial court failed to examine the question as

regards the invalidity of registration of plaintiff's mark.

</p><p id="p_15">              Further, the plaintiff was/is not the prior user/adopter of the

trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″, for the trade marks containing the identical

expression were already registered, in Class 30, in the name of several other

entities. Thus, in the given situation, the plaintiff could not claim any

exclusivity as regards usage of the mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″.

</p><p id="p_16">              Not just that, he submits that there was/is nothing on record to

show that the plaintiff ever used the registered trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″to

run or to carry out his business activities. Thus, in terms of the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_24">Section 47</a> of the Act, the said trade mark was rather liable to be taken off

the register. He submits that, as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_25">Section 34</a> of the Act, the

defendant being a prior user of the trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″could never

be injuncted from its usage, notwithstanding that the plaintiff happened to be

the proprietor of a registered trade mark.

              And, yet another aspect which has been lost sight of by trial

court is; that apparently the adoption and usage of the trade mark

‶ MOHAN'S ″by the defendant was/is bona fide, for it forms part of his

matter in hand. He relied upon the following decision in support of his

operation and scheme. He too has placed reliance upon the majority view of

the Full Bench of Delhi High Court in Data Infosys Ltd. (supra), and a

Single Bench decision of the same Court in <a href="/doc/251357/" id="a_36">Stokely Van Camp Inc and

Anr. v. Heinz India Private Ltd</a>., 2012(52) PTC 540, to contend that there

are only two situations in which infringement action can be stayed: (I)

Under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_37">Section 124(1)(i)</a>, when rectification proceedings were pending

before filing of the suit. (II) If no such proceedings were pending at the time

of institution of the suit, then only, if the court finds the plea of invalidity to

be prima facie tenable in terms of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_38">Section 124(1)(ii)</a>. Further, if despite

opportunity granted by the court a party concerned does not move the IPAB

or plea of invalidity is not found to be tenable, then the only consequence

that ensues is the deemed abandonment of the invalidity plea. In reference to

the matter in hand, he submits that concededly at the time of institution of

the suit on 12.05.2014, no rectification proceedings were pending. In fact,

after the defendant was served, and he caused appearance in the suit, he on

his own, by circumventing the provisions of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_39">Section 124(1)(ii)</a> of the Act,

moved the IPAB for rectification of the register. And, since the defendant

did not opt to follow the procedure set out in <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_40">Section 124(1)(ii)</a> of the Act,

he, on his own, volition abandoned the plea of invalidity. Rather, he submits

that, in the given situation, the trial court ought not to have even stayed the

suit, and was required to proceed with the matter as regards the other issues.

Resultantly, he asserts that the defendant has lost the right to question the

validity of registration of plaintiff's trade mark in these proceedings.

adoption and extensive usage of his mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″since 1978, had

gained enviable goodwill and reputation. And, as a result, the mark of the

plaintiff had acquired a distinctive character and a secondary meaning. Thus,

plaintiff was/is a lawful proprietor of the said mark under the common law.

And further, he had even acquired a statutory right of exclusive usage, for he

secured registration (Registered TM No.1741875, dated 10.10.2008) of his

mark, which is valid and operating. Further, <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_41">Section 31</a> of the Act postulates

that registration of a trade mark is the prima facie evidence of its validity.

He relies upon a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1555192/" id="a_42">Mahendra and

Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd. v. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd</a>., 2002

AIR(SC) 117, wherein the court in reference to the extensive usage of a

word "Mahindra" and "Mahindra and Mahindra" for over five decades held

that it had acquired a distinctiveness and a secondary meaning in the

business. Likewise, reliance is also placed upon a judgment of Bombay High

Court in Lavasa Corporation Ltd. v. Lavasa Visuals Private Ltd.,

<p id="p_22">              And, in any case, he asserts that the defendant lacks locus to

question the registration of the plaintiff's trade mark being non-distinctive,

for none other than the defendant himself had sought registration of his mark

<p id="p_23">              Further, in response to the argument that there were pre-existing

registered proprietors of an identical/nearly identical or similar trade mark, it

is submitted that even if, that is so, it would still not disentitle the plaintiff to

seek injunction against the defendant. For, provisions of <a href="/doc/1045167/" id="a_44">Section 28(3)</a> of the

Act postulate co-existence of more than one registered proprietor of a similar

trade mark.
</p>
<p id="p_24">              And, for apparently the plaintiff was/is the prior adopter and

user of the registered trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″since 1978, the defendant

was/is disentitled to seek any protection under <a href="/doc/1478365/" id="a_45">Section 34</a> of the Act.

Likewise, he submits that the defendant is not a bona fide user of the trade

mark ‶ MOHAN'S ″, for despite having failed to secure registration

(application No.865401, dated 13.07.1999), of his mark MOHAN'S, and to

carry out any search of the trade mark register to ascertain if the

similar/identical mark was indeed the property of someone else, he took the

risk of marketing and selling his products. Thus, adoption and usage of the

mark ‶ MOHAN'S ″by the defendant is apparently mala fide, which

disentitles him to set up a defence under <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_46">Section 35</a> of the Act as well. In

support of his submission, he has placed reliance upon the decisions

could it still hold that there exists a prima facie case in favour of the

plaintiff, and grant injunction. And, per contra, learned counsel for the

plaintiff asserts that since no rectification proceedings were pending before

              and after the plea of invalidity is held to be prima facie

only to initiate the rectification proceedings, but even to keep the invalidity

plea alive. And, in the event of default or even if a party moves the IPAB on

his own, proceedings in the suit shall not be stayed. Meaning thereby, the

fall out of such a lapse would result in abandonment of invalidity plea.

Likewise, if the plea of invalidity is not found to be prima facie tenable or

the party concerned does not approach the IPAB, despite opportunity

afforded by the court, within the specified time, the said plea would be

deemed to have been abandoned. In this back drop, the argument advanced

by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, is well in place and has merit; that

for concededly no rectification proceedings were pending before the

institution of the suit, therefore, to keep the plea of invalidity alive,

defendant was required to adhere to the provisions of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_63">Section 124(1)(ii)</a>, and

since he did not opt to abide by the said process the said plea is deemed to

two situations; one each under clause (i) and (ii) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_65">Section 124(1)</a>, in which

infringement action can be stayed, and consequently the plea of invalidity

remains alive? Having read and analyzed each of the clauses of the

somehow, I fail to construe clause (i) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_66">Section 124(1)</a> to curtail its

application only to a situation where rectification proceedings were

instituted before institution of the suit. For, to my mind and understanding,

does not mean that initiation of rectification proceedings at any stage of the

suit, would attract clause (i) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_68">Section 124(1)</a>, for it ceases to operate after a

</blockquote><p id="p_37">14.           A bare analysis of the provisions of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_71">Section 124(1)(i)</a> reveals

that where in any suit for infringement of a trade mark, defendant pleads

that registration of the plaintiff's trade mark is invalid or he sets up a

defence in terms of clause (e) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_72">section 30</a> of the Act, and

the plaintiff questions the validity of registration of defendant's trade

mark, the court shall stay the suit, if the rectification proceedings are

pending before the IPAB, till the final          decision is reached in those

proceedings. And, in case no such proceedings are pending, and the court

finds the plea of invalidity to be prima facie tenable, in terms of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_73">Section

124(1)(ii)</a>, it would raise an issue in this regard, and adjourn the matter for a

specified time to enable the party concerned to apply to the Appellate Board

for rectification of the register. And, if the rectification proceedings are

initiated within the specified time, the court shall stay the suit, in terms of

<a href="/doc/1530005/" id="a_74">Section 124(2)</a> of the Act, to await final decision in the rectification

proceedings. However, in the event no such application is moved, sub-

section (3) of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_75">Section 124</a> postulates that the issue as to the validity of

registration of the trade mark shall be deemed to have been abandoned, and

the court shall proceed with the suit in regard to other issues. And, under

proceedings shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the court shall

dispose of the suit in terms thereof, in so far as it relates to the issue as to the

validity of registration of the trade mark. Sub-section (5) of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_77">Section 124</a>

suggests that even though the suit is stayed, it shall still not preclude the

court from making any interlocutory order during the period of the stay of

the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_38">15.           Ex facie, to stay the proceedings in an infringement suit,

pendency      of    the    rectification   proceedings      alone   is   not    the

pre-requisite, but a plea of invalidity, in sync with <a href="/doc/269338/" id="a_78">Section 124(1)(a)</a> or

<a href="/doc/944811/" id="a_79">Section 124(1)(b)</a>, as the case may be, must co-exist. Needless to assert that

what, indeed, precedes the stage before the defendant sets up a plea of

invalidity in defence or plaintiff questions the registration of defendant's

trade mark, is the institution of the suit itself, service upon the defendant(s),

defendant(s) causing appearance in the proceedings, and filing the written

statement. It is at that stage, alone it is feasible for the defendant to set out a

plea of invalidity. And, it would be viable, thereafter, for the plaintiff to

question the registration of defendant's trade mark, provided the latter has

set up a defence in terms of clause (e) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_80">Section 30</a>. The

precise moment in the suit to ascertain or the necessity to seek an answer to

the question; whether any rectification proceedings were/are pending, would

arise only when the court trying the suit, on completion of the pleadings of

the parties, takes cognizance of the dispute for the first time and applies its

mind. Be that for the purpose of framing the issues or deciding an injunction

application. And, if at the moment the IPAB is seized of the rectification

proceedings the court shall have to stay the suit under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_81">Section 124(1)(i)</a>,



            For Subsequent orders see CM-16925-CII-2016

notwithstanding whether those proceedings were initiated before or post

institution of the suit.
</p>
<p id="p_39">              Not just that, for clause (ii) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_82">Section 124(1)</a> further

supplements this position. Undoubtedly, clause (i) and (ii) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_83">Section 124(1)</a>

contemplate two different situations, but the process that runs through these

provisions is common till the court is required to determine the prima facie

tenability of the invalidity plea. Meaning thereby, having taken cognizance

of the pleadings of the parties, and applied its mind to the dispute for the

first time, if the court, at that moment, finds that IPAB is seized of the

rectification proceedings, it would stay the suit, and if no such proceedings

are pending, but the court is satisfied as regards the tenability of the said

plea, it would frame an issue in this regard and adjourn the proceedings to

enable the party concerned to approach the IPAB.
</p>
<p id="p_40">              If, I may also spell out my thought by way of an illustration;

assuming in an infringement suit, service of the defendant is yet to be

effected, and being oblivious of the institution and pendency of the suit, he

moves the IPAB for rectification of the register. And thereafter, upon being

served, he causes appearance, and files the written statement setting up a

plea of invalidity. To my mind, it is clause (i) of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_84">Section 124(1)</a> which

would be attracted and come into play. For, where would be the occasion for

the court to still determine the prima facie tenability of the said plea, with a

view and purpose to enable the party concerned to approach the IPAB,

which indeed was already seized of the proceedings.

</p><p id="p_41">              Explicitly, the provision of <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_85">Section 124</a>, operates itself to cater

to diverse situations, and at no stage, indeed it finds the date of institution of

the suit germane and/or necessary to run its full course or operation.

              What further complements this perception is; that right of the

party concerned to move the Registrar/IPAB under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_86">Section 47</a> or 57, for

rectification or removal of the trade mark is independent and indefeasible.

Nowhere does the provisions of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_87">Section 124(1)(i)</a> indicate that post

institution of the suit plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, would

require sanction/ prior permission/approval of the court to move the

Registrar/IPAB. And, my understanding and analysis, in this context, finds

resonance in the minority view of the court in Data Infosys Ltd. (supra).

</p><p id="p_43">16.           The matter can be viewed from yet another perspective: what

<a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_88">Section 124(1)(i)</a> postulates is; if any proceedings for rectification of the

register in relation to the plaintiff's or defendant's trade mark "are

pending" before the Registrar or the Appellate Board. Nowhere does it

say that the court shall stay the suit if the rectification proceedings "were

pending prior to or before or on the date of institution of the suit".

Needless to assert, that neither can the court subtract or add words to a

Statute nor read something into it which indeed does not exist. The Hon'ble

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/781949/" id="a_89">Nasiruddin and Ors. v. Sita Ram Agarwal</a>, AIR 2003

</p>
<p id="p_47">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">              "8.    The language of Sub-rule (4) of Rule 10 is absolutely

             clear    and   does      not   permit   any   artificial   rule   of

             interpretation to be applied. It is well established that if the

             words of a statute are clear and free from any vagueness

             and are, therefore, reasonably susceptible to only one

             meaning, it must be construed by giving effect to that

             meaning, irrespective of consequences. The language of the

             sub-rule here is precise and unambiguous and, therefore,

             has to be understood in the natural and ordinary sense. As

             was observed in innumerable cases in India and in England,

             the expression used in the statute alone declares the intent of

             the legislature. In the words used by this Court in <a href="/doc/1093034/" id="a_91">State of

              Thus, to my mind, <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_92">Section 124(1)(i)</a> not only takes within its

sweep a situation where the rectification proceedings were already pending

at the time of institution of the suit, but also, if subsequent to the filing of the

suit a party concerned moves the Registrar/IPAB, for rectification of the

register, and then set up a plea of invalidity in the written statement or vice-

versa. However, the precise moment or stage at which, if the rectification

proceedings are pending, the court shall have to stay the suit, in terms of

<a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_93">Section 124(1)(i)</a> is: when, post completion of the pleading of the parties,

the court takes cognizance of the dispute for the first time, and applies its

mind.
</p>
<p id="p_50">17.           Having said that, I may now advert to the matter at hands.

Undoubtedly, no rectification proceedings were pending at the time of

institution of the suit on 12.05.2014. And, in fact, the defendant after having

entered appearance in the suit moved the IPAB on 09.07.2014. But, without

any analysis, as to the prima facie tenability, of the plea of invalidity by the

Court. For, it was thereafter the defendant filed the written statement on

19.12.2014, and questioned the registration of plaintiff's trade mark.

However, the fact remains that the moment the trial court took cognizance of

the pleadings of the parties and applied its mind to the dispute, the IPAB was

in seisin of the rectification proceedings. And, that is how, the court stayed

the suit. Significantly, not in terms of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_94">Section 124(1)(ii)</a>, but in terms of

<a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_95">Section 124(1)(i)</a>. For the court never passed any order under <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_96">Section

124(1)(ii)</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_51">              Therefore, the argument that has been advanced by learned

counsel for the plaintiff that the plea of invalidity, set out by the defendant

           For Subsequent orders see CM-16925-CII-2016
                                26 of 64

stood abandoned, cannot be countenanced. Likewise, the submission of the

learned counsel for the defendant that the said plea having been found to be

tenable, the court could never grant injunction to the plaintiff also pales into

insignificance. Thus, the net result is; the plea of invalidity of registration of

the plaintiff's trade mark was/is indeed alive.
</p>
<p id="p_52">18.           That being so, and for the learned counsel for the defendant has

raised serious issues as regards the validity of registration of plaintiff's trade

mark, the question would be; Whether the civil court could go into the

validity/invalidity of a registered mark, albeit the exclusive jurisdiction

to rule upon the validity/invalidity of registration of a trade mark,

under <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_97">Section 47</a>/<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_98">57</a> of the Act rest with the Registrar or the IPAB? The

answer is in the affirmative, and not far to seek, for the proposition is not res

intergra.

<p id="p_53">              Registration of a trade mark, in terms of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_99">Section 31</a> of the Act,

is only a prima facie evidence of its validity and not a conclusive proof.

Which is why, the provisions of <a href="/doc/490592/" id="a_100">Section 28</a> of the Act suggest, in no

uncertain terms, that right of the registered proprietor, for exclusive usage of

the registered trade mark, and to obtain appropriate relief in the event of its

infringement is subject to valid registration, and other provisions of the

Act. And, that is how, even <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_101">Section 124(1)</a> of the Act entitles the party

concerned to set up a plea of invalidity of registration of a mark in the

infringement suit. And, still further <a href="/doc/479452/" id="a_102">Section 124(5)</a> of the Act, postulates that

stay of the infringement suit shall not preclude the civil court from making

an interlocutory order or granting ad interim injunction, which needless to

assert involves prima facie determination of the dispute, as also the plea of

invalidity if set up. Not just that, even in terms of <a href="/doc/514670/" id="a_103">Section 124(1)(ii)</a>, the civil

the said mark, as a result of its consistent and extensive user, had indeed

acquired a secondary meaning. In response, learned counsel for the plaintiff

failed to refer to any such material, at least at this stage, which indeed

formed basis of the satisfaction of the authorities that the plaintiff's trade

mark had actually acquired a secondary significance. Thus, prima facie,

there was no question for the mark/expression ‶ MOHUN'S ″, having lost

its primary meaning and acquiring a secondary character.

the said mark was not capable of distinguishing the goods, specified in the

<p id="p_68">               Not just that, earlier, vide application No.717790, dated

24.09.1996, even the plaintiff had sought to register his mark

MOHUNS in class 30. But, as the identical/similar mark was already

registered in the name of other entities and one of those i.e. M/s Mohan

Meakin Ltd., lodged apposition proceedings, the said application was

abandoned by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_69">22.            That being so, reliance placed by the learned counsel for the

plaintiff upon the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1555192/" id="a_113">Mahendra

and Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd. v. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd</a>., 2002

AIR(SC) 117, and Lavasa Corporation Ltd. v. Lavasa Visuals Private

Ltd., 2013(56) PTC 231, would not advance the case of the plaintiff a bit.

For, in Mahendra and Mahendra Paper Mills Ltd.'s case, the court had

found as a fact that the plaintiff therein had been using the word "Mahindra"

and "Mahindra and Mahindra" in its companies/business concerns for over

five decades and, thus, the name had acquired a distinctiveness and a

secondary meaning. Therefore, it was concluded that the trial court has

rightly passed an interim injunction restraining the defendant-company,

which was yet to commence its business, from using the name "Mahindra"

or "Mahindra and Mahindra" for the purpose of its business.

</p><p id="p_70">               Likewise, in Lavasa Corporation Ltd.'s case (supra), plaintiff

happened to be a registered proprietor of the trade mark LAVASA in class

           For Subsequent orders see CM-16925-CII-2016

16, whereas defendant was a recently incorporated company, which has

started using LAVASA as a part of its corporate name. Claim of the

defendant, that the expression LAVASA was a common word having

generic meaning was rejected by the court, for nothing was brought on

record to show that the said expression was a commonly used word in India.

Likewise, Coffee chain by the name LAVAZZA coffee and LAVAZZA

used as a surname in USA was not sufficient to prove its commonness in

India.
</p>
<p id="p_71">              Whereas, in the matter in hand, plaintiff has failed to place on

record, at least at this stage, the precise material which formed basis of the

satisfaction of the authorities and showed that owing to its regular, vigorous

and uninterrupted long usage, plaintiff's trade mark had acquired a

secondary meaning.
</p>
<p id="p_72">23.           Even the argument; that defendant lacks locus to question the

registration of the plaintiff, as he had himself sought registration of a similar

mark, though unsuccessfuly, also lacks conviction. No doubt, in Marvel Tea

Estate India Ltd. (supra), the court observed that the contention of the

defendant that the trade mark 'MARVEL' was not a distinctive trade mark

and, therefore, no protection could be given to the plaintiff, was devoid of

any substance. For, on the one hand the defendant had questioned the

registration of the said mark, and on the other, he himself had sought

registration of a mark 'MARVEL TOUCH'. Thus, once a person himself

applied for registration of an identical/similar trade mark, he was not entitled

to question the registration of the trade mark of the rival party, who has

initiated the infringement proceedings. Similar observations are recorded in

the case of <a href="/doc/39264970/" id="a_114">Marico Limited v. Agro Tech Foods Limited</a> (supra).

              Indisputably, if a person applies for registration of a trade mark,

which falls under any one of the clauses of <a href="/doc/1288548/" id="a_115">Section 9(1)(a)</a> to <a href="/doc/202329/" id="a_116">9(1)(c)</a> of the

Act, of course the registration thereof shall be refused, unless it is

established that pursuant to its long and uninterrupted commercial usage it

has acquired a distinctive character. And, if a trade mark has indeed been

registered in contravention to clauses (a) to (c) of <a href="/doc/520333/" id="a_117">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act,

and there is no material either to prove that it had gained a distinctive

character, a challenge to the registration of the said mark cannot be

dismissed only because a person, who questioned its registration, had

himself once sought to register an identical or a similar trade mark. If

registration of a trade mark is invalid its invalidity or the defect it suffers

from does not stand cured just because the person, who has questioned it,

had himself sought to secure registration of a similar/identical mark. Need I

say that there cannot be any estoppel against law.
</p>
<p id="p_74">24.           There is yet another aspect that questions the validity of

registration of plaintiff's trade mark; the case set out by the plaintiff himself

is that he had secured registration of his mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″(Registration

TM No.396139, dated 07.10.1982), under the then Trade and Merchandize

Act, 1958. And, subsequently in association with the said registered trade

mark, and in relation to the enlarged specifications of goods, he moved a

fresh application (No.1741875, dated 10.10.2008), seeking registration of

the impugned mark " MOHUN's " under the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_118">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999.

Concededly, the mark of the plaintiff was ordered to be advertised, but

subject to certain restrictions; (a) association of the impugned trade mark

application with the other registered trade mark No.396139, (b) furnishing

NOC by the other partners, for the registered trade mark No.396139 was

obtained by a partnership firm, i.e. MOHUN'S BAKERY PRODUCTS,

consisting of Manjit Singh (plaintiff), Harjit Singh and Mohan Singh. The

positive case set out by the defendant is that, the conditions indicated above

were required to be satisfied by the plaintiff within 30 days from the date of

receipt of a communication, dated 12.05.2010, issued by the Examiner/

Registrar Trade Marks. But, the plaintiff continues to be in default to date,

for those conditions were never complied with. And, yet the Trade Marks

Registry not only advertised, but even registered the mark. Significantly,

this position is not contravened by the learned counsel for the plaintiff. That

being so, the provision that requires a reference in the situation, and would

have a bearing on the matter is; <a href="/doc/472439/" id="a_119">Section 132</a> of the Act:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">              "Abandonment.- Where, in the opinion of the Registrar, an

              may, by notice require the applicant to remedy the default

ought to have rejected/abandoned the impugned registration?

</p><p id="p_78">25.           There is yet another aspect which shall have a decisive bearing

on the right of exclusive usage of a mark being claimed by the plaintiff; the

trade mark containing the identical expression/character "MOHUNS",

28.09.1970, claiming user since 01.01.1964. MOHUN'S NEW LIFE

(Registered TM No.267274) was applied in Class 30, by Mohan Meakin

by Mohan Beakin Breweries Limited on 21.05.1971, claiming user since

02.02.1965. It would be apposite to point out, before I proceed further, that

the trial court did notice this position (in paragraph 11 of its judgment), but

yet failed to examine this aspect and its necessary fall out.

</p><p id="p_79">26.           Ex facie, the plaintiff is not a prior user/adopter of the mark

‶ MOHUN'S ″, for before plaintiff purports to have adopted the impugned

were pre-existing, and registered in the name of other business entities and

entrepreneurs. Prima facie, the expression ‶ MOHUN'S ″appears to be

common to trade and in public domain. Thus, no amount of user, if any, can

lead to exclusive appropriation of expression ‶ MOHUN'S ″as a trade

mark in favour of the plaintiff. Rather, the evidence that shall be led by the

parties, might show, for numerous business houses, establishments and

manufacturers were/are also using the identical word as part of their trade

mark or trade name, the word MOHUN'S had indeed attained the character

of publici juris. The expression publici juris has been defined, on numerous

occasions by the courts, in context of the right of exclusive usage claimed by

a registered proprietor. The Black's Law Dictionary (Tenth Edition)

defines the expression publici juris: Of public right; of importance to or

available to the public; words that are in general or common user and

that are merely descriptive are publici juris and cannot be

just that, none of the invoices/bills pertain to the goods in relation to which

the said trade mark is registered. In fact, all the invoices are in respect of sale

of fruit-cakes alone. Likewise, even the raw material which the plaintiff

purport to have purchased vide bills (Annexure P-111 to P-116), is only for

preparation of fruit cakes. That is how, even the printing bills (Annexures

Further, the registered trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″is claimed to have been

extensively advertised by the plaintiff by means of calendars, hand bills,

pamphlets, stickers, labels and/or by such other media, for which a

considerable expenditure was incurred, but significantly no such material is

brought on record. One wonders as to how, all what has been brought on

record by the plaintiff is only "Fruit Cake" specific/related, and there

indeed is no material to show that plaintiff either manufactured any of the

items for which his trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″was registered, except fruit

cakes, and/or any actual usage of the said mark. The answer is not far to

seek, for originally plaintiff had secured registration of a device mark




(MOHUN'S FRUIT CAKE), vide registration No.396139, dated 07.10.1982

i.e. date of Trade Mark application, claiming user since 1975. And, the only

product/item in relation to which the said mark was registered was Fruit

Cake. So if the plaintiff was actually producing or dealing in any other

merchandise, other than fruit cakes, and had indeed adopted the impugned

mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″since 1978, there was no occasion for him to have still

sought registration,       four years later, in 1982 for a mark, which was Fruit

Cake specific and registered exclusively in relation to Fruit Cakes.

</p><p id="p_96">              On being asked, if there was any material, of any conceivable

nature, to show that the registered trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″was in actual

usage, and/or the plaintiff ever produced/manufactured any of the products,

except Fruit Cakes, for which the said mark was registered, learned counsel

for the plaintiff fairly stated, that for the present, there was nothing on

record. Thus, prima facie, it appears that although the plaintiff had

subsequently, secured registration of a mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″, for enlarged

specification of goods, vide certificate dated 04.02.2011, w.e.f. 10.10.2008,

but neither did he produce those items nor used the registered trade mark.

</p><p id="p_97">29.            It does not end there. For, not only there was no usage or even a

single instance of actual user of a mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″(Registered TM

No.1741875, dated 10.10.2008), in relation to which plaintiff has initiated an

infringement action, the said mark is not even a registered trade mark. For,

registration i.e. Trade Mark No.1741875, dated 10.10.2008, indeed relates to

a device mark i.e.


                     " MOHUN's "
</p><p id="p_98">Why did the plaintiff alter the original registered trade mark and predicate

his suit on the altered mark i.e. ‶ MOHUN'S ″, is not difficult to discover

either. Perhaps, he knew for, despite registration the registered trade mark

remained dormant and in disuse, it may not be possible to prove its actual

user. And, whereas the altered mark could jell with the material on record,

for the word ‶ MOHUN'S ″was also a part of plaintiff's trade name i.e.

MOHUN'S BAKERY PRODUCTS. Which is why, to keep in line with his

pleaded case, it appears, there was/is a conscious and calculated

misrepresentation in paragraph 20 of the plaint even as regards the first

                    registry did not prove its user by the persons in whose

                    names the mark was registered and was irrelevant for

                    the purposes of deciding the application for interim

                    injunction unless evidence had been led or was

</p><p id="p_110">              Thus, the only and the inevitable conclusion one could reach, at

this stage, is that there indeed has been no actual usage of the alleged

registered trade mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″as also the mark " MOHUN's ",

which is registered. And, on the contrary, the defendant is concededly

manufacturing and selling his merchandise under his trade mark

but it also preceded the date of registration of the mark. What needs to be

noticed is that plaintiff's trade mark was registered on 04.02.2011, relating

back to the date of his application i.e. 10.10.2008. Therefore, the question

that arises for consideration is: Whether registration of a mark by itself

from a prior date, in the absence of any proof of its actual usage, shall

prevail upon the prior and actual user of a trade mark? Ex facie, the

purport and intent of the provision is to protect a prior user of a mark from

any interference in his right of usage by the registered proprietor. The first in

the market test has always enjoyed pre-eminence. Rather <a href="/doc/1551966/" id="a_131">Section 47</a> of the

Act postulates the possibility of registered trade mark being taken off the

register, if indeed there was no actual use of the mark for a period of five

years and three months from the date of its registration.

</p><p id="p_112">              The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Neon Laboratories Ltd.

(supra) dealt with a similar situation; Defendant was in appeal before the

Supreme Court against an order of injunction granted by the trial court, and

affirmed by the High Court. Conceded case of the parties was that

predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff had initiated user of the trade mark

PROFOL in the year 1998 and applied for its registration on 24.05.1998.

Whereas, the defendant commenced user of its trade mark ROFOL only

from 16.10.2004. Albeit, defendant had applied for registration of its mark

on 19.10.1992, which was granted on 14.09.2001, relating back to the date

of application i.e. 1992. Quite clearly, plaintiff was the prior user, for,

though the defendant had secured registration of his mark as early as in the

year 1992, but there was no actual usage of the registered trade mark for

twelve long years. In this situation, even though the registration of

defendant's mark preceded the actual user of the mark by the plaintiff, but

the court observed that intention of the Section, which is to protect the prior

user from the proprietor who is not exercising the user of its mark prima

facie appears to be in favour of the plaintiff/respondent:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">              "...The legal nodus is whether the prior registration would

              have the effect of obliterating the significance of the

              goodwill that had meanwhile been established by the

              Plaintiff-Respondents. Would a deeming provision i.e.

              relating registration retrospectively prevail on actuality -

              competing equities oscillate around prior registration and

              prior user.

<blockquote id="blockquote_49">
              7      ... While the case of the Plaintiff-Respondents is

              furthered by the fact that their user commenced prior to

              that of the Defendant-Appellant, the entirety of the Section

              needs to be taken into consideration, in that it gives rights to

              a subsequent user when its user is prior to the user of the

              proprietor and prior to the date of registration of the

              proprietor, whichever is earlier. In the facts of the case at

              hand, the Defendant- Appellant filed for registration in

              1992, six years prior to the commencement of user by the

              Plaintiff-Respondents. The Defendant-Appellant was, thus,

              not prevented from restraining the Plaintiff-Respondents'

              use of the similar mark PROFOL, but the intention of the

              Section, which is to protect the prior user from the

              proprietor who is not exercising the user of its mark prima

              strain inasmuch as it postulates the possibility of a

              application being made by any aggrieved person, inter alia,

              on the ground that for a continuous period of five years and

              three months from the date on which the trademark was

              registered, there was no bona fide use thereof. In the case in

              hand, prima facie, it appears that for over five years after a

              registration application was made by the Defendant-

              Appellant, the mark was not used.

              In other words, the question before the Court would remain

              whether the situation on the date of application for

              registration alone would be relevant, or whether the

              developments in the period between this date and the date

              Thus, prima facie prior user would prevail and have precedence

over mere registration of a mark, which appears to have just existed on the

prominence across the States, that adoption of the mark ‶ MOHAN'S ″by

the defendant was purely to encash upon plaintiff's reputation and divert his

business. The argument advanced by learned counsel for the plaintiff that the

defendant is not a bona fide user of a trade mark ‶ MOHAN'S ″, for he did

not carry out any inspection or search of the trade mark register to ascertain

whether the said mark was/is indeed the property of another, and the reliance

placed in this regard upon the decisions of the Bombay High Court in Aristo

Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. (supra) and <a href="/doc/1285435/" id="a_134">M/s Himalaya Drug Co. v. Gufic

Ltd., and another</a>, 2004 AIR (Bombay) 278, also lacks conviction. For,

<a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_135">Section 35</a> rather prohibits the registered proprietor of a trade mark to cause

any interference with the use by a person of his own name provided its

adoption and usage is bona fide. The decision in Aristo Pharmaceuticals

Pvt. Ltd. (supra) does not advance the case of the plaintiff, for the court

while determining the plea of delay and acquiescence set up by the

defendant, observed that although defendant claimed to have been marketing

its products since 2009, but nothing was produced in evidence to show that

the defendant ever advertised his products under the said trade mark. Even

otherwise, the case of the plaintiff was that the sale figures of respondent

No.2 was so minuscule, which could have hardly been noticed by the

plaintiff. In the given situation, it was observed that where a party uses a

registered trade mark without even bothering to take search in the register,

such use is at the defendant's own risk, and it is not open to the defendant to

raise a question of delay. Such is not the case in the matter in hand.

Likewise, in M/s Himalaya Drug Co. (supra) adoption and/or usage of the

trade mark "Shallaki", by the defendant, was not found to be bona fide on

merits. In fact, paragraph 8 of the said decision reveals that although a

defence, in terms of <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_136">Section 35</a> of the Act, was set up by the defendant, but

the said plea was not pressed. It was in these circumstances, the court had

             word 'Goenka' in the name of its institution is honest. This

             is because the Trust Deed is of 1990, well before the 'G.D.

             Goenka Public School' was started in 1994 and that the

             name of the trustees of the trust have their surnames

             'Goenka'. The institution 'Mohini Devi Goenka Mahila

             Mahavidyalaya' was started in 1995, in the District of Sikar

             in Rajasthan (well away from Delhi) just one year after the

             respondents started 'G.D. Goenka Public School'. In one

             year it is not possible that 'G.D. Goenka Public School'

             categorical and clinching has been placed on record by the

             had a valid reason to us 'Goenka' in their institution in 1995

             as the trustees were Goenkas themselves. So far as use of

             'Goenka' in the name 'Goenka Public School' in the year

             2000 is concerned the arguments as stated in favour of the

             appellant as stated above will hold good and additionally

             also that the respondents had till 2000 admittedly called

             their school 'G.D. Goenka Public School' and had never

registered trade mark, which is not the subject matter of separate application

by the proprietor or is not separately registered, as envisaged under <a href="/doc/1217525/" id="a_141">Section

15</a> of the Act, no exclusivity in terms of its usage can be claimed.

Notwithstanding, the registration of the trade mark as a whole.

</p><p id="p_127">              Faced with this, learned counsel for the plaintiff refers to the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1974917/" id="a_142">Section 55</a> of the Act, which postulates, that if an actual usage

of a trade mark is required to be proved under the Act, the tribunal may, if

and, so far as it shall think right, accept use of a registered associated trade

mark, or of the trade mark with additions or alterations but not substantially

affecting its identity, as an equivalent for the use required to be proved. It

appears that what is sought to be urged is that even if there was no actual

usage of the registered trade mark        " MOHUN's ", user of a mark

‶ MOHUN'S ″, which is substantially the same, be taken as an equivalent

user. But, that too would not advance the case of the plaintiff. Concededly,

the registration of the associated trade mark No.396139, dated 07.10.1982,

lapsed on account of non-payment of the renewal fee, and, prima facie,

plaintiff has even failed to show the actual usage of the altered mark i.e.

‶ MOHUN'S ″.

(supra) SCC 727, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that the object of

interlocutory injunction was/is to protect the plaintiff against injury by

violation of his rights for which he could not adequately be compensated in

damages. However, the need for such protection must be weighed against

the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury

resulting from his having been prevented from exercising his own legal

rights for which he could not be adequately compensated. Thus, the court

must weigh one need against another and determine where does the balance

of convenience lie. Further, the factor that, indeed, be of an immense

relevance is; whether defendant is yet to commission his business or he has a

running business establishment. And, in the latter case, the considerations

would be somewhat different than those that apply when the defendant is yet

to commence his venture/enterprise:

‶ MOHUN'S ″and ‶ MOHAN'S ″, for they were phonetically,

structurally, and visually similar. Further, it could not be said that

registration of the plaintiff's mark was invalid, and rather the documents on

record proved its actual usage since 1978.
</p>
<p id="p_141">              However, the trial court failed to determine the invalidity plea,

the Act, for he claimed to be a prior and bona fide user of his mark. Finding

rendered by the court that registration of plaintiff's mark could not be said

to be invalid, and evidence on record proved its actual user since 1978, is

palpably erroneous and against record.         The trial court despite having

noticed that trade marks containing identical expression were already

registered in the name of many business enterprises or entrepreneurs, much

before the purported adoption and usage of the mark by the plaintiff, yet

failed to examine if the plaintiff could still seek a right of exclusive usage of

a mark to the exclusion of all others. Further that plaintiff had initiated an

infringement action in relation to a mark ‶ MOHUN'S ″, which is only a

fragment or a part of the registered trade mark.
