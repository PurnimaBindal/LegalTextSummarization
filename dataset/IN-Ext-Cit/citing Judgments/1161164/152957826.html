<p id="p_1">PER CHANDRA POOJARI, AM:
</p>
<p id="p_2">       This appeal preferred by the assessee is directed
against the order of the CIT(A)-V, Hyderabad dated
21.04.2010 for assessment year 2003-04.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2.     The grievance of the assessee in this appeal is
with regard to the disallowance of loss/depreciation of
Rs. 1,06,18,444/- on the block of assets.
</p>

<p id="p_4">3.     The learned counsel for the assessee submitted
that the Commissioner of Income tax Appeals cannot
disallow the expenditure without any basis and on the
basis of surmise and suspicion which is not correct and
bad in law and hence not justified. It is submitted that
the assessee was doing the business and earned other
income of R5 3,09,082/-, therefore, the claim of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                2                 I.T.A. No. 1016/Hyd/2010</span>

Commissioner of Income tax Appeals that the assessee
was not doing the business is not correct and not
justified and bad in law. It is submitted that in the case
of the assessee the assets forms the Block of Assets
and   once   the    assets   entered     into     the     block      the
Depreciation   on    the   Block     should   be     allowed.       The
learned counsel relied on the decision                   in case of
Packwell Printers V Asst. Commissioner of Income Tax
1996 -(59) ITD 340 ( Jab) where it has been held that-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      "The Legislature felt that keeping the details with
      regard to each and every depreciable assets was
      time consuming both for the assessee and the
      Assessing Officer. Therefore, they amended the
      law to provide for allowing of the depreciation on
      the entire block of assets instead of each
      individual assets. The Block of Assets has also
      been defined to include the group of assets falling
      with the same class of assets. Hence after the
      amendment with effect from 1-4-1988, the
      individual assets has lost its identity and for the
      purpose of allowing of depreciation, only the block
      of assets has to be considered if a block of assets
      is owned by the assessee and used for the
      purpose of business, depreciation will be allowed.
      Therefore the test of user has to be applied upon
      the block as whole instead of upon an individual
      asset."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_6">4.    The    learned       counsel     submitted          that       the
Legislature has prescribed a different mode for allowing
depreciation in respect of block of asset and henceforth
a calculation of depreciation will be in a lumpsum for
the entire block of depreciable assets and the theory of
individual asset    which    prevailed before           01-04-1988
cannot be considered after the new provision of block
assets came into force. According to learned counsel, if
a particular machinery were owned, forming part of

                                                                   Lanconet Ltd.

Block     asset,    is       not    used    during     the       year,        still
depreciation is to be allowed even if assets are not
used during the present year. It is submitted that if
one single asset out of the entire block has been
discarded or not put to use by the assessee for its
business consideration, for that ground alone partial
deprecation        cannot          be   disallowed.        Further,      it     is
submitted that the case of the assessee was not a case
where the assessee had sold the particular asset at a
consideration which could be reduced for the purpose
of computing WDV of Block of assets as provided in
section 43(6) ( c ). It is pointed out that the assessee
had     discarded        a   particular     asset     during      year,         in
question, meaning thereby that particular asset was
not put to use during the year. It is submitted that the
Taxation laws ( Amendments Act, 1986 ) has changed
thoroughly the system of allowing depreciation with
effect from 0-04-1988 and By these provisions, the
concept of block assets brought into statute book for
the purpose of allowing depreciation . The relevant
provision as it stood after the amendment that is
applicable to the under consideration reads as under:
32    (1)   In     respect         of   Depreciation        of    Buildings,
machinery, Plant or furniture owned by the assessee
and used for the purposes of business or profession.
The learned counsel invited our attention to the CBDT
Circular No. 469 dated 23-09-1986 and the contents
therein are as under:

clause (11) inserted in <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_1">section 2</a> of the Income
Tax Act means a group of assets falling within a
class of assets being buildings, machinery, plant
and furniture in respect of which the same
percentage of depreciation is prescribed. The
necessary amendments to the Income-Tax rules
prescribing the percentage of depreciation in
regard to various blocks of assets will be made
accordingly which will be effective from 02-04-
1987, Le. , for the assessment year 1988-89 and
onwards. It is proposed that the assets which are
eligible for 100 per cent depreciation in initial
year itself will continue to get this benefit. In
addition, there will be only two rates of
depreciation presently proposed at 33 -1/3
percent and 50 percent in respect of plant and
machinery. Further, the buildings meant for low
paid employees machinery. Further, the buildings
meant for low paid machinery. Further, the
buildings meant for low paid employees of
industrial  undertakings   will   be   entitled to
depreciation at 20 percent as against the general
rate of 5 percent for residential buildings and 10
percent for non-residential buildings . In view of
these accelerated rates of depreciation, the extra

<p id="p_15">5.     The learned counsel for the assessee has placed
the reliance on the following case laws:

<p id="p_16"> 6.    Further, the learned counsel for the assessee
relied upon the decision of the Hyderabad Tribunal in
the case of Coromandal Bio Tech Industries (I) Ltd. in
ITA Nos. 287 to 289/Hyd/2007 &amp;          1512/Hyd/08 vide
order dated 30/03/2012 wherein the Tribunal placing
reliance on the decision of the Jurisdictional Bench in
the case of Natco Exports Vs. DCIT, 86 ITD 445
(Hyd.), held as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "16. The condition/requirement of section of word
       'used for the purpose of business' as provided in
       <a href="/doc/1004921/" id="a_4">section 32(1)</a> of the Act for the concept of
       depreciation on block of assets can              be
       summarised, that use of individual asset for the
       purpose of business can be examined only in the
       first year the asset is purchased. In subsequent
       years when use of block of assets is to be
       examined, existence of individual asset in block of
       assets itself amounts to use for the purpose of
       business. This view is fully supported by various
       provisions of the Act which were amended
       consequent to the scheme of depreciation on
       block of assets including to the proviso to section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                       6            I.T.A. No. 1016/Hyd/2010</span>

32 of the act. The said proviso to <a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_5">section 32</a>
requires that where an asset is acquired by the
assessee during the previous year and is put to
use for the purposes of business or profession for
a period of less than one hundred and eight days
in that previous year, the deduction under this
sub section in respect of such asset shall be
restricted to fifty percent of the amount
calculated at the percentage prescribed for an
asset under clause (i)or clause (ii) or clause (iia)
as the case may be. When an asset purchased has
satisfied the above condition in the year of
purchase that asset will be included in the
respective block of asset, depreciation for that
year will be calculated on written down value in
accordance with <a href="/doc/899509/" id="a_6">section 43(6)</a> of the Act by the
increasing opening WDV by the actual cost of any
asset falling within that block, acquired during the
previous year. Once an asset is included in the
block of assets it remains in block for its entire
life. There are following three situations provided
in the statutes when an individual asset of the
block goes out of block:
</p>
<p id="p_18">1. An asset is sold or discarded or demolished or
destroyed during that previous years as provided
in <a href="/doc/899509/" id="a_7">section 43(6)</a> ( c) (i) (b) and 32(1)(iii) of the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_19">2. An asset not exclusively used for the purposes
of the business r profession but used other than
business purposes as provided in <a href="/doc/1527607/" id="a_8">section 38(2)</a> of
the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_20">3. Where any block of assets does not cease to
exist but the full value of the consideration
received or accruing as a result of the transfer of
the depreciable assets by the assessee during the
previous year exceeds the aggregate of the
amounts    stated in <a href="/doc/1705981/" id="a_9">section 50</a> of the act and
where any block of assets ceases to exist for the
reason that all the assets in that block are
transferred during the previous year.
</p>
<p id="p_21">17. Furthermore, the coordinate Bench of the
Tribunal in the case of Natco Exports Vs. Dy.CIT
(86 ITD 445) (Hyd.)has held as follows:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                7            I.T.A. No. 1016/Hyd/2010</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                                        Lanconet Ltd.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                           ====================

      "From the above, it is clear that as long as an
     asset forms part of the block of assets and the
     block continues to exist, provisions of S.50 do not
     come into play and depreciation has to be allowed
     on that portion of the WDV of the assets which
     have been scrapped, after reducing the scrap
     value from the block of assets. This view is
     fortified by the judgments of Jabalpur Bench of
     the Tribunal in the     case of Packwell Printers
     (supra) then judgement of the Ahmedabad Bench
     of the Tribunal in the case of Inductotherm
     (India) Ltd. (supra) and the judgement of the
     Patna Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Parikh
     Engg. &amp; Body Building Co. Ltd. (supra). Therefore,
     in view of the decisions and interpretation of the
     concept of 'block assets' depreciation on ponds
     and plant &amp; machinery which are forming part of
     the block of assets has to be allowed as deduction
     even though these ponds and plant &amp; machinery
     were discarded and not used and not owned by it
     during the assessment years in question, as the
     assessee was not entitled to pay scrap value
     whatsoever, consequent to discarding"

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">     18. Respectfully following the aforesaid decision
     of the Coordinate Bench of the Tribunal, we
     dismiss the appeals of the Revenue.

<blockquote id="blockquote_11">     19. In the result, the           appeals   filed    by     the
     Revenue are dismissed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">7.   According to the learned counsel, the assessee is
entitled for depreciation     on the block of assets as the
depreciation was granted to the assessee in the same
block in earlier assessment years. Being so, it cannot
be   questioned    in   the        assessment    year       under
consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_23">8.   On the other hand, the learned DR submitted that
for granting depreciation, the assessee shall be owner
of the block of assets and should be used the assets for
the purpose of business. He pointed out that in AY
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                    8                    I.T.A. No. 1016/Hyd/2010</span>
                                                                    Lanconet Ltd.
</p><p id="p_24">                                                       ====================

under consideration the          assessee has not carried out
any    business     by   using     the      assets.      Being      so,     the
assessee is not entitled for depreciation.
</p>
<p id="p_25">9.     We have heard the arguments of both the parties
and    perused    the    record.       As   per    the      provisions        of
<a href="/doc/179995/" id="a_10">section 32</a>, to claim depreciation, the assessee shall be
the owner of the assets and put into use the assets
during the relevant assessment year. The contention of
the revenue is that in the year under consideration the
assessee has not carried out any business and the
assets were not put to use. On the contrary, the
learned counsel submitted that the assets have already
put into use, however, the assessee has not placed any
evidence before us to show that the assets were used
for the purpose of business in the assessment year
under consideration. Being so, the judgments relied
upon by the assessee are not of any help to the
assessee's case, as the primary condition for putting
the assets to use was not satisfied.
</p>

<p id="p_26">10.    The learned counsel for the assessee strongly
placed reliance on the orders of the Tribunal in the
case   of Natco      Exports       and Coromandal Bio                     Tech
Industries (I) Ltd. cited supra. These decisions are
delivered on different set of facts, as in these cases the
Tribunal held that the assets which are forming part of
the block assets were entitled for depreciation, though,
it was not used in the relevant assessment year as the
business of the assessee was continued during the
relevant period and block assets consisting during that
period   entitled    for   depreciation           in    its    entirety       at
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                   9                 I.T.A. No. 1016/Hyd/2010</span>
                                                                Lanconet Ltd.
</p><p id="p_27">                                                   ====================

prescribed rate. In the instant case, we are concerned
with    whether    the   assets       used   for    the    purpose        of
business or not ? Most particularly in the assessment
year consideration, the assessee itself has not carried
out any business and no evidence has been placed
before     us   that   the   assessee        has    carried      on     the
business. The financial statement filed by the assessee
for FY 2002-03 relevant to AY 2003-04 also shows no
commercial activities and the Directors report also
confirmed the same fact. Though the assessee owned
the assets, it was not actually used               and there is not
even passive usage of the assets on which the assessee
claimed      depreciation.    Therefore,           we     dismiss       the
grounds of appeal raised by the assessee in this regard
and uphold the order of the CIT(A) in confirming the
order of the Assessing Officer in disallowing loss of Rs.
1,06,18,444/- including depreciation loss.
