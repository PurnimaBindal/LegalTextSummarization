     Constitution of  India, 1950-Arts	16, 46 and 335-Scope
of.
     Scheduled Casters	and  Scheduled	Tribes-If  a  caste-
Exemption granted from passing special departmental tests-If
violative of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_1">Art. 16.</a>



HEADNOTE:
     Rule 13(a)	 of the	 Kerala State  Subordinate  Services
Rules 1958,  provides that  no person  shall be eligible for
appointment to	any service  or any post unless he possessed
such special  qualifications and  has  passed  such  special
tests as  may be  prescribed in	 that behalf  in the Special
Rules.
     For promotion  of a  lower division  clerk to  the next
higher post  of upper division clerk, the Government made it
obligatory for	an employee to pass the special departmental
tests. Rule  13A which	was introduced	sometime later, gave
temporaury exemption from passing the departmental tests for
a period  of two  years. The  rule  also  provided  that  an
employee who  did not  pass the	 unified departmental  tests
within the period of two years from the date of introduction
of the	test would be reverted to the lower post and further
said that  he shall  not again	be eligible  for appointment
under this  rule. Proviso  2 to	 this  rule  gave  temporary
exemption of  two years	 in the case of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  candidates. A	 Harijan Welfare Association
represented to	the State  Government that a large number of
Harijan employees in the State service were facing immediate
reversion as  a result	of  this  rule	and  requuested	 the
Government to grant exemption in respect of Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes employees	 from passing the obligatory
departmental tests  for a period of two years with immediate
effect. Accordingly,  the State	 Government introduced	rule
13AA giving  further  exemption	 of  two  years	 to  members
belonging to  Scheduled Tribes	and Scheduled  Castes in the
service from  passing the  tests referred  to in r. 13 or r.
13A
     Respondent no.  1 passed the special tests in November,
1971. The  other respondents  belonging to  Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes were promoted as Upper Division Clerks
even  though  they  had	 not  passed  the  prescribed  tests
Respondent no.	1 who  was not promoted in spite of the fact
that he had passed the urequisite tests moved the High Court
under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_2">Art.  226</a> of  the Constitution  seeking a	 declaration
that r.	 13AA under  which exemption had been granted to the
other respondents  in the  matter of promotion was violative
of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_3">Art.	 16</a> of	the Constitution. The High Court struck down
the imugned rule as violative of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_4">Art. 16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_5">(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_6">Art.
335</a> of the Constitution.
     Allowing the State's appeal to this Court,
     [Per majority,  Ray C.J.,	Mathew, Beg Krishna Iyer, S.

^
     HELD: (Per	 Ray C.J.)  The classification	of employees
belonging to  Scheduled	 Castes	 and  Scheduled	 Tribes	 for
allowing them  an extended  period  of two years for passing
the special  tests for	promotion is  a just  and reasonable
classification	haring	rational  nexus	 to  the  object  of
providing equal	 opportunity for  all  citizens	 in  matters
relating to  employment or  appointment to  public  offices.
[930H]
907
     (1) Articles  14, 15  and 16  form part  of a string of
constitutionally guaranteed  rights. These rights supplement
each other.  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_7">Article 16</a>	 is  an	 incident  of  guarantee  of
equality contained  in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_8">Art.  14.</a> Both  Articles 14 and 16(1)
permit reasonable  classification  having  a  nexus  to	 the
objects to  be achieved.  Under	 <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_9">Art.  16</a>  there  can  be  a
reasonable  classification   of	 the  employees	 in  matters
relating to employment or appointment. [926F]
     State of  Gujarat and  Anr. etc.  v. Shri	Ambica Mills
Ltd. Ahmedabad etc. A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1300, referred to.
     (2) Equality is violated if it rests on an unreasonable
basis. The  concept of	equality has  an inherent limitation
arising	 from	the  very   nature  of	 the  constitutional
guarantee.  Those   who	 are   similarly  circumstanced	 are
entitled to equal treatment. Classification is to be founded
on substantial differences which distinguish persons grouped
together  from	those  left  out  of  the  groups  and	such
differential  attributes  must	bear  a	 just  and  rational
relation to the object sought to be achieved. [927 C]
     (3) If  there is  a rational  classification consistent
with the  purpose for  which  such  classification  is	made
equality is  not violated.  The categories of classification
for purposes  of  promotion  can  never	 be  closed  on	 the
contention that	 they are  all members	of the same cadre in
service.  If   classification	is   made   on	 educational
qualifications	 for	purposes   of	 promotion   or	  if
classification is  made on  the ground	that the persons are
not similarly  circumstanced in	 regard to  their entry into
employment such classification can be justified. [927E-F]
     C. V.  Rajendran v. Union of India [1968] 1 S.C.R. 721,
followed.
     (4) Art  1.(1) does not bar a reasonable classification
of employees  or reasonable tests for their selection. There
is no  denial of  equality of  opportunity unless the person
who complains  of discrimination  is equally  situated	with
the.  person  or  persons  who	are  alleged  to  have	been
favoured. [928 <a href="/doc/229683/" id="a_10">F]
     State of  Mysore v. V. P. Narasinga Rao</a> [1968] 1 S.C.R.
407, referred to.
     (5)  Under	  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_11">Art.	16(1)</a>  equality	 of  opportunity  of
employment means  equality as  between members	of the	same
class of  employees and	 not equality  between.	 members  of
separate, independent  class.  The  present  case  does	 not
create separate avenues of promotion for these persons. [928

     All  India	  Station  Masters   and  Assistant  Station
Masters' Association  v. General  Manager, Central  Railways</a>
[1960] 2 S.C.R. 311, referred to.
     (6) The  Legislature understands  and  appreciates	 the
needs of  its own  people that	its  laws  are	directed  to
problems  made	 manifest  by	experience  and	  that	 its
discriminations are based upon adequate grounds. The rule of
classification is not a natural and logical corollary of the
rule  of  equality,  but  the  rule  of	 differentiation  is
inherent in  the concept  of equality. Equality means parity
of treatment  under parity  of conditions. Equality does not
connote absolute  equality. A classification, in order to be
constitutional,	 must	rest  upon   distinctions  that	 are
substantial and	 not merely illusory. The test is whether it
has  a	 reasonable  basis   free  from	  artificiality	 and
arbitrariness embracing	 all  and  omitting  none  naturally
falling into that category. [929 <a href="/doc/387531/" id="a_13">D]
     Govind Dattatray Kelkar v. Chief Controller of Imports</a>,
[1967] 2  S.C.R. 29;  <a href="/doc/650814/" id="a_14">Ganga Ram	 v. Union  of India</a> [1970] 1
S.C.C. 377  and Roshan	Lal Tandon v Union of India [1968] I
S.C.R. 185, referred to.
     (7) The  relevant touchstone of validity is to find out
whether	  the	 rule	of   preference	  secures   adequate
representation for  the unrepresented  backward community or
goes beyond it. [930 G]
     (8) The  historical background  of the  rules justifies
the classification  of the personnel of the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes  for  the	 purpose  of  granting	them
exemption from	special tests  with a  view to ensuring them
the
908
equality of  treatment and  equal opportunity  in matters of
employment having  regard to  their backwardness  and under-
representation in the employment of he State. [931 C]
     (9) (a)  The Constitution	makes  a  classification  of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in numerous provisions
namely Arts. 46, 335, 338 and 341 and gives a mandate to the
State to  accord special or favoured treatment to them. [931
D]
     (b) The  impugned rule  and the  orders are  related to
this   constitutional	mandate.   Without   providing	 for
relaxation of  special tests for a temporary period it would
not have  been possible	 to give  adequate promotion  to the
Lower Division	Clerks belonging to the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  to the posts of Upper Division Clerks. The
temporary relaxation of test qualification made in favour of
the Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  is warranted by
their inadequate  representation in  the services  and their
overall backwardness.  The classification  of the members of
the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes made under r. 13AA
is within  the purview	of constitutional mandate under <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_15">Art.
335</a> in consideration of their claims to redress imbalance in
public service and to bring, about parity in the communities
in the. public services. [931H; 932A-B]
     (10) Scheduled  Castes and	 Scheduled Tribes  are not a
caste within the ordinary meaning of castes. [932 <a href="/doc/1725052/" id="a_16">E]
     Bhaiyalal v.  Harikishan Singh and Ors</a>. [1965] 2 S.C.R.
877, referred to
     (11)(a) our Constitution aims at equality of status and
opportunity  for   all	citizens  including  those  who	 are
socially,  economically	  and  educationally  backward.	 The
claims of  members  of	backward  classes  require  adequate
representation	in  legislative	 and  executive	 bodies.  If
members of  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes who	 are
said by	 this Court  to be  backward classes,  can  maintain
minimum necessary  requirement of administrative efficiency,
not only  representation but also preference may be given to
them to enforce equality and to eliminate inequality. [932G-
H]
     (b) Equality  of opportunity for unequals can only mean
aggravation of	inequality. Equality  of opportunity  admits
discrimination	with  reason  and  prohibits  discrimination
without reason. Preferential representation for the backward
classes	 in  services  with  due  regard  to  administrative
efficiency is  a permissible object and backward classes are
a rational  classification recognised  by the  Constitution.
Therefore, differential	 treatment in standards of selection
is within the concept of equality. [933B-C]
     (c) The  rule in  the present  case does not impair the
test of efficiency in administration inasmuch a., members of
Scheduled Castes and Tribes who are promoted have to acquire
the qualification  of passing  the test. The only relaxation
which is  done in  their case  is that	they are granted two
years more  time than  others to  acquire the qualification.
[933 D]
     (12) (a)  Equal protection of laws necessarily involves
classification. The  validity of  the classification must be
adjusted with reference to the purpose of the law. [933 G]
     (b) The classification in the present case is justified
because the  purpose of	 classification is to enable members
of  Scheduled	Castes	and   Scheduled	  Tribes   to	find
representation by  promotion to	 a limited  extent From	 the
point of  view of  time a differential treatment is given to
members of  Scheduled Castes  and Tribes  for the purpose of
giving them equality consistent with efficiency. [933 H]
     (13) The  High Court was wrong in basing its conclusion
that the result of application of the impeached rule and the
orders is  excessive and  exorbitant. The promotions made in
services as a whole are nowhere near 50% of the total number
of posts.  It is  correct that	r. 13AA	 and the  orders are
meant to implement not only the direction under <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_17">Art. 335</a> but
also the directive principle under <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_18">Art. 46.</a> [932C-D]
909
     Per Mathew, J.
     (1) The concept of equality of opportunity is an aspect
of the	more comprehensive  notion of  equality. The idea of
equality has  different shades	of meaning and connotations.
It has many facets and implications. [948 A]
     (2) The  notion of	 equality of opportunity has meaning
only when  a limited  number of posts as in the present case
should be allocated on grounds which do not a priori exclude
any section  of citizens  of those  that desire it. A priori
exclusion  means  exclusion  on	 grounds  other	 than  those
appropriate or rational for the good in question. The notion
requires not  merely that  there should be no exclusion from
access on  grounds other  than those appropriate or rational
for  the   good	 in  question  but  the	 grounds  considered
appropriate for	 the good  should themselves  be  such	that
people from  all sections of society have an equal chance of
satisfying them. [950A-B]
     (3) To  give equality  of opportunity for employment to
the members  of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it is
necessary to  take note	 of their  social,  educational	 and
economic environment.  Not only	 is the	 Directive Principle
embodied in  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_19">Art. 46</a>  binding on the law-maker as ordinarily
understood but	it should  equally inform and illuminate the
approach of  the Court when it makes a decision as the Court
also is	 `State' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_20">Art. 12</a> and makes law
even though interstitially. [951 E]
     His Holiness  Kesavananda	Bharati	 Sripadagalayaru  v.
State of  Kerala and  Another, etc.  [1973] Supp.  S.C.R. 1,
referred to.
     (4) Equality  of opportunity  is not simply a matter of
legal equality.	 Its existence	depends not  merely  on	 the
absence of  disabilities but  on the  presence of abilities.
[951 F]
     (5) The  guarantee of  equality before  the law  or the
equal opportunity in matters of employment is a guarantee of
something more	than what is required by formal equality. It
implies differential  treatment of  persons who are unequal.
Egalitarian principle  has, therefore.	enhanced the growing
belief that  Government has an affirmative duty to eliminate
inequalities and  to provide  opportunities for the exercise
of human rights and claims. [951 H]
     (6) Fundamental  Rights as	 enacted in  Part III of the
Constitution are,  by and  large,  essentially	negative  in
character. They	 mark off  a world  it which time Government
should have  no jurisdiction.  In this realm, it was assumed
that a citizen has no claim upon Government except to be let
alone.[952 A]
     (7)(a) But	 the language  of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_21">Art.	16(1)</a> is  in  marked
contrast with  that of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_22">Art. 14.</a> Whereas the accent in Art 14
is on  the injunction  that the	 State shall not deny to any
person equality	 before the  law or  the equal protection of
the laws,  that is, on the negative character of the duty of
the State,  the emphasis  in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_23">Art.  16(1)</a> is on the mandatory
aspect. [952 B]
     (b) If  equality of  opportunity guaranteed  under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_24">Art.
16(1)</a> means  effective material equality, then <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_25">Art. 16(4)</a> is
not an	exception to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_26">Art. 16(1).</a> It is only all emphatic way
of putting the extent in which equality of opportunity could
be carried namely even upto the point of making reservation.
[956]
     (c) <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_27">Art. 16(1)</a> is only a part of a comprehensive scheme
to ensure  equality in all spheres. It is an instance of the
application of	the larger. concept of equaliy under the law
embodied in  Arts. 14  and  15.	 <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_28">Article  16(1)</a>	 permits  of
classification	just   as  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_29">Art.	  14</a>  does.   But,  by	 the
classification, there can be no discrimination on the ground
only of	 race, caste  and other	 factor	 mentioned  in	<a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_30">Art.
16(2).</a> [951 F]

910
     (d) The  word `caste'  in <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_33">Art.  16(2)</a> does	 not include
Scheduled Castes.  The definition  of Scheduled	 Castes'  in
<a href="/doc/382320/" id="a_34">Art. 366(24)</a>  shows that it is by virtue of the notification
of the	President that the Scheduled Castes come into being.
Though the  members of	the Scheduled  Castes are drawn from
castes, races  or tribes, they attain a new status by virtue
of  the	 Presidential  notification.  Moreover,	 though	 the
members of  tribe might	 be included  in  Scheduled  Castes,
tribe as such is not mentioned in <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_35">Article 16(2).</a> [957 A]
     (e) <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_36">Article  16(1)</a> and  Art 16(2)	do not	prohibit the
prescription of	 a reasonable  qualification for appointment
or for	promotion. Any	provision as  to  qualification	 for
employment or appointment to are office reasonably fixed and
applicable to  all would  be consistent with the doctrine of
equality of opportunity under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_37">Art. 16(1).</a> [957 <a href="/doc/1074353/" id="a_38">E]
     The General  Manager, Southern  Railway  v.  Rangachari</a>
[1962] 3.S.C.R. 586 referred to
     (8) Today,	 the sense  that Government  has affirmative
responsibility	for  elimination  of  inequalities,  social,
economic or  otherwise, is  one of  the dominant  forces  in
constitutional law. [952 E]
     (9) The  concept of  equality of opportunity in matters
of  employment	 is  wide   enough  to	 include  within  it
compensatory measures  to put  the members  of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes on par with the members of other
communities which  would enable	 them to  get their share of
representation in public service. [954 E]
     (10) If  reservation is necessary either at the initial
stage or  at the stage of promotion or at both to ensure for
the members  of the  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes
equality of  opportunity in  the matter of employment. there
is no reason why that is not permissible under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_39">Art. 16(1)</a> as
that alone  might put  them on	a parity  with	the  forward
communities in	the matter  of achieving  the  result  which
equality of opportunity would produce. Equality of result is
the test of equality of opportunity. [954 G-H]
     (11) The State can adopt any measure which would ensure
the adequate representation in public service of the members
of the	Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and justify it
as a  compensatory measure to ensure equality of opportunity
provided the  measure does not dispense with the acquisition
of  the	  minimum  basic  qualification	 necessary  for	 the
efficiency of administration.[956 D]
     (12) It  is a mistake to assume a priori that there can
be no classification within a class, say, the Lower Division
Clerks. If there are intelligible differentia which separate
a group within that class from the rest and that differentia
have nexus  with the  object of	 classification, there is no
objection to a further classification within the class. [957

Kashmir v.  Triloki Nath  Khosa &amp; others</a> [1974] 1 S.C.R. 771
held inapplicable.
     (13) In the instant case Rule 13AA has been enacted not
with the  idea of  dispensing with the minimum qualification
required for  promotion to  a higher  category or class, but
only to give enough breathing space to enable the members of
Seheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes to  acquire it.	 The
purpose of  the classification	made in r. 13AA is to enable
them to have their due claim of representation in the higher
category without  sacrificing the efficiency implicit in the
passing of the test. [958 B]
     (14)  The	 classification	 made	in  r.	13AA  has  a
reasonable nexus  with the  purpose of the law. Rule 13AA is
not intended  to give  permanent exemption to the members of
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes from passing the test
but only  reasonable time  to enable  to them to do so. That
the power  is liable  to be abused is no reason to hold that
the rule itself is bad. [958 E]
911
Per Beg J.
     The only ground given by the High Court for refusing to
give the  benefits of  the impugned  rules and orders to the
backward class	Government servants,  that they fall outside
the  purview  of  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_43">Art.	16(4)</a>  was  not	 substantiated.	 The
respondent has	not discharged	the  burden  establishing  a
constitutionally  unwarranted  discrimination  against	him.
[963 H]
      (1) When citizens are already employed in a particular
  grade as government servant considerations relating to the
       sources from which they were drawn lose much of their
    importance. Neither as members of a single class nor for
 purposes of equality of opportunity which is to be afforded
  to this class does the fact that some of them also members
  of economically and socially backward class continue to be
material or, even relevant. Their entry into the me relevant
     class as others must be deemed to indicate that they no
   longer suffer from the handicaps of a backward class. For
   purposes of Government service the source from which they
   are drawn should cease to matter. As Government servants.
they would form only one class for the purpose of promotion.
						    [960A-B]
     (2) (a)  The specified  and express mode of realisation
of the	objects contained  in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_44">Art.  16(4</a>), must	 exclude the
possibility of	the methods  which could be implied and read
into  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_45">Art.  16(1)</a>  for	securing  them	in  this  field	 the
applicable  maxim   being  `expressio	unius  est  exclusio
alterius". [960 H]
     (2) (b) The purpose of equality of opportunity by means
of tests  is only  to ensure  a fair competition in securing
posts and  promotions in  Government service,  and  not	 the
removal of  causes for	unequal performances in competitions
for these posts or promotions. [960 H]
     (3)  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_46">Article   16(4)</a>  is	designed  to  reconcile	 the
conflicting pulls  of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_47">Art.  16 (1)</a> representing the dynamics
of justice  conceived of  as equality  in  conditions  under
which candidates  actually compete  for posts  in Government
service and  of Arts. 46 and 355 embodying the duties of the
State  to   promote  the   interests  of   the	economically
educationally and  socially backward  so as  to release them
from the  clutches of  social injustice. These encroachments
on the	field of  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_48">Art. 16(1)</a>  can only	be permitted  to the
extent they  are warraned  by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_49">Art.  16(4).</a> To  read  broader
concepts of  social justice and equality into <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_50">Art. 16(1)</a> may
stultify this provision and make <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_51">Art. 16(4)</a> otiose. [961C-D]
     (4) It  would be  dangerous to  extend  the  limits  of
protection  against   the  operation  of  the  principle  of
equality of  opportunity in  this field	 beyond its  express
constitutional authorisation by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_52">Art. 16(4).</a> [959 G]
     (5) But  if the  impugned rules  and  orders  could  be
viewed as  an implementation  of a  policy of  qualified  or
partial or  conditional reservation  which could satisfy the
requirements of	 substantial equality  in keeping  with <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_53">Art.
335</a> and meet the demands of equality and justice looked from
the point of view of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_54">Art. 46</a> of the Constitution, they could
also be justified under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_55">Art. 16(4)</a> of the Constitution. [963
B-C]
     (6) Though	 the respondent was not promoted in spite of
passing the  efficiency	 test  earlier	the  backward  class
employees  who	 were  given   preference  over	  him,	were
discharging  their   duties  in	  the  higher	grade  quite
satisfactorily and  were his  seniors in service. Taking and
passing of  a written  test earlier  than  another  employee
could not  be the sole factor to consider in deciding upon a
claim to  superiority or  to preference	 on grounds of merit
and efficiency for promotion as a government servant. [962A-
B]
     (7) The  effect of	 the relaxation	 is that  a backward
class employee	continues in  the  post	 temporarily  for  a
longer period before being either confirmed or reverted. For
this period,  the post	remains reserved for him. If he does
not satisfy  the efficiency  tests even	 within the extended
period he  has to  revert to  the lower	 grade. If  he	does
satisfy the  special  efficiency  tests.  in  this  extended
period. he is confirmed in the class of promotees into which
he obtained  entry because  of a  reservation.	One  of	 the
dictionary meanings of the word
912
`reserve' is  "to keep	back or hold over to a later time or
place for  further treatment  etc." The	 result of  the rule
therefore is a kind of reservation.
     (8)  If  reservation  of  posts  under  Art  16(4)	 for
employees  of	backward  classes   could  include  complete
reservation of higher posts to which they could he promoted,
there is no reason why it could not be partial or for a part
of the	duration  of  service  and  hedged  round  with	 the
condition that	a temporary.  promotion would  operate as  a
complete and  confirmed	 promotion  only  if  the  temporary
promotee satisfies some tests within a given time. [963 A]
     In the  instant cases  apart from	the fact  that it is
only  one   of	partial	  or   temporary   and	 conditional
reservation, it	 is disputed here that the favoured class of
employees constituted  more than  50% of the total number of
Governments servants  of this  class (Clerks) if the overall
position is  taken into account. Furthermore, a large number
of  temporary	promotions  of	 backward  class  Government
servants of  this grade	 had taken  place  in  1972  in	 the
Department because promotions of this class of employees had
been held  up in the past due to want of necessary provision
in the	rules. The totality of facts of this case to want of
necessary provision  in the  rules. The totality of facts of
this case  is distinguishable in their effects from those in
<a href="/doc/1466728/" id="a_56">T. Devadasan  v. Union of India</a> [1964] 4 S.C.R. 680 and <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_57">M.R.
Balaji &amp; Ors. v. State of Mysore</a> [1963] Suppl. 1 S.C.R. 439.
[963 D-F]
     Per Krishna Iyer. J.
     (1) The Indian Constitution is a great social document,
almost revolutionary  in its aim of transforming a medieval,
hierarchical society  into a  modern, egalitarian democracy.
Its provisions	can be	comprehended  only  by	a  specious,
social-science	approach,   not	 by   pedantic,	 traditional
legalism. [964 E]
     (2) (a)  The Preamble to the Constitution silhouettes a
'justice-oriented' community.  The Directive  Principles  of
State Policy, enjoin on the State the promotion with special
care the  educational and  economic interests  of the weaker
sections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and protect them from social
injustice. To neglect this obligation is to play truant with
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_58">Art. 46.</a>  Economic  interests  of  a  group-as	also  social
justice to  it-are tied	 up with  its place  in the services
under the State. [974 A-B]
     (b) The unanimous opinion of this Court in Keshavananda
Bharti's case  is  that	 the  Court  must  wisely  read	 the
collective  Directive	Principles  of	 Part  IV  into	 the
individual fundamental	rights of  Part	 III,  neither	part
being superior to the other. In this case, the supplementary
theory,	 treating   both  Parts	  as   fundamental,   gained
supremacy. [977 A]
     (c) The upshot is that <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_59">Art. 46</a> has to be given emphatic
expression while  interpreting <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_60">Art.  16(1)</a> and	<a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_61">(2).</a>  Indeed
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_62">Art. 335</a>  is more  specific and	 cannot be  brushed aside or
truncated in  the operational  ambit vis  a vis Arts. 16 (1)
and (2) without hubristic aberration. [977 F-G]
     (3) The  conclusions  that	 could	be  drawn  from	 the
provisions of  the Constitution	 are: (1)  The	Constitution
itself demarcates harijans from others. (2) This is based on
the  stark   backwardness  of	this  bottom  layer  of	 the
community. (3)	The differentiation  has been  made to cover
specifically the  area of  appointments to  posts under	 the
State. (4)  The twin objects blended into one, are claims of
harijans to  be considered in such posts and the maintenance
of  administrative   efficiency.  (5)  The  State  has	been
obligated to  promote the economic interests of harijans and
like backward  classes, Arts.  46 and  335 being a testament
and Arts.  14 to  16 being  the tool-kit.  To blink  at this
panchsheel is to be unjust to the Constitution. [975 B-C]
     (4) To  relax on  basic qualifications is to compromise
with minimum  administrative efficiency;  to relent,  for  a
time,  on  additional  test  qualifications  as	 to  take  a
calculated but	controlled risk, assured of a basic standard
of  performance;  to  encourage	 the  possession  of  higher
excellence is to upgrade the
913
efficiency status  of the  public servant and eventually, of
the department.	 This  is  the	sense  and  essence  of	 the
situation arising in the present case, viewed from the angle
of administrative requirements or fair employment criteria.
     [967 C-D]
     (5) Efficiency  means, in terms of good government, not
marks in  examinations only,  but responsible and responsive
service to the people. [976 C]
     (6)(a) A  bare reading  of Arts. 341 and 342 brings out
the quintessential  concept that  the Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Tribes are  no castes  in the  Hindu fold  but an amalgam of
castes, races,	groups, tribes, communities or parts thereof
found on  investigation to  be the  lowliest and  in need of
massive State  aid and	notified as  such by  the President.
[977 H]
     (b) The discerning sense of the Indian Corpus Juris has
generally regarded  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes,
not as	a caste	 but as	 a large backward group deserving of
societal compassion. [978 B]
     (7) (a)  Given two	 alternative understandings  of	 the
relevants sub-Articles	[Arts. 16(1) and (2)] the Court must
so  interpret	the  language	as  to	 remove	 that	ugly
'inferiority' complex  which  has  done	 genetic  damage  to
Indian polity  and thereby  suppress the  malady and advance
the remedy,  informed by  sociology and social anthropology.
The touch-stone	 is  that  functional  democracy  postulates
participation  by  all	sections  of  the  people  and	fair
representation	in   administration  is	 an  index  of	such
participation. [971 E-F]
     (b) Clause	 (4) of	 <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_63">Art. 16</a>  if closely examined, is an
illustration of	 constitutionally sanctified classification.
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_64">Art. 16(4)</a> need not be a saving clause but put in due to the
over anxiety  of the  draftsman to make matters clear beyond
possibility of doubt. [978 H]
     (c)  Reservation	confers	 pro   tanto  monopoly,	 but
classification grants  under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_65">Art.  16(1)</a> ordinarily a lesser
order of  advantage. The  former is  more rigid,  the latter
more flexible,	although they  may overlap  sometimes.	<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_66">Art.
16(4)</a> covers  all backward  classes; but to earn the benefit
of grouping  under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_67">Art.	 16(1)</a> based on <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_68">Art. 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_69">335</a>, the
twin considerations  of terrible  backwardness of  the	type
harijans   endure   and	  maintenance	of   adminsistrative
efficiency must be satisfied. [979 C-D]
     (d) The  fact that	 better educational prescription for
promotion posts have been upheld by this Court does not rule
out other  resonable differentia  having a  nexus  with	 the
object.	 The  true  test  is  what  is	the  object  of	 the
classification	and  is	 it  permissible?  Further,  is	 the
differentia sound and substantial and clearly related to the
approved object? [980 H]
     (e) The  genius of	 Arts. 14  to  16  consists  not  in
literal	 equality   but	 in   progressive   elimination	  of
pronounced inequality.	To treat  sharply dissimilar persons
equally is  subtle injustice.  Equal opportunity  is a hope,
not a menace. [981 B]
     In	 the  present  case  the  economic  advancement	 and
promotion of the claims of the grossly under-represented and
pathetically  neglected	  classes,  otherwise  described  as
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, consistently with the
maintenance of	administrative	efficiency  is	the  object,
constitutionally  sanctioned   by  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_70">Art.	  46</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_71">335</a>,	 and
reasonably accommodated	 in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_72">Art.  16(1).</a> The  differentia so
loudly obtrusive,  is the  dismal social milieu of harijans.
This has  a rational  relation to  the object set out above.
[981 C]
     (8) It  is a  statistically proved	 social	 reality  in
India that  the depressed  employment position of harijan is
the master  problem in	the battle  against  generations  of
retardations and  reservation and  other solutions have made
no significant impact on their employment in public service.
In such an unjust situation, to maintain mechanical equality
is to  prepetuate actual  inequality. Relaxation  of 'tests'
qualification at the floor level of clerical posts is a part
of this	 multiform  strategy  to  establish  broader  though
seemingly differential equality. [983 F]
914
Per Fazal Ali, J.
     Rule 13AA is a valid piece of statutory provision which
is fully  justified under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_73">Art. 16(1)</a> of the Constitution and
does not fall within the purview of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_74">Art. 16(4).</a> [1007 F]
     (1)(a)  Equality  of  opportunity	would  mean  a	fair
opportunity not	 only to one section or the other but to all
sections for  removing the handicaps if a particular section
of the	society suffers	 from the same. What <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_75">Art. 14</a> or <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_76">Art.
16</a> forbids  is hostile	discrimination	and  not  reasonable
classification. In other words the idea of classification is
implicit in  the concept  of equality because equality means
equality to  all and not merely to the advanced and educated
sections of the society. [992 H; 993 B]
     (b) It follows that in order to provide the equality of
opportunity to	all citizens,  every class  of citizens must
have a	sense of  equal	 participation	in  building  up  an
egalitarian society. [993 C]
     (c) The  only manner in which the objective of equality
as enshrined  in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_77">Art.  14</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_78">16</a> can be achieved is to boost
up  the	  backward  classes   by  giving  them	concessions,
relaxations,  facilities,   removing  handicaps	 and  making
suitable  reservations	so  that  the  weaker  sections	 may
compete with  the more	advanced and  in due  course  become
equals and backwardness is banished for ever. [993 D]
     (2)(a) There  is complete unanimity of judicial opinion
of  this   Court  that	the  Directive	Principles  and	 the
Fundamental Rights  should be construed in harmony with each
other and  every attempt  should be  made by  the  Court  to
resolve apparent inconsistency. [993 H]
     (b) The  Directive	 Principles  contained	in  Part  IV
constitute the	stairs	to  climb  the	high  edifice  of  a
socialistic State  and the  Fundamental Rights are the means
through which one can reach the top of the edifice. [993 H]
     In Re  The Kerala	Education Bill.	 1957, [1959] S.C.R.
995; <a href="/doc/93885/" id="a_79">Mohd.  Hanif Quareshi  &amp; Others  v. The State of Bihar</a>,

Bhavan Boarding	 and Lodging,  Bangalore  v.  The  State  of

Keshavananda Bharati  Sripadagalvaru v.	 State of Kerala and
Anr</a>., [1973] 4 S.C.C. 225, referred to.
     (c)  The  Directive  Principles  form  the	 fundamental
feature and  the social conscience of the Constitution which
enjoins	 upon	the  State   to	 implement  these  Directive
Principles. The	 Directives, thus  provide the	policy,	 the
guidelines and	the end	 of socio-economic freedom and Arts.
14 and	16 are	the means to implement the policy to achieve
the ends  sought to be promoted by the Directive Principles.
So far as the Court are concerned where there is no apparent
inconsistency between  the Directive Principles contained in
Part IV	 and the  Fundamental Rights  mentioned in Part III,
there is  no difficulty in putting a harmonious construction
which advances the object of the Constitution. [996 E-F]
     (3)(a) The	 word 'caste' appearing after 'Scheduled' is
really a  misnomer and has been used only for the purpose of
identifying this  particular class  of citizens	 which has a
special history	 of several  hundred years  behind  it.	 The
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes have  been a special
class of  citizens who	have been  so included and described
that they  have come  to be  identified as the most backward
classes of citizens of this country. [997 A-B]
     (b) Properly  analysed, <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_83">Art.  46</a> contains	a mandate to
the State  to take  special care  for  the  educational	 and
economic interests  of the weaker sections of the people and
as illustrations  of the  persons who  constitute the weaker
sections the  provision	 expressly  mentions  the  Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. [997 F]
     (c) A combined reading of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_84">Art. 46</a> and clauses 24 and 25
of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_85">Art.	 366</a> clearly shows that the members of the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled
915
Tribes must  be presumed  to be backward classes of citizens
particularly when  the Constitution gives the example of the
Scheduled Castes  and the  Scheduled  Tribes  as  being	 the
weaker sections of the society. [997 G]
     (d) The  members of the Scheduled Castes and the Tribes
have been  given a  special status  in the  Constitution and
they constitute	 a  class  by  themselves.  That  being	 the
position it follows that they do not fall within the purview
of  <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_86">Art.   16(2)</a>  of   the  Constitution   which   prohibits
discrimination between the members of the same caste. If the
members of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are
not castes  then it  is open to the State to make reasonable
classification in  order to advance or lift these classes so
that they  may be  able to  be properly	 represented in	 the
services under the State. [998 A-B]
     (4)(a) <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_87">Art.  16</a> is	 merely an  incident of	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_88">Art. 14</a> and
both these articles form a part of the common system seeking
to achieve the same end. [998 <a href="/doc/1264252/" id="a_89">D]

     (d) Equality  of opportunity for all citizens envisaged
in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_102">Art.	 16(1)</a> implies	that opportunity  must be  given not
only to	 a particular section of the society or a particular
class of  citizens who	may be	advanced or  otherwise	more
affluent but  to  all  classes	of  citizens.  This  can  be
achieved by making a reasonable classification so that every
class of  citizens is  duly represented in the service which
will enable  equality of  opportunity to  all citizens.	 The
classification must,  however, be reasonable and must fulfil
the following conditions. [1000 G]
     (i) It  must have a rational basis; (ii) It must have a
close nexus  with the object sought to be achieved and (iii)
It should  not select  any person for hostile discrimination
at the cost of others. [1000 H]
     (5) (a)  If the  promotees do  not belong to a caste as
contemplated by	 <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_103">Art. 16(2)</a> then they do not fall within the
mischief of  <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_104">Art.  16(2)</a>  at  all.  Thus  the  case  of	 the
promotees squarely  falls within  the four-corners  of	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_105">Art.
16(1)</a>  and   can  be   justified  as   based  on  reasonable
classification. [1002 B]
     (b) Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_106">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution cannot be
read in	 isolation but	has to be read as part and parcel of

     (c) Clause	 (4) of	 <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_109">Art. 16</a> is not an exception of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_110">Art.
14</a> in the sense that whatever classification can be made can
be done	 only through  clause (4)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_111">Art. 16.</a> Clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_112">Art. 16</a>, however, is an explanation containing an exhaustive
and exclusive  provision regarding  reservation which is one
of the	forms of  classification. Thus clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_113">Art. 16</a>
deals exclusively  with reservation  and not  other forms of
classification which  can be  made under  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_114">Art. 16(1)</a> itself.
Since  clause	(4)  is	  a  special   provision   regarding
reservation, it	 can safely  be held  that it overrides <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_115">Art.
16(1)</a> to  that extent  and no  reservation can be made under
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_116">Art. 16(1).</a> [1002 G-H]

clause covers the whole field of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_119">Art. 16.</a> Dissenting view of

S.C.R. 680, applied.
     (e) Clause	 4 of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_121">Art. 16</a>	contains express  provisions
empowering the	State to make reservations in suitable cases
provided the following conditions are satisfied:
     (i) That  the class  for which reservation is made must
be socially and educationally backward.
     (ii) That	the class  for which  reservation is made is
not adequately	represented in the services under the State.
[1004 E]
     (iii) The reservation should not be too excessive so as
to destroy the very concept of equality, and [1005 A]
     (iv) Reservation  should not  be made  at the  cost  of
efficiency. [1006 C]
     (6) In  the instant  case what Rule 13AA does is merely
to authorise the Government to exempt for a specified period
any member  or members	of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled
Tribes from passing the test referred to in Rule 13 and Rule
13A. The  rule does  not  give	complete  licence.  A  Lower
Division Clerk who is a member of the Scheduled Caste or the
Scheduled Tribe	 could not  be promoted	 without passing any
test at	 all so	 as to	destroy the  concept of equality. It
merely gives  a special concession or a temporary relaxation
to cockward class of citizens in order to lift them, advance
them and  enable them  to compete with the stronger sections
of the	society. Thus,	the basis of the rule is undoubtedly
both rational  and  reasonable.	 The  rule  does  not  grant
complete exemption  to the  promotees from passing the test.
It only	 provides for  grant of	 extension of time to enable
them to	 clear the  test. It  cannot, therefore be held that
the State's  action in	incorporating rule  13AA. in any way
violates the  mandate contained	 in <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_122">Art. 335.</a> The concession
given in  Rule 13AA  amounts to	 a reasonable classification
which can  be made  under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_123">Art.	16(1)</a> and does not amount to
the  selection	 of  the   respondent  no.   1	for  hostile
discrimination so  as to  be violative	of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_124">Art. 16(1)</a> of the
Constitution. Respondent no. 1 passed the test necessary for
promotion to  the Upper Grade on November 2. 1971. He cannot
put forward  his claim	for being promoted earlier than that
date. Extensions  granted by  the Government  to the  clerks
belonging to  the Scheduled  Castes and	 Tribes from 1958 to
1972 and  thereafter upto  1974 will affect respondent no. 1
only after  November 2, 1971 and not before that date. [1001
C; F-G; 990 DE]
     (7) If  the carry	forward	 rule  is  not	upheld	then
backwardness  will   be	 perpetrated  and  it  would  result
ultimately in  a vacuum.  The High  Court was  in  error  in
holding that  the State's action in filling 34 vacancies out
of 51	by  members of	the Scheduled  Castes and Tribes was
illegal and could not be justified. [1006 C]
     (8) A  concession or relaxation in favour of a backward
class of  citizens particularly	 when  they  are  senior  in
experience would not amount to any impairment of efficiency.
The High  Court was  in error  in holding that Rule 13AA was
ultra vires  and was violative of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_125">Art. 16</a> as it thought that
this rule  came within	the mischief of clause 4 of Art, 16.
[1006 D-E]
     Per Khanna, J. (dissenting)
     There is  no infirmity in the finding of the High Court
that the  impugned promotions  were violative of <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_126">Article 335</a>
of the	Constitution. The  Departmental tests are prescribed
to ensure  standards of	 efficiency for	 the  employees.  To
promote 34  out of  51 persons although they have not passed
the Departmental  tests and  at the same time not to promote
those who  have passed	the Departmental tests can hardly be
conducive to efficiency. [945 H]
     (1) It  is not  permissible to waive the requirement of
the minimum  educational qualification	and other  standards
essential for  the maintenance of efficiency of service. The
reservation of seats for the members of the
917
backward class was not to be at the cost of efficiency. This
fact was  brought out  in <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_127">Art.	335</a> according  to which	 the
claims of  the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes shall  be taken	into consideration consistently with
the maintenance	 of  officiency	 of  administration  in	 the
making of  appointment to  services and	 posts in connection
with the affairs of the Union or of a State. [939 B; 938 H]
     (2)  The	reservation  of	  posts	 for  a	 section  of
population has the effect of conferring a special benefit on
that section  of the population. Such preferential treatment
is plainly a negation of the equality of opportunity for all
citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to
an office  under the  State. Clause  (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_128">Art. 16</a> has been
construed as  a proviso	 or exception  to cl.  (1)  of	that
Article. [939 <a href="/doc/1074353/" id="a_129">C]

of backward classes including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled

scope for  spelling out such preferential treatment from the
language of  cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_132">Art. 16</a> because the language of that
clause does  not  warrant  any	preference  to	any  citizen
against	 another   citizen.  The   language  of	 <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_133">Art.  16(4)</a>
indicates that	but for	 this clause  it would not have been
permissible to make any reservation of appointments or posts
in favour of any backward class of citizens. [939 H; 940 A]

</p><p id="p_3">     (5) The  concept of equality in the matter of promotion
can be predicated only when the promotees are drawn from the
same source.  If the preferential treatment of one source in
relation to  the other	is based  on the differences between
the two	 sources. and the said differences have a reasonable
relation to the nature of the office, it can legitimately be
sustained on the basis of a valid classification. The reason
for the	 classification in  that case  was that	 the  higher
echelons of  the service  should be  filled  by	 experienced
officers possessing  not only  a high  degree of ability but
also first rate experience. [1940 <a href="/doc/627937/" id="a_138">H]

</p><p id="p_4">     (6) A  classification based upon the consideration that
an  employee   belongs	to   a	particular  section  of	 the
population with	 a view to accord preferential treatment for
promotion is  clear violation  of  equality  of	 opportunity
enshrined in cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_139">Art. 16.</a> [941 G]
     (7) The  essential object of various rules dealing with
appointment to posts under the State and promotion to higher
posts is  to ensure efficiency of service. Exemption granted
to a  class of	employees even	though for a limited period,
from  passing	the  departmental   tests  which  have	been
prescribed for	the purpose  of promotion would obviously be
subversive of the object of ensure efficiency of service. It
cannot be  disputed that  departmental tests  are prescribed
with a	view to	 appraise and ensure efficiency of different
employees. To  promote employees  even though  they have not
passed such  efficiency test  can hardly  be consistent with
the desideratum	 of ensuring  efficiency in  administration.
[942 B]
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">918</span>
     (8) The  fact that	 exemption from passing departmental
tests granted  to members  of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes is  not absolute	 but only for a limited period would
not lend  constitutionality to the impugned rule and orders.
Exemption granted  to a	 section of  employees	while  being
withheld from the remaining employees has obvious element of
discrimination between those to whom it is granted and those
from whom  it is  withheld. If	the passing  of departmental
tests is  an  essential	 condition  of	promotion  it  would
plainly be  invidious to  insist upon  compliance with	that
condition in  the case of one set of employees and not to do
so in  the case	 of others.  The basic	question is  whether
exemption is constitutionally permissible. [942 D]
     (9)(a) Preferential  and favoured	treatment  for	some
citizens in  the matter	 of employment or appointment to any
office under  the State would be antithesis of the principle
of equality  of opportunity. Equality of opportunity' is one
of  the	 corner-stones	of  our	 Constitution.	It  finds  a
prominent mention in the preamble to the Constitution and is
one of	the pillars  which gives  support and stength to the
social, political  and administrative edifice of the nation.
[942 F-H]
</p><p id="p_5">     (b)   Privileges,	 advantages,   favours,	  exemptions
concessions specially  earmarked for  sections of population
run counter  to the concept of equality of opportunity, they
indeed	eat   into  the	 very  vitals  of  the	concept.  To
countenance classification  for	 the  purpose  of  according
preferential treatment to persons not sought to be recruited
from different	sources and  in cases not covered by cl. (4)
of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_140">Art.	 16</a>  would  have  the  effect  of  eroding,  if	 not
destroying altogether  the valued  principle of	 equality of
opporunity enshrined in cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_141">Art. 16.</a> [943 A-B]
     (10)(a) To introduce fresh notions of classification in
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_142">Art. 16(1)</a>  would necessarily have the effect of vesting the
State  under  the  garb	 of  classification  with  power  of
treating sections  of population  as  favoured	classes	 for
public employment.  It may  not be  difficult to  circumvent
that clause mentioning grounds other than those mentioned in
cl. (2). [943 C]
</p><p id="p_6">     (b) To  expand the	 frontiers of  classification beyond
those which have so far been recognised under cl.(1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_143">Art.
16</a> is  bound to	 result in  creation of classes for favoured
and preferrential  treatment for  public employment and thus
erode  the  concept  of	 equality  of  opportunity  for	 all
citizens in  matters relating to employment under the State.
[943 D-E]
     (11) In  construing the provisions of the Constitution,
the courts should avoid doctrinaire approach. A constitution
is the	vehicle of  the life  of a  nation  and	 deals	with
practical problems  of the  Government.	 It  is,  therefore,
imperative that	 the approach  to be  adopted by  the courts
while construing  the provisions  of the Constitution should
be pragmatic  and not  one as a result of which the court is
likely to  get lost  in a  maze of  abstract  theories.	 The
important task	of construing  the article of a Constitution
is not	an exercise  in mere  syllogism. It  necessitates an
effort to  find the  true purpose and object which underlies
that  article.	 The   historical   background,	  the	felt
necessities of	the time,  the balancing  of the conflicting
interests must all enter into the crucible when the court is
engaged in  the delicate task of construin the provisions of
a constitution. [943 E-H]
     (12) Another  thing which	must be	 kept in  view while
construing the	provisions of the Constitution is to foresee
as to  what would  be the  impact of  that construction	 not
merely on the case in hand but also on the future
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">919</span>
cases which may arise under those provisions. Out of concern
for the	 facts of  one individual  case, the courts must not
adopt a	 construction the  effect of  which might be to open
the door  for making all kinds of inroads into a great ideal
and  desideratum  like	that  of  equality  of	opportunity.
Likewise,  the	 courts	 should	 aviod	in  the	 absence  of
compelling  reason,   a	 course	  that	has  the  effect  of
unsettling a  constitutional position which has been settled
over a	long term of years by a series of decisions. [941 A-
B]
     (13) The  liberal approach that may sometimes have been
adopted in  upholding classification  under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_144">Art. 14</a> would in
the very  nature of things be not apt in the context of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_145">Art.
16</a> when	 the object underlying <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_146">Art. 16</a> is kept in view. [944
C]
     (14) The  State has  ample power  to make provision for
safeguarding the  interest of backward classes under cl. (4)
of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_147">Art.	 16</a> which  deals with reservation of appointments or
posts for backward classes not adequately represented in the
services under	the State. Inaction on the part of the State
under  or.   (4)  of   <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_148">Art.  16</a>	  cannot  justify   strained
construction of cl. (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_149">Art. 16.</a> [946 E]
     Per Gupta J. (dissenting)
     (1) Rule  13AA and	 the orders  made thereunder  giving
additional opportunity	in this	 regard to  some out  of the
same class  of employee	 would be  obviously void unless the
fact that  the favoured	 members  of  the  class  belong  to
Scheduled Castes  or Scheduled Tribes made and difference in
the position. [987 B]
     There is  no force	 in the	 contention that  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_150">Art. 16(1)</a>
should be read in the light of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_151">Art. 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_152">335.</a> Neither <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_153">Art.
46</a> and <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_154">Art. 335</a> mentions <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_155">Art. 16(1)</a> nor <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_156">Art. 16(1)</a> refers to
either of  them. All  the  three  Articles  coexist  in	 the
Constitution and  if is	 correct to  say that  one  of	them
should be  read in  the light of the other two it is equally
right to  suggest that	the two	 of them  should read in the
light of  the other. This means that the various parts of an
organie	 instrument   like  the	 Constitution  ought  to  be
harmoniously construed	but that  is not  the same things as
suggesting that	 even where  the scope and ambit of one part
is clear it should be abridged, extended or amended to prove
its affinity  with another  part. Each	limb of the body has
its own function. and to try to make one of them do the work
of another  is both unnecessary and unwise. This might throw
the entire system out of gear. [985 C-D]
     (2)(a) It	is  difficult  to  see	how  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_157">Art.  46</a>  which
requires the State to promote with special care the economic
interests of the weaker sections of the people especially of
the Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled Tribes, can serve as an
aid to the construction of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_158">Art. 16(1).</a> [985 H]
</p><p id="p_7">     (b)  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_159">Art.	 335</a>  cannot   furnish	any   clue  to	 the
understanding of  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_160">Art. 16(1).</a>  This Article  does not create
any right  in  the  members  of	 the  Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled Tribes  which they  might claim  in the  matter of
appointments  to   services  and  posts;  one  has  to	look
elsewhere, to find out the claims conceded to them. <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_161">Art. 335</a>
says that  such claims shall be considered consistently with
the administrative  efficiency. This  is a  provision  which
does not enlarge but qualify such claims as they may have as
members of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. [986 C]
     (3) <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_162">Article 14</a> which guarantees equality before the law
and equal protection of the laws does not insist on absolute
equality of  treatment to  all persons	in disregard  of all
differences among  them	 but  provides	for  equality  among
equals only,  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_163">Art. 16(1)</a> contemplates classifications on the
basis of  eligibility for an appointment; those who have the
qualifications needed  for the	post form one class. it also
implies that  the  same	 class	of  employees  constitute  a
separate unit.	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_164">Art. 16(1)</a>  forbids between  the members  of

classification,	 but   only  such   classification   as	  is
reasonable, and	 the test of reasonableness having regard to
the object  of the  Article, must  be whether  the  proposed
classification helps  in achieving  this object.  Judging by
this test  it is  not possible to hold that the sub-division
of Lower  Division Clerks  into two  categories,  those	 who
belong to  the Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled Tribes those
who do not, is reasonable. [987 E-F]
     (5)(a) The	 special reference  to the  Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes does  not suggest that the State should
promote the economic interests of these castes and tribes at
the expense  of other  "weaker sections of the people". [987
H]
</p><p id="p_9">     (b) There	is nothing  reasonable in  denying  to	some
Lower Division	Clerks the same opportunity for promotion as
others have because they do not belong to a particular caste
or tribe.  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, no  doubt,
constitute a  well defined class, but a classification valid
for one purpose may not be so for another. In the context of
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_172">Art. 16(1)</a>  the sub-class  made by  r. 13AA  within the same
class of employees amounts to discrimination only on grounds
of race	 and caste which is forbidden by cl. (2) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_173">Art. 16.</a>
[988 B]
     (6) Picking  out employees	 belonging to  the Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  from the	same class  of Lower
Division Clerks	 to give  them additional  opportunity to be
promoted as  Upper Division  Clerks is not a measure for the
promotion of  the  economic  welfare  of  these	 castes	 and
tribes.	 Some	incidental   financial	 gain	to   certain
individuals, assuming  it results  in  the  welfare  of	 the
castes and  tribes to  which they  belong in some remote and
indirect way is not what <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_174">Art. 46</a> contemplates. [988 D]
     (7)(a) In	any case,  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_175">Art. 16  (1)</a> does not permit such
classification as  made by  r. 13AA. That rule may have been
inspired by  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_176">Art.  46</a>  which  requires	the  State  to	take
measures to  bridge the	 education and	economic gap between
the weaker  sections of	 the people  and other citizens, but
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_177">Art. 46</a>	 does not qualify the provisions of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_178">Art. 16(1).</a> <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_179">Art.

hereinafter called the Rules and two orders which are marked
P-2 and P-6.
</p><p id="p_21">     In order  to appreciate  Rule 13AA,  it is necessary to
refer to  Rules 12,  13A, 13AA.	 These rules  were framed in
exercise of  the powers	 conferred by the proviso to <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_183">Article
309</a> of	the Constitution. These rules came into existence on
17 December, 1958.
</p><p id="p_22">     "Promotion" is  defined  in  Rule	2(11)  to  mean	 the
appointment of	a member  of any  category  or	grade  of  a
service or  a class of service to a higher category or grade
of such service or class.
</p><p id="p_23">     Rule  12	states	that   where   general	 educational

which are  not prescribed  for a  category or  grade in such
service or  class carrying a lower rate of pay and no member
in the	category or  grade carrying the lower rate of pay is
eligible for  promotion to  such category,  grade or  post a
member in  such lower  category or  grade may be promoted to
the category  or grade	carrying  the  higher  rate  of	 pay
temporarily until  a member  of the former category or grade
qualified under	 this rule  is available  for  promotion.  A
member temporarily  promoted under  this rule  shall not  by

in the	category or  grade to which he has been promoted, or
be entitled to any preferential claim to future promotion.
</p><p id="p_24">     Rule 13  speaks of special qualifications. Rule 13 does
not concern this appeal.
</p><p id="p_25">     The two  rules which  are of  importance in this appeal
are Rules 13A and 13AA. They are as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "13A.	 Special  and  Departmental  Tests-Temporary

<p id="p_26">     It is necessary to state here that the third proviso to
Rule 13A  and the  proviso to Rule 13AA were introduced with
effect from  12 October, 1973. Rule 13AA was introduced with
effect from  13 January, 1972. Exhibit P-2 is an order dated
13 January,  1972. The	order is  made by  the Governor. The
order refers  to a  memorandum dated  19 June, 1971 from the
President, Kerala  Harijan Samskarika  Kshema Samithy, State
Committee. Trivandrum  and a  letter dated 13 November, 1971
from the  Secretary, Kerala  Public Service  Commission. The
order is as follows :-

<p id="p_27">     Exhibit P-6  is an	 order dated 11 January, 1974. It is
an order made by the Governor. The order is as follows :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">	  "Government are  pleased to  order that the period
     of temporary  exemption granted to Scheduled Castes and
     Scheduled Tribes  in the  G.O. read  above from passing

     be extended  from 13-1-1974  to cover  a period  during
     which  two	  tests	 are  held  by	the  Public  Service
     Commission and  results thereof  published so that each
     individual gets  two chances to appear. Government also
     order that	 these categories  of employees	 will not be
     given any further extension of time to acquire the test
     qualifications."</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">     Pursuant to  Rule 13AA  which came	 into force  on 13th
January, 1972  the  order  Exhibit  P-2	 was  passed  on  13
January,  1972	 granting  temporary  exemption	 to  members
already in  service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes from  passing all	 tests (unified	 and
special or  departmental tests)	 for a	period of two years.
The exemption  granted by  Exhibit P-2	in almost  all cases
would have expired on 12 January, 1974.
</p><p id="p_29">     The other	impugned order	is  Exhibit  P-6  which	 was
passed on 11 January, 1974 gave further exemption to members
of Scheduled  Castes and  Tribes from  13 January, 1974 from
passing tests to cover a period during which two tests would
be held by the Public Service Commission and results thereof
published so  that each	 individual would get two chances to
appear within  that period. The Government also ordered that
these categories of employees would not be given any further
extension of time to acquire the test qualifications.
</p><p id="p_30">     On	 the   basis  of  these	 exemption  orders,  several
promotions have been effected. The respondent alleged in the
writ petition that 12 Lower Division Clerks who were members
of Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  were  promoted
without test  qualification. The  further allegation is that
by an order dated 15 June, 1972, 19 Lower
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">924</span>
Division Clerks	 belonging to  Scheduled Castes	 and  Tribes
were promoted  as Upper	 Division Clerks  of  which  5	were
unqualified Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  members
and 14	were qualified Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
members. By  order  dated  19  September,  1972,  another  8
promotions of  members of  Scheduled Castes  and Tribes were
ordered of  which only	two were qualified and the remaining
six were  unqualified. By  another order dated 31st October,
1972, 7	 Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes members were
promoted without  qualifying test  and one was promoted with
the  qualifying	 test.	The  grievance	of  the	 respondent-
petitioner  before  the	 High  Court  was  that	 out  of  51
vacancies which	 arose in  the category	 of  Upper  Division
Clerks in  the year  1972, 34  were filled  up by  Scheduled
Castes members	who did	 not possess qualifications and only
17 were given to qualified persons.
</p><p id="p_31">     The respondent is a Lower Division Clerk working in the
Registration Department.  For promotion	 to  Upper  Division
Clerk in  that Department  on the  basis of  seniority,	 the
Lower Division Clerks have to pass (1) Account Test (Lower),
(2) Kerala  Registration Test  and (3)	Test in	 the  manual
office procedure. The respondent's grievance is that in view
of certain  concessions given to members of Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes, they  were able	to obtain promotions
earlier than  the respondent,  though  the  members  of	 the
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes who were promoted had
not passed the tests.
</p><p id="p_32">     The respondent  in the  writ petition filed in the High
Court  asked   for  a	declaration  that   Rule   13AA	  is
unconstitutional and  mandamus for  compelling the  State to
forbear from  giving effect  to order dated 13 January, 1972
marked Exhibit P-2. The respondent by an affidavit asked for
a similar  order that  Exhibit P-6 dated 11 January, 1974 be
set aside.
</p><p id="p_33">     The respondents'  contentions in  the High	 Court	were
that Rule  13AA of  the Service	 Rules and Exhibits P-2, P-6
and Exhibit  P-7 which	was another  order dated  31 October
1972 and  all  orders  of  promotion  made  thereunder	were
violative of Articles 16(1) and 16(2). The High Court upheld
the contentions of respondent No. 1.
</p><p id="p_34">     The contention  of the State is that the impugned rules
and orders  are not  only legal and valid but also support a
rational classification under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_184">Article 16(1).</a>
</p><p id="p_35">     The contentions  on behalf	 of  respondent	 No.  1	 are
these. First <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_185">Article 16</a> is a specific application of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_186">Article
14</a> in  matters relating	 to employment or appointment to any
service in the State. Clauses (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_187">Article 16</a> give
effect to  equality before  law guaranteed by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_188">Article 14</a> and
to prohibition	against discrimination guaranteed by <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_189">Article
15(1).</a> In  other words,	 <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_190">Article 16(1)</a>	is absolute in terms
guaranteeing equality  of opportunity  to  every  indivdiual
citizen	 seeking  employment  or  appointment.	Emphasis  is
placed	on  similar  opportunity  and  equal  treatment	 for
seeking employment  or appointment. Second, matters relating
to employment in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_191">Article 16(1)</a> in-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">925</span>
<p id="p_36">clude all  matters in  relation to employment both prior and
subsequent to  the employment and form part of the terms and
conditions of  service. Equal opportunity is to be given for
appointment,  promotion,   termination	of   employment	 and
payment of  pension and	 gratuity. Third, the abridgement of
equality guaranteed  by <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_192">Article	 16(1)</a> is only to the extent
curtailed by  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_193">Article 16(4).</a>  Apart from  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_194">Article 16(4</a>), the
right guaranteed  under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_195">Article	 16(1)</a> cannot  be curtailed.
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_196">Article 16(4)</a>  is, in  substance,  an  exception  to  rights
guaranteed by  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_197">Article 16(1)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_198">(2).</a> Fourth, <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_199">Article 16(4)</a>
does not  cover the  entire field  occupied by <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_200">Article 16(1)</a>
and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_201">(2).</a>  Some of  the matters	relating  to  employment  in
respect of which equality of opportunity has been guaranteed
by <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_202">Article  16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_203">(2)</a> do not fall within the mischief of
non-obstante clause in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_204">Article 16(4).</a> To illustrate, clauses
(1) and	 (2) of	 <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_205">Article 16</a> do not prohibit the prescription
of reasonable  rules for  selection  to	 any  employment  or
appointment in office. Any provision as to the qualification
for employment or appointment in office reasonably fixed and
applicable to  all citizens  would be  consistent  with	 the
doctrine  of  equality	of  opportunity	 in  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_206">Article  16(1).</a>
Reasonable qualification  of employment	 for the  purpose of
efficiency of  service is  justified. Fifth,  rule  13AA  is
violative of  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_207">Article 16(1)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_208">(2).</a> The impeached Exhibits
fall within the same mischief. There is no scope for dealing
with Scheduled	Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  different from
other  backward	  classes.  Exemption	from   qualification
necessary for  promotion is not conducive to the maintenance
of  efficiency	of  administration  and	 violates  not	only
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_209">Article 335</a> of the Constitution but also <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_210">Article 16(1).</a>
</p><p id="p_37">     Before  the   introduction	 of  the  Kerala  State	 and
Subordinate Services  Ruless 1958  on 17  December, 1958 and
also the  formation of Kerala State on 1 November, 1956, the
Travancore-Cochin Government  had issued  orders on 14 June,
1956 directing	that the standard of qualification should be
lower for  members of  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
than compared  to  others  in  the  matter  of	examinations
relating to  various tests.  By Government  order  dated  27
June, 1958, it was directed that the peiod of exemption from
passing tests  be extended  by two  years  in  the  case  of
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes. Again by Government
order dated  2 January,	 1961. the  period of  exemption  to
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes was further extended
to 3  years. By	 another Government  order dated 14 January,
1963, a	 unified account  test (lower)	and a test in office
procedure were	introduced replacing  the old  tests and  as
this was  treated as  a	 new  test,  all  persons  who	were
formerly in  Travancore-Cochin or  Madras Service were given
two years'  time  to  pass  the	 test  and  members  of	 the
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes were given extra time
in accordance  with the orders earlier mentioned. A circular
was issued  on 9  February, 1968 granting 7 years' time from
14 January,  1963 to  members of  the Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled Tribes  to pass the unified tests. This period was
to expire on 14 January, 1970. On 13 January, 1970, an order
was passed  extending the  time for  another  year  upto  14
January, 1971.	On 14 January, 1971 another Government order
was issued extending the period by another year.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">926</span>
<p id="p_38">     It was  brought to	 the notice  of the  Government that
large number  of Government  servants belonging to Scheduled
Casts  and   Scheduled	Tribes	were  unable  to  get  their
promotion because  of want  of test qualifications. In order
to give relief to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,
the Government	incorporated Rule  13AA	 which	enabled	 the
Government to grant exemption to members of Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes for a specified period. On 13 January,
1972 exemption from passing the tests was granted to members
of Scheduled  Castes and  Scheduled Tribes for two years. On
11 January,  1974 order	 was made  under  Rule	13AA  giving
members of  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes exemption
from passing  the tests	 for the  period of  two tests to be
conducted after the order dated 11 January, 1974.
</p><p id="p_39">     The criterion for promotion of Lower Division Clerks to
Upper Division	Clerks is seniority-cum-merit qualification.
For want  of test  qualification a  large  number  of  Lower
Division Clerks	 belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes were  passed over.  It is  because of  the  aforesaid
Government order  dated 13  January, 1972 marked exhibit P-2
that promotions	 were made  according to seniority-cum-merit
qualification. The  larger share  went to the members of the
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes	 because  they	were
senior hands. After the issue of the order dated 13 January,
1972, 34  out of  51 Lower Division Clerks who were promoted
belonged to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These
34 persons  were given	temporary exemption from passing the
departmental tests. It also appears that these 34 members of
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes have  become  senior
most in the lower cadre.
</p><p id="p_40">     Articles 14,  15 and  16  form  part  of  a  string  of
constitutionally guaranteed  rights. These rights supplement
each  other.  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_211">Article  16</a>  which  ensures  to  all  citizens
equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment is
an incident  of guarantee  of equality	contained in Article
</p><p id="p_41">14. <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_212">Article  16(1)</a> gives effect to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_213">Article 14.</a> Both Articles
14 and 16(1) permit reasonable classification having a nexus
to the objects to be achieved. Under <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_214">Article 16</a> there can be
a reasonable  classification of	 the  employees	 in  matters
relating to employment or appointment.
</p><p id="p_42">     This Court	 in the	 State of  Gujarat and	Anr. etc. v.
Shri Ambica  Mills Ltd.	 Ahmedabad etc.(1)  said "The  equal
protection of  the laws	 is a  pledge of  the protection  of
equal laws.  But laws  may classify.  And the  very idea  of
classification is  that	 of  inequality.  In  tackling	this
paradox the  Court has	neither	 abandoned  the	 demand	 for
equality nor  denied the  legislative right  to classify. It
has taken a middle course. It has resolved the contradictory
demands of  legislative	 specialization	 and  constitutional
generality by  a doctrine of reasonable classification. (See
Joseph Tussman	and Jacobus ten Breck, "The Equal Protection
of the Laws", 37 California Rev. 341.)"
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">927</span>
<p id="p_43">     In the  Ambica Mills  case (supra) this Court explained
reasonable classification  to be  one which includes all who
are similarly situated and none who are not. The question as
to who	are similarly  situated has been answered by stating
that one  must look beyond the classification to the purpose
of law.	 "The purpose of a law may be either the elimination
of a  public mischief  or the  achievement of  some positive
public good."
</p><p id="p_44">     Discrimination  is	  the  essence	 of  classification.
Equality is  violated if it rests on unreasonable basis. The
concept of  equality has an inherent limitation arising from
the very  nature of  the constitutional guarantee. Those who
are  similarly	 circumstanced	are  entitled  to  an  equal
treatment. Equality  is amongst	 equals. Classification	 is,
therefore, to  be founded  on substantial  differences which
distinguish persons  grouped together from those left out of
the groups and such differential attributes must bear a just
and rational relation to the object sought to be achieved.
</p><p id="p_45">     The crux of the matter is whether Rule 13AA and the two
orders Exhibits	 P-2 and  P-6 are unconstitutional violating
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_215">Article	 16(1).</a>	  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_216">Article  16(1)</a>   speaks  of	equality  of
opportunity in matters relating to employment or appointment
under the  State. The  impeached Rule  and orders  relate to
Promotion from	Lower  Division	 Clerks	 to  Upper  Division
Clerks. Promotion  depends upon	 passing the test within two
years in  all cases  and exemption  is granted to members of
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes for  a longer period
namely, four  years. If	 there is  a rational classification
consistent with the purpose for which such classification is
made  equality	 is  not   violated.   The   categories	  of
classification for purposes of promotion can never be closed
on the	contention that	 they are  all members	of the	same
cadre in  service. If  classification is made on educational
qualifications	 for	purposes   of	 promotion   or	  if
classification is  made on  the ground	that the persons are
not similarly  circumstanced in	 regard to  their entry into
employment,   such    classification   can   be	  justified.
Classification between	direct recruits	 and  promotees	 for
purposes of  promotion has  been held to be reasonable in <a href="/doc/269704/" id="a_217">C.
A. Rajendran v. Union of India</a>(1).
</p><p id="p_46">     The respondent  contended that apart from <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_218">Article 16(4)</a>
members of  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes were not
entitled to  any favoured  treatment in regard to promotion.
<a href="/doc/1466728/" id="a_219">In T.  Devadasan v. The Union of India &amp; Anr</a>.(2) reservation
was made  for backward classes. The number of reserved seats
which  were  not  filled  up  was  carried  forward  to	 the
subsequent year.  On the  basis of "carry forward" principle
it  was	  found	 that  such  reserved  seats  might  destroy
equality. To  illustrate, if  18 seats were reserved and for
two succesive  years the  reserved seats were not filled and
in the	third year there were 100 vacancies the result would
be that	 54 reserved  seats would  be occupied	out  of	 100
vacancies. This	 would	destroy	 equality.  On	that  ground
"carry forward"	 principle was	not sustained in Devadasan's
case (supra).  The same	 view was taken in the case of <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_220">M. R.
Bajali and  Others v.  State of	 Mysore</a>(3). It was said that
not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">928</span>
more than  50 per  cent	 should	 be  reserved  for  backward
classes.  This	ensures	 eqalality.  Reservation  is  not  a
constitutional compulsion  but is discretionary according to
the ruling of this Court in Rajendran's case (supra).
</p><p id="p_47">     There is  no denial  of equality  of opportunity unless
the  person  who  complains  of	 discrimination	 is  equally

those governing	 and her  set of  persons or objects so that
the question  of unequal  treatment does  not  really  arise
between	 persons   governed  by	  different  conditions	 and
different sets	of circumstances.  The principle of equality
does not mean that every law must have universal application
for all	 persons  who  are  not	 by  nature,  attainment  or
circumstances in  the same position and the varying needs of
different classes  of persons require special treatment. The
legislature understands	 and appreciates the need of its own
people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest

adequate grounds.  The	rule  of  classification  is  not  a
natural and  logical corollary	of the rule of equality, but
the rule  of differentiation  is inherent  in the concept of
equality. Equality means parity of treatment under parity of
conditions. Equality  does not	connote absolute equality. A
classification in  order to be constitutional must rest upon
distinctions that  are substantial  and not merely illusory.
The test  is whether  it has  a reasonable  basis free	from

Court to be backward classes, can maintain minimum necessary
requirement   of   administrative   efficiency,	  not	only
representation but  also preference  may be given to them to
enforce equality and to eliminate inequality. Articles 15(4)

out the content of equality guaranteed by Articles 14, 15(1)

opportunity  for  appointment.	Preferential  treatment	 for
members	  of   backward	  classes   with   due	 regard	  to

mean aggravation  of  inequality.  Equality  of	 opportunity
admits	 discrimination	   with	  reason    and	   prohibits

means rational	classification	for  differential  treatment
having nexus  to the  constitutionally	permissible  object.
Preferential representation  for  the  backward	 classes  in
services with  due regard  to administrative  efficiency  is
permissible object  and	 backward  classes  are	 a  rational
classification reconginsed  by our  Constitution. Therefore,
differential treatment	in standards of selection are within
the concept of equality.
</p><p id="p_66">     A rule  in	 favour	 of  an	 under-represented  backward
community  specifying  the  basic  needs  of  efficiency  of
administration will  not contravene  Articles 14,  16(1) and
16(2). The rule in the present case does not impair the test
of efficiency  in  administration  inasmuch  as	 members  of
Scheduled Castes and Tribes who are promoted have to acquire
the qualification  of passing  the test. The only relaxation
which is  done in  their case  is that	they are granted two
years more  time than  others to  acquire the qualification.
Scheduled Castes and Tribes are descriptive of backwardness.
It is  to the  aim of our Constitution to bring them up from
handicapped position  to improvement.  If classification  is
permissible under  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_264">Article 14</a>,	it  is	equally	 permissible
under  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_265">Article	16</a>,  because  both  the	 Articles  lay	down
equality. The  quality and  concept of	equality is  that if
persons are dissimilarly placed they cannot be made equal by
having the same treatment. Promotion of members of Scheduled

based on  the classification  with the	object	of  securing
representation to  members of  Scheduled Castes	 and Tribes.

not passed  the tests  mentioned above. Respondent No. 1 was
not, however,  promoted despite	 the fact that he had passed

<p id="p_80">     <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_284">Article 14</a>	 of the Constitution enshrines the principle
of  equality   before  the   law.   <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_285">Article   15</a>   prohibits
discrimination against citizens on grounds only of religion,
race, caste,  sex, place of birth or any of them. <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_286">Article 16</a>
represents one	fact of the guarantee of equality. According
to this	 article, there shall be equality of opportunity for
all  citizens	in  matters   relating	to   employment	  or
appointment to any office under the State. No citizen, it is
further provided,  shall on  grounds only of religion, race,
caste, sex,  descent, place  of birth,	residence or  any of
them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect
of, any	 employment or	office under the State. Articles 14,
15 and	16 underline the importance which the framers of our
Constitution attached  to ensuring  equality  of  treatment.
Such equality  has a  special significance  in the matter of
public employment.  It	was  with  a  view  to	prevent	 any
discrimination in  that field  that an express provision was
made to	 guarantee equality  of opportunity for all citizens
in matters  relating to	 employment or	appointment  to	 any
office under the State.
</p><p id="p_81">     At the  same time	the framers of the Constitution were
conscious of  the backwardness	of  large  sections  of	 the
population.  It	  was  also  plain  that  because  of  their
backwardness those  sections of	 the population would not be
in a  position to  compete with	 advanced  sections  of	 the
community who had all the advantages of affluence and better
education. The	fact that the doors of competition were open
to them would have been a poor consolation to the members of
the backward classes because the chances of their success in
the competition	 were far  too	remote	on  account  of	 the
inherent handicap and disadvantage from which they suffered.
The  result   would  have  been	 that,	leaving	 aside	some
exceptional cases,  the members	 of backward  classes  would
have  hardly   got  any	 representation	 in  jobs  requiring
educational background.	 It  would  have  thus	resulted  in
virtually repressing  those who	 were already repressed. The
framers of  the Constitution  being conscious  of the  above
disadvantage from  which  backward  classes  were  suffering
enjoined upon the State in <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_287">article 46</a> of the Constitution to
promote with special care educational and economic interests
of the	weaker sections	 of the people, in particular of the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and also protect them
from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. To give
effect to  that objective in the field of public employment,
a provision  was made  in clause  (4)  of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_288">article  16</a>	that
nothing in  that article would prevent the State from making
any provision  for the	reservation of appointments or posts
in favour  of any  backward class  of citizens which, in the
opinion of  the State, was not adequately represented in the
services under	the State.  Under the  above clause,  it  is
permissible  for   the	State,	 in  case   it	 finds	 the
representation of  any backward	 class of  citizens  in	 the
State services to be not adequate, to make provision for the
reservation of	appointments or	 posts	in  favour  of	that
backward class of citizens. The reservation of seats for the
members of  the backward  classes was not, however, to be at
the cost of efficiency. This fact was brought out in <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_289">article
335</a>,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">939</span>
according  to  which  the  claims  of  the  members  of	 the
Scheduled Castes  and the  Scheduled Tribes  shall be  taken
into consideration,  consistently with	the  maintenance  of
efficiency of  administration, in the making of appointments
to services  and posts in connection with the affairs of the
Union or  of a	State. In view of that it is not permissible
to   waive    the   requirement	  of   minimum	 educational
qualification  and   other  standards	essential  for	 the
maintenance of efficiency of service.
</p><p id="p_82">     It is further plain that the reservation of posts for a
section of population has the effect of conferring a special
benefit on  that section  of the population because it would
enable members	belonging to  that section to get employment
or office  under the State which otherwise in the absence of
reservation they  could	 not  have  got.  Such	preferential
treatment  is	plainly	 a   negation  of  the	equality  of
opportunity  for   all	citizens   in  matters	relating  to
employment or  appointment to  an office  under	 the  State.
Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_290">article 16</a> has, therefore, been construed as a
proviso or  exception to clause (1) of that article (see <a href="/doc/1074353/" id="a_291">The
General Manager<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_292">,  Southern Railway  v. Rangachari</a></a>(1)  and <a href="/doc/1466728/" id="a_293">T.
Devadasan v. The Union of India &amp; Anr</a>. (2).
</p><p id="p_83">     It has  been argued  on behalf  of the  appellants that
equality   of	treatment   does   not	 forbid	  reasonable
classification. Reference  in this  context is	made to	 the
well accepted  principle that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_294">article 14</a> of the Constitution
forbids	  class	   legislation	 but	does   not    forbid
classification. Permissible  classification, it	 is  equally
well  established,   must  be  founded	on  an	intelligible
differentia which  distinguishes persons  or things that are
grouped together  from others  left out of the group and the
differentia must  have a  rational relation  to	 the  object
sought to  be achieved	by the	statute in  question. It  is
urged that the same principle should apply when the court is
concerned with	the equality of opportunity for all citizens
in matters  relating to	 employment or	appointment  to	 any
office under  the State.  In this respect I may observe that
this Court has recognized the principle of classification in
the context  of clause	(1) of	<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_295">article 16</a>  in matters where
appointments are  from two  different sources,	e.g., guards
and station  masters, promotees	 and direct  recrits, degree
holder and  diploma holder  engineers (see All India Station
Masters &amp;  Asstt. <a href="/doc/59130/" id="a_296">Station  Masters' Assn.  &amp; Ors. v. General
Manager</a>, Central  Railway &amp;  Ors.,(3) <a href="/doc/627937/" id="a_297">S.  G.  Jaisnghani  v.
Union of  India &amp;  Ors</a>.(1) and	<a href="/doc/1264252/" id="a_298">State of  Jammu &amp; Kashmir v.
Triloki Nath Khosa &amp; Ors</a>.(5). The question with which we are
concerned, however,  is whether	 we  can  extend  the  above
principle of  classification so	 as  to	 allow	preferential
treatment to  employees on  the ground that they are members
of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. So far as this
question is concerned I am of the view that the provision of
preferential treatment	for  members  of  backward  classes,
including scheduled  castes and	 scheduled tribes,  is	that
contained  in	clause	(4)  of	 <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_299">article  16</a>  which  permits
reservation of posts for them. There is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">940</span>
no scope  for spelling	out such preferential treatment from
the language  of  clause  (1)  of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_300">article  16</a>	because	 the
language of  that clause  does not warrant any preference to
any citizen  against another  citizen. The  opening words of
clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_301">article 16</a> that "nothing in this article shall
prevent	 the   State  from  making  any	 provision  for	 the
reservation of	appointments or	 posts in favour of backward
class of citizens" indicate that but for clause (4) it would
not  have  been	 permissible  to  make	any  reservation  of
appointments or	 posts in  favour of  any backward  class of
citizens.
</p><p id="p_84">     In the  case of  All India	 Station Masters'  &amp;  Asstt.
Station Masters' Association (supra) the Roadside Masters of
the Central  Railway  Challenged  the  constitutionality  of
promotion of  guards to higher grade station masters' posts.
The  petitioners'   contention	was   that  the	 channel  of
promotions amounted  to a  denial of  equal  opportunity  as
between Roadside Station Masters and guards in the matter of
promotion and  thus contravened	 clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_302">article 16</a> of
the Constitution. It was urged that taking advantage of this
channel of  promotions, guards	became station	masters at a
much younger  age than	Roadside Station Masters who reached
the scale  when they  were  much  older.  According  to	 the
petitioners, Roadside  Station	Masters	 and  guards  really
formed one  and the  same class	 of  employees.	 This  Court
rejected that  contention and held that the Roadside Station
Masters belonged  to a	wholly distinct	 and separate  class
from guards and so there could be no question of equality of
opportuntiy in	matters of  promotions as  between  Roadside
Station Masters	 and guards.  It was  further laid down that
the question of denial of equal opportunity required serious
consideration only as between the members of the same class.
The concept  of equal  opportunity in  matters of employment
did not	 apply as  between members  of different  classes of
employees  under  the  State.  Equality	 of  opportunity  in
matters of  employment	could  be  predicated  only  between
persons who  were either seeking the same employment, or had
obtained the  same employment.	Equality of  opportunity  in
matters of  promotion must  mean equality between members of
the same class of employees and not equality between members
of separate, independent classes. In the case of Jaisinghani
(supra) the  dispute was about seniority between two classes
of income-tax  service, the direct recruits to class I grade
II and	promotees from class II to class I grade II. For the
purpose of promotion, the Government fixed a ratio of 2 to 1
for direct  recruits and  promotees. It	 was in that context
and on	those facts that this Court laid down that it is not
correct to say that all officers appointed to class I, grade
II service formed one class and that after the officers have
been once  recruited there  could be  no distinction between
direct recruits	 and promotees.	 It  is	 really	 a  case  of
recruitment to	the service  from two  different sources and
the adjustment	of seniority  between them.  The concent  of
equality in  the matter	 of promotion can be predicated only
when the  promotees are	 drawn from  the same source. If the
preferential treatment	of one	source in  relation  to	 the
other is  based on  the differences between the two sources,
and the	 said differences  have a reasonable relation to the
nature of the office it can legitimately be sustained on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">941</span>
basis  of   a  valid  classification.  The  reason  for	 the
classification in  that case was that the higher echelons of
the  service   should  be  filled  by  experienced  officers
possessing not only a high degree of ability but also first-
rate experience.  In the  case of Triloki Nath Khosa (supra)
the question  before  the  Court  was  with  regard  to	 the
validity of  a rule which provided that only those assistant
engineers would	 be  eligible  for  promotion  as  executive
engineers  who	 possessed  a  degree  in  engineering.	 The
validity of  this rule was challenged by assistant engineers
who were  diploma-holders and  did not possess the degree in
engineering. This  Court held  that though persons appointed
directly and  by promotion  were integrated  into  a  common
class of  assistant engineers,	they could  for purposes  of
promotion to  the cadre of executive engineers be classified
on  the	  basis	 of  educational  qualifications.  The	rule
providing  that	  graduates  shall   be	 eligible  for	such
promotion to the exclusion of diploma-holders was held to be
not violative  of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. It
would thus  appear that in each of the above cases the Court
was concerned  with two categories of employees, each one of
which category	constituted a  separate and  distinct class.
Differential treatment	for those  classes was upheld in the
context of  their educational  and other  qualifications and
because of  the fact  that  they  constituted  distinct	 and
separate classes. Not much argument is needed to show that a
rule requiring	that an	 official must	possess a  degree in
engineering before  he	can  be	 promoted  to  the  post  of
executive  engineer   is  conceived   in  the	interest  of
efficiency of  service. A  classification  based  upon	that
consideration is  obviously valid.  Likewise, classification
based upon  the consideration that one category of employees
are  direct   recruits	while	others	are   promotes,	  is
permissible classification  because the	 two  categories  of
employees constitute  two separate and distinct classes. The
same  is  true	of  roadside  station  masters	and  guards.
Classification of  employees in	 each  of  these  cases	 was
linked with  the  nature  of  their  initial  employment  or
educational qualifications  and had  nothing to	 do with the
fact that  they belonged  to any  particular section  of the
population.  A	classification	based  upon  the  first	 two
factors was  upheld because it was conceived in the interest
of efficiency  of service  and because	they constituted two
different classes  in  view  of	 the  fact  that  they	were
initially appointed  to posts  of different categories. Such
classification does not impinge upon the rule of equality of
opportunity. As	 against that,	a classification  based upon
the consideration  that an  employee belongs to a particular
section of the population with a view to accord preferential
treatment for  promotion is  clear violation  of equality of
opportunity enshrined  in clause  (1) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_303">article 16.</a>  In no
case has  the Court  ever accepted  and upheld under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_304">article
16(1)</a> classification  and  differential	 treatment  for	 the
purpose of promotion among employees who possessing the same
educational qualifications  were initially  appointed as  in
the present  case to  the same category of posts, viz., that
of lower  division clerks.  The present	 case falls squarely
within the  dictum laid down in the case of Station Masters'
&amp; Asstt.  Station Masters'  Association (supra) that equaliy
of opportunity	in matters of employment could be predicated
between persons who were either seeking the same
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">942</span>
employment  or	 had  obtained	 the  same  employment.	 The
essential object  of various  rules dealing with appointment
to posts under the State and promotion to higher posts is to
ensure efficiency  of service.	Classification upheld  under
clause (1)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_305">article 16</a> subserved and in no case militated
against the  attainment of that object. Exemption granted to
a class	 of employees, even though for a limited period from
passing the  departmental tests	 which have  been prescribed
for the	 purpose of  promotion would obviously be subversive
of the	object to ensure efficiency of service. It cannot be
disputed that  departmental tests are prescribed with a view
to appraise and ensure efficiency of different employees. To
promote employees  even though	they have  not	passed	such
efficiency  test   can	hardly	 be  consistent	  with	 the
desideratum of ensuring efficiency in administation.
</p><p id="p_85">     Much has  been made  of the  fact that  exemption	from
passing departmental  tests granted  to members of scheduled
castes and  scheduled tribes  is not absolute but only for a
limited period.	 This fact,  in our  opinion, would not lend
constitutionality to the impugned rule and orders. Exemption
granted to  a section of employees while being withheld from
the   remaining	   employees   has    obvious	element	  of
discrimination between those to whom it is granted and those
from whom  it is  withheld. If	the passing  of departmental
tests is  an essential	condition  of  promotion,  it  would
plainly be  invidious to  insist upon  compliance with	that
condition in  the case of one set of employees and not to do
so in  the case	 of other.  The basic  question	 is  whether
exemption is  constitutionally permissible. If the answer to
that question be in the negative, the fact that exemption is
for a limited period would not make any material difference.
In either  event  the  vice  of	 discrimination	 from  which
exemption suffers  would contaminate  it and  stamp it	with
unconstitutionality. Exemption	for a  limited period  to be
constitutionally valid	cannot be  granted  to	one  set  of
employees and withheld from the other.
</p><p id="p_86">     What clause  (1) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_306">article 16</a>  ensures is equality of
opportunity for	 all  citizens	as  individuals	 in  matters
relating to  employment or  appointment to  any office under

appointment  to	  any  office	under  the  State  would  be
antithesis of  the principle  of  equality  of	opportunity.
Equality of  opportunity in matters of employment guaranteed
by clause  (1) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_307">article 16</a>  is intended  to be  real	 and
effective. It is not something abstract or illusory. It is a
command to  be obeyed, not one to be defied or circumvented.
It cannot  be reduced to shambles under some cloak. Immunity
or exemption  granted to  a  class,  however  limited,	must
necessarily have  the effect of according favoured treatment
to that	 class and of creating discrimination against others
to whom	 such immunity or exemption is not granted. Equality
of  opportunity	  is  one   of	the   corner-stones  of	 our
Constitution. It  finds a  prominent mention in the preamble
to the	Constitution and  is one  of the pillars which gives
support	 and   strength	 to   the  social,   political	 and
administrative	 edifice    of	 the   nation.	 Privileges,
advantages, favours, exemptions,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">943</span>
concessions specially  earmarked for  sections of population
run counter  to the concept of equality of opportunity, they
indeed	eat  into  the	very  vitals  of  that	concept.  To
countenance classification  for	 the  purpose  of  according
preferential treatment to persons not sought to be recruited
from different	sources and  in cases  not covered by clause
(4) of	<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_308">article 16</a>  would have the effect of eroding, if not
destroying altogether,	the valued  principle of equality of
opportunity enshrined in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_309">article 16.</a>
</p><p id="p_87">     The proposition  that to  overdo classification  is  to
undermine equality  is specially  true	in  the	 context  of
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_310">article 16(1).</a>	To introduce fresh notions of classification
in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_311">article  16(1</a>), as  is sought  to be	 done in the present
case, would necessarily have the effect of vesting the State
under the  garb of  classification with	 power	of  treating
sections  of  population  as  favoured	classes	 for  public
employment. The	 limitation imposed by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_312">article
16</a> may	also not  prove very  effective because, as has been
pointed out  during the	 course of  arguments,	that  clause
prevents discrimination	 on grounds  only of religion, race,
caste, sex,  descent, place  of birth,	residence or  any of
them. It  may not  be difficult to circumvent that clause by
mentioning grounds other than those mentioned in clause (2).
</p><p id="p_88">     To expand	the frontiers of classification beyond those
which have  so far  been  recognized  under  clause  (1)  of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_313">article 16</a>  is bound  to result	 in creation  of classes for
favoured and  preferential treatment  for public  employment
and thus  erode the  concept of	 equality of opportunity for
all citizens  in matters  relating to  employment under	 the
State.
</p><p id="p_89">     In construing  the provisions  of the  Constitution  we
should avoid  a doctrinaire  approach. A Constitution is the
vehicle of  the life  of a  nation and	deals with practical
problems of  the government.  It is,  therefore,  imperative
that  the  approach  to	 be  adopted  by  the  courts  while
construing the	provisions of  the  Constitution  should  be
pragmatic and  not one	as a  result of	 which the  court is
likely to  get lost  in a maze of abstract theories. Indeed,
so far as theories are concerned, human thinking in its full
efforescence, free  from constraints  and  inhibitions,	 can
take such  diverse forms  that views  and reasons apparently
logical and  plausible can  be found  both in  favour of and
against a particular theory. If one eminent thinker supports
one view,  support for the opposite view can be found in the
writings of another equally eminent thinker. Whatever indeed
may be the conclusion, arguments not lacking in logic can be
found in  support of  such conclusion. The important task of
construing the articles of a Constitution is not an exercise
in mere	 syllogism. It	necessitates an	 effort to  find the
true purpose  and object  which underlies  that article. The
historical background, the felt necessities of the time, the
balancing of  the conflicting  interests must all enter into
the crucible  when the court is engaged in the delicate task
of construing the provisions of a Constitution. The words of
Holmes that  life of  law is not logic but experience have a
direct relevance in the above context.
</p><p id="p_90">     Another  thing   which  must  be  kept  in	 view  while
construing the	provisions of the Constitution is to foresee
as to what would be the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">944</span>
impact of  that construction  not merely on the case in hand
but also  on the  future cases	which may  arise under those
provisions.  Out  of  our  concern  for	 the  facts  of	 one
individual case, we must not adopt a construction the effect
of which  might be  to open the door for making all kinds of
inroads into  a great  ideal and  desideratum like  that  of
equality of  opportunity. Likewise,  we should avoid, in the
absence of  compelling reason,	a course that has the effect
of unsettling  a constitutional	 position,  which  has	been
settled over a long-term of years by a series of decisions.
</p><p id="p_91">     The liberal  approach  that  may  sometimes  have	been
adopted in  upholding classification  under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_314">article 14</a> would
in the	very nature  of things	be not apt in the context of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_315">article 16</a>  when we  keep  in  view  the  object  underlying
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_316">article 16.</a>  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_317">Article 14</a> covers a very wide and general field
of equality  before the	 law and the equal protection of the
laws. It  is, therefore,  permissible to  cover	 within	 its
ambit  manifold	  classifications  as	long  as   they	 are
reasonable and	have a	rational connection  with the object
thereof. As against that, <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_318">article 16</a> operates in the limited
area of	 equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters
relating to employment or appointment to an office under the
State.	Carving	  out  classes	 of  citizens  for  favoured
treatment in  matters of  public employment, except in cases
for which  there is an express provision contained in clause
(4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_319">article 16</a>, would as already pointed out above in the
very nature  of things run counter to the concept underlying
clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_320">article 16.</a>
</p><p id="p_92">     The matter can also be looked at from another angle. If
it was	permissible to	accord favoured treatment to members
of backward  classes under  clause (1)	of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_321">article 16</a>, there
would have  been no  necessity of  inserting clause  (4)  in
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_322">article 16.</a>  Clause (4) in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_323">article 16</a> in such an event would
have to	 be treated  as wholly superfuous and redundant. The
normal rule  of interpretation	is that	 no provision of the
Constitution is	 to be	treated as redundant and superfuous.
The Court  would, therefore,  be reluctant  to accept a view
which would  have the  effect of  rendering  clause  (4)  of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_324">article 16</a> redundant and superfuous.
</p><p id="p_93">     This Court	 in the	 case of State of Madras v. Shrimati
Champakkam Dorairajan(1) unequivocally repelled the argument
the effect  of which  would have been to treat clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_325">article 16</a>  to be wholly unnecessary and redundant. Question
which arose  for consideration	in that	 case was  whether a
Communal G.O.  fixing  percentage  of  seats  for  different
sections of  population for admission in the engineering and
medical colleges  of the  State of  Madras  contravened	 the
fundamental rights.  It was  held that	the Communal G.O. by
which  percentage   of	seats  was  apportioned	 contravened
<a href="/doc/762902/" id="a_326">article 29(2)</a>  of the  Constitution. A	seven-Judge Bench of
this Court in that case referred to clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_327">article 16</a>
of the Constitution and observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">	  "If the  argument founded on <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_328">article 46</a> were sound
     then clause  (4) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_329">article 16</a>  would have been wholly
     unnecessary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">945</span>
     and redundant.  Seeing, however,  that clause  (4)	 was
     inserted in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_330">article 16</a>, the omission of such an express
     provision from  <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_331">article 29</a>	 cannot but  be regarded  as
     significant. It  may well	be that the intention of the
     Constitution was  not  to	introduce  at  all  communal
     considerations  in	  matters  of	admission  into	 any
     educational institution  maintained  by  the  State  or
     receiving aid  out of  State funds.  The protection  of
     backward classes of citizens may require appointment of
     members of	 backward classes  in State services and the
     reason why power has been given to the State to provide
     for  reservation  of  such	 appointments  for  backward
     classes may  under those  circumstances be	 understood.
     That  consideration,   however,   was   not   obviously
     considered necessary  in the  case of admission into an
     educational institution and that may well be the reason
     for the omission from <a href="/doc/1888152/" id="a_332">article 29</a> of a clause similar to
     clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_333">article 16."</a>
</blockquote><p id="p_94">After the  above decision  of  this  Court,  clause  (4)  of
<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_334">article 15</a> was added in the Constitution by the Constitution
(First Amendment) Act, 1951 and the same reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">	  "Nothing in  this article  or	 in  clause  (2)  of

     special provision	for the	 advancement of any socially
     and educationally	backward classes  of citizens or for
     the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes."</blockquote>
<p id="p_95">     If the  power of  reservation  of	seats  for  backward
classes was  already contained	in clause (1) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_336">article 15</a>,
the decision  in the  above mentioned case would in the very
nature of  things have	been different	and there would have
been no	 necessity for	the introduction  of clause  (4)  in
<a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_337">article 15</a>  by means  of the  Constitution (First Amendment)
Act. The  fact that  clause (4)	 of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_338">article 15</a> is similar to
clause (4)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_339">article	16</a> was also emphasised by this Court
in the case of <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_340">M. R. Balaji &amp; Ors. v. State of Mysore</a>(1).
</p><p id="p_96">     It has  been argued  that there are observations in the
case  of   Champakam  (supra)	relating  to  the  Directive
Principles of  State Policy  which should  be deemed to have
been overruled	by the decision of this Court in the case of
Kesavananda Bharati(2). It is, in our opinion, not necessary
to express  an opinion on this aspect. Whatever view one may
take with  regard to  those  observations,  they  would	 not
detract from  the correctness  of the  unanimous decision of
the seven-Judge	 Bench of  this Court  in that case that, in
the absence  of provision  like clause (4) of <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_341">article 15</a>, it
was  not  permissible  to  make	 reservation  of  seats	 for
admission to  engineering and medical colleges on the ground
of backwardness.
</p><p id="p_97">     The matter	 can also  be looked  at from another angle.
Departmental tests  are prescribed  to ensure  standards  of
efficiency for	the employees.	To  promote  34	 out  of  51
persons although they have not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">946</span>
passed the  departmental tests	and at	the same time not to
promote those  who have	 passed the  departmental tests	 can
hardly	be   conducive	to   efficiency.  There	  does	not,
therefore, appear  to be any infirmity in the finding of the
High Court  that the  impugned promotions are also violative
of <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_342">article 335</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_98">     I may  state that	there is  no dispute  so far  as the
question is concerned about the need to make every effort to
ameliorate  the	 lot  of  backward  classes,  including	 the
members of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes. We
are all	 agreed on  that. The backwardness of those sections
of population  is a  stigma on our social set up and has got
to  be	 erased	 as   visualized  in   <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_343">article	46</a>   of	 the
Constitution. It  may also  call for  concrete acts to atone
for the	 past neglect and exploitation of those classes with
a view	to bring  them on  a footing  of equality,  real and
effective, with the advanced sections of the population. The
question with  which we	 are concerned,	 however, is whether
the method  which has  been adopted  by	 the  appellants  is
constitutionally permissible under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_344">article 16.</a>
The answer  to the  above question, in my opinion, has to be
in the	negative. Apart from the fact that the acceptance of
the appellants'	 contention would  result in undermining the
principle of equality of opportunity enshrined in clause (1)
of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_345">article  16</a>, it would also in effect entail overruling of
the view  which has  so far  been held	by this Court in the
cases of  Champakam, Rangachari	 and Devadasan	(supra).  It
find no	 sufficient ground  to warrant	such a	course.	 The
State, in  my opinion, has ample power to make provision for
safeguarding the  interest of  backward classes under clause
(4)  of	  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_346">article  16</a>	which  deals   with  reservation  of
appointments or	 posts for  backward classes  not adequately
represented in the services under the State. Inaction on the
part of	 the State  under clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_347">article 16</a> cannot in
my opinion,  justify strained  construction of clause (1) of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_348">article 16.</a>  We have  also to  guard  against  allowing	 our
supposed zeal  to safeguard  the  interests  of	 members  of
scheduled castes  and scheduled	 tribes to  so sway our mind
and warp our judgment that we drain off the substance of the
contents of  clause (1)	 of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_349">article  16</a> and whittle down the
principle of equality of opportunity in the matter of public
employment enshrined in that clause in such a way as to make
it a  mere pious  wish and  teasing illusion.  The ideals of
supremacy of  merit, the  efficiency  of  services  and	 the
absence of  discrimination in  sphere of  public  employment
would be  the obvious  casualties  if  we  once	 countenance
inroads to  be made  into that valued principle beyond those
warranted by clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_350">article 16.</a>

to the	Kerala State  and Subordinate  Services Rules, 1958,
and Exhibits  P-2 and P-6 the orders passed by government in
the exercise of their power under that rule, were valid. The

<p id="p_104">     Justice Brandeis  has said	 the knowledge	must precede
understanding and  that understanding must precede judgment.
It will	 therefore be  in the interest of clarity of thought
to begin with an understanding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">948</span>
of just	 what equality	of opportunity	means. <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_362">Article 16(1)</a>
provides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in the
matter of  employment and  there can  be no  doubt that	 the
equality guaranteed  is an  individual right. The concept of
equality  of   opportunity  is	 an  aspect   of  the	more
comprehensive notion  of equality.  The idea of equality has
different shades  of meaning  and connotations.	 It has many
facets and implications. Plato's remark about law is equally
applicable to  the concept  of equality: "a perfectly simple
principle can never be applied to a state of things which is
the  reverse   of  simple.(1)"	Different  writers  tend  to
emphasize some	forms of  equality rather  than others as of
overriding importance-	equality before the law, equality of
basic  human   rights,	economic   equality,   equality	  of
opportunity or equality of consideration for all persons.
</p><p id="p_105">     Formal equality  is achieved  by treating	all  persons
equally: "Each	man to count for one and no one to count for
more than  one." But  men are not equal in all respects. The
claim for  equality is	in fact	 a protest  against  unjust,
undeserved and	unjustified inequalities.  It is a symbol of
man's revolt  against chance,  fortuitous disparity,  unjust
power and  crystallised privileges. Although the decision to
grant equality	is motivated  prima  facie  by	the  alleged
reason that  all men  are equal	 yet, as soon as we clear up
the confusion  between	equality  in  the  moral  sense	 and
equality in the physical sense, we realise that the opposite
is the	truth; for,  we think  that it	is just	 to  promote
certain equalities precisely to compensate for the fact that
men are	 actually born	different. We,	therefore,  have  to
resort to  some	 sort  of  proportionate  equality  in	many
spheres to achieve justice.
</p><p id="p_106">     The principle of proportional equality is attained only
when equals  are trated equally and unequals unequally. This
would raise  the baffling  question. Equals  and unequals in
what ?	The principle  of  proportional	 equality  therefore
involves an  appeal to	some criterion	in  terms  of  which
differential  treatment	  is  justified.   If  there  is  no
significant  respect   in  which   persons   concerned	 are
distinguishable,    differential    treatment	 would	  be
unjustified. But  what is  to be  allowed as  a	 significant
difference such as would justify differential treatment?
</p><p id="p_107">     In distributing  the office of a state, not any sort of
personal  equality   is	 relevant;  for,  unless  we  employ
criteria appropriate  to the  sphere in	 question, it  would
turn out  that a  man's height or complexion could determine
his eligibility	 or suitability	 for a	post.  As  Aristotle
said, claims  to political office cannot be based on prowess
in athletic  contests. Candidates  for office should possess
those qualities	 that go  to make up an effective use of the
office.	 But   this  principle	 also  does   not  give	 any
satisfactory  answer   to  the	question  when	differential
treatment can be meted out. As I said, the principle that if
two  persons   are  being  treated  or	are  to	 be  treated
differently there should be some relevant difference between
them  is,  no  doubt,  unexceptionable.	 Otherwise,  in	 the
absence of  some differentiating  feature what	is sauce for
the goose  is sauce  for the  gander.  The  real  difficulty
arises	in   finding  out   what  constitutes	a   relevant
difference.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">949</span>
<p id="p_108">     If we  are all  to be  treated in the same manner, this
must carry with it the important requirement that none of us
should be  better or  worse in	up bringing, education, than
any one else which is an unattainable ideal for human beings
of anything  like the  sort we now see. Some people maintain
that  the   concept  of	  equality  of	 opportunity  is  an
unsatisfactory concept.	 For, a	 complete formulation  of it
renders it incompatible with any form of human society. Take
for instance,  the  case  of  equality	of  opportunity	 for
education. This	 equality cannot  start in schools and hence
requires uniform  treatment in	families which is an evident
impossibility. To remedy this, all children might be brought
up in  state nurseries,	 but, to  achieve the  purpose,	 the
nurseries would	 have to be run on vigorously uniform lines.
Could we guarantee equality of opportunity to the young even
in those  circumstances ?  The idea  is	 well  expressed  by
Laski:

     character will inevitably affect profoundly the quality
     of the children whom it touches. So long, therefore, as
     the family	 endures-and there  seems little  reason  to
     anticipate or  to desire  its disappearance-the varying
     environments it  will create  make the  notion of equal
     opportunities a fantastic one."(1)
     Though complete  inentity of equality of opportunity is
impossible in this world, measures compensatory in character
and which  are calculated to mitigate surmountable obstacles
to ensure  equality of opportunity can never incur the wrath
of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_363">Article 16(1).</a></blockquote>
<p id="p_109">     The notion	 of equality of opportunity is a notion that
a limited  good shall  in fact	be allocated  on the grounds
which do  not a	 priori exclude	 any section  of those	that
desire it(2).  All  sections  of  people  desire  and  claim
representation in the public service of the country, but the
available number  of posts  are limited	 and therefore, even
though all  sections of people might desire to get posts, it
is  practically	  impossible  to  satisfy  the	desire.	 The
question therefore  is: On  what basis	can any	 citizen  or
class of  citizens be  excluded from his or their fair share
of representation?  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_364">Article 335</a>	 postulates that  members of
Scheduled Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes  have	a  claim  to
representation in  the public  service both of the Union and
the  States  and  that	the  claim  has	 to  be	 taken	into
consideration	consistently   with   the   maintenance	  of
efficiency of  administration in  the making of appointments
to services  of the  Union and	the States.  As I  said, the
notion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">950</span>
of equality  of opportunity  has meaning only when a limited
good or,  in the present context, a limited number of posts,
should be allocated on grounds which do not a priori exclude
any section of citizens of those that desire it.
</p><p id="p_110">     What, then,  is a priori exclusion ? It means exclusion
on grounds  other than those appropriate or rational for the
good (posts)  in question.  The notion	requires not  merely
that there  should be  no exclusion  from access  on grounds
other than  those appropriate  or rational  for the  good in
question, but  the grounds  considered appropriate  for	 the
good should themselves be such that people from all sections
of society have an equal chance of satisfying them.
</p><p id="p_111">     Bernard A.	 O. Williams,  in his  article "The  Idea of
Equality" (supra)  gives an  illustration of  the working of
the principle of equality of opportunity:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">	  "Suppose that	 in a certain society great prestige
     is attached  to membership	 of  a	warrior	 class,	 the
     duties of	which require  great physical strength. This
     class has	in the	past  been  recruited  from  certain
     wealthy  families	 only;	but   egalitarian  reformers
     achieve a	change in  the rules,  by which warriors are
     recruited from  all sections  of the  society,  on	 the
     result of	a suitable  competition. The effect of this,
     however, is  that the  wealthy families  still  provide
     virtually all  the warriors,  because the	rest of	 the
     populace is so undernourished by reason of poverty that
     their physical  strength is  inferior to  that  of	 the
     wealthy and  well nourished. The reformers protest that
     equality of  opportunity has  not really been achieved;
     the wealthy  reply that  in fact  it has,	and that the
     poor now have the opportunity of becoming warriors- -it
     is just  bad luck	that their  characteristics are such
     that they	do not	pass the  test. "We  are not",	they
     might say, "excluding anyone for being poor; we exclude
     people for being weak, and it is unfortunate that those
     who are poor are also weak."</blockquote>
<p id="p_112">     This is  not a  satisfactory answer though it may sound
logical. The  supposed	equality  of  opportunity  is  quite
empty. One  knows that	there is a causal connection between
being poor  and	 being	under-nourished	 and  between  being
under-nourished and  being  physically	weak.  One  supposes
further that  something should	be done	 subject to whatever
economic conditions  obtain in	the  society  to  alter	 the
distribution of wealth. All this being so, the appeal by the
wealthy	 to   bad  luck	 of  the  poor	must  appear  rather
disingenuous.
</p><p id="p_113">     It is clear that one is not really offering equality of
opportunity to X and Y if one contents oneself with applying
the same  criteria to X and Y. What one is doing there is to
apply the  same criteria  to X	as  affected  by  favourable
conditions and	to Y as affected by unfavourable but curable
conditions. Here  there is  a necessary pressure to equal up
the conditions.	 To give  X and	 Y equality  of	 opportunity
involves regarding their conditions, where curable, as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">951</span>
themselves part of what is done to X and Y and not part of X
and Y  themselves. Their  identity for this purpose does not
include their  curable environment,  which is itself unequal
and a  contributor of inequality [see Williams, "The Idea of
Equality" (supra)].

</blockquote><p id="p_115">and that
	  "It is  obvious that	equality  in  law  precludes

their social, educational and economic environment. Not only
is the directive principle embodied in <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_366">Article 46</a> binding on

</p><p id="p_116">     Equality of opportunity is not simply a matter of legal
equality. Its  existence depends,  not merely on the absence
of disabilities,  but  on  the	presence  of  abilities.  It
obtains in  so far as, and only in so far as, each member of
a community,  whatever his  birth or  occupation  or  social
position, possesses  in fact,  and not merely in form, equal
chances of  using to  the full	his  natural  endowments  of
physique, of character, and of intelligence(3).
</p><p id="p_117">     The guarantee  of equality	 before the law or the equal
opportunity in	matters of  employment	is  a  guarantee  of
something more	than what is required by formal equality. It
implies differential  treatment of  persons who are unequal.
Egalitarian principle  has therefore  enhanced	the  growing
belief that  government has an affirmative duty to eliminate
inequalities and  to provide  opportunities for the exercise
of human rights and claims. Fundamental rights as enacted in
Part III  of the Constitution are, by and large, essentially
negative in character.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">952</span>
<p id="p_118">They mark off a world in which the government should have no
jurisdiction. In  this realm,  it was assumed that a citizen
has no claim upon government except to be let alone. But the
language of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_370">Article 16(1)</a> is in marked contrast with that of
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_371">Article 14.</a>  Whereas the  accent in  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_372">Article 14</a>	 is  on	 the
injunction that	 the State  shall not  deny  to	 any  person
equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws,
that is, on the negative character of the duty of the State,
the emphasis  in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_373">Article  16(1)</a> is  on the mandatory aspect,
namely, that  there shall be equality of opportunity for all
citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to
any office under the State implying thereby that affirmative
action by Government would be consistent with the Article if
it is  calculated to  achieve  it.  If	we  are	 to  achieve
equality, we can never afford to relax. "While inequality is
easy since  it demands	no  more  than	to  float  with	 the
current, equality  is difficult	 for  it  involves  swimming
against it. (1)".
</p><p id="p_119">     Today, the	 political  theory  which  acknowledges	 the
obligation of  government under	 Part IV of the Constitution
to provide jobs, medical care, old age pension, etc. extends
to human  rights and  imposes an  affirmative obligation  to
promote equality  and liberty.	The force  of the  idea of a
state with  obligation to  help the  weaker sections  of its
members seems  to have increasing infuence in constitutional
law. The  idea finds  expression in  a number  of  cases  in
America involving  racial discrimination  and  also  in	 the
decisions requiring  the state	to  offset  the	 effects  of
poverty by  providing counsel,	transcript of appeal, expert
witnesses,  etc.   Today  the	sense  that  government	 has
affirmative responsibility  for elimination of inequalities,
social, economic  or otherwise, is one of the dominant forms
in constitutional  law. While  special concessions  for	 the
underprivileged have  been easily  permitted, they  have not
traditionally been  required.  Decisions  in  the  areas  of
criminal procedure,  voting rights  and education in America
suggest that  the traditional approach may not be completely
adequate. In  these areas,  the inquiry whether equality has
been achieved no longer ends with numerical equality; rather
the equality  clause has  been held  to require	 resort to a
standard of  proportional equality which requires the state,
in framing  legislation, to take into account the private in
equalities   of	   wealth,   of	   education	and    other
circumstances(2).
</p><p id="p_120">     The idea  of compensatory	state action  to make people
who are	 really unequal in their wealth, education or social
environment, equal, in specified areas, was developed by the
Supreme Court  of the  United States. Rousseau has said: "It
is precisely  because the  force of  circumstances tends  to
destroy equality  that force of legislation must always tend
to maintain it (3)."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">953</span>
<p id="p_121">     In Griffin	 v. Illinois(1),  an indigent  defendant was
unable to  take advantage of the one appeal of right granted
by Illinois  law because  he could  not afford	to  buy	 the
necessary transcript.  Such transcripts	 were made available
to all	defendants on  payment or  a  similar  fee;  but  in
practice  only	non-indigents  were  able  to  purchase	 the
transcript and	take the  appeal. The Court said that "there
can be	no equal  justice where the kind of trial a man gets
depends on  the amount	of money  he has"  and held that the
Illinois procedure violated the equal protection clause. The
state did  not have  to make  appellate review	available at
all; but  if it	 did, it  could not  do so  in a  way  which
operated to  deny access  to  review  to  defendants  solely
because of  their indigency.  A similar theory underlies the
requirement  that  counsel  be	provided  for  indigents  on
appeal. In  Douglas v.	California(2), the case involved the
California procedure  which guaranteed	one appeal  of right
for criminal  defendants convicted  at trial. In the case of
indigents the appellate court checked over the record to see
whether it would be of advantage to the defendant or helpful
to the	appellate court	 to have  counsel appointed  for the
appeal. A  negative answer  meant that	the indigent  had to
appeal pro  se if at all. The Court held that this procedure
denied defendant  the equal  protection of  the	 laws.	Even
though	the  state  was	 pursuing  an  otherwise  legitimate
objective  of	providing  counsel  only  for  non-frivolous
claims, it  had created	 a situation in which the well-to-do
could always  have  a  lawyer-even  for	 frivolous  appeals-
whereas the indigent could not.
</p><p id="p_122">     Justice Harlan,  dissenting in both Griffin and Douglas
cases (supra)  said that  they represented  a new  departure
from the  traditional view  that numerically equal treatment
cannot violate	the equal  protection clause.  He  concluded
that the  effect of  the  decisions  was  to  require  state
discrimination. He said:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">	  "The Court  thus holds that, at least in this area
     of	 criminal   appeals,  the  Equal  Protection  Clause
     imposes on	 the States  an affirmative duty to lift the
     handicaps	flowing	  from	 differences   in   economic
     circumstances.  That  holding  produces  the  anomalous
     result that  a constitutional  admonition to the States
     to treat  all persons  equally means  in this  instance
     that Illinois must give to some that it requires others
     to pay  for....It may  accurately be said that the real
     issue  in	 this  case  is	 not  whether  Illinois	 has
     discriminated  but	  whether   it	 has   a   duty	  to
     discriminate."</blockquote>
<p id="p_123">     Though in one sense Justice Harlan is correct, when one
comes to  think of  the real  effect of	 his  view,  one  is
inclined to  think that the opinion failed to recognise that
there are  several ways of looking at equality, and treating
people equally	in one	respect always	results	 in  unequal
treatment in  some other  respects. For	 Mr. Justice Harlan,
the only  type	of  equality  that  mattered  was  numerical
equality in the terms upon which transcripts were offered to
defendants. The	 maiority, on  the other  hand, took  a view
which would bring about equality
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">954</span>
in fact,  requiring similar  availability to all of criminal
appeals in  Griffin's  case  and  counsel-attended  criminal
appeals in  Douglas'  case.  To	 achieve  this	result,	 the
legislature had	 to resort  to a  proportional	standard  of
equality. These	 cases are remarkable in that they show that
the kind  of equality  which is	 considered important in the
particular context  and hence  of the respect in which it is
necessary to treat people equally(1).
</p><p id="p_124">     Look at  the approach  of the  Supreme Court  of United
States	of   America  in   Harper  v.	Virginia  Board	  of
Elections(2). The  Court there	declared as unconstitution a
Virginia poll  tax of  $ 1.50  per  person  which  had	been
applied to  all indiscriminately. As in Griffin and Douglas,
the  state  had	 treated  everyone  numerically	 alike	with
respect to  the fee. Whatever discrimination existed was the
result of  the state's	failure to proportion the fee on the
basis of  need or,  what is  the same  thing,  to  employ  a
numerically equal  distribution with  respect  to  the	vote
itself.	 The   result  again   is  a  requirement  that	 the
legislature  should  take  note	 of  difference	 in  private
circumstances in formulating its policies.
</p><p id="p_125">     There is  no reason  why this  Court  should  not	also
require the  state  to	adopt  a  standard  of	proportional
equality which takes account of the differing conditions and
circumstances  of   a  class   of  citizens  whenever  those
conclusions and	 circumstances stand  in the  way  of  their
equal access to the enjoyment of basic rights or claims.
</p><p id="p_126">     The concept  of equality  of opportunity  in matters of
employment is  wide enough to include within it compensatory
measures to  put the  members of  the Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled  Tribes   on	par   with  the	  members  of  other
communities which  would enable	 them to  get their share of
representation in  public service. How can any member of the

power of  the State  to make  reservation at  the  stage  of
promotion also	and therefore  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_375">Article 16(1)</a>  cannot include
within its  compass the	 power to give any adventitious aids

reservation is	necessary either  at the initial stage or at
the stage  of promotion or at both to ensure for the members

opportunity in the matter of employment. I see no reason why
that is	 not permissible  under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_376">Article	 16(1)</a> as that alone
might put  them on  a parity with the forward communities in
the  matter  of	 achieving  the	 result	 which	equality  of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">955</span>
attained in  the  result.  Formal  equality  of	 opportunity
simply enables	people with  more education and intelligence

equality if  its object is to bring those who share a common
characteristic under  a class for differential treatment for
sufficient and	justifiable reasons. In this view, I have no
doubt that  the principle  laid down  in  <a href="/doc/59130/" id="a_394">All-India  Station
Masters'  and  Assistant  Station  Masters'  Association  v.
General	 Manager,  Central  Railway</a>  and  Others(1),  <a href="/doc/627937/" id="a_395">S.  G.

prescription of	 a reasonable  qualification for appointment
or for	promotion. Any	provision as  to  qualification	 for
employment or  appointment to an office reasonably fixed and
applicable to  all would  be consistent with the doctrine of
equality of opportunity under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_399">Article 16(1) [</a>see <a href="/doc/1074353/" id="a_400">The General
Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari</a>(3)].
</p><p id="p_136">     Rule 13  provides that  no person shall be eligible for
appointment to	any service  unless he possesses the special
qualification and  has passed  such special  tests as may be
prescribed in that behalf by special rules or possesses such
special qualification  as he  considered to be equivalent to
the said special qualification or special tests.
</p><p id="p_137">     The  material  provision  in  rule	 13A  provides	that

therein or  in any  class thereof, a member of a service who
has not	 passed the said test but is otherwise qualified and

<p id="p_138">     Rule 14  provides for  reservation of  appointments  to
members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
</p><p id="p_139">     Rule 13AA	has  been  enacted  not	 with  the  idea  of
dispensing  with  the  minimum	qualification  required	 for
promotion to  a higher	category or  class, but only to give
enough breathing  space to  enable the	members of Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled Tribes  to acquire  it. The purpose of
the classification  made in  rule 13AA	viz., of putting the
members of  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes  in	 one
class and giving them an extension of time for acquiring the
test qualification  prescribed by rule 13 and rule 13A is to
enable them to have their due claim of representation in the
higher category	 without sacrificing the efficiency implicit
in the	passing of  the test.  That the	 passing of  some of
these tests  does not  spell in	 the realm  of minimum basic
requirement of efficiency is clear from rule 13A. That rule,
at any	rate, contemplated  passing of	the test  by all the
employees within  two  years  of  its  introduction  showing
thereby that acquisition of the test qualification was not a
sine qua  non  for  holding  the  posts.  Rule	13(b)  which
provides for  exemption from  passing the  test	 would	also
indicate  that	 passing  of  the  test	 is  not  absolutely
essential for  holding the  post. The classification made in
rule 13AA  has a  reasonable nexus  with the  purpose of the
law, namely,  to enable	 the members of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  to get their due share of promotion to the
higher grade in the service without impairing the efficiency
of  administration.  Rule  13AA	 is  not  intended  to	give
permanent exemption  to the  members of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  from passing	the test but only reasonable
time to	 enable them  to do so. The power to grant exemption
under the  rule, like  every other  power, is  liable to  be
abused. If  the power  is abused  and  the  members  of	 the
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled	 Tribes are  given  favoured
treatment to  the extent  not warranted	 by their legitimate
claim, the  courts are not rendered helpless. That the power
is liable  to be  abused is  no reason to hold that the rule
itself viz., rule 13AA, is bad.
</p><p id="p_140">     The ultimate  reason for the demand of equality for the
members of  backward classes  is a  moral perspective  which
affirms the intrinsic value of all human beings and call for
a society  which provides those conditions of life which men
need for  development of  their varying capacities. It is an
assertion of  human equality  in the sense that it manifests
an equal  concern for  the well being of all men. On the one
hand it involves a demand for the removal of those obstacles
and impediments which stand in the way of the development of
human capacities-that  is it  is a call for the abolition of
unjustifiable inequalities.  On the  other hand,  the demand
itself gets  its sense	and moral  driving  force  from	 the
recognition that  'the poorest	he that is in England hath a
life to live, as the greatest he'(1).

<p id="p_141">     I agree  with the	conclusion  of	my  Lord  the  Chief
Justice that the appeal should be allowed.
</p><p id="p_142">     BEG, J  : I share the conclusion reached by the learned
Chief Justice  and my learned brethren Mathew, Krishna Iyer,
and Murtaza  Fazal Ali.	 I would, however, like to add, with
great respect,	that a view which though not pressed in this
Court by  the Advocate General of Kerala, perhaps because it
had been  repelled by  the Kerala High Court, seems to me to
supply	a   more  satisfying  legal  justification  for	 the
benefits conferred,  in	 the  form  of	an  extended  period
granted to  Government employees of a backward class to pass
a qualifying  test  for	 promotion  to	a  higher  grade  of
service, that  is to  say, from	 that of  the Lower Division
Clerks to  that of the Upper Division Clerks in the State of
Kerala. I think that we have to, in such a case, necessarily
consider whether  the manner  in which	Scheduled Caste	 and
Scheduled Tribe	 Government employees  are  treated  by	 the
rules and  orders under	 consideration falls  within <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_401">Article
16(4)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_143">     Strictly speaking,	 the  view  adopted  by	 my  learned
brother Khanna,	 that the ambit of the special protection of
"equality of  opportunity  in  matters	relating  to  public
service", which can be made available to members of backward
classes of  citizens, is  exhausted by	<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_402">Article 16(4)</a> of the
Constitution, seems  inescapable. <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_403">Article 16</a> is after all, a
facet of  the grand principles embraced by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_404">Article 14</a> of our
Constitution. It  guarantees :	"Equality of  opportunity in
matters of  public appointment".  It  does  so	in  absolute
terms.	It   is	 a   necessary	consequence  and  a  special
application of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_405">Article 14</a> in an important field where denial
of  equality  of  opportunity  cannot  be  permitted.  While
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_406">Article 16(1)</a>  sets out	 the positive  aspect of equality of
opportunity in	matters relating to employment by the State,
<a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_407">Article 16(2)</a>  negatively prohibits  discrimination  on	 the
grounds given  in <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_408">Article  16(2)</a>  in  the  area	 covered  by
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_409">Article 16(1)</a>  of the  Constitution. If	 Scheduled Castes do
not fall  within the  ambit of	<a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_410">Article	 16(2</a>),	 but,  as  a
"backward class"  of citizens, escape the direct prohibition
it is  because the  provisions of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_411">Article 16(4)</a> make such an
escape	possible   for	them.  They  could  also  avoid	 the
necessary consequences	of the	positive mandate  of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_412">Article
16(1)</a> if  they come  within the	 only exception contained in
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_413">Article 16(4)</a>  of the  Constitution. I	respectfully  concur
with my	 learned brother  Khanna and  Gupta that it would be
dangerous to  extend the  limits of  protection against	 the
operation of  the principle  of equality  of opportunity  in
this field  bevond its	express constitutional authorisation
by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_414">Article 16(4).</a>
</p><p id="p_144">     When citizens  are already	 employed  in  a  particular

quite reasonably  and logically,  be said  to belong  to one
class, atleast	for purposes  of promotion in public service
for which there ought to be a real "equality of opportunity"

them are  also	members	 of  an	 economically  and  socially
backward  class	  continue  to	be  material,  or,  strictly
speaking, even	relevant. Their entry into the same relevant
class as  others must  be deemed  to indicate  that they  no
longer suffer  from the	 handicaps of  a backward class. For
purposes of  Government service	 the source  from which they
are drawn  should cease	 to matter.  As Government  servants
they would,  strictly speaking,	 form  only  one  class	 for

</p><p id="p_146">     As has  been pointed  out by  Mylord the Chief Justice,
the protection	of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_415">Article  16(1)</a> continues  throughout	 the
period of  service. If <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_416">Article 16(1)</a> is only a special facet
or field,  in which an application of the general principles
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_417">Article  14</a> is  fully worked out or stated, as it must be
presumed to  be, there is no room left for importing into it
any other  or further  considerations from <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_418">Article 14.</a> Again
the express provisions of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_419">Article 16(4)</a> would be presumed to
exhaust all  exceptions made  in favour	 of backward classes
not contained  there if	 we apply  the maxim expressio unius
est exclusio  alterius". It  is true  that the	principle of
reasonable classification  may still claim recognition or be
relevant for working out the exact significance of "equality
of opportunity"	 even within <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_420">Article 16(1)</a> in some aspect or
context other  than the one indicated by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_421">Article 16(4).</a> But,
in view	 of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_422">Article  16(4</a>), that  aspect or  context must be
different  from	 one  aimed  at	 realizing  the	 objects  of
Articles 46 and 335 in the sphere of Government service. The
specified and  express mode  of realization of these objects
contained in  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_423">Article 16(4</a>), must exclude the possibility of
other methods  which could  be implied and read into <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_424">Article
16(1)</a> for securing them in this field. One could think of so
many other  legally permissible	 and  possibly	better,	 or,
atleast more  direct,  methods	of  removing  socio-economic
inequalities by	 appropriate  legislative  action  in  other
fields	left   open   and   unoccupied	 for   purposes	  of
discrimination in favour of the backward.
</p><p id="p_147">     In relation  to promotions,  "equality of	opportunity"
could  only   mean  subjection	to  similar  conditions	 for
promotion by  being subjected  uniformly to  similar or same
kind of	 tests. This  guarantee was,  in fact,	intended  to
protect the  claims  of	 merit	and  efficiency	 as  against
incursions  of	 extraneous  considerations.  The  guarantee
contained in  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_425">Article 16(1)</a>  is not,  by  itself,  aimed  at
removal	 of   backwardness   due   to	socio-economic	 and
educational disparties	produced by  past history  of social
oppression, exploitation,  or  degradation  of	a  class  of
persons. In  fact, efficiency tests, as parts of a mechanism
to provide  equality of	 opportunity, are meant to bring out
and measure actually existing inequalities in competence and
capacity or  potentialities so	as to  provide	a  fair	 and
rational  basis	  for  justifiable   discrimination  between
candidates. Whatever  may be  the  real	 causes	 of  unequal
performances which  imposition of  tests may  disclose,	 the
purpose of equality of opportunity by means of tests is only
to  ensure   a	fair   competition  in	securing  posts	 and
promotions in  Government service,  and not  the removal  of
causes for unequal performances in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">961</span>
competitions  for  these  posts	 or  promotions.  Thus,	 the
purposes of Articles 46 and 335, which are really extraneous
to the	objects of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_426">Article 16(1</a>), can only be served in such
a context  by rules  which secure preferential treatment for
the backward  classes and detract from the plain meaning and
obvious	 implications  of  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_427">Article  16(1)</a>  and	<a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_428">16(2).</a>	Such
special	 treatment   mitigates	the   rigour  of   a  strict
application of	the principle contained in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_429">Article 16(1).</a> It
constitutes a  departure  from	the  principle	of  absolute
equality of  opportunity in the application of uniform tests
of competence.	<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_430">Article 16(4)</a>  was designed to reconcile the
conflicting  pulls   of	 <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_431">Article   16(1</a>),  representing	 the
dynamics of  justice, conceived of as equality in conditions
under  which   candidates  actually  compete  for  posts  in
Government service,  and of  Articles 46  and 335, embodying
the duties  of the  State to  promote the  interests of	 the
economically, educationally,  and socially backward so as to
release them  from the	clutches of  social injustice. These
encroachments on  the field  of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_432">Article	 16(1)</a> can  only  be
permitted to the extent they are warranted by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_433">Article 16(4).</a>
To read broader concepts of social justice and equality into
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_434">Article 16(1)</a>  itself may stultify this provision itself and
make <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_435">Article 16(4)</a> otiose.
</p><p id="p_148">     Members of	 a  backward  class  could  be	said  to  be
discriminated against  if severer  tests were prescribed for
them. But,  this is  not the position in the case before us.
All promotees,	belonging to any class, caste, or creed, are
equally subjected  to efficiency  tests of the same type and
standard. The  impugned rules  do not  dispense	 with  these
tests for  any class  or group. Indeed, such tests could not
be dispensed  with for employees from Scheduled Castes, even
as a  backward class,  keeping in  view	 the  provisions  of
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_436">Article 335</a>  of the  Constitution. All	that happens here is
that the  backward class  of employees	is  given  a  longer
period of  time to pass the efficiency tests and prove their
merit as  determined by	 such tests. It has been, therefore,
argued that, in this respect, there is substantial equality.
In other  words, the argument is that if <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_437">Article 16(1)</a> could
be interpreted	a little less rigidly and more liberally the
discrimination involved	 here will not fall outside it. Even
if this	 was a	tenable view.  I would,	 for all the reasons
given here,  prefer to	find the  justification if  this  is
possible, in the express provisions of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_438">Article 16(4)</a> because
this is where such a justification should really lie.
</p><p id="p_149">     In the  case before  us,  it  appears  that  respondent
petitioner's grievance	was  that  certain  members  of	 the
Scheduled Castes,  as  a  backward  class,  had	 been  given
preference over	 him inasmuch as he was not promoted despite
having passed  the efficiency  test, but  certain members of
the backward  class were  allowed to  remain in	 the  higher
posts as  temporary promotees,	without	 having	 passed	 the
efficiency tests,  because they	 had been  given an extended
period	of   time  to  satisfy	the  qualifying	 tests.	 The
petitioner thus	 claimed priority  on the  ground  of  merit
judged solely  by taking  and passing  the  efficiency	test
earlier. Apparently,  he was  not even promoted, whereas the
backward class	employees said to have been given preference
over him
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">962</span>
were, presumably  quite	 satisfactorily,  discharging  their
duties in  the higher  grade  in  which	 they  were  already
working as  temporary promotees.  He also  admits  that	 the
respondents, over  whom he  claims preference for promotion,
were his  seniors in  service who had put in longer terms of
total	service	   before   their   conditional	  promotions
temporarily into  the grade of the Upper Division Clerks. It
seems to  me that  the taking  and passing of a written test
earlier than  another employee	could not be the sole factor
to consider  in deciding  upon a  claim to superiority or to
preference on  grounds of merit and efficiency for promotion
as a Government servant.
</p><p id="p_150">     The relevant  rule 13A  shows  that  a  person  who  is
allowed temporarily  to work in the cadre of promotees, even
without having	passed the  special efficiency	test,  must,
nevertheless, have  satisfied the  test of  being "otherwise
qualified and  suitable for  appointment". Thus, an employee
from a	Scheduled Caste has also to be "otherwise qualified"
before he  is given  an	 opportunity  to  work	with  others
similarly promoted temporarily. The only difference is that,
whereas the  others get only two years from the introduction
of the	new test  within which	to qualify  according to the
newly introduced test, an employee of a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled Tribe, similarly placed, gets two more years under
the second  proviso. The  impugned rule 13AA, however, gives
power to  the Government  to  specify  a  longer  period  of
exemption if it considers this to be necessary. The Governor
passed the  impugned order  of 13-1-1972  under	 rule  13AA,
extending the period still more. This order and the relevant
rules 13A and 13AA are already set out above in the judgment
of  Mylord   the  Chief	 Justice.  I  need  not,  therefore,
reproduce them here.
</p><p id="p_151">     What is  the effect  of the provisions of Rules 13A and
13AA and  the order  of 13-1-1972  ? Is it not that a person
who is	in the	position of  the respondent  petitioner must
wait for a place occupied by or reserved for a person from a
Scheduled Caste	 or Tribe,  treated as backward class, until
it is  shown that  the employee	 from the backward class has
failed to  take and  pass the  new test despite the extended
period given  to him.  The effect  of the relaxation is that
the  backward	class  employee	  continues  in	  the	post
temporarily  for   a  longer   period  before  being  either
confirmed or  reverted. For  this period,  the post  remains
reserved for  him. If  he does	not satisfy  the  efficiency
tests even  within this	 extended period he has to revert to
the lower  grade. If  he does satisfy the special efficiency
test, in  this extended period, he is confirmed in the class
of promotees  into which  he obtained  entry  because  of  a
reservation. Among  meanings of the term "reserve", given in
the Oxford  Dictionary, are  "To keep back or hold over to a
later time  or place for further treatment; to set apart for
some purpose or with some end in view". In the Webster's New
International  Dictionary   IInd  Edn.	(at  p.	 2118),	 the
following meanings  are given:	"To keep  back; to retain or
hold over  to a	 future time  or place; not to deliver, make
over or	 disclose it  at once".	 The  result  of  the  above
mentioned rules	 and orders  does seem to me to be a kind of
reservation. If	 a reservation	of posts under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_439">Article 16(4)</a>
for employees of backward classes could include complete re-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">963</span>
<p id="p_152">servation of  higher posts  to which they could be promoted,
about which  there could  be no doubt now, I fail to see why
it cannot  be partial  or for  a part  of  the	duration  of
service and hedged round with the condition that a temporary
promotion  would   operate  as	 a  complete  and  confirmed
promotion only	if the	temporary  promotee  satisfies	some
tests within a given time.
</p><p id="p_153">     If the  impugned rules and orders could be viewed as an
implementation of  a  policy  of  qualified  or	 partial  or
conditional reservation,  in the form indicated above, which
could satisfy  the requirements	 of substantial equality, in
keeping with <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_440">Article 335</a>, and meet the demands of equity and
justice looked	at from the broader point of view of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_441">Article
46</a> of  the Constitution,  they could,  in my  view, also  be
justified under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_442">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_154">     It may  be that  the learned  Advocate General  for the
appellant State	 did not  press the ground that the impugned
rules and  orders are  governed by  <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_443">Article 16(4)</a> because of
the tests  required for	 complete  or  absolute	 reservation
dealt with  in <a href="/doc/1466728/" id="a_444">T.  Devadasan v. the Union of India &amp; Anr</a>.(1)
and <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_445">M. R. Balajli &amp; Ors. v. State of Mysore</a>(2), where it was
held that  more than  50% reservations	for a backward class
would violate  the requirement of reasonableness inasmuch as
it would  exclude too  large a	proportion of  others. Apart
from the  fact that the case before us is distinguishable as
it is  one of  only a  partial or  temporary and conditional
reservation, it	 is disputed here that the favoured class of
employees really constituted more than fifty per cent of the
total number  of Government  servants of  this	class  (i.e.
Clerks) if  the overall	 position and picture, by taking the
number of  employees in all Govt. Departments, is taken into
account. Furthermore,  it is pointed out that a large number
of  temporary	promotions  of	 backward  class  Government
servants of  this grade	 had taken  place  in  1972  in	 the
Registration Department, in which the petitioning respondent
worked, because	 promotions of	backward class employees had
been held up in the past due to want of necessary provisions
in rules which could enable the Government to give effect to
a policy  of a	sufficient representation  of backward class
employees of  this grade in Government service. The totality
of facts  of this  case is distinguish able in their effects
from those in cases cited before us. No case was cited which
could fully cover the position we have before us now.
</p><p id="p_155">     I am  not satisfied  that the  only ground given by the
High Court  for refusing  to give  the benefits	 of impugned
rules and  orders to the backward class Government servants,
that they  fall outside	 the purview  of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_446">Article  16(4</a>), was
substantiated. It  was	for  the  respondent  petitioner  to
discharge the  burden  of  establishing	 a  constitutionally
unwarranted discrimination  against him.  His petition ought
in my  opinion, to have been dismissed on the ground that he
had failed to discharge this initial burden.

</p><p id="p_159">     Law, including constitutional law, can no longer 'go it
alone' but  must be  illumined in the interpretative process
by sociology  and allied  fields of  knowledge. Indeed,	 the
term 'constitutional  law' symbolizes an intersection of law
and politics, wherein issues of political power are acted on
by persons  trained  in	 the  legal  tradition,	 working  in
judicial institutions,	following  the	procedures  of	law,
thinking  as   lawyers	think.(1)   So	much   so,  a  wider
perspective is	needed to  resolve issues  of constitutional
law. May  be, one  cannot agree	 with the view of an eminent
jurist and  former Chief Justice of India: 'the judiciary as
a whole	 is  not  interested  in  the  policy  underlying  a
legislative measure'  (Mr. Hidayatullah-'Democracy  in India
and Judicial  Process'-1965-p.	70).  Moreover,	 the  Indian
Constitution   is    a	 great	 social	  document,   almost
revolutionary  in   its	 aim  of  transforming	a  medieval,
hierarchical society  into a  modern, egalitarian democracy.
Its provisions	can be	comprehended  only  by	a  spacious,
social-science	approach,   not	 by   pedantic,	 traditional
legalism. Here	we are	called upon to delimit the amplitude
and decode  the implications of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_448">Art. 16(1)</a> in the context of
certain special	 concessions relating  to employment,  under
the Kerala  State (the appellant), given to Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled  Tribes (for short, hereinafter referred to as
harijans) whose	 social lot  and economic  indigence are  an
Indian	reality	  recognized  by   many	 Articles   of	 the
Constitution. An  overview of the decided cases suggests the
need to	 re-interpret the  dynamic import  of the  'equality
clauses' and, to stress again, beyond reasonable doubt, that
the paramount  law,  which  is	organic	 and  regulates	 our
nation's growing  life, must  take  in	its  sweep  'ethics,
economics, politics and sociology'. Equally pertinent to the
issue mooted before us is the lament of Friedman:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_39">	  "It would  be tragic	if the law were so petrified
     as to be unable to respond to the unending challenge of
     evolutionary or revolutionary changes in society."(2)
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">965</span>
The main assumptions which Friedman makes are:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">	  "first, the  law is,	in  Holmes'  phrase,  not  a
     'brooding omnipotence  in	the  sky',  but	 a  flexible
     instrument of  social order, dependent on the political
     values  of	  the	society	  which	  it   purports	  to
     regulate...."(1)
     Naturally	surges	 the  interrogation,  what  are	 the
challenges of  changing values	to which  the  guarantee  of
equality must  respond and  how? To  pose the  problem	with
particular reference  to our  case, does  the impugned	rule
violate the  constitutional creed  of equal  opportunity  in
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_449">Art. 16</a> by resort to a suspect classification or revivify it
by  making  the	 less  equal  more  equal  by  a  legitimate
differentiation ? Chief Justice Marshall's classic statement
in Mc  Culloch v  Maryland(2) followed by Justice Brennan in
Kazenbach v. Morgan(3) remains a beacon light:
	  "Let the  end be  legitimate, let it be within the
     scope of  the constitution,  and all  means  which	 are
     appropriate, which	 are plainly  adapted to  that	end,
     which are	not prohibited,	 but consist with the letter
     and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional."</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">     The background  facts may	be briefly  set out  in	 the
elemental form.	 The Kerala  State and	Subordinate Services
Rules, 1958  (for short,  the rules) regulate the conditions
of service of the State employees of the lower order. We are
concerned  with	  the  prescription  of	 qualifications	 for
promotion of  the lower	 division clerks  to upper  division
posts in  the Registration  Department. Rule  13 insists  on
passing certain	 tests	for  promotional  eligibility.	When
tests were  newly introduced, r. 13A gave 2 years from their
introduction for passing them, to all hands-harijan and non-
</blockquote><p id="p_160">harijan, but  the former  enjoyed an  extra two	 year  grace
period.	 Rule	13B  totally  exempted	pentagenarians	from
passing	 these	tests.	Rule  13AA,  which  is	impugned  as
violative of  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_450">Art. 16(1)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_451">(2)</a>  of the  Constitution, was
promulgated on January 13, 1972 and it reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">	  "13AA. Notwithstanding anything contained in these
     rules, the	 Government may,  by  order,  exempt  for  a
     specified period  any member or members, belonging to a
     Scheduled Caste  or a  Scheduled Tribe,  and already in
     service, from  passing the tests referred to in rule 13
     or rule 13A of the said Rules.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">	  Provided that this rule shall not be applicable to
     tests prescribed  for  purposes  of  promotion  of	 the
     executive	staff	below  the  rank  of  Sub-Inspectors
     belonging to the Police Department."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">966</span>
<p id="p_161">A Note	appended to the rule gives the raison d' etre of the
rule:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_44">	  "It has  been brought	 to the notice of Government
     that a  large number  of Harijan  employees  in  Public
     Service are facing immediate reversion from their posts
     for want  of test	qualifications. So  it is considered
     necessary to  incorporate an  enabling provision in the
     Kerala State  and Subordinate  Services Rules,  1958 to
     grant by  order temporary	exemption to members already
     in service	 belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
     Tribes from  passing all  tests for a specified period.
     This notification	is intended  to	 achieve  the  above
     object."</blockquote>
<p id="p_162">     A break-up	 of r.	13AA of	 the rules  certainly  gives
power to  Government to extend the time to harijan officials
of 'subordinate	 services' for	passing tests prescribed for
occupying promotional posts. But it does not for ever exempt
these hands  but only  waive for  a  specified,	 presumably,
short term.  Nor does  it relax	 the minimal  qualifications
held necessary	for these  posts from  the point  of view of
basic administrative  efficiency.  The	subsidiary  need  of
passing certain	 new tests, for which all employees get some
period (from  the time of their introduction) is relaxed for
a longer  period in  the case  of harijan hands under r. 13A
and still more under r. 13AA. We must expect that Government
will, while  fixing the longer grace time for passing tests,
have regard to administrative efficiency. You can't throw to
the winds  considerations of  administrative capability	 and
grind the  wheels of  Government to  a halt  in the  name of
'harijan  welfare'.   The  Administration   runs  for	good
government, not to give jobs to harijans. We must accept the
necessary import of the rule as a limited concession to this
weaker group and test its vires on this basis.
</p><p id="p_163">     One significant  factor must  be  remembered  to  guard
against	 exaggerating  the  bearing  of	 these	tests  as  a
coefficient of	efficiency.  Certainly,	 they  were  not  so
important as  all that	because r.  13A-not  challenged	 all
these years-gave  2 years'  qualifying period  for all and 4
years for harijans. Also those above 50 years of age did not
have to	 pass the  tests at  all (r. 13B). The nature of the
tests vis a vis the nature of work of upper division clerks,
and their  indispensability for official capability have not
been brought  out in  the writ	petition  and,	absent	such
serious suggestions,  we have to assume that Government (the
author of  r.13)  would	 have  granted	varying	 periods  of
exemption only	because of  their  desirability,  not  their
precedent necessity.  To expatiate  a little more, it is not
unusual to  fix basic  qualifications for  eligibility to  a
post. Their  possession is  a must,  having  regard  to	 the
functions of  the office. A second and secondary category of
qualifications is  insisted on	as useful  to discharge	 the
duties of  the	post  e.g.,  accounts  test,  or  civil	 and
criminal judicial  tests and  the  like,  depending  on	 the
department where  he is to work. After all here he is a pen-
pushing clerk,	not a  magistrate, accounts  officer, forest
officer, sub-registrar, space scientist or too administrator
or one	on whose initiative the wheels of a department speed
up or  slow down.  Even so,  it makes his clerical work more
understanding and efficient. These
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">967</span>
tests are,  therefore, demanded	 for better performance, not
basic  proficiency,   but  relaxation  is  also	 allowed  in
suitable class	of cases,  their absence  not being fatal to
efficiency. A  third class  of virtues	which will  make the
employee ultra	efficient, but	is not regarded as cardinal,
is listed as entitled to preference. A doctorate in business
management, or LL.M. where the basic degree is the essential
requisite, social  service or  leadership  training,  sports
distinction and a host of other extra attainments which will
improve the  aptitude and  equipment of	 the officer  in his
speciality but are, in no sense, necessary-these are welcome
additives, are	good and  may even get the employee a salary
raise but are not insisted on for initial appointment to the
post either  as a  direct recruit  or as  a  promotee.	This
trichotomy of  qualifications makes pragmatic meaning to any
employer and  is within	 anyone's ken  if he  turns over the
advertisements	 in    newspapers.   To	  relax	  on   basic
qualifications is  to compromise with minimum administrative
efficiency; to	relent,	 for  a	 time,	on  additional	test
qualifications is  to take a calculated but controlled risk,
assured of a basic standard of performance; to encourage the
possession of higher excellence is to upgrade the efficiency
status	of   the  public  servant  and,	 eventually  of	 the
department. This  is the  sense and essence of the situation
arising in  the present	 case,	viewed	from  the  angle  of
administrative requirements or fair employment criteria.
</p><p id="p_164">     Back now  to the  rule  of	 exemption  and	 its  vires.
Frankly, here  the respondents	who have  passed the 'tests'
are stalled  in their  promotion because  of the new rule of
harijan exemption.  As individuals,  their rights  vis a vis
their harijan brethren are regarded unequally. In a strictly
competitive   context	or   narrowly	performance-oriented
standard, r. 13AA discriminates between a harijan and a non-
harijan. The  question is  whether a  perceptive sensitivity
sees on	 'equal opportunity'  a critical distinction between
distribution  according	  to  'merit'	of  individuals	 and
distribution  according	  to  'need'  of  depressed  groups,
subject to  broad efficiency  criteria.	 We  enter  here  'a
conceptual disaster area'.
</p><p id="p_165">     Factual contexts dictate State action. The differential
impact	of   a	law  on	 a  class  will	 influence  judicial
evaluation of the reasonableness of a classification and its
relation to a purpose which is permissible. Courts, however,
adopt a	 policy of  restrained review where the situation is
complex and is intertwined with social, historical and other
substantially	human	 factors.   Judicial   deference-not
abdication-is  best  expressed	by  Justice  Holmes  in	 his
dissent in Louisvilla Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Coleman
	  "But when  it is seen that a line or a point there
     must be,  and that there is no mathematical and logical
     way  of  fixing  it  precisely,  the  decision  of	 the
     legislature must  be accepted unless we can say that it
     is very wide of any reasonable mark."
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">968</span>
<p id="p_166">In Buck v. Bell Holmes J. observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_45">	  "The law  does all that is needed when it does all
     that it  can, indicates  a policy,	 applies it  to	 all
     within the	 lines, and  seeks to bring within the lines
     all similarly  situated so far and so fast as its means
     allow".
</blockquote><p id="p_167">Given a	 legitimate over-riding	 purpose for selectivity the
Court passes,  leaving it  to the  law-maker  the  intricate
manner	 of    implementation.	 Faced	  with	 a   suspect
classification	based	on  a  quasi-caste  differentia	 and
apparently injuring  administrative quality, the Court turns
activist. Conceptual  equilibrium between these two lines is
the correct guideline.
</p><p id="p_168">     The  operational  technique  may  vary  with  time	 and
circumstance but the goal and ambit must be constitutionally
sanctioned. In	the instant  case, the	State  has  taken  a
certain step  to advance the economic interests of harijans.
What-if we  break down	the rule  into	its  components-have
Government done	 ? Have	 they transgressed  the rights under
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_452">Art.  16(1)</a>   <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_453">&amp;	 (2)   ?</a>  If   they  have,   the  Court,  as
constitutional	 invigorator	interdicts,   after   making
permissible presumptions  in favour  of	 State	actions	 and
importing the  liberal spirit of effective equality into the
mandate of  Arts. 14  and 16. Otherwise, the hammer does not
fall.
</p><p id="p_169">     Why was  this  second  'holiday'  under  rule  13AA  to
harijans granted  ? The hapless circumstance which compelled
this course  was, according  to the  State, the need to help
this class,  acting within  the	 constitutional	 bounds,  to
avert mass  reversion to  lower	 posts,	 without  abandoning
insistence on  passing 'tests'.	 The  Note  to	r.  13AA  is
explanatory. The State viewed this disturbing situation with
concern, and,  having regard  to their	backward  condition,
made r.	 13AA which  conferred power  on Government to grant
further spells	of grace  time to  get through	these tests.
Simultaneously, a  period within which two opportunities for
passing tests  would be	 available was	afforded by  a	G.O.
issued under  r. 13AA.	The consequence	 was their immediate
reversion was  averted and  the promotion  prospects of	 the
non-harijan writ petitioners, who were test-qualified, stood
postponed. This	 grievance of  theirs drove them to the High
Court where  the rule  of temporary  exemption from  passing
tests for  promotional eligibility in favour of harijans was
held ultra vires Arts. 16(1) and 335.
</p><p id="p_170">     I shall  focus on the basis because my learned brethren
have dilated  on the  necessary details	 of facts  and, more
importantly, because  confusion on fundamentals deflects the
construction of	 constitutional clauses-all this against the
admitted backdrop  of die-hard	harijan	 bondage,  sometimes
subtle, sometimes gross. The learned Advocate General fairly
conceded-and  I	  think	 rightly-that  r.  13AA	 was  not  a
'reservation'  under   <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_454">Art.  16(4)</a>   and  yet  the  favoured
treatment to  harijan  clerks  was  valid,  being  based  on
reasonable   classification    under   a    constitutionally
recognised differentia which had a relation to the legi-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">969</span>
<p id="p_171">timate end  of promoting the advancement of this handicapped
class, subject	to administrative  efficiency.	The  learned
Solicitor General,  appearing on  notice by the Court to the
Attorney General,  stated the  law on  a broader  basis	 and
urged  that   the  grouping   of  classes  of  socially	 and
educationally downtrodden  people especially  the  Scheduled
Castes and Tribes, was good and did not offend <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_455">Art. 16(1)</a> or
(2). Shri  R. K.  Garg, for  some of the respondents and for
the interveners,  spread out  the social canvas, focussed on
the age-old suppression and consequential utter backwardness
of those  societal brackets  and the  State's obligation  to
wipe out  the centuries of deprivation by making a concerted
effort to  bring them  up to  the same	level as  the  other
classes so  that, after	 this levelling up, the whole nation
could  march   forward	on  terms  of  democratic  equality.
Discrimination	on  the	 ground	 of  caste  did	 not  arise,
according to  counsel, Scheduled Castes and Tribes being not
a caste	 but an	 amalgam of the socially lowly and the lost,
including groups  with a  caste savour.	 Shri Krishnamoorthy
Iyer, for  the respondents,  naturally	disputed  all  these
propositions. The  cornerstone of  his case  was that in the
field of  State employment caste-wise compassion to harijans
flew in	 the face  of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_456">Art.  16(1)</a> and  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_457">(2)</a> and	separate but
special treatment  was permissible  only  under	 <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_458">Art.  16(4)</a>
which was  expressly designed  as  benignant  discrimination
devoted to lifting backward classes to the level of the rest
through the  constitutional technology	of 'reservation'. To
travel beyond  this special  clause  and  evolve  a  general
doctrine of  backward classification  was to  over-power the
basic concept  of equality  and to  bring in,  by a specious
device, a  back-door casteism  subverting the  scheme  of  a
casteless  society   set  as   one  of	 the  goals  of	 our
constitutional	order.	 Efficiency  of	 administration,  an
important desideratum of public service, would also suffer.
</p><p id="p_172">     I will  examine these  contentions in  depth and detail
later in this judgment.
</p><p id="p_173">     Let us  proceed to	 assess the  constitutional merit of
the State's  ex facie  'unequal' service  rule favouring in-
service	 harijan   employees  in   a   realist	 socio-legal
perspective. But  before that,	some memorable facts must be
stated. The  Father of the National adopted, as his fighting
faith, the  uplift of  the bhangi  and his  assimilation, on
equal footing,	into Hindu  society, and  the  Constitution,
whose principal architect was himself a militant mahar, made
social justice	a founding  faith and built into it humanist
provisions to  lift the	 level of the lowly scheduled castes
and tribes  to make  democracy viable  and  equal  for	all.
Studies in  social anthropology	 tell us  how  cultural	 and
material suppression  has, over	 the  ages,  crippled  their
personality, and  current demography  says that nearly every
fifth Indian  is a  harijan and his social milieu is steeped
in  squalour.  The  conscience	of  the	 Constitution  found
adequate expression  on this  theme, in Dr. Ambedkar's words
of caution and premonition in the Constituent Assembly:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_46">	  "We must  begin by  acknowledging first that there
     is complete  absence of  two things  in Indian society.
     One of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">970</span>
     these is  equality. On  the social	 plane, we  have  in
     India a society based on privilege of graded inequality
     which means  elevation  for  some	and  degradation  of
     others. On	 the economic  plane, we  have a  society in
     which there are some who have immense wealth as against
     the many  who are living in abject poverty. On the 26th
     of January,  1950, we are going to enter into a life of
     contradictions. In	 politics we  will have equality and
     in social	and economic life we will have inequality...
     We must  remove  this  contradiction  at  the  earliest
     possible  moment,	 or  else   those  who	suffer	from
     inequality will  blow up  the  structure  of  political
     democracy which  this Assembly has so laboriously built
     up."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_47">     (Speeches, Vol. II, pp. 184-187).
</blockquote><p id="p_174">Judges	may   differ  in  constitutional  construction	but,
without peril  of distorting  the substance,  cannot discard
the activism  of the equal justice concept in the setting of
deep concern  for the weaker sections of the community. What
I endeavour to emphasize, as I will elaborate later, is that
equal justice  is an aspect of social justice, the salvation
of the	very weak  and down-trodden, and the methodology for
levelling them up to a real, not formal, equality, being the
accent.
</p><p id="p_175">     The Kerala	 State,	 the  appellant,  has  statistically
shown the  yawning gap	between	 what  number  of  posts  in
Government service  harijans are  entitled  to,	 population-
ratio wise, and the actual number of posts occupied by them.
Their 'official'  fate is no less ominous elsewhere in India
and would  have been poorer on the competitive market method
of selection  unaided by  'reservation'. The case for social
equality and  economic balance, in terms of employment under
the State,  cries for  more energised  administrative effort
and a  Government that	fails to  repair this depressed lot,
fools the  public on  harijan welfare. Indeed, an aware mass
of humanity,  denied justice  for generations, will not take
it lying  down too long but may explode into Dalit Panthers,
as did	the Black  Panthers in	another country, -a theme on
which Shri  Gajendragadkar, a former Chief Justice of India,
has  laid   disturbing	stress	 in  two  Memorial  Lectures
delivered recently.  Jurists must  listen to  real life and,
theory apart,  must be	alert enough  to read the writing on
the wall  !  Where  the	 rule  of  law	bars  the  doors  of
collective justice,  the crushed class will seek hope in the
streets!  The	architects  of	our  Constitution  were	 not
unfamiliar with	 direct action	where basic justice was long
withheld and  conceived of  'equal opportunity' as inclusive
of equalising  opportunity. Only a clinical study of organic
law will yield correct diagnostic results.
</p><p id="p_176">     Social engineering-which  is Law  in action- must adopt
new strategies	to liquidate  encrusted group  injustices or
surrender society  to traumatic	 tensions.  Equilibrium,  in
human terms, emerges from
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">971</span>
release of the handicapped and the primitive from persistent
social disadvantage,  by determined creative and canny legal
manouvres of the State, not by hortative declaration of arid
equality. 'To  discriminate positively in favour of the weak
may sometimes  be promotion  of genuine	 equality before the
law' as	 Anthony Lester	 argued in his talk in the B.B.C. in
1970 in	 the series:  'What is wrong with the Law'. 'One law
for the	 Lion and  Ox is oppression'. Or, indeed as was said
of another  age by  Anatole France, 'The law in its majestic
equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under
bridges,  to  beg  in  the  streets  and  to  steal  bread'.
Redistributive	justice	  to  harijan  humanity	 insists  on
effective reforms,  designed to produce equal partnership of
the erstwhile  'lowliest and  the lost',  by  State  action,
informed by  short-run and  long-run  sociologically  potent
perspective planning  and implementation.  An uneven  socio-
economic landscape hardly gives the joy or equal opportunity
and development	 or draw  forth	 their	best  from  manpower
resources now  wallowing in  the  low  visibility  areas  of
discontented life.
</p><p id="p_177">     The domination of a class generates, after a long night
of sleep  or stupor of the dominated, an angry awakening and
protestant resistance  and  this  conflict  between  thesis,
i.e., the  status quo,	and anti-thesis i.e., the hunger for
happy equality,	 propels new  forces of	 synthesis i.e.,  an
equitable constitution	order or  just society. Our founding
fathers, possessed  of spiritual  insight and  influenced by
the materialist	 interpretation of history, forestalled such
social pressures  and pre-empted  such economic upsurges and
gave us	 a trinity of commitments-justice : social, economic
and political.	The 'equality  Articles' are  part  of	this
scheme.	  My   proposition   is,   given   two	 alternative
understandings of the relevant sub-Articles [Arts. 16(1) and
(2)], the  Court must so interpret the language as to remove
that ugly  'inferiority'  complex  which  has  done  genetic
damage to  Indian polity and thereby suppress the malady and
advance	 the   remedy,	informed  by  sociology	 and  social
anthropology. My  touch-stone is  that functional  democracy
postulates participation  by all  sections of the people and
fair representation  in administration	is an  index of such
participation.
</p><p id="p_178">     Justice Brennen, in a somewhat different social milieu,
uttered words which may not be lost on us:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_48">	  "Lincoln  said   this	 Nation	 was  'conceived  in
     liberty and  dedicated to	the proposition that all men
     are created  equal'. The  Founders' dream	of a society
     where all	men are	 free and equal has not been easy to
     realize. The degree of liberty and equality that exists
     today has been the product
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">972</span>
     of unceasing struggle and sacrifice. Much remains to be
     done-so much  that the very institutions of our society
     have  come	  under	 challenge.   Hence,  today,  as  in
     Lincoln's time, a man may ask 'whether (this) nation or
     any nation	 so conceived  and  so	dedicated  can	long
     endure'. It  cannot endure if the Nation falls short on
     the  guarantees   of  liberty,  justice,  and  equality
     embodied in  our founding documents. But it also cannot
     endure if	our precious  heritage of ordered liberty be
     allowed to	 be ripped  apart amid the sound and fury of
     our time.	It cannot  endure if in individual cases the
     claims of social peace and order on the one side and of
     personal  liberty	on  the	 other	cannot	be  mutually
     resolved in  the forum  designated by the Constitution.
     If that  resolution cannot be reached by judicial trial
     in a  court of law, it will be reached elsewhere and by
     other means,  and	there  will  be	 grave	danger	that
     liberty, equality, and the order essential to both will
     be lost."</blockquote>
<p id="p_179">     The Note  to r.  13AA explains the immediate motivation
behind the  rule but the social backdrop set out by me helps
us appreciate its constitutionality. However, we are under a
Consitution and mere social anthropology cannot override the
real words  used in  the Constitution. For, Judges may read,
not  reconstruct.   Plainly  harijans	enjoy  a   temporary
advantage over	their non-harijan  brethern by	virtue of r.
13AA and  this, it  is plausibly  urged by  counsel for	 the
contestants,  is  violative  of	 the  merciless	 mandate  of
equality 'enshrined'  dually  in  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_459">Art.	16(1)</a>  and  <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_460">(2).</a>  It
discriminates  without	 constitutional	 justification	 and
imports the  caste differentia	in the	face of	 a  contrary
provision. The	learned Advocate  General seeks	 to meet  it
more by	 a legal  realist's(approach and,  in  a  sense,  by
resort	 to    functional   jurisprudence.   What   is	 the
constitutional core  of equality  ? What  social  philosophy
animates it  ? What  luminous connotation does the pregnant,
though	terse,	phrase	'equality  of  opportunity  for	 all
citizens in  matters of	 employment' bear ? What excesses of
discrimination are banned and what equalitarian implications
invite administrative  exploration ?  Finally, what light do
we derive  from precedents  of this Court on these facets of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_461">Art. 16 ?</a> I will examine these contentious issues presently.
</p><p id="p_180">     The  Solicitor   General,	in   his  brief	  but	able
submissions,  has   offered  a	harmonious  and	 value-based
construction  of   the	constitutional	 code	guaranteeing
equality (Arts.	 14 to	16). Sri  Garg has  swung to extreme
positions, some	 of which  spill over  beyond  the  specific
issue arising  in  this	 case.	Even  so,  I  agree  that  a
quickened social vision is needed to see in the Constitution
what a myopic glimpse may not reveal.
</p><p id="p_181">     A	word  of  sociological	caution.  In  the  light  of
experience, here and elsewhere, the danger of 'reservation',
it seems  to me,  is three-fold. Its benefits, by and large,
are snatched  away by the top creamy layer of the 'backward'
caste or  class, thus  keeping the  weakest among  the	weak
always weak  and leaving the fortunate layers to consume the
whole	cake.	 Secondly,   this   claim   is	 over-played
extravagantly in  democracy by	large and vocal groups whose
burden of backwardness has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">973</span>
substantially lightened by the march of time and measures of
better education  and more  opportunities of employment, but
wish to	 wear the 'weaker section' label as a means to score
over their  near-equals formally  categorised as  the  upper
brackets. Lastly,  a lasting  solution to  the problem comes
only  from   improvement  of   social	environment,   added
educational facilities	and cross-fertilisation of castes by
inter-caste and inter-class marriages sponsored as a massive
State programme,  and this  solution is	 calculatedly hidden
from view  by the  higher 'backward'  groups with  a  vested
interest in  the plums	of backwardism.	 But social  science
research, not  judicial impressionism,	will alone  tell the
whole  truth   and  a  constant	 process  of  objective	 re-
evaluation  of	 progress  registered	by  the	 'under-dog'
categories is  essential lest a once deserving 'reservation'
should	 be    degraded	  into	 'reverse   discrimination'.
Innovations in	administrative strategy	 to help  the really
untouched, most	 backward  classes  also  emerge  from	such
socio-legal studies  and audit exercises, if dispassionately
made. In  fact,	 research  conducted  by  the  A.  N.  Sinha
Institute of  Social Studies,  Patna, has  revealed  a	dual
society	 among	harijans,  a  tiny  elite  gobbling  up	 the
benefits and  the darker layers sleeping distances away from
the special concessions. For them, Arts. 46 and 335 remain a
noble romance' the bonanza going to the 'higher' harijans. I
mention this  in the  present case  because  lower  division
clerks are  likely to  be drawn	 from the  lowest levels  of
harijan humanity  and promotion	 prospects being accelerated
by withdrawing,	 for a	time, 'test' qualifications for this
category may  perhaps delve  deeper. An	 equalitarian break-
throug in  a hierarchical  structure has to use many weapons
and r. 13AA perhaps is one.
</p><p id="p_182">     The core  conclusion I  seek to emphasize is that every
step needed to achieve in action, actual, equal, partnership
for  the  harijans,  alone  amounts  to	 social	 justice-not
enshrinement of	 great rights  in Part III and good goals in
Part IV.  Otherwise, the  solemn undertakings in Arts. 14 to
16 read	 with Arts.  46 and 335 may be reduced to a 'teasing
illusion or  promise of	 unreality'. A	clear vision  of the
true  intendment   of  these   provisions  demands   a	deep
understanding of  the  Indian  spiritual-secular  idea	that
divinity  dwells  in  all  and	that  ancient  environmental
pollution  and	 social	 placement,  which  the	 State	must
extirpate,   account	for   the   current   socio-economic
backwardness  of   the	blacked-out  human  areas  described
euphemistically as  Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes.
The roots of our constitutional ideas-at least some of them-
can be	traced to our ancient culture. The noble Upanishadic
behest of  collective acquisition of cultural strength is in
volved in  and must evolve out of 'equality', if we are true
to the subtle substance of our finer heritage.
</p><p id="p_183">     Let me  now turn  to the essential controversy. Is rule
13AA valid  as protective  discrimination to  the harijans ?
The Advocate  General drew  our attention to the Articles of
the  Constitution  calculated  to  overcome  the  iniquitous
alienation of harijans from the three branches of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">974</span>
Government. The	 Preamble to  the Constitution silhouettes a
"justiceoriented' community.  The  Directive  Principles  of
State Policy,  fundamental in the governance of the country,
enjoin on  the State  the promotion  'with special  care the
educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of
the people,  and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and
the Scheduled  Tribes, ...  and	 protect  them	from  social
injustice'. To	neglect this  obligation is  to play  truant
with <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_462">Art.  46.</a> Undoubtedly, economic interests of a group-as
also social  justice to it-are tied up with its place in the
services under	the State.  Our history, unlike that of some
other countries,  has found  a zealous pursuit of government
jobs as	 a  mark  of  share  in	 State	power  and  economic
position.  Moreover,   the   biggest-and   expanding,	with
considerable  State  undertakings,-employer  is	 Government,
Central and  State, so	much so	 appointments in  the public
services matter	 increasingly in  the prosperity of backward
segments. The  Scheduled Castes	 and Scheduled	Tribes	have
earned	special	  mention  in  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_463">Art.  46</a>	 and  other  'weaker
sections', in  this  context,  means  not  every  'back-ward
class' but  those dismally  depressed categories  comparable
economically  and  educationally  to  Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled Tribes.  To widen the vent is to vitiate the equal
treatment which	 belongs to  all citizens,  many of whom are
below the  poverty line.  Realism reveals  that	 politically
powerful castes	 may try  to break  into equality, using the
masterkey of  backwardness but leaving aside <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_464">Art. 16(4</a>), the
ramparts of  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_465">Art. 16(1)</a>	 and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_466">(2)</a>  will resist  such  oblique
infiltration.
</p><p id="p_184">     Even so,  does <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_467">Art.  46</a> at	 all authorise the breach of
uniform equality  of opportunity  guaranteed by <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_468">Art. 16(1) ?</a>
Can a  favoured treatment  to harijans,	 by way of temporary
concessions in	passing tests,	be founded  on <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_469">Art.  46</a> as a
basis  for   rational  classification?	 Is  such  a  benign
discrimination	a  caste-oriented  legislation	contravening
<a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_470">Art. 16(2)  ?</a> Before I consider these vital questions, I may
as  well   glance  at  some  of	 the  important	 pro-harijan
provisions in the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_185">     The Constitution  itself makes  a	super-classification
between harijans  and others,  grounded on  the, fundamental
disparity in  our society  and the imperative social urgency
of  raising   the  former's   sunken  status.	Apart	from
reservation of seats in the Legislatures for harijans, which
is a  deliberate  departure,  taking  note  of	their  utter
backwardness  (<a href="/doc/818841/" id="a_471">Art.  330</a>  and  <a href="/doc/688355/" id="a_472">332</a>,  a	special	 officer  to
investigate and	 report to the President upon the working of
special constitutional	safeguards made	 to protect harijans
has to	be appointed  under <a href="/doc/626485/" id="a_473">Art.  338.</a> Gross  inadequacy  of
representation in  public services  is obviously one subject
for investigation  and report.	More importantly,  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_474">Art. 335</a>,
which Shri Garg relied on to hammer home his point, reads:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_49">	  "335, Claims	of Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled
     Tribes to services and posts.-The claims of the members
     of the  Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall
     be taken  into  consideration,  consistently  with	 the
     maintenance of  efficiency of  administration,  in	 the
     making  of	  appointments	to  services  and  posts  in
     connection with  the affairs  of  the  Union  or  of  a
     State."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">975</span>
<p id="p_186">This provision	directs pointedly  to (a)  the claims of-not
compassion   towards-harijans	 to   be    given    special
consideration  in  the	making	of  appointments  to  public
services; and  (b) lest this extra-attention should run riot
and ruin  administrative efficiency,  a caution	 is  uttered
that maintenance  of efficiency in administration should not
suffer mayhem.
</p><p id="p_187">     Now we  may deduce	 from these and other like Articles,
unaided by  authority, certain	clear conclusions  of  great
relevance to  the present  case: (1) The Constitution itself
demarcates harijans  from others.  (2) This  is based on the
stark backwardness  of this  bottom layer  of the community.
(3) The	 differentiation has been made to cover specifically
the area  of appointments  to posts under the State. (4) The
twin objects,  blended into  one, are the claims of harijans
to be  considered in  such  posts  and	the  maintenance  of
administrative efficiency.  (5) The State has been obligated
to promote  the economic  interests  of	 harijans  and	like
backward classes,  Arts. 46  and 335  being a  testament and
Arts. 14  to 16	 being the  tool-kit, if one may put it that
way. To	 blink at  this panchsheel  is to  be unjust  to the
Constitution.
</p><p id="p_188">     Sri   Krishnamoorthy    Iyer,   for    the	  contesting
respondents, argued  that harijans  may	 have  been  grouped
separately for	protective care	 by the Constitution but its
expression, in the matter of employment under the State, has
to be subject to the fundamental right of every citizen like
his clients  to the  enjoyment of equal opportunity and non-
discrimination on  the score  of caste.	 His proposition  is
that, in the name of harijan welfare, dilution of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_475">Art. 16(1)</a>
and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_476">(2)</a>	 is impermissible under the scheme of Part III which
is paramount  and contains  enforceable	 guaranteed  rights.
Secondly, 'scheduled  castes' are  castes all  the same	 and
preferment shown  to them  is plainly opposed to <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_477">Art. 16(2).</a>
Thirdly, even  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_478">Art. 335</a>	 insists on  administrative tone, so
essential to  good government,	and prolonged exemption from
tests prescribed  by the  impugned rule,  from the  point of
view  of  official  efficiency,	 undermines  this  pertinent
criterion. This	 Court has all along struck down measures of
'reserved'   representation    for   backward	classes	  in
educational institutions  and public  services when  a	high
proportion has	been so	 ear-marked, escalating	 the risk of
making the  Administration  itself  backward.  Finally,	 the
Constitution has  set apart  an exclusive  exception to	 the
equal opportunity rule in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_479">Art. 16(4</a>), so much so <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_480">Art. 46</a> and
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_481">335</a> must be projected through that provision only and cannot
spill over  into <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_482">Art.  16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_483">(2).</a> Fundamental rights are
fundamental and	 cannot be  cut	 back  upon  or	 insidiously
eroded by the classificatory technique.
</p><p id="p_189">     Both  the	presentations  have  a	flawless  look,	 the
controlling distinction	 being between	two visions  of	 the
mood  and   message  of	  the  supreme	 law  we   call	 the
Constitution, the  dynamic and	the static, the sociological
and  the  formal.  It  is  unexceptional  to  say  that	 any
insightful construction	 must opt for the former methodology
and  also   seek  a   good  fellowship	 among	the  various
provisions, conventionally called 'harmonious construction'.
In an  elevating and  organic instrument, antagonisms cannot
exist. If that be the lodester to help interpret the suprema
lex we have to discover a note of unison in Arts. 16(1), (2)
and (4)	 as well  as Arts.  46 and  335, the background tune
being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">976</span>
one of	profound effort	 first to equalise and then to march
together  without   class-creed	 distinction.	The   social
engineering know-how of our constitution, viz., levelling up
the  groups   buried  under   the  debris   by	a   generous
consideration and thereafter enforcing strict equality among
all-this two-tier  process operating  symbiotically, is	 the
life of	 the law  and the  key to  the	'equal	opportunity'
mechanism. Equally emphatic is the grave concern shown for a
casteless and  classless society-not  in a magic instant but
through	 a   careful  striving-and   for  the  standards  of
performance of	the Administration, noted from Curzon's days
for drowsiness.
</p><p id="p_190">     Efficiency means,	in terms  of  good  government,	 not
marks in  examinations only,  but responsible and responsive
service to the people. A chaotic genius is a grave danger in
public administration.	The inputs  of efficiency  include a
sense of  belonging and	 of accountability  which springs in
the bosom  of the bureaucracy (not pejoratively used) if its
composition takes  in also  the weaker	segments of 'We, the
people of  India'. No  other understanding can reconcile the
claim of  the radical Present and the hangover of the unjust
Past.
</p><p id="p_191">     Now to  the precedential  guidelines. I am alive to the
correctly reluctant  attitude of  this Court  to depart from
precedent  lest	 an  unstable  and  uncertain  situation  be
created. Stare	decisis et  non quieta movere. Khanna J. has
rightly emphasized  this great need but also quoted Brandeis
and Cardozo JJ.:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_50">     "As observed  by Brandeis,	 'stare decisis	 is always a
     desideratum, even in these constitutional cases. But in
     them, it is never a command'.
</blockquote><pre id="pre_2">     x	     x	      x	       x	x
     "As observed by Cardozo):
       ...			       ...    But I am ready
</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_51">     to concede	 that the  rule of  adherence to  precedent,
     though it	ought not  to be  abandoned, ought  to be in
     some degree relaxed. I think that when a rule, after it
     has been  duly tested  by experience, has been found to
     be inconsistent  with the	sense of justice or with the
     social welfare,  there should  be	less  hesitation  in
     frank avowal  and full  abandonment. We  have had to do
     this sometimes in the field of constitutional law'.</blockquote>
<p id="p_192">     Anyway, here  no case  is being  over-ruled because  no
case has  said Scheduled  Castes and  Tribes are a caste nor
that advancement  of sunken sections of society consistently
with administrative  efficiency cannot	be a rational object
linked with  outrageous	 backwardness  of  a  class  as	 the
intelligible differentia within an official cadre.
</p><p id="p_193">     Keshavananda Bharati  has clinched the issue of primacy
as between  Part III  and Part	IV of  the Constitution. The
unanimous
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">977</span>
ruling	there  is  that	 the  Court  must  wisely  read	 the
collective  Directive	Principles  of	 Part  IV  into	 the
individual fundamental	rights of  Part	 III,  neither	Part
being superior	to the	other! Since  the days of Dorairajan
judicial opinion  has hesitatingly  tilted in favour of Part
III but	 in Keshvananda	 Bharati (supra)  the  supplementary
theory,	 treating   both  Parts	  as   fundamental,   gained
supremacy. Khanna J spoke with a profound sense of depth (if
I may say so with respect) at p. 1878:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">	  "The	Directive  Principles  embody  a  commitment
     which was	imposed by  the Constitution  makers on	 the
     State to  bring about  economic and social regeneration
     of the  teeming millions  who are	steeped in  poverty,
     ignorance and  social backwardness.  They incorporate a
     pledge to	the coming  generations of  what  the  State
     would strive to usher in."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_53">     *********************************************
	  "There should	 be  no	 reluctance  to	 abridge  or
     regulate the  fundamental rights  to property if it was
     felt necessary  to do  so	for  changing  the  economic
     structure and  attaining the objective contained in the
     Directive Principles."</blockquote>
<p id="p_194">     (at p. 1880)
Chandrachud J.	has (again,  I quote with deference) set the
judicial singhs straight in this passage (at p. 2050):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_54">	  "What is  fundamental in  the	 governance  of	 the
     country cannot  surely be less significant than what is
     fundamental in  the life of an individual. The freedoms
     of a  few have  to be  abridged in	 order to ensure the
     freedom of	 all. If State fails to create conditions in
     which the Fundamental freedoms could be enjoyed by all,
     the freedom of the few will be at the mercy of the many
     and then all freedoms will vanish. In order, therefore,
     to preserve their freedom, the privileged few must part
     with a portion of it."
</blockquote><p id="p_195">The upshot,,  after Bharati,  (supra), is that <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_484">Art. 46</a> to be

aside or  truncated in	the operational ambit vis-a-vis <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_488">Art.
16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_489">(2)</a> without hubristic aberration.
</p><p id="p_196">     We may  clear the clog of <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_490">Art. 16(2)</a> as it stems from a
confusion about caste in the terminology of Scheduled Castes
and  Scheduled	Tribes.	 This  latter  expression  has	been
defined in  Arts. 341  and 342 A bare reading brings out the
quintessential concept	that they are no castes in the Hindu
fold but  an  amalgam  of  castes,  races,  groups,  tribes,
communities or	parts thereof  found on	 investigation to be
the lowliest  and in  need of massive State aid and notified
as such	 by the	 President. The	 confuse this  backward-most
social composition with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">978</span>
castes is  to commit  a constitutional	error, misled  by  a
compendious appellation. So that, to protect harijans is not
to prejudice  any caste	 but to	 promote citizen solidarity.
<a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_491">Art. 16(2)</a>  is out  of the  way	 and  to  extend  protective
discrimination to  this mixed  bag of tribes, races, groups,
communities  and  non-castes  outside  the  four-fold  Hindu
division is  not to  compromise	 with  the  acceleration  of
castelessness enshrined	 in the	 sub-Article. The discerning
sense of  the Indian  Corpus Juris  has	 generally  regarded
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, not as caste but as a
large backward	group deserving	 of societal compassion. The
following  provisions  of  the	<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_492">Income	Tax  Act</a>,  1961	 are
illustrative of this principle:

<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_505">335</a> as I have explained, the twin considerations of terrible
backwardness of	 the type harijans endure and maintenance of
administrative efficiency must be satisfied.
</p><p id="p_201">     The surviving,  but  substantial,	controversy  centres
round the 'equal opportunity' rule and its transgression, if
any, by	 r. 13AA.  The learned	Advocate General  fairly and
rightly agreed	that the  impugned rule	 falls outside	<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_506">Art.
16(4).</a>	Therefore   he	sought	 to  salvage  the  temporary
exemption   from    passing   tests   by   urging   that   a
constitutionally valid	classification was all that had been
done  and   cited  Indian  rulings  and	 American  juridical
writings in support of his stand.
</p><p id="p_202">     It is platitudinous constitutional law that Arts. 14 to
16 are	a common  code of  guaranteed  equality,  the  first
laying down the broad doctrine, the other two applying it to
sensitive  areas   historically	 important  and	 politically
polemical in a climate of communalism and jobbery.
</p><p id="p_203">     We need  not tarry	 to consider whether <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_507">Art. 16</a> applies
to appointments	 on promotion.	It does.  Nor need  we worry
about administrative  calamities if  test qualifications are
not acquired  for time	by some	 hands. For one thing, these
tests are  not so telling on efficiency as explained earlier
by me. And, after all, we are dealing with clerical posts in
the Registration  Department where aiert quailldriving and a
smattering of special knowledge will make for smoother turn-
out of	duties. And  the Government  is only postponing, not
foregoing, test qualification. As for the bearing of 'tests'
on basic efficiency, everything depends on the circumstances
of a case and the post.
</p><p id="p_204">     The basic	question thus  is  one	of  social  dynamics
implied in  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_508">Art. 16(1).</a>	 Let us	 go to	the fundamentals and
ignore the  frills. In a spacious sense, 'equal opportunity'
for members  of a hierarchical society makes sense only if a
strategy by which the underprivileged
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">980</span>
have environmental  facilities	for  developing	 their	full
human potential. This consummation is accomplished only when
the utterly  depressed groups  can claim  a  fair  share  in
public life  and  economic  activity,  including  employment
under the  State, or  when a classless and casteless society
blossoms as  a result  of positive State action. To help the
lagging social	segments, by special care, is a step towards
and not	 against  a  larger  and  stabler  equality.  I	 had
occasion to observe in <a href="/doc/1264252/" id="a_509">J &amp; K State v. T. N. Khosa</a>(1).
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_61">	  "In this  unequal world  the proposition  that all
     men are  equal has	 working limitations, since absolute
     equality leads  to	 Procrustean  cruelty  or  sanctions
     indolent  inefficiency.   Necessarily,  therefore,	  an
     imaginative  and  constructive  modus  vivendi  between
     commonness and  excellence must  be forged	 to make the
     equality clauses  viable. This  pragmatism produced the
     judicial gloss  of 'classification'  and  differentia',
     with the  by-products  of	equality  among	 equals	 and
     dissimilar things having to be treated differently. The
     social meaning  of arts.  14  to  16  is  neither	dull
     uniformity nor specious 'talentism'. It is a process of
     producing quality	out  of	 larger	 areas	of  equality
     extending better  facilities to the latent capabilities
     of the  lowly. It	is not a methodology of substitution
     of pervasive  and slovenly	 mediocrity for activist and
     intelligent-but not  snobbish  and	 uncommitted-cadres.
     However, if the State uses classification casuistically
     for salvaging  status and	elitism,  the  point  of  no
     return is	reached for  arts. 14  to 16 and the Court's
     jurisdiction awakens to dadden such manouvres. The soul
     of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_510">art.  16</a>  is  the  promotion  of  the  common  man's
     capabilities, over-powering  environmental	 adversities
     and  opening   up	full  opportunities  to	 develop  in
     official  life  without  succumbing  to  the  sophistic
     argument of  the elite  that talent is the privilege of
     the few  and they	must  rule,  wriggling	out  of	 the
     democratic imperative  of arts.  14 and 16 by theory of
     classified equality which at its worst degenerates into
     class domination."
</blockquote><p id="p_205">This observation  was approved	later by this Court in <a href="/doc/1887454/" id="a_511">Mohd.
Shujat Ali v. Union of India</a>(2).
</p><p id="p_206">     Sri Krishnamoorthy	 Iyer pressed before us, backed by a
catena	of  cases,  that  this	Court  has  frowned  upon  a
classification for promotion from within a homogeneous group
except	when   it  is  based  on  qualification	 for  higher
functional efficiency,	and  to	 inject	 a  new	 ground	 for
grouping within	 the class  for promotion was constitutional
anathema. I  think not.	 The fact  that	 better	 educational
prescriptions for  promotion posts  have been upheld by this
Court does not rule out other reasonable differentia, having
a nexus	 with the  object. The	true test  is, what  is	 the
object of the classification and is it permissible ?
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">981</span>
<p id="p_207">Further,  is  the  differentia	sound  and  substantial	 and
clearly related	 to the	 approved object  ? I  agree this is
virgin ground, but does not, for that reason alone, violate,
equality. My conclusion is that the genius of Arts. 14 to 16
consists  not	in  literal   equality	but  in	 progressive
elimination  of	 pronounced  inequality.  Indeed,  to  treat
sharply dissimilar  persons  equally  is  subtle  injustice.
Equal opportunity is a hope, not a menace.
</p><p id="p_208">     If <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_512">Art. 14</a> admits of reasonable classification, so does
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_513">Art. 16(1)</a>  and this Court has held so. In the present case,
the economic  advancement and promotion of the claims of the
grossly	  under-represented   and   pathetically   neglected
classes,  otherwise   described	 as   Scheduled	 Castes	 and
Scheduled  Tribes,   consistenly  with	the  maintenance  of
administrative efficiency,  is the  object, constitutionally
sanctioned by  Arts. 46	 and 335 and reasonably accommodated
in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_514">Art.	 16(1).</a> The differentia, so loudly obtrusive, is the
dismal social  milieu of  harijans.  Certainly	this  has  a
rational relation to the object set out above. I must repeat
the  note   of	caution	  earlier  struck.   Not  all  caste
backwardness is	 recognised in	this formula.  To do  so  is
subversive of  both <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_515">Art. 16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_516">(2).</a> The social disparity
must be	 so grim and substantial as to serve as a foundation
for benign discrimination. If we search for such a class, we
cannot find  any large	segment	 other	than  the  Scheduled
Castes and  Scheduled  Tribes.	Any  other  caste,  securing
exemption from	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_517">Art. 16(1)</a>  and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_518">(2</a>),  by exerting  political
pressure or  other influence,  will run	 the  high  risk  of
unconstitutional  discrimination.   If	the  real  basis  of
classification is  caste masked as backward class, the Court
must strike  at such  communal manipulation.  Secondly,	 the
Constitution recognizes	 the claims  of only  harijans (Art.
</p><p id="p_209">335) and not of every backward class. The profile of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_519">Art. 46</a>
is more	 or less  the same.  So, we  may readily  hold	that
casteism cannot	 come back  by the  backdoor and,  except in
exceptionally rare  cases, no  class other than harijans can
jump the  gauntlet of  'equal opportunity'  guarantee. Their
only hope  is in <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_520">Art. 16(4).</a> I agree with my learned brother
Fazal Ali  J. in the view that the arithmetical limit of 50%
in any	one year  set by some earlier rulings cannot perhaps
be pressed  too far.  Overall representation in a department
does not depend on recruitment in a particular year, but the
total strength	of a cadre. I agree with his construction of
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_521">Art. 16(4)</a> and his view about the 'carry forward' rule.

of the	existence of  the  organized  state.  I	 quote	from

     Illustrative of  an allied	 type  of  State  action  to

good omen  for American	 women in Schlessinger v. Ballard(1)
is indicative  of high	judicial hunch	in understanding the
classificatory clue to promotion of employment equality. The
case related  to a  male challenge  of a provision entitling

no  significant	  impact  on   their  employment  in  public

mechanical equality  is to  perpetuate actual  inequality. A
battery of  several  programmes	 to  fight  down  this	fell
backwardness must  be tried  out by the State. Relaxation of
'tests' qualification  at the  floor level of clerical posts

breach the  dykes of  equality of  opportunity guaranteed to
all citizens. To them the answer is that, save in rare cases
of 'chill  penury repressing  their noble rage', equality is
equality-nothing less  and nothing  else.  The	heady  upper

They  beguile	the  broad  community  into  believing	that

(see <a href="/doc/1264252/" id="a_545">State  of Jammu  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_546">&amp; Kashmir	 v. T.	N. Khosa</a>  <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_547">&amp; Ors</a></a>.(1).
<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_548">Article 14</a>  which guarantees  equality before  the  law	 and
equal protection  of the  laws, it  has been  held, does not
insist on  absolute equality  of treatment to all persons in
disregard of  all differences  among them  but provides	 for
equality among	equals	only.  This  court  observed  in  <a href="/doc/1466728/" id="a_549">T.
Devadasan v.  The Union	 of India</a>(2)  that "while the aim of
this Article  is to  ensure that  invidious  distinction  or
arbitrary discrimination  shall not  be made  by  the  State
between	 a  citizen  and  a  citizen  who  answer  the	same
description and	 the differences  which may  obtain  between
them and  of no	 relevance for	the purpose  of	 applying  a
particular law,	 reasonable classification  is permissible".
Reasonable classification  is thus  permissible,  and  often
necessary, to  achieve this equality. <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_550">Article 16(1)</a> which is
an instance  of the  application  of  the  general  rule  of
equality  with	 special  reference   to   opportunity	 for
appointments under  the State  also does not require "......
absolute  equality  as	such.  What  is	 guaranteed  is	 the
equality of  opportunity and  nothing more. <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_551">Article 16(1)</a> or
(2) does  not prohibit	the prescription of reasonable rules
for selection  to  any	employment  or	appointment  to	 any
office. Any  provision as  to  the  qualifications  for	 the
employment or the appointment to office reasonably fixed and
applicable to  all citizens  would certainly  be  consistent
with the  doctrine of  the equality  of opportunity;  but in
regard	to  employment,	 like  other  terms  and  conditions
associated with	 and incidental	 to it,	 the promotion	to a
selection post	is also	 included in the matters relating to
employment, and	 even in  regard to  such a  promotion to  a
selection post all that <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_552">Article 16(1)</a> guarantees is equality
of opportunity	to all	citizens who  enter service"-<a href="/doc/1074353/" id="a_553">General
Manager, Southern  Railway v.  Rangachari</a>(3). <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_554">Article  16(1)</a>
thus contemplates classification on the basis of eligibility
for an appointment; those who have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">987</span>
the qualifications  needed for	the post  form one class; it
also implies  that the	same class of employees constitute a
separate unit.	<a href="/doc/925953/" id="a_555">In Sham	 Sunder v.  Union of India</a> (1), this
Court  explained  that	"<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_556">Article  16(1)</a>	 means	equality  as
between members	 of the same class of employees" and forbids
between the  members of this class discrimination and denial
of equal opportunity in the matter of promotion.
</p><p id="p_223">     The  lower	  division  clerks   in	  the	Registration
Department of  the State  of Kerala belong to the same class
as employees.  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_557">Article 16(1)</a> ensures to all of them equality
of opportunity in the matter of promotion. Rule 13AA and the
orders made thereunder giving additional opportunity in this
regard to  some out  of the same class of employees would be
obviously void	unless the fact that the favoured members of
the class  belong to  Seheduled Castes	or Scheduled  Tribes
made any  difference in	 the position,	as contended.  It is
argued that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes constitute
a well-recognized  class of  citizens and,  as <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_558">Article 16(1)</a>
permits classification,	 employees belonging to these castes
and tribes  may be treated as a separate unit for promotion.
It is claimed that <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_559">Article 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_560">Article 335</a> encourage such
further classification	within the  same class	which should
therefore be  regarded as  valid for  the purpose of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_561">Article
16(1).</a> Two assumptions are implicit in this argument: first,
that <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_562">Article  16(1)</a> is subservient to <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_563">Article 46</a> and <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_564">Article
335</a> and	 has no	 requirements of its own and, secondly, that
these two  Article justify  the discrimination	made by Rule
13AA. I	 do not	 consider either  of those assumptions to be
correct. I  have stated	 already that neither <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_565">Article 46</a> nor
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_566">Article 335</a>  is of  any assistance  in interpreting  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_567">Article
16(1).</a> <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_568">Article	16(1)</a> in  clear terms insists on equality of
opportunity for	 all employees	of the	same class, and this
requirement cannot  be dispensed with because of anything in
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_569">Article 46</a>  or <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_570">Article	335</a> which  do not in any way qualify
the guarantee  in  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_571">Article  16(1).</a>  The	 Article  of  course
permits classification,	 but only  such classification as is
reasonable, and the test of reasonableness, having regard to
the object  of the  Article, must  be whether  the  proposed
classification helps  in achieving  this object.  Judging by
this test,  is it possible to hold the sub-division of lower
division clerks into two categories, those who belong to the
Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled Tribes and those who do not,
as reasonable  ? I  do not  think so; such classification is
not relevent  to the  object of	 the Article and, therefore,
not reasonable.
</p><p id="p_224">     Scheduled Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes are  castes and
tribes specified by the President under Articles 341 and 342
of the	Constitution to be known as such for the purposes of
the Constitution.  It is  accepted that	 generally  speaking
these castes  and tribes  are backward	in  educational	 and
economic  fields.   It	is   claimed  that   the  expression
"Scheduled Castes"  does not refer to any caste of the Hindu
Society but connotes a backward class of citizens. A look at
<a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_572">Article 341</a>  however will  show that  the expression means a
number of  existing social  castes  listed  in	a  schedule;
castes do  not cease  to be  castes being  put in a schedule
though backwardness  has come  to be  associated with  them.
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_573">Article 46</a>  requires  the  State  to  promote  the  economic
interests of  the weaker  sections of  the  people  and,  in
particular,  of	 the  Scheduled	 Castes	 and  the  Scheduled
Tribes. The special reference to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">988</span>
the Scheduled  Castes and  the	Scheduled  Tribes  does	 not
suggest that the State should promote the economic interests
of these  castes and  tribes at the expense of other "weaker
sections of  the people".  I do not find anything reasonable
in  denying   to  some	 lower	division   clerks  the	same
opportunity for promotion as others have because they do not
belong to  a particular caste or tribe. Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  no doubt  constitute a well-defined class,
but a classification valid for one purpose may not be so for
another; in  the context of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_574">Article 16(1)</a> the sub-class made
by Rule	 13AA within the same class of employees amounts to,
in my  opinion, discrimination	only on	 grounds of race and
caste which is forbidden by clause (2) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_575">Article 16.</a> <a href="/doc/1847684/" id="a_576">In the
State of  Rajasthan &amp;  Ors. v.	Thankur Pratap Singh</a>(1) this
Court struck  down a  notification under  <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_577">section 15</a>  of the
Police Act  issued by  the State  of Rajasthan exempting the
Harijan inhabitants  of certain villages from payment of the
cost of additional police force stationed in those villages.
It was	held that the notification discriminated against the
law-abiding members  of the  other communities	on the basis
only of	 caste. I  do not  find it  possible to	 accept that
picking out  employees belonging to the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes  from the  same  class	 of  lower  division
clerks to give them additional opportunity to be promoted as
upper division	clerks is  a measure  for the  promotion  of
economic welfare of these castes and tribes. Some incidental
financial gain to certain individuals assuming it results in
the welfare of the castes and tribes to which they belong in
some remote  and indirect  way, is  not	 in  my	 view,	what
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_578">Article 46</a>  contemplates; the other view of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_579">Article 46</a> would
justify as  valid  the	exemption  granted  to	the  Harijan
villagers of  Thakur Pratap Singh's case from payment of the
cost of additional police force. In any case, <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_580">Article 16(1</a>),
as I  have sought  to explain  earlier, does not permit such
classifcation as  made by Rule 13AA. That Rule may have been
inspired by  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_581">Article 46</a>	 which requires	 the State  to	take
measures to  bridge the educational and economic gap between
the weaker  sections of	 the people  and other citizens, but
<a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_582">Article 46</a> does not qualify the provisions of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_583">Article 16(1).</a>
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_584">Article	 16(1)</a>	 speaks	 of  equality  of  opportunity,	 not
opportunity to	achieve equality.  For reasons I have stated
already, <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_585">Article 335</a> appears to be even less relevant on the
question under consideration.
</p><p id="p_225">     All I  have said  above relates to the scope of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_586">Article
16(1)</a> only,  because counsel for the appellant has built his
case on	 this provision	 alone. Clause	(4)  of	 <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_587">Article  16</a>
permits reservation  of appointments  or Posts	in favour of
backward classes of citizens notwithstanding  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_588">Article 16(1);</a>
I agree	 with the  views expressed  by Khanna  J. On <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_589">Article
16(4)</a> which  comes in for consideration incidentally in this
case.  The  appalling  poverty	and  backwardness  of  large
sections of  the people	 must move the State machinery to do
everything in its power to better their condition but doling
out unequal  favours to	 members of  the clerical staff does
not seem  to be	 a step	 in that  direction: tilting  at the
windmill taking it to be a monster serves no useful purpose.

lines of  my own  highlighting some of the important aspects
which arise in this appeal.
</p><p id="p_230">     The facts	of this	 appeal lie  within  a	very  narrow
compass. This  appeal by certificate is directed against the
judgment of  the Kerala High Court dated April 19, 1974. The
judgment has  struck down r. 13-A.A. of the Kerala State and
Subordinate Service  Rules,  1958.  The	 impugned  rule	 was
substituted by	Government Order (P) 21/PD dated January 13,
1972.  It   appears  that   the	 main  dispute	between	 the
appellants and	respondent No. 1 centres round the promotion
of some Lower Division Clerks to the grade of Upper Division
Clerks.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">990</span>
<p id="p_231">The grievance  of respondent No. 1 before the High Court was
that some  of the  Lower Division Clerks who were members of
scheduled  castes   or	scheduled   tribes  were   shown   a
preferential treatment in that they had been promoted to the
higher grade  of Upper	Division Clerks in spite of the fact
that they  had not  cleared the test prescribed for reaching
the said  grade.  The  Government  of  Kerala  selected	 the
respondent  for	 hostile  discrimination  as  against  these
persons by granting extension after extension to the members
belonging to  the scheduled castes or tribes so as to enable
them to	 pass  the  test.  The	series	of  such  extensions
culminated into	 the order  creating r.	 13-A.A.  which	 was
wholly discriminatory  and  violative  of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_596">Art.	 16</a>  of	 the
Constitution of	 India. The plea of respondent No. 1 appears
to have	 found favour with the High Court which held that r.
13-A.A. was discriminatory and was clearly violative of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_597">Art.
16(1)</a>  of   the	 Constitution	and  was   also	 beyond	 the
reservation permitted by clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_598">Art. 16.</a>
</p><p id="p_232">     It may  be necessary  here to  mention a  few  admitted
facts. In the first place it is not disputed that respondent
No. 1 himself passed the test necessary for promotion to the
Upper grade  on November 2, 1971. It is, therefore, manifest
that whatever  grievance  the  respondent  No.	1  may	have
against the  other clerks,  he cannot  put forward his claim
for being promoted earlier than November 2, 1971 i.e. before
the  time   he	passed	the  test.  In	these  circumstances
extensions granted by the Government to the clerks belonging
to the	scheduled castes  or tribes  from 1958	to 1972	 and
thereafter upto	 1974 will  affect the respondent No. 1 only
after November	2, 1971	 and not before that. Secondly it is
also not  denied that the Lower Division Clerks belonging to
the scheduled  castes and  tribes were undoubtedly senior to
the respondent	No. 1  and had	been promoted on the express
condition that unless they passed the test prescribed by the
Government  they   would  have	to  be	reverted.  This	 was
obviously done	to advance  and	 lift  the  members  of	 the
scheduled castes  and tribes  who  were	 backward  class  of
citizens so  that they may be able to compete with the other
stronger sections  of the  society. It may also be mentioned
here that  the promotees  were not  completely exempted from
the test  but they  were given extension of time for passing
the test. Thus it is obvious that but for the passing of the
test the  respondent No. 1 could not have any other claim to
promotion as  Upper Division Clerk. The respondent No. 1 was
previously  serving   as  a  Lower  Division  Clerk  in	 the
Registration  Department  at  Kottayam	but  is	 at  present
serving in Chitty Auditor's Office at Kottayam. Lastly it is
also admitted that the promotees against whom the respondent
No. 1  has a  grievance	 were  undoubtedly  members  of	 the
scheduled castes  or tribes  and such  Lower Division Clerks
belonging to  the scheduled  castes or tribes will hereafter
be referred as 'the promotees' for the purpose of brevity.
</p><p id="p_233">     In the  background of these admitted facts, we have now
to see	whether	 r.  13-A.A.  violates	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_599">Art.  16(1)</a>  of	 the
Constitution in	 any way.  The High Court has struck down r.
13-A.A. on three grounds:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_77">	  (1)  that it	is beyond  the permissible limits of
	       clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_600">Art. 16;</a>
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">991</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_78">	  (2)  that by	virtue of the carry-forward rule the
	       Government has  promoted more than 62% of the
	       clerks belonging	 to the scheduled castes and
	       tribes and have thereby destroyed the concept
	       of equality; and
	  (3)  that the	 rule is  discriminatory inasmuch as
	       it makes	 an uncalled for distinction between
	       the  members   of  the	same   service	 and
	       classification  made  by	 the  Government  is
	       neither reasonable nor rational.</blockquote>
<p id="p_234">     It may  be mentioned  here that  the High Court has not
disputed that the members of the scheduled castes and tribes
were not  adequately represented  in the  services under the
State of Kerala which is the positive case of the appellants
before us.  The High  Court has	 traced the  history of	 the
various orders	passed by the Government of Kerala from 1951
to 1972	 granting extensions  for two years, three years and
so on,	to the promotees a fact which was not at all germane
for the	 purpose of  this case-because	the respondent No. 1
who  was  the  petitioner  before  the	High  Court  himself
admitted that  he had  passed the  test held  on November 2,
1971.  Thus  the  conduct  of  the  Government	in  granting
extensions prior  to November  2, 1971 was wholly irrelevant
in  order  to  decide  the  question  of  discrimination  as
canvessed by respondent No. 1.
</p><p id="p_235">     Mr. M.  M. Abdul  Khader, Advocate	 General  of  Kerala
appearing for the appellants submitted two points before us.
In the first place he argued that r. 13-A.A. did not provide
for reservation	 as contemplated by clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_601">Art. 16</a> of
the Constitution and the High Court was, therefore, in error
in  striking   down  the   rule	 because   it  exceeded	 the
permissible limits of clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_602">Art. 16.</a> Secondly it was
submitted that	the members  of	 the  scheduled	 castes	 and
tribes were not only members of one caste but for historical
reasons they are a special class by themselves and they have
been given  an exalted status under the Constitution itself.
There is  thus nothing	in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_603">Art. 16(1)</a> of the Constitution to
prevent the  State from	 making reasonable classification in
order to  boost up  the members	 of the scheduled castes and
tribes	by   giving  concessions   without  imperilling	 the
efficiency of  the services. The State action in the instant
case was,  therefore, justified	 by the	 Advocate General of
Kerala on  the ground  that  it	 had  only  implemented	 the
directive  principles	contained  in	Part   IV   of	 the
Constitution. Mr.  L. N.  Sinha, Solicitor-General appearing
for the	 Attorney General  of  India  and  Mr.	R.  K.	Garg
appearing for the intervener State of U.P. also more or less
supported the stand taken by the Advocate General of Kerala.
</p><p id="p_236">     Mr.  T.   S.  Krishnamoorthy  Iyer	 appearing  for	 the
respondent No.	1, however,  submitted	that  classification
could only  be made  under clause  (4) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_604">Art. 16.</a>  In	 the
instant case  even if the provisions contained in r. 13-A.A.
be deemed  a reservation within the meaning of clause (4) of
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_605">Art. 16</a>	 they exceed  the permissible limits and destroy the
concept of  equality. Secondly	it was	argued that  as	 the
respondent No.	1 and the promotees were members of the same
class of  service they	were equally  circumstanced and	 any
discrimination made  in favour	of the promotees was clearly
hit by <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_606">Art. 16(1)</a> of the Consti-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">992</span>
<p id="p_237">tution. It  was also faintly suggested by him that there was
no reliable  evidence  to  show	 that  the  members  of	 the
scheduled castes  and tribes were not adequately represented
in the	services under	the  State  so	as  to	justify	 any
classification being made in their favour.
</p><p id="p_238">     In order to understand the arguments put forward by the
parties it may be necessary to examine the nature and extent
of the	provisions of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_607">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution of India.
<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_608">Article 16</a> may be extracted as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_79">	  "16 .(1)  There shall	 be equality  of opportunity
     for all  citizens in  matters relating to employment or
     appointment to any office under the State.
	  (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion,
     race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or
     any  of  them,  be	 ineligible  for,  or  discriminated
     against in	 respect of,  any employment or office under
     the State.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_80">	  (3)  Nothing	 in  this   article  shall   prevent
     Parliament from  making any  law prescribing, in regard
     to a  class or  classes of employment or appointment to
     an office	under the  Government of,  or any  local  or
     other authority within, a State or Union territory, any
     requirement as  to residence within that State or Union
     territory prior to such employment or appointment.
	  (4) Nothing  in this	article	 shall	prevent	 the
     State from	 making any provision for the reservation of
     appointments or  posts in	favour of any backward class
     of citizens  which, in the opinion of the State, is not
     adequately represented in the services under the State.
	  (5) Nothing  in  this	 article  shall	 affect	 the
     operation of  any law which provides that the incumbent
     of an  office in  connection with	the affairs  of	 any
     religious or  denominational institution  or any member
     of	 the  governing	 body  thereof	shall  be  a  person
     professing a  particular religion	or  belonging  to  a
     particular denomination."</blockquote>
<p id="p_239">     It is  no doubt  true  that  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_609">Art.	16(1)</a>  provides	 for
equality of  opportunity for  all citizens  in the  services
under the  State. It  is,  however,  well-settled  that	 the
doctrine contained in <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_610">Art. 16</a> is a hard and reeling reality,
a concrete  and constructive concept and not a rigid rule or
an empty formula. It is also equally well-settled by several
authorities of this Court that <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_611">Art. 16</a> is merely an incident
of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_612">Art.	 14</a>,  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_613">Art.  14</a>	being  the  genus  is  of  universal
application whereas  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_614">Art. 16</a>  is the  species and  seeks  to
obtain equality	 of opportunity	 in the	 services under	 the
State. The  theory of  reasonable classification is implicit
and inherent in the concept of equality for there can hardly
be any	country where all the citizens would be equal in all
respects. Equality  of opportunity  would naturally  mean  a
fair opportunity not only to one section or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">993</span>
the other but to all sections by removing the handicaps if a
particular section  of the society suffers from the same. It
has never  been disputed  in judicial pronouncements by this
Court as  also of  the various	High  Courts  that  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_615">Art.  14</a>
permits reasonable  classification. But what <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_616">Art. 14</a> or <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_617">Art.
16</a> forbid  is  hostile	discrimination	and  not  reasonable
classification. In  other words,  the idea of classification
is implicit  in the  concept of	 equality  because  equality
means equality	to all	and not	 merely to  the advanced and
educated sections  of the  society. It	follows,  therefore,
that in	 order to  provide equality  of opportunity  to	 all
citizens of our country, every class of citizens must have a
sense of  equal participation  in building up an egalitarian
society, where	there is  peace and  plently, where there is
complete economic  freedom and	there is  no  pestilence  or
poverty, no  discrimination and	 oppression, where  there is
equal opportunity  to education,  to  work,  to	 earn  their
livelihood so  that the	 goal of social justice is achieved.
Could we,  while conferring benefits on the stronger and the
more advanced  sections of  the	 society,  ignore  the	more
backward classes  merely because  they cannot  come upto the
fixed standards	 ? Such	 a course, in my opinion, would lead
to denial  of opportunity  to the backward classes resulting
in  complete   annihilation  of	  the  concept	of  equality
contained in  Arts. 14	and 16. The only manner in which the
objective  of  equality	 as  contemplated  by  the  founding
fathers of our Constitution and as enshrined in Arts. 14 and
16 can	be achieved  is to  boost up the backward classes by
giving them  concessions, relaxations,	facilities, removing
handicaps, and	making suitable	 reservations  so  that	 the
weaker sections	 of the	 people may  compete with  the	more
advanced and in due course of time all may become equals and
backwardness is banished for ever. This can happen only when
we achieve complete economic and social freedom. In our vast
country where  we have	diverse races and classes of people,
some of	 whom are  drowned  in	the  sea  of  ignorance	 and
illiteracy, the	 concept of  equality assumes very important
proportions. There are a number of areas in some States like
Kashmir, Sikkim,  hilly areas  of U.P., Bihar and the South,
where due  to lack of communication or transport, absence of
proper educational  facilities or because of old customs and
conventions and	 other environmental reasons, the people are
both socially  and educationally backward. Could we say that
the citizens  hailing from  these areas	 should continue  to
remain backward	 merely because	 they fall  short of certain
artificial standards  fixed by	various institutions  ?	 The
answer must  be in  the negative.  The directive  principles
enshrined in  our Constitution	contain a  clear mandate  to
achieve equality  and social justice. Without going into the
vexed question as to whether or not the directive principles
contained in Part IV override the fundamental rights in Part
III there  appears to  be a  complete unanimity	 of judicial
opinion of  this Court that the directive principles and the
fundamental rights  should be construed in harmony with each
other and  every attempt  should be  made by  the  Court  to
resolve any apparent inconsistency. The directive principles
contained in Part IV constitute the stairs to climb the high
edifice of  a socialistic  State and  the fundamental rights
are the	 means through	which one  can reach  the top of the
edifice. I  am fortified  in my view by several decisions of
this Court to which I will refer briefly.

     to establish  a welfare  State where  there is economic
     and social	 freedom without  which political  democracy
     has no meaning. What is implicit in the Constitution is
     that there	 is a  duty on	the Courts  to interpret the

</p><p id="p_252">Chandrachud, J., observed : (p. 962)
	  "Our decision	 of this  vexed question must depend
     upon the  postulate of  our Constitution  which aims at
     bringing about a synthesis between `Fundamental Rights'
     and the  `Directive Principles  of	 State	Policy',  by
     giving to the former a pride of place and to the latter
     a place of permanence. Together, not individually, they
     form  the	core  of  the  Constitution.  Together,	 not
     individually, they constitute its true conscience."
     In view  of the  principles adumbrated by this Court it
is clear  that the directive principles form the fundamental
feature and  the social	 conscience of	the Constitution and
the Constitution  enjoins upon	the State to implement these
directive  principles.	 The  directives  thus	provide	 the
policy, the guidelines and the end of socio-economic freedom
and Arts. 14 and 16 are the means to implement the policy to
achieve the  ends sought  to be	 promoted by  the  directive
principles. So	far as	the Courts are concerned where there
is  no	 apparent  inconsistency   between   the   directive
principles contained  in Part  IV and the fundamental rights
mentioned in  Part III, which in fact supplement each other,
there is  no difficulty in putting a harmonious construction
which advances	the object  of the  Constitution. Once	this
basic fact  is kept  in mind, the interpretation of Arts. 14
and 16 and their scope and ambit become as clear as day.
</p><p id="p_253">     In the  instant case  one of  the main  planks  of	 the
argument put  forward by  Mr. M.  M. Abdul Khader, Advocate-
General, Kerala, was that so far as the scheduled castes and
the scheduled  tribes were  concerned they had been given an
exalted and  privileged status under the Constitution and in
the directive  principles contained in Part IV which contain
a mandate  to the  State to  consider their  claims.  It  is
necessary to  consider this aspect of the matter in a little
detail, because	 the main  argument of	Mr. Abdul Khader has
been that  the scheduled  castes and  tribes did not fall at
all within  the mischief  of clause  (2) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_623">Art.  16</a>  which
prohibits discrimination  on the  ground of  caste etc.	 The
scheduled caste	 is not	 caste as mentioned in <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_624">Art. 16(2).</a> I
am inclined  to agree  with the	 argument  advanced  by	 the
Advocate General that the word
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">997</span>
`caste' appearing after `scheduled' is really a misnomer and
has been  used only  for the  purpose  of  identifying	this
particular class  of citizens which has a special history of
several hundred	 years behind  it. The	scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes  have been  a special class of citizens who
have been  so included	and described that they have come to
be identified  as the most backward classes of citizens that
we have	 in our	 country. <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_625">Article 366</a> clauses (24) &amp; (25) of
the Constitution read thus :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_87">     366 "(24) "Scheduled Castes"  means such  castes, races
	       ortribes or  parts of  or groups	 within such
	       castes, races  or tribes	 as are deemed under
	       <a href="/doc/68762/" id="a_626">article 341</a>  to be  Scheduled Castes  for the
	       purposes of this Constitution;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_88">	  (25) "Scheduled  Tribes"   means  such  tribes  or
	       tribal communities  or  parts  of  or  groups
	       within such  tribes or  tribal communities as
	       are deemed  under <a href="/doc/768139/" id="a_627">article 342</a> to be Scheduled
	       Tribes	for    the    purposes	  of	this
	       Constitution;"
</blockquote><p id="p_254">These  constitutional	provisions,  therefore,	  create   a
presumption in	favour of  scheduled  castes  and  scheduled
tribes that they are backward classes of citizens. It is not
disputed that  the  members  of	 the  scheduled	 castes	 and
scheduled tribes  are specified	 in the notifications issued
under Arts.  341 and 342 of the Constitution and, therefore,
they must  be deemed  to be  scheduled castes  and scheduled
tribes for the purposes of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_255">     <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_628">Article 46</a> of the Constitution runs thus :
</p><p id="p_256">	  "The State  shall promote  with special  care	 the
     educational  and	economic  interests  of	 the  weaker
     sections of  the people,  and, in	particular,  of	 the
     Scheduled Castes  and the	Scheduled Tribes,  and shall
     protect them  from social	injustice and  all forms  of
     exploitation."
</p><p id="p_257">Properly analysed  this article	 contains a  mandate on	 the
State to  take special care for the educational and economic
interests of  the weaker  sections  of	the  people  and  as
illustrations of  the  persons	who  constitute	 the  weaker
sections the  provision	 expressly  mentions  the  scheduled
castes and the scheduled tribes.
</p><p id="p_258">     A combined	 reading of  <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_629">Art. 46</a> and clauses (24) &amp; (25)
of <a href="/doc/294137/" id="a_630">Art.	 366</a> clearly shows that the members of the scheduled
castes and  the scheduled  tribes must	be  presumed  to  be
backward  classes   of	citizens,   particularly  when	 the
Constitution gives  the example	 of the scheduled castes and
the scheduled  tribes as  being the  weaker sections  of the
society.
</p><p id="p_259">     Similarly <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_631">Art.  335</a> which	expressly provides  that the
claims of  the members	of  the	 scheduled  castes  and	 the
scheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration runs thus
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_89">	  "The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes
     and  the	Scheduled  Tribes   shall  be	taken	into
     consideration, consistently  with	the  maintenance  of
     efficiency	 of   administration,  in   the	 making	  of
     appointments to  services and  posts in connection with
     the affairs of the Union or of a State."</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">998</span>
<p id="p_260">     Thus in  view of  these provisions	 the members  of the
scheduled castes  and the scheduled tribes have been given a
special status	in the	Constitution and  they constitute  a
class by themselves. That being the position it follows that
they do	 not fall  within the  purview of  <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_632">Art. 16(2)</a> of the
Constitution  which  prohibits	discrimination	between	 the
members of the same caste. If, therefore, the members of the
scheduled castes  and the  scheduled tribes  are not castes,
then  it   is  open   to  the	State  to   make  reasonable
classification in  order to advance or lift these classes so
that they  may be  able to  be properly	 represented in	 the
services under the State. This can undoubtedly be done under
<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_633">Art. 16(1)</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_261">     Before, however, examining the nature of classification
that can  be made  by the Government under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_634">Art. 16(1)</a> of the
Constitution it	 may be	 necessary to state three principles
which are supported by abundant authority :
</p><p id="p_262">     (1) That  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_635">Art. 16</a>	is merely an incident of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_636">Art. 14</a> and
both these articles form a part of the common system seeking
to achieve  the same  end. I  am fortified  in	my  view  by
several decisions of this Court. <a href="/doc/1264252/" id="a_637">In State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_95">	  "Since the  constitutional code  of  equality	 and

     opportunity in  matters of	 promotion  means  an  equal
     promotional   opportunity	 for   persons	 who   fall,
     substantively, within  the same class. A classification
     of	 employees   can  therefore   be  made	 for   first
     identifying and  then  distinguishing  members  of	 one
     class from those of another."
</blockquote><p id="p_270">The same  view has  been expressed  by this  Court  in	C.A.
Rajendran's case;  in S. G. Jaisinghani's case; Rangachari's
case and Mohammad Shujat Ali's case, quoted supra.
</p><p id="p_271">     The  concept   of	equality  or  equal  opportunity  as
contained in  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_661">Art. 16</a>  does not	 mean that same laws must be
applicable to  all persons  under every circumstance. Indeed
if this	 artificial interpretation  is put  on the scope and
ambit  of   <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_662">Art.  16</a>  it  will	lead  to  channelisation  of
legislation  or	  polarisation	of  rules.  Differences	 and
disparities exist  among men  and things  and they cannot be
treated alike  by the  application of  the same laws but the
law has	 to come  to terms  with life  and must	 be able  to
recognise the genuine differences and disparities that exist
in human  nature. Legislature  has also to enact legislation
to meet	 specific ends	by making  a reasonable and rational
classification. In Morey v. Doud(1) it was so aptly observed
:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_96">	  "To recognise	 marked differences  that  exist  in
     fact is  living law; to disregard practical differences
     and concentrate on some abstract identities is lifeless
     logic."</blockquote>
<p id="p_272">     Coming now	 to <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_663">Art.  16</a> it	 may be	 analysed into three
separate categories  so far as the facts of the present case
are concerned :
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_97">	  Category I-Clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_664">Art. 16.</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_98">	  Category II-Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_665">Art. 16.</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_99">	  Category III-Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_666">Art. 16.</a></blockquote>
<p id="p_273">     Clause (1)	 of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_667">Art. 16</a> clearly provides for equality of
opportunity to all citizens in the services under the State.
It is important to note that the Constitution uses the words
"equality of  opportunity for all citizens". This inherently
implies that  the opportunity  must be	given not  only to a
particular section  of the  society or a particular class of
citizens who  may be  advanced or otherwise more afflunt but
to all classes of citizens. This, therefore, can be achieved
by making a reasonable classification so that every class of
citizens is  duly represented  in the  services	 which	will
enable equality	 all citizens.	The classification, however,
must be	 a reasonable  one and	must  fulfil  the  following
conditions:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_100">	  (i)  it must have a rational basis;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_101">	  (ii) it  must have  a close  nexus with the object
	       sought to be achieved;
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">1001</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">	  (iii)it should  not select  any person for hostile
	       discrimination at the cost of others.
</blockquote><p id="p_274">Now let	 us see	 whether r. 13-A.A. can be justifiable under
clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_668">Art. 16.</a> Rule 13-A.A. of the Rules reads thus:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_103">	  "Notwithstanding  anything   contained  in   these
     rules, the	 Government may,  by  order,  exempt  for  a
     specified period, any member or members, belonging to a
     Scheduled Caste  or a  Scheduled Tribe,  and already in
     service, from  passing the tests referred to in rule 13
     or rule 13A of the said Rules."
</blockquote><p id="p_275">What the  rule does is merely to authorise the Government to
exempt for  a specified	 period any member or members of the
scheduled castes  and scheduled tribes from pasing the tests
referred to in r. 13 and r. 13A. It may be noticed that this
rule does  not at  all give  a	complete  licence.  A  Lower
Division Clerk	who is	a member  of the  scheduled caste or
schedule tribe	could not  be promoted	without passing	 any
test at	 all so	 as to	destroy the  concept of equality. It
merely gives  a special concession or a temporary relaxation
to backward class of citizens in order to lift them, advance
them and  enable them  to compete with the stronger sections
of the	society. Thus  the basis  of the rule is undoubtedly
both rational and reasonable.
</p><p id="p_276">     <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_669">Article 335</a>  of the  Constitution contains a mandate to
the State  for considering  the claims of the members of the
scheduled castes  and the scheduled tribes consistently with
the maintenance	 of efficiency	of administration. By giving
the special  concessions to  the promotees  this mandate  is
sought to  be obeyed  by the  Government. Mr.  T. S. Krishna
moorthy Iyer counsel for the respondent No. 1 submitted that
the mandate  given  in	<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_670">Art.  335</a>  is  violated	 because  by
granting exemption  to the  members of	the scheduled castes
and tribes  the standard of efficiency of the services would
be impaired.  We are,  however, unable	to  agree  with	 the
argument. Both	the respondent	No 1  and the promotees were
members of  the same  service and  had been working as Lower
Division Clerks	 for a	pretty long  time. The promotees who
were  members	of  the	 scheduled  castes  and	 tribes	 are
admittedly senior  to respondent  No. 1 and have gained more
experience.  Further   the  rule  does	not  grant  complete
exemption to  the promotees  from passing  the test; it only
provides for  grant of	extension of  time to enable them to
clear the  test. In  these circumstances  it cannot  be held
that the  State's action  in incorporating r. 13-A.A. in any
way violates  the mandate  contained in	 <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_671">Art. 335.</a>  In these
circumstances, therefore,  I am	 clearly satisfied  that the
concession given  in r.	 13-A.A.  amounts  to  a  reasonable
classification which  can be  made under  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_672">Art. 16(1)</a>  of the
Constitution and  does not  amount to  the selection  of the
respondent No.	1 for  hostile discrimination  so as  to  be
violative of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_673">Art. 16(1)</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_277">     Category II  refers to  clause (2) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_674">Art. 16</a> which may
be reproduced as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_104">	  "No citizen  shall, on  grounds only	of religion,
     race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or
     any  of  them,  be	 ineligible  for,  or  discriminated
     against in	 respect of,  any employment or office under
     the State."
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">1002</span>
<p id="p_278">In view	 of my	findings and  the various  provisions of the
Constitution regarding	the status  of the  members  of	 the
scheduled castes  and the  scheduled tribes,  it is  obvious
that the  members of  the scheduled castes and the scheduled
tribes are  not a  'caste' but	a special  class of backward
citizens whose	backwardness cannot  be	 doubted.  In  these
circumstances, therefore,  if the promotees do not belong to
a caste	 as contemplated by <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_675">Art. 16(2)</a> then they do not fall
within the  mischief of	 <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_676">Art. 16(2)</a> at all. Thus the case of
the promotees squarely falls within the four corners of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_677">Art.
16(1)</a>  and   can  be   justified  as   based  on  reasonable
classification.
</p><p id="p_279">     Before  leaving   categories  I  and  II  it  might  be
mentioned that the Court has to apply strict scrutiny to the
classification made  by the  Government and to find out that
it does	 not destroy or fructify the concept of equality. In
other  words,  the  State  cannot  be  permitted  to  invoke
favourtism or  nepotism under  the cloak of equality. Having
considered the	matter in all its comprehensive aspects I am
satisfied that	in this	 particular case  the classification
made by	 the Government	 by virtue  of r.  13-A.A. is  fully
justified by <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_678">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_280">     This brings  us to	 the consideration  of Category	 III
which is  clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_679">Art. 16.</a> Clause (4) may be extracted
as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_105">	  Nothing in  this article  shall prevent  the State
     from  making  any	provision  for	the  reservation  of
     appointments or  posts in	favour of any backward class
     of citizens  which, in the opinion of the State, is not
     adequately	 represented   in  the	services  under	 the
     State."
</blockquote><p id="p_281">Clause (4)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_680">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution cannot be read in
isolation but  has to  be read	as part	 and parcel  of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_681">Art.
16(1)</a> <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_682">&amp;	 (2).</a> Suppose there are a number of backward classes
who form a sizeable section of the population of the country
but are	 not  properly	or  adequately	represented  in	 the
services under	the State  the question	 that arises is what
can be	done to	 enable them to join the services and have a
sense of  equal participation.	One  course  is	 to  make  a
reasonable classification  under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_683">Art. 16(1)</a> in the manner to
which I	 have already  adverted in  great detail.  The other
method	to   achieve  the   end	 may  be  to  make  suitable
reservations for  the backward classes in such a way so that
the inadequate representation of the backward classes in the
services is made adequate. This form of classification which
is referred  to as  reservation, is,  in my opinion, clearly
covered	 by   <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_684">Art.  16(4)</a>  of  the  Constitution,  which  is
completely exhaustive  on this	point. That is to say clause
(4) of	<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_685">Art. 16</a>	 is not an exception to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_686">Art. 14</a> in the sense
that whatever  classification can  be made  can be done only
through clause	(4) of	<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_687">Art. 16.</a>  Clause  (4)  of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_688">Art.	 16</a>,
however, is  an explanation  containing	 an  exhaustive	 and
exclusive provision  regarding reservation  which is  one of
the forms  of classification.  Thus clause  (4) of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_689">Art.  16</a>
deals exclusively  with reservation  and not  other forms of
classification which  can be  made under  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_690">Art. 16(1)</a> itself.
Since  clause	(1)  is	  a  special   provision   regarding
reservation, it	 can safely  be held  that it overrides <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_691">Art.
16(1)</a> to  that extent  and no  reservation can be made under
Art 16(1).  It is  true that  there are	 some authorities of
this
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">1003</span>
Court that clause (4) is an exception to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_692">Art. 16(1)</a> but with
due respect I am not in a position to subscribe to this view
for the reasons that I shall give hereafter.
</p><p id="p_282">     In the  first  place  if  we  read	 <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_693">Art.  16(4)</a>  as  an
exception to  <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_694">Art. 16  (1)</a> then	 the inescapable  conclusion
would be  that <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_695">Art. 16(1)</a> does not permit any classification
at all	because an  express provision has been made for this
in clause  (4). This  is, however,  contrary  to  the  basic
concept of  equality contained	in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_696">Art.	 14</a> which implicitly
permits	 classification	  in  any   form  provided   certain
conditions are	fulfilled. Furthermore, if no classification
can be made under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_697">Art. 16(1)</a> except reservation contained in
clause (4)  then the  mandate contained in <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_698">Art. 335</a> would be
defeated.
</p><p id="p_283">     I have already observed that the fundamental guarantees
provided by the Constitution have to be read in harmony with
the directive principles contained in Part IV. Again if <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_699">Art.
16(4)</a> is  deemed to be the only mode of classification, then
it would  follow that the Constitution permits only one form
of classification,  namely, reservation and no other form so
far as	the services  are concerned.  This will	 render	 the
concept of  equality nugatory  and defeat  the very  purpose
which is  sought to  be achieved  by <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_700">Art. 16(1).</a> Equality of
opportunity to	all citizens  does not mean equality to some
and inequality to others. As I have already pointed out that
in our	country there are a large number of backward classes
of citizens  who have  to be granted certain concessions and
facilities in  order to be able to compete with others. Does
it mean that such citizens should be denied these facilities
which may  not fall  under the	term 'reservation'  ? Let us
take a	few instances.	A  notification	 provides  that	 all
candidates  for	 a  particular	post  must  apply  before  a
specified date.	 A person  belonging to	 a backward class of
citizens living in a very remote area gets information late.
The Government,	 however, in  case of  such a backward class
candidate makes a relaxation and extends the date. Can it be
said that  this has  resulted in  violation  of	 <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_701">Art.  16(1)</a>
because it does not fall within the reservation contemplated
by clause  (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_702">Art. 16 ?</a> It is obvious that the intention
of the	Government is  merely to  help the backward class of
citizens to apply for the job along with others by condoning
the delay for special reasons. Another instance may be where
the State  makes a  relaxation regarding  the age in case of
backward classes  of citizens in view of the far-fetched and
distant area to which that class of citizens belongs. Lastly
let us	take the  instance of  the present  case. The clerks
belonging to  the scheduled  castes and	 tribes were given a
further extension  of time to pass the test because of their
backwardness. They  were not exempted from passing the test.
This could  only be  done under	 <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_703">Art. 16(1)</a>  and  not  under
clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_704">Art. 16.</a>
</p><p id="p_284">     For these reasons, therefore, I respectfully agree with
the observations  of Subba  Rao, J.,  as he  then was  in <a href="/doc/1466728/" id="a_705">T.
Devadasan  v.  The  Union  of  India  and  Anr</a>(1)  where  he

     intention in a most
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">1004</span>
     emphatic way that the power conferred thereunder is not
     limited in	 any way  by the  main provision  but  falls
     outside it.  It has not really carved out an exception,
     but has  preserved a  power untrammelled  by the  other
     provisions of the Article."
</blockquote><p id="p_285">My view	 that <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_707">Art.  16(4)</a> is not a proviso to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_708">Art. 16(1)</a> but
that this  clause covers the whole field of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_709">Art. 16</a> is amply
supported by  the decision  of this  Court  in	<a href="/doc/1074353/" id="a_710">The  General
Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari</a> (supra) where it was
observed: (p. 599)

</p><p id="p_286">     Now analysing  clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_717">Art. 16</a> it appears that it
contains express  provisions empowering	 the State  to	make
reservations  in   suitable  cases  provided  the  following
conditions are satisfied:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_107">	  (i)  that the	 class for which reservation is made
	       is  must	  be  socially	 and   educationally
	       backward.</blockquote>
<p id="p_287">     I might  mention that  so far  as the  members  of	 the
scheduled castes  and tribes  are concerned,  in view of the
constitutional provisions  referred to above, this fact will
have to	 be presumed and it was also so held in Rangachari's
case supra.
</p><p id="p_288">	  (ii) That the	 class for which reservation is made
	       is not adequately represented in the services
	       under the State.
</p><p id="p_289">     So far  as this  is concerned  it was  suggested by Mr.
Krishnamoorthy Iyer  appearing for  respondent	No.  1	that
there is  no  material	on  the	 record	 to  show  that	 the
promotees were	not adequately	represented in	the services
under the  State and  the  Government  had  not	 issued	 any
notification declaring	this fact. It, however, appears that
this point  was not  canvassed before the High Court at all.
Nevertheless  the   appellants	have   produced	 before	  us
sufficient  materials  to  show	 that  the  members  of	 the
scheduled  castes   and	 the   scheduled  tribes   were	 not
adequately and	properly represented  in the  services under
the State  and particularly  in the  Registration Department
with which  we are  dealing in this appeal. It is clear from
Annexure 'A'  of the  Appeal Paper  Book that  there were as
many as	 2254 non-gazetted  employees  in  the	Registration
Department out	of which members of the scheduled castes and
tribes are only 198. It has also been stated in the counter-
affidavit before  the High  Court that	the members  of	 the
scheduled castes  and tribes  form about  8 per cent. of the
population of  the State of Kerala. This, therefore, clearly
shows that  the promotees  were inadequately  represented in
the services under the State and, therefore, they fulfil the
second condition required by clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_718">Art. 16.</a>
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">1005</span>
<p id="p_290">	  (iii)The reservation	should not  be too excessive
	       so  as	to  destroy   the  very	 concept  of
	       equality.
</p><p id="p_291">     This means	 that the  reservation should  be within the
permissible limits and should not be a cloak to fill all the
posts belonging	 to a  particular class of citizens and thus
violate <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_719">Art.  16(1)</a> of	the Constitution  indirectly. At the
same time  clause (4)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_720">Art.	16</a> does not fix any limit on
the power  of the  Government  to  make	 reservation.  Since
clause (4)  is a  part of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_721">Art. 16</a> of the Constitution it is
manifest that  the State  cannot be  allowed to	 indulge  in
excessive reservation  so as  to defeat the policy contained
in <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_722">Art.	 16(1).</a> As  to what  would be a suitable reservation
within permissible  limits will	 depend upon  the facts	 and
circumstances of  each case and no hard and fast rule can be
laid down,  nor can this matter be reduced to a mathematical
formula so  as to  be adhered to in all cases. Decided cases
of this Court have no doubt laid down that the percentage of
reservation  should   not  exceed   50%.  As   I  read	 the
authorities, this  is, however,	 a rule	 of caution and does
not exhaust all categories. Suppose for instance a State has
a  large  number  of  backward	classes	 of  citizens  which
constitute 80%	of the	population and	the  Government,  in
order to  give them  proper representation,  reserves 80% of
the jobs  for them,  can it  be said  that the percentage of
reservation is	bad and	 violates the  permissible limits of
clause (4)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_723">Art.  16 ?</a>  The answer must necessarily be in
the negative.  The dominant  object of	this provision is to
take steps to make inadequate representation adequate.
</p><p id="p_292">     This brings  us to	 the validity  of the  carry-forward
rule which  also has  been touched by the High Court. It has
been held  by the High Court that as a result of the special
rule adopted  by the  State 34 out of 51 vacancies have been
filled up by the members of the scheduled castes and tribes,
thus far exceeding the 50 per cent limit which has been laid
down by	 this Court.  It is true that in T. Devadasan's case
(supra) the  majority judgment of this Court did strike down
a rule	which permitted carry-forward of the vacancies. With
respect, however,  I am	 not able  to agree  with this	view
because such  a rule  some times defeats the ends of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_724">Art. 16</a>
itself. By  the carry-forward  rule what is meant is that if
suppose there  are 50  vacancies  in  a	 year,	25  of	such
vacancies are set apart for backawrd classes of citizens and
if out	of these  25 only  10 such candidates are available,
then the remaining 15 vacancies instead of being kept vacant
which may  result in  inefficiency and stagnation are filled
up from	 other classes	but the	 deficiency is	sought to be
made up	 in the next year or in the year next to that. I can
see no objection to this course being adopted which is fully
in consonance  with the spirit of clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_725">Art. 16.</a> The
main idea is to give adequate representation to the backward
classes of  citizens if	 they are not adequately represented
in the	services. What difference does it make if instead of
keeping the reserved vacancies vacant from year to year as a
result of which work of the Government would suffer they are
allowed to  be filled  up by other candidates and the number
of vacancies  so filled	 up are	 kept reserved	for the next
year to accommo-
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">1006</span>
<p id="p_293">date candidates	 from backward	classes. This  does not	 and
cannot destroy	the  concept  of  equality,  nor  result  in
hostile discrimination	to one or the other. There can be no
doubt that  reservation to  the extent of 50% is permissible
and if	the candidates to that extent are not available, and
those vacancies	 could not  be filled up by other candidates
then such  candidates would  not get any appointment at all.
It is  only by	chance that  some of  the candidates  of the
backward  classes   not	 being	 available  that  the  other
candidates are	appointed. In fact if the carry-forward rule
is not	allowed to be adopted it may result in inequality to
the backward  classes of citizens who will not be able to be
absorbed in  public employment	in accordance  with the full
quota reserved for them by the Government. Thus if the carry
forward rule  is  not  upheld,	then  backwardness  will  be
perpetrated and	 it would result ultimately in a vacuum. For
these reasons,	therefore, I am of the opinion that the High
Court was  in error  in holding	 that the  State's action in
filling 34  vacancies out  of 51 by members of the scheduled
castes and tribes was illegal and could not be justified.
</p><p id="p_294">	  (iv) Reservation should not be made at the cost of
	       efficiency.
</p><p id="p_295">     This is  a very important condition for the application
of clause  (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_726">Art. 16.</a> No reservation can be made at the
cost of efficiency which is the prime consideration. But one
should	not   take  an	artificial  view  of  efficiency.  A
concession or  relaxation in  favour of	 a backward class of
citizens particularly  when they  are senior  in  experience
would not  amount to  any impairment  of efficiency.  It is,
however, not  necessary for  me to  dilate  on	this  aspect
because in my view the relaxation contained in r. 13-A.A. of
the rules  does not  fall within  clause (4)  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_727">Art. 16</a> but
falls squarely	within clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_728">Art. 16</a> as shown above,
and, therefore,	 I am of the opinion that the High Court was
in error  in holding that r. 13-A.A. was ultra vires and was
violative of  <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_729">Art. 16</a>  as it  thought that  this  rule	came
within the mischief of clause (4) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_730">Art. 16.</a>
</p><p id="p_296">     Before closing  this judgment  I would  like to allay a
serious apprehension  that has	been  expressed	 by  learned
counsel for  respondent No. 1 that if the Court is to give a
wide and  liberal interpretation to <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_731">Art. 14</a> and <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_732">Art. 16</a>, the
guarantees  of	 fundamental  right  to	 equality  might  be
completely eroded  in due  course of  time. I  have given my
anxious consideration  to this	argument and I am clearly of
the opinion  that the  apprehension expressed by the learned
counsel does  not appear  to be well founded. This Court has
upheld in  several cases  classifications  graver  and	more
damaging than  the one	made in	 the  present  case  without
affecting the  concept of  equality. For instance in Triloki
Nath Khosa's case (supra) this Court upheld a classification
made by	 the State  between the members of the same service,
recruited from the same source and holding the same posts on
the ground that one set of members having possessed a higher
qualification,	namely,	  a  degree  in	 engineering,  could
constitute a separate class and could be differently treated
from the  other members	 of the same service who were merely
diploma holders. What had happened in that case was that the
service of  Engineers was  one integrated service consisting
of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">1007</span>
Assistant Engineers  who were  merely  diploma	holders	 and
those who  were degree	holders. The  Government  passed  an
order by  which the  degree holders  could  be	promoted  to
higher grade  of service,  namely, to the posts of Executive
Engineer  or  Superintending  Engineer,	 which	was  however
blocked to those Assistant Engineers who were merely diploma
holders. This  rule was	 struck down  by the  High Court  of
Jammu &amp;	 Kashmir but  the Supreme  Court on appeal held that
qualification was  a reasonable ground of classification and
by virtue  of the  qualification the Assistant Engineers who
were degree holders could be shown a preferential treatment.
The position does not appear to be worse in this case and on
a parity of reasoning the Government has merely extended the
time prescribed	 for departmental tests for the promotees by
treating them  as a  special class  for two reasons-(1) that
they were senior to and more experienced than the respondent
No. 1; and (2), that they belonged to backward classes being
members	 of   the  scheduled   castes  and  tribes  and	 for
historical reasons  they did not have sufficient opportunity
to develop  their genius and intellectual capacity as others
could do.  I, therefore,  see no  reason to  hold that	this
classification was in any way unreasonable or arbitrary. The
conditions under  which classification	has to	be made,  as
pointed out  by me,  are so  strict and	 stringent that	 the
apprehension of	 erosion of  the concept of equality appears
to be  illusory. We  must remember that the Courts are meant
to interpret  and not  make the	 law. As Justice Frankfurter
observed.

<p id="p_297">     Finally there  can be no doubt that if the State action
in a  particular case amounts to an arbitrary classification
or a hostile discrimination which is violative of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_733">Art. 16</a> of
the Constitution  the Court  is there  to act as sentinel on
the qui vive in order to strike down such an action.
</p><p id="p_298">     For the  reasons  given  above,  I	 have  come  to	 the
conclusion that	 r. 13-A.A. of the rules is a valid piece of
statutory provision  which is  fully  justified	 under	<a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_734">Art.
16(1)</a> of  the Constitution of India and does not fall within
the purview of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_735">Art. 16(4).</a>
</p><p id="p_299">     I would,  therefore, allow	 the appeal,  set aside	 the
judgment of the High Court and direct the status quo ante to
be restored.  In the circumstances of this case, I leave the
parties to bear their respective costs.
