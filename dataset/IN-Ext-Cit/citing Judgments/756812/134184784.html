</pre><p id="p_1">           The appellant was charged under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_1">Sections 498A</a> and

<a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_2">304B</a> of the IPC and alternatively, under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_3">Section 302</a> of the IPC

along with two other accused namely Karam Ali and Anwara

Begam by the Sessions Judge, Gomati Judicial District. The other

two accused were acquitted from the charge on benefit of doubt

but the appellant has been convicted under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_4">section 498A</a> and

<a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_5">304B</a> of the IPC by the Sessions Judge, having observed that from

the evidence of PWs-2, 3, 4 7, 9 and 11, it has clearly transpired

that wife of the appellant namely Rahima Begam @ Marjina was
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                Page 2 of 49</span>

being tortured and harassed by the appellant on demand of

dowry,   particularly   for    articles   like   televisions   etc.   That

harassment goaded the victim to commit suicide. Pursuant to the

said conviction, the appellant has been sentenced to suffer

rigorous imprisonment of 3 (three) years and to pay fine

Rs.5000/-    with   default    stipulation    for   committing      offence

punishable under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_6">Section 498A</a> of the IPC. He has been further

sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for 10 (ten) years and

to pay fine of Rs.10,000/- with default stipulation for committing

offence punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_7">Section 304B</a> of the IPC. It has been

directed if the fine money is realized, the same shall be paid to the

father of Rahima Begam (the deceased). Both the sentences are

directed to run concurrently. The period of detention as undergone

by the appellant has been directed to be set off from the term of

imprisonment under <a href="/doc/914361/" id="a_8">Section 428</a> of the CrPC. The said judgment

and order of conviction and sentence dated 21.09.2019 are

challenged by the appellant in this appeal.
</p>
<p id="p_2">[2]         Based on a written complaint (Exbt-2) filed by one

Rajjak   Miah   (PW-3)    on     02.06.2016,        Kakraban   PS     Case

No.2016KKB042 under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_9">Section 498A</a>/<a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_10">302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_11">34</a> of the IPC was

registered and taken up for investigation. In the said complaint,

PW-3 had revealed cognizable offence to the officer-in-charge of

the said police station by stating that his daughter, Rahima Begam
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                              Page 3 of 49</span>

was given marriage to the appellant as per Shariat law. At the

time of marriage, a cash of Rs.5000/- gold jewelry weighing 1½

bhari, wooden furniture etc. were given away on demand of the

groom. His daughter and the appellant lived their married life

peacefully for one and half year. One girl child was born in the

wedlock. After birth of the girl child, Babul Miah (the appellant)

Karam Ali (the accused who has been acquitted) Anwara Bibi (the

other accused who has been acquitted) and Habul Miah (the

brother of the appellant) started torturing his daughter physically

and mentally. They had increased their torture on his daughter by

saying that "the materials given in marriage were not good

enough". His daughter used to inform him about such incidents

over her mobile phone. As PW-3 was not comfortable with his

finance, he could not give the television set at the time of

marriage. Moreover, the appellant had one television in their

house. When his daughter went to watch that television, the

accused persons used to make bad comments e.g. if you want to

see the television, then bring it from your father‟s house.

[3]        On 24.05.2019, the appellant had beaten his daughter

severely. Several times, PW3 visited his daughter‟s matrimonial

home to bring his daughter. Every time the accused persons used

to tell him to change the material those were given in the

marriage, else his daughter would not be permitted to go to their
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                               Page 4 of 49</span>

house. On 01.06.2016, the day before the filing of the complaint

(Exbt-2) at about 9.30 pm when the PW3 had called his daughter,

she told him that the appellant had told her that she would never

be allowed to go to her father‟s house. On 02.06.2016 about 10

am in the morning, one Rubel Miah, a resident of Rajdhannagar,

informed him over telephone that Rahima had died by hanging a

few moments ago. PW3 having the said information, rushed to the

place of the appellant along with his relatives. Thereafter, in that

context, he hasstated in the complaint as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                      "I noticed that Rahima had been laid down over the
                bed after she was brought down from the hanging state
                on a ceiling fan by Gamcha (the napkin) I firmly believe by
                observing my daughter that my daughter Rahima had not
                committed suicide by hanging herself. The accused
                persons had hanged my daughter by killing her and later
                they brought her down from there and laid down over the
                bed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_3">[4]        After the investigation was complete, the police filed

that final report chargesheeting the accused persons, as noted

before. Since the offences, except of the <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_12">section 498A</a> of the IPC

are exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, on taking

cognizance, the police papers were committed to the court of the

Sessions Judge who on 17.01.2018 framed the charge as

described before. The accused persons including the appellant had

denied the charge and claimed to be tried in accordance with law.

[5]        The prosecution, in order to substantiate the charge,

adduced as many as 15 witnesses (PWs 1 to 15) including the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                              Page 5 of 49</span>

complainant (PW-3). That apart, the prosecution had introduced 7

documentary evidence (Exbts-1 to 11) including the inquest report

(Exbt-1) and the post mortem examination report (Exbt-6). After

the prosecution‟s evidence was recorded by the Sessions Judge,

the appellant and the other accused persons were separately

examined under <a href="/doc/886494/" id="a_13">Section 313(1)(b)</a> of the CrPC for having their

response in respect of incriminating materials as surfaced in the

evidence. The accused persons including the appellant reiterated

their plea of innocence and stated that they have been falsely

implicated with mala fide intention.
</p>
<p id="p_4">[6]        In order to rebut the prosecution evidence, two

witnesses (DWs 1 to 2) were examined by the defence. Mr. R.

Datta, learned counsel appearing for the appellant has contended

that the trial judge while returning the finding of conviction, failed

to appreciate the evidence objectively. He has overlooked the

materials discrepancies, improved versions and contradictions in

the statement of PWs 3, 4, 7, 9, and 11 on whose testimonies, the

find of the conviction has been returned. There is no convincing

evidence of torture or harassment on demand of dowry soon

before the death of the deceased. More importantly, there is no

evidence of unlawful demand in order to establish cruelty to

punish the appellant under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_14">Section 498A</a> of the IPC. The

investigation carried out by PWs 13, 14 and 15 cannot be stated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                              Page 6 of 49</span>

to be in accordance with law. Mr. R. Datta, learned counsel for the

appellant has contended that there was no investigation. There is

no evidence to show that PW-3 or the deceased had complaint

against the appellant during her lifetime. Mr. Datta, learned

counsel has quite emphatically submitted that from the evidence

of DWs 1 and 2, it has clearly transpired that the marital life of

the appellant and the deceased was quite normal and cordial. On

the day of the occurrence, the room in which the deceased was

found hanging from a fan was bolted from inside that was to be

broken to enter into the room. As such, the prosecution story of

murder is figment of wild imagination. But the investigating

officers were greatly influenced by the hypothesis of murder and

they had carried out an offender-centric investigation and such

investigation cannot be termed as fair investigation.

[7]        In support of his contention, Mr. Datta, learned counsel

has relied on a decision of the apex court in <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_15">Appasaheb and

Another vs. State of Maharashtra</a> reported in (2007) 9 SCC 721

where the apex court had occasion to observe that the definition

of "dowry" as provided by <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_16">Section 2</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act is

sufficient to understand the meaning and purport of dowry. Dowry

is fairly well known in the social custom or practice in India. It has

been observed in Appasaheb (supra) as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                        "Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or
                 practice in India. It is well settled principle of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                             Page 7 of 49</span>

               interpretation of Statute that if the Act is passed with
               reference to a particular trade, business or transaction
               and words are used which everybody conversant with that
               trade, business or transaction knows or understands to
               have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be
               construed as having that particular meaning. (<a href="/doc/505565/" id="a_17">See Union
               of India v. Garware Nylons Ltd</a>. : AIR (1996) SC 3509 and
               <a href="/doc/420006/" id="a_18">Chemicals and Fibres of India v. Union of India</a> : AIR
               (1997) SC 558). A demand for money on account of some
               financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic
               expenses of for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a
               demand for dowry as the said word is normally
               understood. The evidence adduced by the prosecution
               does not, therefore, show that any demand for "dowry" as
               defined in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_19">Section 2</a> of the Dowry Prohibition Act was
               made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for
               was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for
               purchasing manure. Since an essential ingredient of
               <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_20">Section 304-B</a> IPC viz. demand for dowry is not
               established, the conviction of the appellants cannot be
               sustained."

<p id="p_5">[8]       Mr. Datta, learned counsel has also referred to a

decision of the apex court in <a href="/doc/73680580/" id="a_21">Durga Prasad and Another vs. State

               made on behalf of the respective parties, we are inclined
               to allow the benefit of doubt to the appellants having
               particular regard to the fact that except for certain bald
               statements made by PWs.1 and 3 alleging that the victim
               had been subjected to cruelty and harassment prior to her
               death, there is no other evidence to prove that the victim
               committed suicide on account of cruelty and harassment
               to which she was subjected just prior to her death, which,
               in fact, are the ingredients of the evidence to be led in
               respect of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_22">Section 113-B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872,

               IPC, it has to be shown that apart from the fact that the

               burn or bodily injury, otherwise than under normal
               circumstances, within 7 years of her marriage, it has also

               subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any
               relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any
               demand for dowry. Only then would such death be called
               "dowry death" and such husband or relative shall be

               concerned.

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                      18. In this case, one other aspect has to be kept in
                mind, namely, that no charges were framed against the
                Appellants under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_25">Dowry Prohibition
                Act</a>, 1961 and the evidence led in order to prove the same
                for the purposes of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_26">Section 304-B</a> IPC was related to a
                demand for a fan only.

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                       19. The decision cited by Mr. R.P. Gupta, learned
                Senior Advocate, in Biswajit Halder's case : (2008) 1 SCC
                202, was rendered in almost similar circumstances. In

                IPC, it will not be sufficient to only lead evidence showing
                that cruelty or harassment had been meted out to the
                victim, but that such treatment was in connection with the
                demand for dowry. In our view, the prosecution in this
                case has failed to fully satisfy the requirements of both
                <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_28">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 and <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_29">Section 304-</a>

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                       20. Accordingly, we are unable to agree with the
                views expressed both by the trial Court, as well as the
                High Court, and we are of the view that no case can be
                made out on the ground of insufficient evidence against
                the appellants for conviction under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_30">Sections 498-A</a> and

only lead evidence showing that cruelty or harassment had been

meted out to the victim and such harassment was in connection

with demand for dowry. Unless the said foundation of evidence is

laid, no presumption under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_38">section 113B</a> of the Evidence Act can

be drawn.

<p id="p_6">[10]        Mr. Datta, learned counsel has also referred a few

other decisions of the apex court in order to lay the law relating to

interpretation or the interplay of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_39">Section 113B</a> of the Indian

Evidence Act, and <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_40">Section 304B</a> of the IPC. <a href="/doc/108888974/" id="a_41">In Hira Lal and Others

vs. State (Govt. of NCT), Delhi</a> reported in (2003) 8 SCC 80, the

apex court had observed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">                A conjoint reading of <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_42">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act
                and <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_43">Section 304-B</a> IPC shows that there must be material
                to show that soon before her death the victim was
                subjected to cruelty or harassment. The prosecution has
                to rule out the possibility of a natural or accidental death
                so as to bring it within the purview of the "death
                occurring otherwise than in normal circumstances". The
                expression "soon before" is very relevant where <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_44">Section
                113-B</a> of the Evidence Act and <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_45">Section 304-B</a> IPC are
                pressed into service. The prosecution is obliged to show
                that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or
                harassment and only in that case presumption operates.
                Evidence in that regard has to be led by prosecution.
                "Soon before" is a relative term and it would depend upon
                circumstances of each case and no strait-jacket formula
                can be laid down as to what would constitute a period of
                soon before the occurrence. It would be hazardous to
                indicate any fixed period, and that brings in the
                importance of a proximity test both for the proof of an
                offence of dowry death as well as for raising a
                presumption under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_46">Section 113-B</a> of the Evidence Act. The
                expression "soon before her death" used in the
                substantive <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_47">Section 304-B</a> IPC and <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_48">Section 113-B</a> of the
                Evidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. No
                definite period has been indicated and the expression
                "soon before" is not defined. A reference to expression
                "soon before" used in Section 114 Illustration (a) of the
                <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_49">Evidence Act</a> is relevant. It lays down that a Court may
                presume that a man who is in the possession of goods
                "soon after the theft, is either the thief has received the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                              Page 10 of 49</span>

                goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account
                for his possession". The determination of the period which
                can come within the term "soon before" is left to be
                determined by the Courts, depending upon facts and
                circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate
                that the expression "soon before" would normally imply
                that the interval should not be much between the
                concerned cruelty or harassment and the death in
                question. There must be existence of a proximate and live-
                link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry demand
                and the concerned death. If alleged incident of cruelty is
                remote in time and has become stale enough not to
                disturb mental equilibrium of the woman concerned, it
                would be of no consequence."

defines "dowry" as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_8">"2. Definition of "dowry" - In this Act, "dowry" means any

either directly or indirectly -

</p><p id="p_11">       Keeping in view the object, a new <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_58">Section 113-B</a>
was introduced in the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_59">Evidence Act</a> to raise a presumption
as to dowry death. It reads as under:
</p>
<p id="p_12">       "113B. Presumption as to dowry death - When the

person had caused the dowry death.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      Explanation - For the purposes of this section,
"dowry death" shall have the same meaning as in <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_60">Section
304B</a> of the Indian Penal Code.
</p>
<p id="p_14">       One another provision which is relevant in this
context in <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_61">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. which reads as under:

subjecting her to cruelty- Whoever being the husband or
the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such
woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for
a term which may extend to three years and shall also be
liable to fine.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      Explanation - For the purposes of this section,
"cruelty" means-
</p>
<p id="p_17">a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely
to drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave
injury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or
physical) of the woman; or

</p><p id="p_18">b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is
with a view to coercing her or any person related to her to
meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable
security or is on account of failure by her or any person
related to her to meet such demand.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      A careful analysis of <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_62">Section 304B</a> shows that this
section has the following essentials:
</p>
<p id="p_20">(1) The death of a woman should be caused by burns of
bodily  injury   or  otherwise  than  under   normal
circumstances;
</p>
<p id="p_21">(2) Such death should have occurred within seven years
of her marriage;
</p>
<p id="p_22">(3) She must have been subjected to cruelty or
harassment by her husband or any relative of her
husband;
</p>
<p id="p_23">(4) Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in
connection with demand for dowry.
</p>
<p id="p_24">       <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_63">Section 113B</a> of the Evidence Act lays down that if
soon before the death such woman has been subjected to
cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any
demand for dowry, then the Court shall presume that such
person has committed the dowry death. The meaning of
"cruelty" for the purposes of these sections has to be
gathered from the language as found in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_64">Section 498A</a> and
as per that section "cruelty" means "any wilful conduct
which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to
commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life
etc. or harassment to coerce her or any other person
related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any
property or valuable security or is on account of failure by
her or any person related to her to meet such demand." As
per the definition of "dowry" any property or valuable
security given or agreed to be given either at or before or
any time after the marriage, comes within the meaning of
"dowry". With this background of the provisions of law we
shall examine the facts in the instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_25">       5. Both the courts below have held that the two
appellants did not send the deceased to her parent's
house and drove out the brother as well as the father of
the deceased complaining that scooter and television have
not been given as dowry. We have carefully examined this
part of the prosecution case and we are satisfied that the
prosecution has established beyond all reasonable doubt
that the appellants treated the deceased cruelly and the
same squarely comes within the meaning of "cruelty"
which is an essential under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_65">Section 304B</a> and that such
cruelty was for demand for dowry, It is an admitted fact
that death occurred within seven years of the marriage.
Therefore three essentials are satisfied. Now we shall see
whether the other essential namely whether the death
occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">              Page 13 of 49</span>

also established? From the evidence of P.W.I, the father,
P.W.2 the brother, and P.W.3 the mother, it is clear that
they were not even informed soon about the death and
that the appellants hurriedly cremated the dead body.
Under these circumstances the presumption under <a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_66">Section
113B</a> is attracted. The accused examined defence
witnesses to rebut the presumption and to show that the
deceased suffered heart-attack. We have examined the
evidence of D.Ws 2 and 3 and we agree with the courts
below that this theory of natural death cannot be accepted
at all. No material "was placed to show that the deceased
suffered any such attack previously. If it was natural
there was no need for the appellants to act in such
unnatural manner and cremate the body in great and
unholy haste without even informing the parents. Because
of this cremation no post-mortem could be conducted and
the actual cause of death could not be established clearly.
There is absolutely no material to indicate even remotely
that it was a case of natural death. It is nobody's case that
it was accidental death. In the result it was an unnatural
death; either homicidal or suicidal. But even assuming
that it is a case of suicide even then it would be death
which had occurred in unnatural circumstances. Even in
such a case, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_67">Section 304B</a> is attracted and this position is
not disputed. Therefore, the prosecution has established
that the appellants have committed an offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_68">Section 304B</a> beyond all reasonable doubt.

</p><p id="p_26">       6. Now we shall consider the question as to whether
the acquittal of the appellants of the offence punishable
under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_69">Section 498A</a> makes any difference. The submission
of the learned counsel is that the acquittal under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_70">Section
498A</a> I.P.C. would lead to the effect that the cruelty on the
part of the accused is not established. We see no force in
this submission. The High Court only held that <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_71">Section
304B</a> and <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_72">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. are mutually exclusive and
that when once the cruelty envisaged in <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_73">Section 498A</a>
I.P.C. culminates in dowry death of the victim, <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_74">Section
304B</a> alone is attracted and in that view of the matter the
appellants were acquitted under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_75">Section 498A</a> I.P.C. It can
therefore be seen that the High Court did not hold that the
prosecution has not established cruelty on the part of the
appellants but on the other hand the High Court
considered the entire evidence and held that the element
of cruelty which is also an essential of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_76">Section 304B</a> I.P.C.
has been established. Therefore the mere acquittal of the
appellants   under     <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_77">Section  498A</a>      I.P.C.  in   these
circumstances makes no difference for the purpose of this
case. However, we want to point out that this view of the
High Court is not correct and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_78">Sections 304B</a> and <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_79">498A</a>
cannot be held to be mutually exclusive. These provisions
deal with two distinct offences. It is true that "cruelty" is
a common essential to both the sections and that has to
be proved. The Explanation to <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_80">Section 498A</a> gives the
meaning of "cruelty". In <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_81">Section 304B</a> there is no such
explanation about the meaning of "cruelty" but having
regard to the common background to these offences we
have to take that the meaning of "cruelty or harassment"
will be the same as we find in the explanation to Section
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                              Page 14 of 49</span>

                498A under which "cruelty" by itself amounts to an
                offence and is punishable. Under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_82">Section 304B</a> as already
                noted, it is the "dowry death" that is punishable and such
                death should have occurred within seven years of the
                marriage. No such period is mentioned in <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_83">Section 498A</a>
                and the husband or his relative would be liable for
                subjecting the woman to "cruelty" any time after the
                marriage. Further, it must also be borne in mind that a
                person charged and acquitted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_84">Section 304B</a> can be
                convicted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_85">Section 498A</a> without charge being there,
                if such a case is made out. But from the point of view of
                practice and procedure and to avoid technical defects it is
                necessary in such cases to frame charges under both the
                sections and if the case is established they can be
                convicted under both the sections but no separate
                sentence need be awarded under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_86">Section 498A</a> in view of
                the substantive sentence being awarded for the major
                offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_87">Section 304B</a>."

however, intriguing may be fact and circumstances of the case,

the charges made against the accused must be proved beyond all

reasonable doubt and the requirement of proof cannot stay in the

realm of surmise and conjuncture. The requirement of proof

beyond reasonable doubt does not stand altered. Even after the

introduction of <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_102">section 498A</a> of the IPC and <a href="/doc/294349/" id="a_103">Section 113A</a> of the

Indian Evidence Act, the court‟s concerns must be satisfied that

the accused is not held guilty when there are reasonable doubts

about the complicity of the accused in respect of the offences

alleged. It should be borne in mind that         there is no absolute

standard for proof in a criminal trial and the question whether the

charges   made   against    the    accused   have    been   beyond     all

reasonable doubts must depend upon the facts and circumstances

of the case and also on the quality of the evidence adduced in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                              Page 17 of 49</span>

case and the materials placed on record. The doubt must be of a

reasonable man and the standard adopted must be a standard

adopted by a reasonable and just man for coming to a conclusion

considering the relevant context. Even though Mr. Datta, learned

counsel has not referred to Better vs. Better reported in (1950) 2

All ER 458 but we should. In that case, Lord Dening J espoused

the concept of the reasonable doubt as the doubt of a reasonable

man and the standard for that purpose be adopted that of a

reasonable and just man. In      Orilal Jaiswal (supra) it has been

further observed as follows:

[15]      Mr. S. Debnath, learned Addl. PP has submitted that

the combination of evidence introduced by PWs 2, 3 ,4, 7, 9, and

11 makes it abundantly clear that appellant had tortured his wife,

Rahima both physically and mentally on demand of TV. The

evidence of those witnesses are so natural, those outweigh the

defence evidence as introduced through DWs 1 and 2. Mr.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                            Page 18 of 49</span>

Debnath, learned counsel has particularly pointed out that three

days prior to her death, Rahima came to the house of her father

and told him that her husband (the appellant) was demanding TV

and fridge. It is also clear from the evidence that her mother-in-
</blockquote>
<p id="p_28">law taunted Rahima as the necklace given by her parents was

"thin". The appellant and his parents used to taunt her on the

demand of TV as the TV was not given at the time of marriage.

One week before the death of Rhiama, her brother PW-4 went to

the maternal home of the victim. At that time, the victim had

shown PW-4, marks of injury inflicted by the appellant on her

person.
</p>
<p id="p_29">[16]      According to Mr. Debnath, learned Addl. PP, the

evidence of PW-2 occupies of paramount importance in respect of

proof of dowry death punishable under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_105">Section 304B</a> of the IPC.

PW-2 has testified in the trial stating that she heard hue and cry

from the house of the accused and could realize that Marzina Bibi

was crying and shortly thereafter, the news of Rahima‟s hanging

broke out. PW-2 has however stated while deposing in the trial

that she had no knowledge about the marital life of the victim, but

her version that she saw Rahima crying soon before her hanging

has indicated to "the torturous and unbearable atmosphere in the

matrimonial home". PW-9 had also corroborated the torture by the

appellant on the victim (Rahima) aided by his parents. PW-9 has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                             Page 19 of 49</span>

categorically testified that Rahima told her that they tortured her

on demand of a TV.
</p>
<p id="p_30">[17]       Mr.   Debnath,    learned        Addl.PP,   thereafter,   has

submitted that it stands out clearly from the prosecution‟s

evidence that being unable to cope with torture and harassment,

the victim chose the extreme step and she committed suicide by

hanging. Soon before her death, she was subjected to harassment

on demand of dowry. She had shown to PW-4, the marks of injury

inflicted by the appellant. Few minutes before the hanging,

Rahima (the victim) was found crying. It is thus sufficiently

established by the prosecution that soon before the death of the

victim she was ill treated, harassed and obviously tortured on

demand of dowry by the appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_31">[18]       Mr. Debnath, learned Addl. PP has submitted that the

evidence as placed by the prosecution, if taken together, could

show that the prosecution has successfully brought home the

charge under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_106">Section 498A</a> and <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_107">304B</a> of the IPC beyond

reasonable doubt and as such the statutory presumption under

<a href="/doc/1906/" id="a_108">Section 113B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act can unhesitatingly be

drawn. Mr. Debnath, learned Addl. PP has referred a passage from

Orilal Jaiswal (supra) where in respect of the probative value of

testimonies of the interested witnesses has been discussed. It has

been held in Orilal Jaiwsal as under:

                 instant case, the evidence about physical and mental
                 torture of the deceased has come from the mother, elder
                 brother and other close relations. Such depositions by
                 close relations, who may be interested in the prosecution
                 of the accused, need not be discarded simply on the score

                 Whether the evidence of interested witness is worthy of

[19]       Even in Balwinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported

in 1996 CRl.L.J 883 SC, the apex court had sounded caution to the

trial courts that they should not get swayed by emotional

considerations and allowed suspicion, surmise and conjecture to

take the place of legal proof. Mr. Debnath, Addl. PP has further

submitted that the principle of "beyond reasonable doubt" cannot

be applied casualty. It must be applied to further the ends of

justice, but not to defeat it. According to Mr. Debnath, learned

Addl. PP, there is no infirmity in the finding of conviction and

therefore no interference is called for.

<p id="p_33">[20]       A short survey of the evidence requires to be taken for

appreciating the rival contentions as advanced by the counsel for

the parties. As stated earlier, the prosecution has candidly

admitted that testimonies of PWs 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 are mostly

undisputed. At the outset this court will take note of the

testimonies of those witnesses.

[21]       PW-2,    Mst.   Saleha    Begum    is   a    witness   from

neigbourhood and she has stated that she heard hue and cry in

the house of the appellant. She found Marjina Bibi (the victim )

was crying and thereafter, she entered in a room of their house.

After sometimes, her daughter told her that Marjina died by

hanging. She has denied to have any knowledge about the affairs

of the family of the appellant or why Marjina died of hanging. In

the cross-examination, she had denied to have been interrogated

by the police and stated further that she did not say to the police

that she saw Marjina crying or she heard hue and cry in the house

of the appellant. The defence did not try to bring out any omission

or contradiction of her said statement, perhaps for the reason that

she had denied to have made any statement to the police.

[22]       PW-5, Sri Bijoy Sarkar, a constable of Kakarabn Police

Station was the witness of the seizure of vicera of the deceased

from Dr. Gayatri Debnath (PW-12). He has identified the seizure

list (Exbt-3) and his signature thereon in the trial.

[23]       PW-6, Sri Rahul Amin is a witness to the inquest report.

He has stated that he heard hue and cry from the house of the

appellant. He had rushed     to the house of the appellant and he

found the wife of Babul Miah lying dead on the cot and "a gamcha

tied in her neck‟ and in the fan of the room a piece of gamcha was

found tied. The dead body was brought down by cutting the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                            Page 22 of 49</span>

gamcha and that was the reason why a part of the gamcha was

around the neck and the other part was hanging from the fan. He

has denied any knowledge whether that was murder or suicide.

Since PW 6 did not support the prosecution case by deviating from

his statement as recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_109">Section 161</a> of the CrPC (Exbt-4),

he was cross examined by the prosecution, but denied to have

made any statement to the police officer. In the cross-examination

carried out the defence, he has stated that Rahima‟s mother did

never complain about ill treatment by her in-laws.

[24]      PW-8, Sri Anju Miah Kazi is the Moulvi who conducted

the marriage between Rahima and the appellant. He could not

state anything when the marriage was conducted.

[25]      PW-10, Smt. Manika Debbarma, the Senior Scientific

Officer from the State Forensic Science Laboratory (SFSL). She

has stated that from examination of various bodily parts of

Marjina Bibi @ Rahima as collected by PW 12, presence of organo

phosphorous, organo chloro, carbamates, pyrethroids group of

pesticides and venzodiazetimepimes varbituratus group drugs or

partly open with dribbling of salivation mark in the right side of

angel of mouth upto the right side of chest. No injury mark was

present over the whole body. A single ligature mark, not

continuous, encircling the neck was directed upward, towards the

left 3-4 cm in width with knot present over the left side of neck

touching the tip of the left mastoid process. The ligature mark was

present above the thyroid process and cartilage. On dissection the

underline subcutaneous tissues, muscles were pale, glysterine and

there was no       bruising. PW12 collected the viscera namely

stomach with its contents part of liver and part of lung. According

to PW-12, the time of death was 20-25 hours before from the post

mortem examination. She admitted in the evidence her report

(Exbt-6). It may be noted at this juncture that according to the

report post mortem had commenced on 03.06.2016 at 11 am.

PW-12 has clearly opined that the cause of death was „asphyxia as

a result of hanging‟. It appears that the defence did not cross

<p id="p_36">[27]      PWs-13, 14, 15      are the investigating officers in

(Exbt-3) from PW12. He confirmed the statement of Malek Miah

(PW-1) from which statement the said witness deviated from. The

said statement was admitted in the evidence as Exbt-10. Even the

relevant statement of PW-6 as recorded by him has been admitted

in the evidence as Exbt-11. In the cross-examination, he has

categorically stated that it is not mentioned in the statement of

Mohar Miah (PW4) that he told him that Babul Miah had illicit

relation with a woman. It is also not mentioned in the statement

(under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_110">Section 161</a> of the Cr.PC) PW4 had stated him that mother

injury and told that the injuries were caused due to beating by her

husband after consuming alcohol, or that three days her death

Rahima     was   sent   to   her   father‟s   house   by   the   in-laws

commanding her to bring TV from the house of her father or that

verified the action of the previous investigation office and found

that the investigation was carried out meticulously. When she

went on maternity leave, the investigation was handed over to

PW-14, Robert Darlong another Dy.SP. He had arrested the

accused Anwara Begam and examined or re-examined witnesses

namely Rajjak Miah, Saleha Begam, Jakir Hossein, Rinku Begam,

on 24.05.2016, Rahima was beaten in the evening beaten up by

her parents in laws or having information her father went to bring

her back, but the accused persons did not allow her to go with her

father. Even he has denied to have made a statement that on

[30]      PW-3, Sri Rajjak Miah is the unfortunate father of the

deceased and he had lodged the complaint (Exbt-2). In the trial,

he has stated that in the year 2010 as per Sharia laws marriage

between her daughter and the appellant was contracted. His

daughter was happy for some times but afterwards her father-in-

law, Karam Ali and her husband, Babul Miah started demanding

TV and asked her to watch TV only if she got it from her father.

Rahima used to tell him about the said demand. Thereafter, she

has stated her husband used to assault her and he used to go

their 2-3 times in a month to settle the issue. Three days before

her death, Rahima came to his house and returned to the

matrimonial one day before the death. PW-3 has reiterated that

the husband was demanding TV and fridge. One day after Rahima

returned to her matrimonial house, he got one phone from Rubel

Miah (not examined in the trial) that his daughter had been killed

by the appellant and his father. Her dead body was laid in the cot.

PW-3 rushed to the house of the appellant and found the

appellant‟s father, Karam Ali only present in the house and the

others were absent. Rahima was lying dead on the cot. A gamcha

was tied around her neck. Thereafter, PW-3 has stated that he

"learned that she was killed by strangulation" by napkin. Some

were saying that she had committed suicide by hanging. When he

had visited that place, the police were present there, but he did

not talk to Karam Ali. He had narrated the incident to the police

officer, who recorded the same and he had signed over that

younger sister, was contracted on 29.06.2010. After 5-6 months

of her marriage, her husband and father-in-law started torturing

Rahima "as Babul Miah has illicit relation with one woman in

Sonamura, Sephijala. Babul used to torture and send her to our

house". He has stated in the trial that she had a daughter of three

years of age at the time of her death. According to him, a dowry

of Rs.50,000/-, 1 and 1/2 bhari (the local unit of measuring

valuable metal) necklace were given away. Rahima‟s mother-in-

law used to taunt her saying that her necklace was too thin. But

the appellant and his father and parents-in-law mostly taunted her

in relation to demand of TV as they did not give TV at the time of

marriage. Often, they used to assault her. One week before

Rahima‟s   death,   PW-4   claimed    to   have   visited   Rahima‟s

matrimonial home. At that time, Rahima showed marks of injuries

on her body and those were claimed to have caused by her

husband by beating her, after consuming alcohol. Three days

before her death, Rahima was sent to her paternal house by her

in-laws by stating that she should bring TV from their house. On

the previous day of her death, he took her to in-laws house. It

was Thursday. Next day, when he was selling fish at Santirbazaar,

he got the information by mobile phone at 10 am that Rahima was

killed by her husband and in-laws. Immediately, he had rushed to

their house along with his parents and some neighbours. On

with neck with loose knot. Her father-in-law told them she had

committed suicide by hanging. No other inmates were found

present in the house. But the narrative of the suicide was not

acceptable, as the ceiling fan was set in low height, it would reach

her chest if she stood on the bed. He had also put his signature on

the inquest report after the inquest was carried out by the police

officer.
</p>
<p id="p_41">[33]       In the cross-examination, he has stated that he did not

know with whom the appellant had the extra marital affairs.

Rahima did not say the name of that woman but after Rahima‟s

death, the appellant married that woman. But he did not know the

name of that woman. He had seen her with the appellant. He had

seen that woman in a ceremony in Sonamura. He has asserted

that he told police that the appellant had illicit relation with a

woman. But when was confronted with his previous statement

recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_120">Section 161</a> of the CrPC, the statement that her

mother-in-law taunted about the necklace being thin was not

found. Even the statements that he told the investigation officer

one week before Rahima‟s death, he went to their house and

Rahima showed him marks of injury and said that those were

caused by her husband by beating her after consuming alcohol,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                              Page 31 of 49</span>

were not found in the statement of PW4 as recorded under

<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_121">Section 161</a> of the CrPC. The concerned investigating officer had

admitted that no such statement was made to him. Similarly, his

statements that he told the investigating officer that three days

before her death, Rahima was sent to their house by in laws by

force commanding her to bring TV from their house and on

previous day of her death, he took her to the in-laws house were

also not found when PW-4 was confronted by the defence in this

regard. PW-4 has stated that the investigating officer did not

record his statement properly. He has denied the defence

suggestion that no dowry was given during the marriage or that

the victim was not being taunted in her matrimonial house for the

gold necklace being thin or she did not bring the TV etc. Even his

statement that he had stated to the police officer that her mother-

in-law and husband were not present in the house, when they

visited their house after the death of Rahima. When his attention

was drawn to the previous statement recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_122">Section 161</a>

of CrPC, no such statement was found.
</p>
<p id="p_42">[34]      PW-7,    Sri   Jakir   Hossain     is   a   witness   from   the

neighbourhood of the appellant. He has stated in the trial that he

came to learn from his wife that the appellant‟s wife hanged

herself. He has stated in the trial when he tried to talk to the

appellant‟s mother, she did not talk to him. He found on reaching
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                             Page 32 of 49</span>

the place of occurrence that Rahima was lying dead on the cot and

a gamcha was tied around her neck. He has denied that he has no

knowledge about any affairs of the house of the appellant.

</p><p id="p_43">           In the cross-examination, he has categorically stated

that "I did not hear anything bad in their family affairs. Rahima or

her father never told me about any assault or torture by the

accused persons."
</p>
<p id="p_44">[35]       PW-9, Smt. Rinku Begum stated that the victim is her

niece. The appellant married her. She has stated that after

marriage, Rahima used to be tortured by her husband and her

parents-in-law. Rahima had told her that they tortured on demand

of TV. Even she had stated that her mother-in-law used to scold

and assault her. She had a daughter aged about 3 years at the

time of her death. One month before her death, Rahima came to

her father‟s house. She visited the place of occurrence on getting

the information and found Rahima lying dead on the cot. A

gamcha was tied around her neck. Her in-laws were not present in

the house. After about an hour after she had reached the place of

occurrence, her father-in-law came and the dead body was shifted

to the hospital. During the cross-examination, she was confronted

with her statement that after Rahima‟s death, she had rushed to

their house and found Rahima lying dead on the cot and a gamcha

was tied around her neck. She could not show her statement in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                              Page 33 of 49</span>

the previous statement as recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_123">section 161</a> of the CrPC

by the investigating officer, she denied the suggestion that she did

not state the said fact to the police. She has denied that she had

made that incriminating statement being the relative of the victim.

Even she has denied the suggestion that the accused persons did

not torture Rahima on demand of TV or her mother-in-law did not

assault or torture her.
</p>
<p id="p_45">[36]       PW-11, Sri Rashid Miah has stated that one week

before the death of the victim, referred by him as Marjina Bibi, he

went to Rajjak Miah‟s house by his auto rickshaw. He took Marjina

and her father to his house from the matrimonial house of Marjina

following a dispute in her matrimonial home by his auto rickshaw.

Thereafter, he has stated in the trial as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_32">                 They told me that Marjina's husband was demanding
                 Rs.50,000/- from her father for purchasing an auto
                 rickshaw. Her father was unable to meet the demand.
                 Marjina was being tortured by her in-laws and husband as
                 she told to her father in my presence. Marjina also told
                 that her husband was torturing her as he wanted to marry
                 another woman. After three days of that journey Marjina
                 died. On the day of her death I went to her matrimonial
                 house and found her dead body lying on the cot."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_46">[37]       He has also stated in the trial that Rahima‟s nick name

was Marjina. When his attention was drawn in the course of cross-

examination as regards his statement that seven days before her

death, he took Marjina and her father to her father‟s house, PW-

11 could not find out such statement in his previous statement as

recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_124">Section 161</a> of the CrPC. There is no mention of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                              Page 34 of 49</span>

demanding an amount of Rs.50,000/- in the said previous

statement. Further, when his attention was drawn as regards his

statement that Marjina told him that her husband was torturing

as he wanted to marry another woman, PW-11 could not find out

such statement in his previous statement as recorded under

<a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_125">section 161</a> of the CrPC. Even his statement that he went to the

house of Marjina on the day of her death, when was confronted

he could not find the said statement in his previous statement as

recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_126">Section 161</a> of the CrPC. He has also stated that

his statement was recorded after one month of the occurrence,

though he was at his house all through. The suggestions, contrary

to the statement he made in the examination-in-chief, has been

squarely denied by PW-11.

<p id="p_47">             In the examination carried out under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_127">Section 313</a> of the

CrPC, the appellant denied all the incriminatory         statements    as

recorded in the trial against him and reiterated his plea of

innocence.
</p>
<p id="p_48">[38]         To buttress his plea as well as to prove his story of

innocence, the appellant adduced two witnesses.

[39]         DW-1   Smt.   Hazerra   Bibi    is   a   witness   from   the

neighbourhood. According to her, the relation of the appellant with

the deceased (referred as Marjina) was cordial and she heard
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                 Page 35 of 49</span>

nothing about their domestic trouble. Thereafter, she made the

following statement in the trial:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_33">                          "On the day of death of Marjina I was in my house.
                    Suddenly I heard hue and cry of Marjina's father in law
                    Karam Ali. At that time the room of Marjina was closed
                    from inside. Then nearby people came and broke open the
                    door and found Marjina hanging and they thought that she
                    was alive and so brought her down. At that time Marjina's
                    mother in law and husband were not present in the
                    house."</blockquote><p id="p_49">


</p><p id="p_50">               In the cross-examination, she denied the all suggestion

contrary to statement she made in examination-in-chief.

[40]           DW-2, Shri Abul Hossain is a witness from the

neighbourhood. He has also testified in the trial that the

appellant‟s relation with Marjina was good. But Marjina never told

him of any ill treatment to her by her husband or by in-laws.

During time of death of Marjina, he was in Gazi bazaar. After

coming to home, he came to learn that Marjina was found hanged

in her room and she was brought down by people, "by breaking

open the door". The suggestion as made contrary to what he had

stated in the examination-in-chief was denied by DW-2.

[41]           Having perused the entire record of evidence, the

following questions have surfaced as material for determining the

appeal:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">       (1) Whether Rahima Begam @ Marjina Bibi was subjected to

       cruelty or harassment on demand of dowry soon before her

       death     which    occurred    otherwise     than    under    normal

       circumstances within seven years of her marriage?
</blockquote><span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                               Page 36 of 49</span>

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">       (2) Whether Rahima Begam @ Marjina Bibi was subjected to

       cruelty within the meaning of <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_128">Section 498A</a> of the IPC?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_51">[42]        Before we proceed to evaluate the evidence afresh in

the perspective of the questions as noted above, it would be

appropriate to scrutinize the opinion of the doctor (PW-12) as

regards the cause and how the death occurred. In the post

mortem report, which has been admitted by PW-12, PW-12 has

opined that the death was due to asphyxia, as a result of hanging.

From the Forensic Science Laboratory Report (Exbt-5) we have

noticed that the death did not occur from consumption of any

common poison. Death by hanging has got support from the

injuries, ante mortem in nature found, on the body of Rahima. On

the entire body, there was no mark of injury barring a single

ligature mark, not continuous but encircling the neck, description

of which has been given earlier. PW-12 has clearly stated that the

ligature mark was present above the thyoid process and cartilage.

In the cross-examination, PW-12 has categorically stated that that

was not a case of strangulation as in the case of strangulation the

ligature mark would be continuous and circular and in the case of

hanging the direction of ligature mark would be upward and

continues. Thus, it will be very difficult to infer a case of murder

and after murder, the body was hanged. According to the expert
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                               Page 37 of 49</span>

opinion, it is a case of suicidal hanging. In this regard, the finding

of the trial court requires no interference.

<blockquote id="blockquote_41">                 8. A perusal of this Section shows that this definition can
                 be broken into six distinct parts.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">                 1) Dowry must first consist of any property or valuable
                 security - the word "any" is a word of width and would,
                 therefore, include within it property and valuable security
                 of any kind whatsoever.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">                 2) Such property or security can be given or even agreed
                 to be given. The actual giving of such property or security
                 is, therefore, not necessary.

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">                 3) Such property or security can be given or agreed to be
                 given either directly or indirectly.

<p id="p_53">4) Such giving or agreeing to give can again be not only
by one party to a marriage to the other but also by the
parents of either party or by any other person to either
party to the marriage or to any other person. It will be
noticed that this clause again widens the reach of the Act
insofar as those guilty of committing the offence of giving
or receiving dowry is concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_54">5) Such giving or agreeing to give can be at any time. It
can be at, before, or at any time after the marriage. Thus,
it can be many years after a marriage is solemnised.

</p><p id="p_55">6) Such giving or receiving must be in connection with the
marriage of the parties. Obviously, the expression "in
connection with" would in the context of the social evil
sought to be tackled by the <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_136">Dowry Prohibition Act</a> mean
"in relation with" or "relating to".
</p>
<p id="p_56">9. The ingredients of the offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_137">Section 304B</a> have
been stated and restated in many judgments. There are
four such ingredients and they are said to be:
</p>
<p id="p_57">(a) death of a woman must have been caused by any
burns or bodily injury or her death must have occurred
otherwise than under normal circumstances;
</p>
<p id="p_58">(b) such death must have occurred within seven years of
her marriage;
</p>
<p id="p_59">(c) soon before her death, she must have been subjected
to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of
her husband; and

</p><p id="p_60">(d) such cruelty or harassment must be in connection with
the demand for dowry.
</p>
<p id="p_61">10. This has been the law stated in the following
judgments: <a href="/doc/549619/" id="a_138">Ashok Kumar v. State of Haryana</a>, (2010) 12
SCC 350 <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_139">Bachni Devi &amp; Anr. v. State of Haryana</a>, (2011) 4
SCC 427, <a href="/doc/79816183/" id="a_140">Pathan Hussain Basha v. State of A.P</a>., (2012) 8
SCC 594, <a href="/doc/50247209/" id="a_141">Kulwant Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab</a>, (2013)
4 SCC 177, <a href="/doc/10522469/" id="a_142">Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, (2014) 4

353, <a href="/doc/36736141/" id="a_145">Sher Singh v. State of Haryana</a>, (2015) 3 SCC 721.

</p><p id="p_62">11. This Court has spoken sometimes with divergent
voices both on what would fall within "dowry" as defined
and what is meant by the expression "soon before her
death". <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_146">In Appasaheb v. State of Maharashtra</a>, (2007) 9
SCC 721, this Court construed the definition of dowry
strictly, as it forms part of <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_147">Section 304B</a> which is part of a
penal statute. The court held that a demand for money for
defraying the expenses of manure made to a young wife
who in turn made the same demand to her father would
be outside the definition of dowry. This Court said:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">              Page 39 of 49</span>

"11......A demand for money on account of some financial
stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses
or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand
for dowry as the said word is normally understood. The
evidence adduced by the prosecution does not, therefore,
show that any demand for "dowry" as defined in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_148">Section 2</a>
of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants
as what was allegedly asked for was some money for
meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure."

</p><p id="p_63">12. This judgment was distinguished in at least four other
judgments (see: <a href="/doc/1814094/" id="a_149">Bachni Devi v. State of Haryana</a> (2011) 4
SCC 427, <a href="/doc/50247209/" id="a_150">Kulwant Singh &amp; Ors. v. State of Punjab</a>, (2013)
4 SCC 177, <a href="/doc/10522469/" id="a_151">Surinder Singh v. State of Haryana</a> (2014) 4
SCC 129 and <a href="/doc/75885009/" id="a_152">Raminder Singh v. State of Punjab</a> (2014) 12
SCC 582. The judgment was, however, followed in <a href="/doc/167568223/" id="a_153">Vipin
Jaiswal v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>, (2013) 3 SCC 684.

</p><p id="p_64">13. In order to arrive at the true construction of the
definition of dowry and consequently the ingredients of
the offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_154">Section 304B</a>, we first need to
determine how a statute of this kind needs to be
interpreted. It is obvious that <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_155">Section 304B</a> is a stringent
provision, meant to combat a social evil of alarming
proportions. Can it be argued that it is a penal statute and,
should, therefore, in case of ambiguity in its language, be
construed strictly?
</p>
<p id="p_65">14. The answer is to be found in two path-breaking
judgments of this Court. <a href="/doc/35536/" id="a_156">In M. Narayanan Nambiar v. State
of Kerala</a>, 1963 Supp. (2) SCR 724, a Constitution Bench of
this Court was asked to construe <a href="/doc/1229833/" id="a_157">Section 5(1)(d)</a> of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. In construing the said
Act, a penal statute, Subba Rao,J. stated:
</p>
<p id="p_66">"9. The preamble indicates that the Act was passed as it
was expedient to make more effective provisions for the
prevention of bribery and Corruption. The long title as well
as the preamble indicate that the Act was passed to put
down the said social evil i.e. bribery and corruption by
public servant. Bribery is form of corruption. The fact that
in addition to the word "Bribery" the word "corruption" is
used shows that the legislation was intended to combat
also other evil in addition to bribery. The existing law i.e.<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_158">
Penal Code</a> was found insufficient to eradicate or even to
control the growing evil of bribery and corruption
corroding the public service of our country. The provisions
broadly include the existing offences under <a href="/doc/48127346/" id="a_159">Sections 161</a>
and <a href="/doc/126359453/" id="a_160">165</a> of the Indian Penal Code committed by public
servants and enact a new rule of presumptive evidence
against the accused. <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_161">The Act</a> also creates a new offence of
criminal misconduct by public servants though to some
extent it overlaps on the pre-existing offences and enacts
a rebuttable presumption contrary to the well known
principles of Criminal Jurisprudence. It also aims to
protect honest public servants from harassment by
prescribing that the investigation against them could be
made only by police officials of particular status and by
making the sanction of the Government or other
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                             Page 40 of 49</span>

               appropriate officer a pre-condition for their prosecution.
               As it is a socially useful measure conceived in public
               interest, it should be liberally construed so as to bring
               about the desired object, i.e. to prevent corruption among
               public servants and to prevent harassment of the honest
               among them.

               cited by the Learned Counsel as an aid for construction
               neatly states the principle and therefore may be
               extracted: Lord Justice James speaking for the Board

               used, and must not strain the words on any notion that
               there has been a slip, that there has been a casus

               that it must have been intended to be included if thought
               of. On the other hand, the person charged has a right to
               say that the thing charged although within the words, is
               not within the spirit of the enactment. But where the thing
               is brought within the words and within the spirit, there a
               penal enactment is to be construed like any other
               instrument, according to the fair commonsense meaning
               of the language used, and the Court is not to find or make
               any doubt or ambiguity in the language of a penal statute,
               where such doubt or ambiguity would clearly not be found
               or made in the same language in any other instrument."

               In our view this passage, if we may say so, restates the
               rule of construction of a penal provision from a correct
               perspective."

[44]      It is quite apparent that Rajinder Singh (supra) and

four other judgments viz, Bachni Devi (supra) Qulban Singh

(supra) Surinder Singh (supra) and Ravinder Singh (supra) have

distinguished the propositions of law in Appasaheb (supra) where

the apex court had observed that demand for money on account

of financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic

expense or for purchasing manure cannot be termed as demand

for dowry. The same principle has been followed in Vipin Jaiswal

(supra). Both Appasaheb (supra) and Vipin Jaiwasl (supra) were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                            Page 41 of 49</span>

followed in Babul Ghosh (supra) inasmuch as Babul Ghosh (supra)

was decided on 05.12.2013 much before Rajinder Singh (supra)

and other four decisions as referred above. Meaning and purport

of „dowry‟ as laid down in Appasaheb (supra), Vipin Jaiswal

(supra) and Babul Ghosh (supra) have been distinguished and the

proposition as have overruled the expansive interpretation by

following the strict interpretation of the penal enactment. Hence,

the argument as advanced on definition of dowry having referred

to Appasaheb (supra) etc. cannot be any more acceptable for

purpose of defining dowry. Rajinder Singh (supra) would hold the

field considering that the same judgment has been delivered by a

larger bench of the apex court.

<p id="p_70">[45]      There cannot be any amount of doubt that death of

Rahima has occurred not under normal circumstances within

seven years of her marriage. The trial judge has correctly

observed that the „marriage‟ between the appellant and Rahima

Bibi has been conclusively proved by the prosecution. By the

medical evidence (see PW 12), it has been established that there

was ligature mark over the left side of the neck but that was not

continuous. But traces of encirclement was found. PW 12 has,

unhesitatingly and in distinct terms, opined that death was due to

asphyxia as a result of hanging (see the post mortem report-Exbt-

</p><p id="p_71">6). That apart, PW 12 has further observed in the cross-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                              Page 42 of 49</span>

examination that it was not a case of strangulation as in the case

of strangulation, the ligature mark would be continuous and

circular and in the case of hanging, the direction of the ligature

mark would be upward and non-continuous. Signs for hanging was

manifest. That helped PW 12 to come to a categorical observation

as stated above. The trial judge therefore correctly observed that

the charge under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_162">Section 302</a> has not been proved.

[46]       Now,    the   question    that    surfaces   whether    the

prosecution did place the materials to show that soon before her

death, Rahima has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or

in connection with any demand for dowry. According to the trial

judge,   the   prosecution   has   successfully   proved   those   pre-

requisites to presume the dowry death.
</p>
<p id="p_72">[47]       PW3, Rajjak Miah is the sterling witness for the

prosecution. He has stated that Rahima used to tell him that her

husband demanded a TV from the Rahima‟s parents. Three days

before her death, Rahima came to his house and returned to her

matrimonial home one day before her death. On the following day

of her return, the said occurrence did occur. PW3 complained that

Rahima had been killed but that has been disproved by the

medical evidence. Not only that, allegation of cruelty was against

Karam Ali and Anwara Begum as well. The role of the co-accused

was not believed by the trial court relying on the same set of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                              Page 43 of 49</span>

evidence. The allegation was that Rahima was taunted and told

not to watch TV unless she brought one from her father. Another

witness, Mohar Miah, elder brother of PW3, also stated that there

was demand of TV from the appellant‟s family. That apart, they

used to assault her. Last time, one week before her death, she

visited him and shown her the marks of injury. Rahima‟s mother-

in-law Anwara Begam used to taunt for the necklace being thin.

Her allegation was also, that her husband used to beat her after

consuming alcohol.
</p>
<p id="p_73">[48]       PW 7, Jakir Hossain, a co-villager, has contrary to the

prosecution backbone of evidence, stated that Rahima hanged

herself. PW 9, Rinku Begam, an aunt of the deceased, stated in

the trial that Rahima was subjected to torture on demand of TV.

The witnesses those visited immediately after hanging, they all

stated similarly that they saw Rahima lying dead on her bed (cot).

The streak of exaggeration hugely emerged from the deposition of

PW11 Rashid Miah who stated that there was demand of cash.

While   assessing    the   evidence,   the   defence   evidence   was

completely brushed aside by the trial judge. DW 1, Hajara Bibi has

categorically stated that she did not hear any hue and cry from

the house of the appellant, contrary of what PW 2 (Saleha Begum)

has stated that she heard hue and cry in the house of the

appellant and she realized that Rahima alias Marjina was crying.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                 Page 44 of 49</span>

After some time, she got the information that Rahima died by

hanging. The trial judge has in this regard observed that but the

facts the she found Rahima crying soon before her death is

testimony of death of her being ill treated in the matrimonial

home. That was taken to the extent of considering the same as

meeting the requirement of cruelty or harassment soon before

death of Rahima. Fragilities of the said observation has been

gaping. Someone‟s crying does not mean that, that person was

subjected to cruelty, if considered the said testimony of PW2 is

trustworthy. The improvement by way of exaggeration by the

prosecution witnesses has been acceded to by the investigating

officer in respect of the appellant‟s being engaged with another

woman    in   an   illicit   relation.   The    investigating   officer   has

completely discarded the said narrative as no evidence could be

collected. PW14 has categorically stated he did not get any input

about illicit relation of Babul Miah with other woman. Even in

respect of testimony of PW 9, PW14 has stated that PW9 did not

state to him that after Rahima‟s death, she rushed to her house

and found Rahima lying dead on the cot and a gamcha was tied

around her neck. Even PW 11 did not state that seven day before

her death, he took Rahima and her father by his auto to her

father‟s house.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                            Page 45 of 49</span><p id="p_74">

[49]       PW 15, Ratan Chakraborty, the other investigating

officer, has testified in the trial that he had not recorded any

statement including the statement of Mohan Miah (PW4) that the

appellant had an illicit relation with a woman. Even no such

statement has been recorded by him that the mother-in-law of the

victim taunted her for her necklace gifted in the marriage being

thin or that Rahima had shown her injuries to PW4 seven days

before her death. PW 15 has further stated that in the statement

as recorded under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_163">section 161</a> of the CrPC, no statement was

made to him that the injuries were caused due to beating by her

husband after consuming alcohol or that three days before her

death Rahima was sent to her father‟s house by in-laws,

commanding her to bring TV from the house of her father.

Similarly, the other statement as exaggerated by the witness was

not recorded by any of the investigating officers. These were all

improved in the trial.
</p>
<p id="p_75">[50]       DW 2, Abul Hussain has clearly stated in the trial tha

there was no ill treatment to Rahima. According to DW2, though

she was very close to Rahima alias Marjina but she did never tell

anything about ill treatment to her by her husband or in-laws. She

heard from the villagers that body of Rahima was brought down

by the people by breaking the door. DW2 has also stated in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                              Page 46 of 49</span>

similar line for illustration. The relevant part of DW 2‟s testimony

is extracted below.
</p>
<p id="p_76">                 Suddenly I heard a cry of Marjina's father-in-law,
                 Karam Ali. At that time, the room of Marjina was
                 closed from inside then, nearby people came and
                 broke open the door and found Marjina hanging and
                 they thought she was alive and so brought her down.
                 At that time, Marjina's mother-in-law and husband
                 were not present in the house."
</p>
<p id="p_77">           She stood by the cross-examination.
</p>
<p id="p_78">[51]       Whether any statement which is not directly related to

death made by the deceased before her death to the persons who

had no occasion to see the action alleged of, can be saved under

<a href="/doc/1135830/" id="a_164">Section 32(1)</a> of the Evidence Act. Thus, the answer should be in

the negative. There is no evidence that there had been any

initiative from the parents of Rahima to bring the fact of so-called

cruelty in the public. Even there was no dialogue between two

families. In such circumstances, it is difficult to believe the cruelty

as alleged did really happen. Moreover, it has surfaced that all the

important witnesses have exaggerated the story. The evidentiary

value of defence witness stands at par with that of the prosecution

witnesses, it is neither inferior nor superior. If the evidence of the

prosecution and the defence are juxtaposed, it would be apparent

that Rahima Bibi alias Marjina hanged herself. The appellant also

did not shed any light why her wife committed suicide by hanging.

At the beginning, the prosecution case was that the appellant

killed Rahima. But later on, the evidence was designed in such a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                              Page 47 of 49</span>

manner so that the appellant can be convicted under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_165">Section 304B</a>

and under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_166">Section 498A</a> of the IPC. The allegations those are

made in the complaint are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_45">       1. The ornament given in marriage was not good.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_46">       2. The inmates of the appellant used to taunt her by saying,

       if she wanted to watch television than she would bring it

       from her father‟s house.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">       3. On 25.04.2016 the appellant had beaten the victim

       severely.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_79">[52]         Almost after ten days, PW3‟s daughter committed

suicide. There is no evidence in respect of beating on 25.04.2016.

As such, we do not have hesitation to hold there is no evidence

that the victim was meted out with cruelty or she was harassed on

demand of dowry. Therefore, no presumption can also be drawn

under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_167">Section 113B</a> of the IPC. As regards, beating by the

appellant,   the   investigating   officer   has   stated   that   those

statements were not made to them. Even the allegation of

appellant‟s illicit relation was not revealed to the investigating

officers. The allegations are general in nature and to some extent

was not beyond insignificant tear of the marital life. Even no

witness has stated that the alleged physical assault by the

appellant has got any connection with the demand of TV or fridge.

The allegation is clear that under the influence of liquor the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                   Page 48 of 49</span>

appellant used to beat Rahima. As stated earlier, there is no

evidence that such cruelty did take place soon before the death of

the victim.
</p>
<p id="p_80">[53]          We have seriously scanned the evidence of the close

relatives   and    relied     their   consistent   statements    which      got

corroborated by the other witnesses. But credibility of those

witnesses has been judged in the light of the statement of two

investigating officers and in that test, their testimonies got

seriously shakened. We have failed to find that any particular

event has been highlighted by the prosecution to show the impact

which drove the victim to hang herself. Thus, we do not find any

evidence to connect the death with harassment for dowry demand

or cruelty meted to her. Even the post mortem doctor did not

support the testimony of PW4 who had stated that he found the

injury marks over the person of Rahima Bibi. PW 12, the post

mortem doctor, has clearly made the statement as follows:

</p><p id="p_81">                            "No injury mark was present over whole body."
</p>
<p id="p_82">
[54]          The finding of the trial judge that crying out by Rahima

Bibi on the morning as stated by PW2 is extension of the fact

without     material   support.       Moreover,     that   statement        was

contradicted by one defence witness. Hence, it cannot be by

means inferred that the crying out was for torture. Thus, we are of

the view that the prosecution evidence has gone haywire. Thus,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                     Page 49 of 49</span>

        we are unable to affirm the conviction of the appellant under

        <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_168">Section 304B</a> of the IPC. Even for want of any reliable evidence

        which instills confidence in the court, we are unable to uphold the

        conviction as returned under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_169">Section 498A</a> of the IPC.

</p><p id="p_83">                   As consequence of the finding as recorded above, the

        impugned judgment of conviction and the order of sentence dated

        21.09.2019 are set aside. The appellant be set at liberty forthwith,

        if not wanted in any other case.
