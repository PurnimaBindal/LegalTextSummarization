            O.P.(DRT) Nos.11 of 2015-O &amp; 12 of 2015-O
            ------------------------------------------------------------
              Dated this the 19th day of February, 2016

                                 JUDGMENT

         Both the Original Petitions arise on similar circumstances,

from two separate orders, both dated 21.01.2015; in appeals

disposed of by the Debts Recovery Tribunal, Ernakulam [Kerala

and Lakshadweep] [for brevity "DRT"], produced as Exhibit P5 in

the respective Original Petitions; in Appeal Nos.4 of 2013 and 3 of

2013. The 1st petitioners in both the Original Petitions, borrowers

from the very same Bank, are two different firms; represented by a

husband and wife, who are 2nd and 3rd petitioners in both the

Original Petitions and their son, the 4th respondent in O.P.(DRT)

No.12 of 2015; being the partners of the two firms. The purchaser

also is the very same individual, who is impleaded as the 2nd

respondent in both the Original Petitions.

            2. The sale challenged before the DRT arises from

DRC Nos.395/SBT and 517/SBT, of three properties, all situated in

Kunnamkulam Village, Thalappilly Taluk, Thrissur District. Three

different properties were sold, one under DRC 395/SBT and the

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015         - 2 -



other two under DRC 517/SBT. But for the separate proceedings

the proclamation of sale and the other proceedings leading to the

sale were on identical dates and the facts are similar. The orders

of the DRT produced in the respective Original Petitions, proceed

on identical lines, detailing the entire facts, which indicate the

identical circumstances under which the sale was proceeded with,

and hence one of the said Original Petitions can be referred to for

convenience. O.P.(DRT) No.11 of 2015, hence, is taken as the

lead case, from which the facts and documents are referred to.

             3. The preliminary issue raised by the learned Senior

Counsel appearing for the Bank and the learned counsel

appearing for the auction purchaser is as to the maintainability of

the Original Petition for reason of there being an appellate remedy

provided under the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial

Institutions Act, 1993 [for brevity "RDDB Act"]. The respondents

would rely on <a href="/doc/1968473/" id="a_1">Punjab National Bank v. O.C. Krishnan</a> [(2001) 6

SCC 569] and <a href="/doc/175816/" id="a_2">United Bank of India v. Satyawati Tandon</a>

[(2010) 8 SCC 110] to urge this Court to relegate the petitioners to

the appellate remedy.

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015          - 3 -



             4. O.C. Krishnan (supra) was a case in which a suit

filed by the creditor Bank was transferred to the DRT and the DRT

decreed the same. On the Recovery Officer proceeding to sell the

hyothecated plant and machinery, the guarantors, whose property

was mortgaged, approached the High Court under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a> of

the Constitution and the High Court of Calcutta, finding that the

properties are situated in Chennai, held the DRT to have no

territorial jurisdiction. The Hon'ble Supreme Court found that the

High Court ought not to have exercised the jurisdiction under

<a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Article 227</a> in view of the alternate remedy contained in the Act.

Satyawati Tandon (supra)            was  a  case   in   which the

mortgagor/guarantor filed a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_5">Article 226</a> of the

Constitution against a notice issued under Section 13(4) of the

Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and

<a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_6">Enforcement of Security Interest Act</a>, 2002 [for brevity "<a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_7">SARFAESI

Act</a>"]. The Hon'ble Supreme Court found that the High Court has

overlooked the settled law that a petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> would

not be entertained if an alternate remedy is available to the

aggrieved person.

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015         - 4 -




           5. On a reading of the order cited first and the

judgment second cited, no departure is discernible from the settled

law as laid down by a three Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme

Court in <a href="/doc/674013/" id="a_9">State of H.P. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd</a>. [(2005) 6

SCC 499]. The Hon'ble Supreme Court had recognized and

succinctly stated the instances where despite the alternate

remedy, the High Court could invoke the extra-ordinary jurisdiction.

            "22. ... There are two well-recognised exceptions

      to the doctrine of exhaustion of statutory remedies.

      First is when the proceedings are taken before the

      forum under a provision of law which is ultra vires, it is

      open to a party aggrieved thereby to move the High

      Court for quashing the proceedings on the ground that

      they are incompetent without a party being obliged to

      wait until those proceedings run their full course.

      Secondly, the doctrine has no application when the

      impugned order has been made in violation of the

      principles of natural justice. We may add that where

      the proceedings itself are an abuse of process of law

      the High Court in an appropriate case can entertain a

      writ petition.

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015           - 5 -



             23. Where under a statute there is an allegation

       of infringement of fundamental rights or when on the

       undisputed facts the taxing authorities are shown to

       have assumed jurisdiction which they do not possess

       can be the grounds on which the writ petitions can be

       entertained. But normally, the High Court should not

       entertain writ petitions unless it is shown that there is

       something more in a case, something going to the root

       of the jurisdiction of the officer, something which would

       show that it would be a case of palpable injustice to

       the writ petitioner to force him to adopt the remedies

       provided by the statute. ...".



            6. Herein, it is to be noticed that the contention raised

is with respect to the illegality occasioned in the proceedings for

sale which goes to the root of the matter and if found favour with,

would result in the sale itself being set aside. Such illegality is

pointed out on the compelling grounds of violation of statutory

provisions, and the sale having been conducted by an officer not

empowered to so act. The allegation is with respect to a clear

abuse of process and the tribunal which considered the initial

appeal has dealt with the facts in a comprehensive manner, which

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015          - 6 -



does not raise any dispute or call for any resolution on facts.

Further, it is to be noticed that the Appellate Tribunal at Chennai

does not have a Presiding Officer and that at Bombay             has

temporary charge of the Tribunal at Chennai. This fortifies the

contention that as of now there is no efficacious remedy available

to the petitioners, who are the borrowers. The respondent-Bank

also despairingly points out to this Court that a decree of the year

2000 is sought to be realized and it is with much difficulty that the

respondent-Bank has now effectuated the recovery through the

impugned sale proceedings.

             7. Considering all these aspects as also looking at the

order of the DRT, which elaborately discussed the matter after

looking into the records of the Recovery Officer, and also keeping

in mind the principles governing the deviation from the rule of self-

restrain in invoking the power under Art 226 or 227, even in the

context of an available efficacious alternate remedy; this Court is

satisfied that this is a case were the same is necessitated.

Essentially what is to be looked at is the interpretation of Rules

under the Second Schedule to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_10">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 [for

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 7 -



brevity "Schedule II" and"<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_11">IT Act</a>"], which has been incorporated in

the RDDB Act for purposes of recovery under <a href="/doc/7794885/" id="a_12">Section 29</a>. There

are no disputed questions of facts and the Tribunal has scanned

the proceedings of the sale proceeded with at the office of the

Recovery Officer minutely and has also extracted it in its order.

The relegation to the appellate remedy as of now is not

efficacious, for reason of the Tribunal not regularly sitting and the

expediency too warrants that this Court consider the issue, so that

there can be a quietus.

            8. The learned counsel for the petitioners would urge

that the sale conducted is against the provisions of the Schedule II

to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">IT Act</a>. He would rely on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1626208/" id="a_14">M.V.Janardhan

Reddy v. Vijaya Bank</a> [(2008) 7 SCC 738] and Mathew

Varghese v. M.Amritha Kumar [(2014) 5 SCC 610] to urge the

mandatory nature of the proceedings as contemplated under

Schedule II to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_15">IT Act</a>.

            9. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

respondent-Bank and the learned counsel appearing for the party

respondent, the purchaser, contends that the DRT has gone into

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015         - 8 -



the entire facts and has also examined the proceedings

threadbare, as revealed from the records of the Recovery Officer

and has come to the conclusion that the sale is in accordance with

the procedure contemplated under Schedule II. The learned

counsel for the purchaser also would contend that he being a

bonafide purchaser, cannot be interdicted from enjoying the fruits

of the sale, especially since he has remitted the entire money,

coming to about Rs.1,91,20,000/-, within the stipulated time as per

Schedule II. The fee for registration as also the stamp duty having

been paid, the property stands conveyed in the name of the 2nd

respondent and, hence, there could be no interference caused,

going by the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/92195429/" id="a_16">Sadashiv

Prasad Singh v. Harendar Singh and Others</a> [(2015) 5 SCC

574]. The Bank also would contend that in examining whether the

procedure was followed and the adjournment of sale made was

proper; the decision in <a href="/doc/286259/" id="a_17">Bhat v. Anugraha Charitable Trust</a> [2008

(1) KLT 617] is apposite. The respondents also have a contention

that the appeal was not filed within the time provided from the date

of sale and that the appeal was filed only after the confirmation.

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015          - 9 -




             10. The contention is only of procedural irregularity and

illegality and there is no dispute on facts which has to be resolved.

The proceedings are very clear from the order of the Tribunal,

which has extracted the proceedings recorded by the Recovery

Officer and     the Recovery Inspector, the latter of whom was

authorized to conduct the sale; which authorization is the bone of

contention. Essentially the contention raised by the petitioner is

that the Recovery Inspector who conducted the sale was not

competent to conduct the same and the authorization made was

of no avail, going by the provisions regulating the sale. The

respondent-Bank, however, contends that the authorization is

permissible under Rule 13 of Schedule II and there cannot be any

defect found in the sale conducted. The proclamation was made

by the Recovery Officer and so was the confirmation and the sale,

could    be conducted by the Recovery Inspector who was duly

authorized by the Recovery Officer, is the argument. One has to

first look at the proceedings, which has been extracted by the

Tribunal.

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 10 -



            11. There is no dispute that the proclamations of sale,

which are produced as Exhibit P1 in both the writ petitions, are

made by the Recovery Officer, one P.Balasubramanian. The name

of the incumbent is relevant as will be presently noticed. Both the

proclamations of sale were made on 19.11.2012 and the auction

was notified on 05.02.2013. The auction was in the e-auction

mode and a service provider was entrusted with the task of

carrying out the auction. There is also a contention raised that the

auction cannot be carried out by the service provider, since

Schedule II specifically provides that the auction has to be

conducted by the Recovery Officer. However, it is to be noted that

when e-auctions are conducted, the service provider provides a

platform on which the auction is conducted through the internet. It

is also clarified by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the

respondent-Bank that e-auction is conducted and the sale effected

by the Recovery Inspector himself from his office; ie: through the

office Personal Computer.

            12. The proceedings       which occurred after the

proclamation have been verified and extracted by the Tribunal.

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015         - 11 -



The affixture report dated 28.12.2012 was found in the DRC files

and the borrowers were also served with the proclamation dated

19.11.2012, to which they have not chosen to file any objection as

to material irregularity in the proclamation made or in the upset

price fixed. The Tribunal has also found that the proclamation is

not challenged by the borrowers, within 30 days as provided under

Section 30(1) of the RDDB Act.

                13. The next issue raised is with respect to the

irregularity in the sale held on 26.03.2013, to which date the sale

stood adjourned from the date, as notified in the sale

proclamation. The sale was notified as per the proclamations, on

05.02.2013, on which date there were no tenders received. The

Recovery Inspector adjourned the sale as per the proceedings

recorded in the files of the DRC's . The auction was adjourned to

04.03.2013, on which date also no tenders were received. Again,

the sale was adjourned to 26.03.2013, as is noticed from the

records of the DRC. The said adjournment was also made by the

Recovery Inspector.

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015          - 12 -



             14. Subsequently, the auction was conducted on

26.03.2013, when there was only one bid for all the properties.

The proceedings in both the DRC's are extracted by the Tribunal,

in its order which is as follows:

DRC 517/SBT

        "26.03.13:

        e-Auction conducted. Shri.Preman.V.G. has bid item

        No.1 for Rs.1,05,60,000/- and item No.2 for

        Rs.45,20,000/- Reports generated from the site of

        service provider are placed in file. File is placed

        before RO on 29.4.13".


        29.4.13
        Reposted to 8.5.13".



DRC 395/SBT

        "26.03.13:

        E-Auction held. Report generated from the service

        provider is placed in file. Shri.Preman.V.G. Has been

        the highest bidder for a bid amount of Rs.40,40,000.

        File is placed before RO on 29.4.13".


        29.4.13

        Reposted to 8.5.13".

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 13 -



The sole bidder with respect to the three items of property, two in

the former and one in the latter, is the 2nd respondent in both the

Original Petitions.

            15. The further proceeding on 08.05.2013 in the

respective appeals are as follows:

DRC 517/SBT

       "08/5
       Heard CHB. Property sold for Rs.15080000/-. Claims
       by CTO and EPF are on record. CHB agreed to pay
       the said claims.

              In the auction sale, there was only one bidder,
       who offered Rs.1,50,80,000/- for two properties.
       Considering the long pendency of the RC and the
       failure of earlier sales, in the interest of speedy
       recovery, the sole bid requires to be accepted.
       Accordingly accepted.

              Reported that there was no challenge to the
       sale.

              Sale is confirmed and made absolute. Issue
       order of sale confirmation. For further proceedings,
       adjd. To13.5.13".

                              {emphasis supplied by me}

DRC 395/SBT

       "8/5/13
       L.O. of CHB present. Property sold for Rs.40.40 lkh.
       in E-auction. Auction report noted. Amount due

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015         - 14 -



        under RC was Rs.95.60 lkh. There are claims made
        by CTO (Rs.23,70,322/-) and EPF (Rs.7,80,002.85/-
        for 2 A/cs.). CHB agreed for settlement of the said
        statutory dues. Further reported that no petition was
        filed u/r.60-62, challenging sale.

        Sale held in favour of the successful

        In the auction sale, there was only one bidder, who
        offered the price of Rs.40,40,000/- vis-a-vis the RP
        of Rs.40,00,000/-. It was submitted that the RC was
        pending for long time and that earlier auctions were
        failed    for want    of  bidders.  Considering     the
        circumstances of the matter, the offer made by the
        sole bidder is accepted. Entire purchase price
        reported to have been deposited within statutory
        period.

              The sale is therefore confirmed and made
        absolute in favour of the sole bidder. Issue notice
        to order confirming the sale. Adjd. To 13.05.13".

                                {emphasis supplied by me}


             16. The defect pointed out by the petitioner as far as

violation of the provisions of Schedule II are three fold; (I) the sale

could not have been adjourned beyond thirty days, (ii) the

Recovery Officer himself had to conduct the sale and he could not

have authorized the Recovery Inspector (iii) there was no sale

conducted on 26.02.2013 as the sale and confirmation were both

done on 08.05.2013. The Bank relies on Rule 13 of Schedule II to

contend that there was an authorization in favour of the Recovery

Inspector and the same is permitted under Rule 13. The

authorization relied on in both the cases is dated 05.05.2009:

<p id="p_3">
</p><p id="p_4">             17. It is argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner

that the authorization made is by one Vijay Kumar Pillai, Recovery

Officer, in the year 2009, who died while in service. At the relevant

time, when the proclamation of sale was made, there were two

Recovery Officers; one of whom, P.Balasubramanian, issued the

</p>
<p id="p_5">

proclamation in both the above DRCs. It is first argued that Rule

19A authorization, as is seen from the above extract, can be made

only with prior approval and there is no prior approval on record.

The prior approval has to be obtained from the Commissioner, as

referred to in Schedule II; but in the case of the Recovery Officer

under the RDDB Act, it has to be either from the Government or

from the DRT. In any event, no authorization could be made

without prior approval under R 19A and, hence, the same cannot

be relied on. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Bank,

taking cue from the order of the DRT, attempts to substantiate the

authorization on the basis of Rule 13. The further argument of the

learned Counsel for the petitioner is that there was no sale as

such effected on 26.03.2013 and the sale was effected and the

confirmation made on 08.05.2013 when a Recovery Officer who

was holding temporary charge of the office came to Cochin on

08.05.2013.

<p id="p_6">           18. In examining the issue, the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/183313510/" id="a_18">C.N.Paramasivam v. Sunrise Plaza</a> [(2013) 9

SCC 460] assumes relevance. The Hon'ble Supreme Court was

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 17 -
</p>
<p id="p_7">

concerned with the interpretation of Section 29 of the RDDB Act,

wherein the words "as far as possible" was used. The Hon'ble

Supreme Court held that <a href="/doc/7794885/" id="a_19">Section 29</a> of the Act incorporates the

Rules in Schedule II for purposes of realization of dues by the

Recovery Officer under the RDDB Act. The expressions "as far as

possible" and "with necessary modifications" appearing in Section

29 of the RDDB Act was found to have been used to take care of

situations where certain provisions applicable to recovery of

income tax would not be applicable on account of the scheme

under the RDDB Act. For example, the recovery of arrears used in

Schedule II would relate to arrears under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_20">IT Act</a>, whereas

under the RDDB Act, it refers to the "amount of debt". Those rules

under Schedule II which do not deal with recovery of debts under

the RDDB Act, was found to have no application; for instance,

Rules 86 and 87 under Schedule II. The argument that the words

"as far as possible" used in <a href="/doc/7794885/" id="a_21">Section 29</a> would lead to a discretion

on the Recovery Officer under the RDDB Act to decide on the

applicability of Schedule II to recovery under the RDDB Act was

repelled. The words were found to be indicative only of a certain

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015           - 18 -
</p>
<p id="p_8">

inbuilt flexibility and but for that the same was held to be

mandatory in nature. The provisions of Schedule II incorporated

under the RDDB Act would have the same effect as if it were an

integral part of the statute. Hence, there is no doubt that the

provisions with respect to recovery has to be applied with full

effect, in the recovery effected under the RDDB Act.

</p><p id="p_9">              19.   The     learned    Senior     Counsel     for the

respondent-Bank would take this Court through Rules 13 and 15

to contend that the sale proceedings as such could be entrusted to

a Recovery Inspector, as authorized by the aforesaid Sections.

Rule 13 and Rule 15 are extracted hereunder:

       of such arrears and costs has been paid to the Tax

</blockquote><p id="p_10">The contention of the respondent-Bank is that the proviso to

sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 specifically speaks of leave of the

Recovery Officer, for purposes of adjournment, only if the sale is

conducted in the precincts of the office of the Recovery Officer.

Hence, a conjoint reading of Rules 13 and 15 would definitely

indicate that there is power for such authorization. The said

contention has to be analyzed with respect to the facts in the

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 20 -
</p>
<p id="p_11">

aforesaid case.
</p>
<p id="p_12">             20. The authorization said to have been made on

05.05.2009, is by the earlier incumbent, i.e., one Vijay Kumar

Pillai, who had authorized one Ranjith.R., the Recovery Inspector,

to carry on the auction sale and necessary orders regarding

matters of payment to bank and financial institutions/ prospective

bidders, etc. and necessary orders in connection with the issuance

of certified copies. The said authorization, extracted herein above,

was specifically made under rule 19A and long prior to the

proclamations in the instant DRC's. Rule 19A, as was noticed

earlier, speaks of a prior approval. Going by the binding precedent

in C.N.Paramasivam (supra), the provisions have to be applied

as far as possible to the proceedings under the RDDB Act. The

"Joint Commissioner" referred to under Schedule II as against the

Tax Recovery Officer is the superior officer of the Tax Recovery

Officer. The provisions of the RDDB Act indicates that the Tribunal

could be interposed in the place of the Joint Commissioner as

noticed in Rule 19A. Hence, the two interpretations possible

insofar as the incorporation of Rule 19A of Schedule II to RDDB

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015         - 21 -
</p>
<p id="p_13">

Act is as follows: If there could be no prior approval and there is

no officer similar to the Joint Commissioner available as per the

provisions of the RDDB Act, then there could be no such

authorization made. If the Tribunal is found to take the place of the

Joint Commissioner, then Rule 19A could be invoked only with

prior approval of the DRT. In the present case, obviously, there is

no such prior approval obtained. Hence, Rule 19A cannot have

any application in the present case. It is also to be noticed that the

respondent-Bank also does not rely on Rule 19A and relies on

Rule 13, as has been done by the Tribunal.
</p>
<p id="p_14">             21. Rule 13 indicates that attachment and sale of

movable/immovable property has to be made by such persons as

the Tax Recovery Officer may "from time to time direct". This Court

is inclined to hold that, no blanket authorization, as is evidenced in

the present case, can be made. The authorization under Rule 13

has to be made "from time to time", which clearly mandates that

any particular sale made by any officer other than the Recovery

Officer would have to be made on the specific authorization of the

Recovery Officer, in that particular DRC. Herein, what assumes

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 22 -
</p>
<p id="p_15">

significance is that the Recovery Officer who was in office while

the proclamations were made and subsequently retired never

made such an authorization. An earlier incumbent made the

authorization in the name of one of the Recovery Inspectors, in the

year 2009. The said incumbent passed away, while in service. It is

also an admitted fact that subsequently there were two Recovery

Officers attached to the Tribunal when the proclamation of sale

was made. At the point when the sale was conducted, there were

none in office and the Recovery Officer who made the

proclamation of sale had retired. In such circumstance, an

authorization made by an earlier incumbent cannot be of any avail

in conducting a sale by the Recovery Inspector even going by the

words employed in Rule 13.
</p>
<p id="p_16">            22. The proceedings in both DRC's on the date of the

sale also are of significant import. As is extracted herein above, on

26.03.2013, the e-auction was conducted and the sole bid of the

2nd respondent was recorded. The report generated from the

service provider's site were placed in the file, which was placed

before the Recovery Officer on 29.04.2013. Hence, no sale as

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015       - 23 -
</p>
<p id="p_17">

such was conducted. If sale was conducted in favour of the sole

bidder, then that had to be recorded and a communication also

sent to that effect. The purchaser, being the 2nd respondent, also

does not speak of any such communication being addressed to

him. The records of the DRC's, which were called for, also does

not reveal any such communication having been issued by the

office of the Recovery Officer. The purchaser speaks of a

communication from the Bank, who was not competent to conduct

the sale. The deposit to be made on a sale conducted, as per the

proclamation of sale, is said to have been made by the bidder,

without any statement as to under what authority, that too with the

respondent Bank directly and not through the Recovery Officer.

</p><p id="p_18">           23. Further the proceedings on 08.05.2013, is the

proceedings of the Recovery Officer himself, who is said to have

come from Chennai on additional charge. Even according to the

DRT, as seen from its order, the Recovery Officer from Chennai,

had additional     charge of Kerala between 01.05.2013 to

21.07.2013. The proceedings of the Recovery Officer extracted

above shows that he conducted the sale on that day. The specific

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 24 -
</p>
<p id="p_19">

words employed was that "there was only one bidder, who offered

Rs.1,50,80,000/- for two properties. Considering the long

pendency of the RC and the failure of earlier sales, in the interest

of speedy recovery, the sole bid requires to be accepted.

Accordingly accepted". Hence, the sale was only on 08.05.2013.

Further, on the same day, by the very same proceedings, it was

ordered that "Sale is confirmed and made absolute". The

proceedings in the other DRC also is similar as is evident from the

extract herein above. Hence, though the auction was conducted

on 26.03.2013, the sale and confirmation were made on the same

day, i.e., on 08.05.2013.
</p>
<p id="p_20">            24. Rule 52 of Part III of Schedule II speaks of

proclamation of sale; on which there is no dispute in the instant

case. The contents of the proclamation also cannot be challenged

now, since the borrowers and the mortgagors have not objected to

the same. The mode of proclamation as provided in Rule 54 also

cannot now be disputed. Rule 55 prohibits sale of any immovable

property under Schedule II without the consent, in writing of the

defaulter, until the expiry of at least 30 days calculated from the

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 25 -
</p>
<p id="p_21">

date on which a copy of the proclamation of sale has been affixed

on the property or in the office of the Tax Recovery Officer. It has

to be read with the provision for adjournment under Rule 15,

wherein sub-rule (2) specifically speaks of an adjournment under

sub-rule (1) for a longer period than one calendar month, requiring

a fresh proclamation of sale. Herein, though the initial sale date

was with 30 days notice, the further adjournments are said to be

within 30 days period and hence there is no requirement for a

fresh proclamation, is the contention.
</p>
<p id="p_22">           25. The original sale was on 05.02.2013, which was

adjourned to 04.0-3.2013, within 30 days. Again on 04.03.2013, it

was adjourned to 26.03.2013, within 30 days. The learned counsel

for the respondent-Bank relies on a decision of this Court reported

in Bhat (supra), to contend that a fresh proclamation is called for

only when a single adjournment is made for a period longer than

one calendar month, pushing the date of sale beyond a period of

one month. With due respect, I am unable to agree with the said

declaration and in the normal course this would have necessitated

a reference to a Division Bench. However, the said procedure

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015         - 26 -
</p>
<p id="p_23">

need not be adopted in view of the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Mathew Varghese (supra) wherein the

application of Schedule II of the IT Act to the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_22">SARFAESI Act</a> was

considered. It was held so in paragraphs 52 and 53:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">              "52. Keeping the said basic principle in

        applying the above provisions in mind, when we refer

        to Rule 15 of Schedule II Part I of the Income Tax

        Act, 1961, in the first place it will have to be stated

        that a reading of the said Rule does not in any way

        conflict with either <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_23">Section 13(8)</a> of the SARFAESI

        Act or Rules 8 and 9 of the 2002 Rules. As far as

        sub-rule (1) of Rule 15 is concerned, it only deals

        with the discretion of the Tax Recovery Officer to

        adjourn the sale by recording his reasons for such

        adjournment. The said Rule does not in any way

        conflict with either Rules 8 or 9 or <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_24">Section 13</a>, in

        particular sub-section (1) or sub-section (8) of the

        <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_25">SARFAESI Act</a>. Therefore, to that extent there is no

        difficulty in applying Rule 15. As far as sub-rule (2)

        is concerned, the same is clear to the effect that

        a sale of immovable property once adjourned

        under sub-rule (1) for a longer period than one

        calendar month, a fresh proclamation of sale

        should be made unless the defaulter consents to

     particular <a href="/doc/152603276/" id="a_27">Section 13</a> or Rules 8 and 9. In fact there

     is no provision relating to grant of adjournment or

     issuance of a fresh proclamation for effecting the

     sale after the earlier date of sale was not adhered to

     in the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_28">SARFAESI Act</a>. In such circumstances going

     by the prescription contained in <a href="/doc/116137496/" id="a_29">Section 37</a> of the

     SARFAESI Act, as we have reached a conclusion

     that the provision contained in Section 29 of the

     RDDB Act will be in addition to and not in derogation

     of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_30">SARFAESI Act</a>, the

     provisions contained in Rule 15, which is applicable

     by virtue of the stipulation contained in Section 29 of

     the RDDB Act, whatever is stated in sub-rule (2) of

     Rule 15 should be followed in a situation where a

     notice of sale notified as per Rules 8 and 9(1) of the

     2002 Rules, read along with <a href="/doc/175152120/" id="a_31">Section 13(8)</a> gets

     postponed.      In  our   considered   view   such    a

     sale or transfer of the secured asset on any

Supreme Court, the provision for 30 days notice is to protect the

interest of the borrower and the mortgagor. There could be

fluctuation in the market and there could also be changes in the

circumstances of the borrower or the mortgagor, which would

enable them to settle the matter. The Recovery Officer, who has

the statutory duty to conduct the sale so as to effectuate speedy

recovery of the amounts due to the Banks has an equal duty to the

the mortgagor/owner to ensure that the maximum price is received

for the property. To that extent, useful reference can be made to

paragraphs 41, 42 and 43 of Mathew Varghese (supra):

    made therein, we wish to state that the endeavour or the

    role of a secured creditor in such a situation while

    resorting to any sale for the realisation of dues of a

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_27">          constitutional right as well as a human right. A

          person cannot be deprived of his property

          except in accordance with the provisions of a

          statute. (<a href="/doc/1077729/" id="a_44">Vide Lachhman Dass v. Jagat Ram</a>

          Thus, the condition precedent for taking away

          someone's property or disposing of the secured

          assets, is that the authority must ensure

          compliance with the statutory provisions.

          summarised to the effect that the recovery of the

          public dues must be made strictly in accordance

          with the procedure prescribed by law. The

          liability of a surety is coextensive with that of the

          principal debtor. In case there are more than

          one surety the liability is to be divided equally

          among the sureties for unpaid amount of loan.

          Once the sale has been confirmed it cannot be

      dues should be made expeditiously, it should be in

      accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and

      that it should not frustrate a constitutional right, as well

      as the human right of a person to hold a property and

      that in the event of a fundamental procedural error

      occurred in a sale, the same can be set aside".</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_31">



</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_32">             27. The prohibition of sale being adjourned beyond 30

days, without the consent of the owner is with the specific intent of

protecting the rights over the property and to ensure that such

valuable rights are not deprived of unless by procedure

established by law. The Recovery Officer cannot be allowed to

adjourn the sale for every 20 days and then conduct it after one

year. Apposite would be a reference to the oft-quoted principle that

when the statute prescribes for something to be done in a

particular manner, it shall be done in that manner or not at all

[Taylor v. Taylor [(1875) 1 Ch.D 426]. Herein, the first sale was

on 05.02.2013. It was adjourned to 04.03.2013 and then to

26.03.2013, clearly beyond the 30 days period prescribed. Hence,

of the same running contrary to the provisions of Schedule II,

specifically Rule 15.
</p>
<p id="p_25">             28. There is also no sale conducted on 26.03.2013.

This Court has already found that the authorization on 05.05.2009

cannot at all be relied on, to clothe the Recovery Inspector with the

power to conduct the sale. Even if such authorization had been

properly made, the proceedings in the DRC would not indicate any

sale having been conducted. Rule 56 of Schedule II mandates that

the sale shall be by public auction to the highest bidder and shall

be subject to confirmation by the Recovery Officer. Here, a public

auction is seen to have been conducted, but no sale effected.

Reference can be made to the decision of Mathew Varghese

(supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court says so:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">       "Unfortunately, the fourth respondent Bank stated to have

       effected the sale on 28.12.2007 by accepting the tender of

       the appellant and by way of further process, directed to

       deposit the balance amount within 15 days, which was

       deposited by the appellant on 11.1.2008". [para 55]

The extract is made not to state a principle, but only to understand

as to how a process of sale has to be effected in auction. In

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">

</blockquote><p id="p_26">auction, the sale has to be effected by "accepting the tender" and

the purchaser has to be directed to deposit the amounts as

directed in the proclamation for sale. On compliance of such

directions, there will be a sale proper. Here, the auction alone was

conducted through the service provider and there was only one

bid, which has not been accepted by the Recovery Inspector. The

acceptance has been made specifically on 08.05.2013, on which

date itself the confirmation was also made.
</p>
<p id="p_27">             29. Rule 60 of Schedule II provides for an application

to set aside the sale of immovable property on deposit, by which

the defaulter or any person affected by the sale could, within 30

days from the date of sale, apply to the Recovery Officer to set

aside the sale on his depositing the amounts as specified in

clause (a) and clause (b). Rule 61 speaks of an application to set

aside sale of an immovable property on the ground of non-service

of notice or irregularity, in the event of which, no deposit has to be

made. Rule 62 provides for an application to set aside the sale, by

the purchaser, within 30 days of such sale on the ground that the

defaulter has no sale-able interest. The confirmation mandated by

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015       - 35 -
</p>
<p id="p_28">

Rule 63 is only when no such application has been made or when

such an application is made and disallowed by the Recovery

Officer. Hence, a conjoint reading of Rules 60, 61, 62 and 63

would indicate that the confirmation shall be made only after 30

days of the sale. The bid herein was accepted on 08.05.2013 and

was confirmed on the very same day. This is also against the

provisions of Schedule II.

<p id="p_29">            30. The question remaining is the third party rights

acquired by a bonafide purchaser. <a href="/doc/92195429/" id="a_46">Sadashiv Prasad Singh v.

Harendar Singh and Others</a> [(2015) 5 SCC 574] was in a

circumstance when the brother of the deceased mortgagor

approached the High Court; when an objection raised before the

Recovery Officer against the proclamation, by the same person,

was not prosecuted. The case arose from two appeals, one filed

by the objector before the Recovery Officer and the other filed by

the purchaser. The proceedings were taken by the creditor-Bank

against a firm and on the basis of the Recovery Certificate issued

by the DRT, the Recovery Officer took steps for sale of the

property. The brother, of one of the partners who owned the

mortgaged property, was before the Recovery Officer contending

that his brother had executed an agreement for sale with him and

he had a claim over the properties attempted to be sold. Though

such an objection was filed before the Recovery Officer,

subsequently it was abandoned. Recovery proceedings were

taken, auction was conducted, the highest bidder purchased the

property and the sale was confirmed; after which the objector

approached the High Court in a writ petition. The learned Single

Judge dismissed the writ petition. In appeal, the objector took up a

contention that the property was sold for Rs.13.20 lakhs and

offered a sum of Rs.39 lakhs. The creditor-Bank had a total dues

of Rs.75,75,562/-. An offer was made by the Bank to settle the

matter finally on being paid an amount of Rs.45 lakhs. Somehow,

the compromise did not fructify.

<p id="p_31">           31. Later, when the matter was finally disposed of, the

Division Bench took note of the earlier offer and directed that the

appellant pay Rs.15 lakhs to the auction purchaser and Rs.30

lakhs to the Bank, upon which the sale would be set aside. The

Hon'ble Supreme Court found that the Division Bench could not

available to the auction purchaser. Paragraph 12 is extracted

hereunder:

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">            "12. Learned counsel for the auction purchaser

        fall of the hammer, and certain rights accrue in

          the sale is confirmed by that authority, certain

          rights accrue in favour of the auction - purchaser,

          and these rights cannot be extinguished except

          in exceptional cases such as fraud.

<blockquote id="blockquote_48">                31. In the present case, the auction having

          cannot be set aside unless some fraud or

     cannot be extinguished except in cases where the said

     purchase can be assailed on grounds of fraud or

     collusion".
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">

</blockquote><p id="p_36">It has to be emphasized that the decisions referred to in the above

extracts were cases in which there was a proper auction

conducted. Only in such circumstances the auction purchaser gets

a legal interest, which has to be protected notwithstanding

anything, but a fraud or collusion having been occasioned. In the

instant case, the thrust is on the very legality of the procedure of

sale and not on the third-party interest.
</p>
<p id="p_38">            32. In the context of the instant case, more apposite

would be reference to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

in M.V.Janardhan Reddy (supra). That was a case in which the

Recovery Officer, sought permission from the Company Court to

sell the property; since the Company Court had appointed an

Official Liquidator for the borrower Company. The permission

granted was for the sale to be conducted, subject to final orders of

the Company Court. The sale was confirmed by the Recovery

Officer and the owner of the property was before the Company

Judge, who set aside the sale. Before the Supreme Court, it was

submitted that after confirmation of sale no order setting aside the

sale could have been passed by the Court. It was urged that, after

the sale was confirmed, it could be set aside only on grounds of

fraud or irregularity in conducting the sale. The Supreme Court

found that the order of the Company Judge specifically and

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015          - 42 -
</p>
<p id="p_39">

unequivocally stated that permission of the Court should be

obtained before the sale was confirmed or finalized. The same

was found to be an express condition imposed by the Company

Court and as such it was not open to the Recovery Officer to

confirm the sale and such confirmation had no authority of law. It

was held so in paragraph 25:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_52">            "25. It is true that the Recovery Officer confirmed

       the sale in favour of the appellant. But as we have

       already noted, in view of the condition imposed by the

       Company Court, the Recovery Officer did not have the

       power to confirm sale. An order passed by an officer

       having no authority of law has no effect. It neither

       creates any right in favour of a party for whom such

       order is made nor imposes any obligation on the

       opposite party against whom it was passed".</blockquote><p id="p_40">



</p><p id="p_41">           33. In the present case also, irregularity in the conduct

of the sale is pointed out with reference to the violation of the

provisions of Schedule II, which is applicable for the sale

conducted by the Recovery Officer under the RDDB Act. As was

found by this Court, the proclamations of sale in both the Original

Petitions cannot be assailed by the borrower. The same was

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015       - 43 -
</p>
<p id="p_42">

issued by the Recovery Officer, who was competent to do so and

there was no objection filed as to any procedural irregularity or

with respect to the determination of the upset price. The sale was

also posted to 05.02.2013, giving clear 30 days notice. However,

the adjournments made thereafter went beyond the 30 days period

and the auction is said to have been conducted on 26.03.2013.

This court has already found, on the basis of the binding

precedent of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, that the provision with

respect to the adjournment without a fresh proclamation beyond

30 days, is not one merely prohibiting a single adjournment

pushing the date beyond 30 days. Adjournments for short-term

periods, but eventually leading to the date being pushing beyond

30 days, would be clearly illegal and in the present case the sale,

by two adjournments, was pushed beyond 30 days attracting the

prohibition under Schedule II. It is also found that no sale was

actually conducted on 26.03.2013 and the conduct of the auction

was recorded and the files placed before the Recovery Officer as

seen from the proceedings in both the DRCs. The Recovery

Officer-in-charge on 08.05.2013 having gone through the

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 44 -
</p>
<p id="p_43">

proceedings in the files of the DRCs, accepted the auction and

confirmed the sale. The acceptance of the auction is the action

which results in the sale having been effected. The sale having

been effected, the confirmation should have been 30 days

thereafter; going by the provisions of Schedule II, as found by this

Court. The fact that the sale was confirmed does not at all result in

any consequence. The sale having been found to be irregular and

illegal cannot create any rights on the purchaser merely because

of the confirmation, which is also against the provisions of

Schedule II. The sale effected on the purchaser, hence, has to be

necessarily set aside.
</p>
<p id="p_44">            34. Yet another irregularity in the conduct of the sale is

that, the Recovery Inspector definitely is not competent to conduct

the sale on the basis of the authorization dated 05.05.2009, since

the person who made the authorization is no more and there was

another person in the post of Recovery Officer who had made the

proclamation for sale. The said Recovery Officer had also retired

and as on date there was no person occupying the office of the

Recovery Officer. Hence, the Recovery Inspector, in any case,

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 45 -
</p>
<p id="p_45">

could not have conducted the sale on the basis of an authorization

of the year 2009.
</p>
<p id="p_46">            35. Now, the question is as to how the purchaser will

be compensated. The purchaser has remitted Rs.1,91,20,000/=

[Rupees one crore, ninety one lakhs and twenty thousand only] on

09.04.2013. It is pertinent that the said deposit was made before

the sale was effected and the purchaser is unable to produce any

communication from the office of the Recovery Officer to

substantiate that he was communicated of the sale having been

effected. However, the purchaser cannot be found fault with, since

the sole bid being of the purchaser, in his over anxiety to comply

with the conditions in the proclamation for sale, the purchaser

would have made the deposit even on a communication from the

Bank. But, that does not in any manner confer any rights on the

purchaser and would only enable him to claim the amounts to be

refunded; with interest and just compensation. The factum of the

registration having been effected and the stamp duty and

registration charges paid cannot also create any right on the

purchaser; but for just compensation.
</p>
<p id="p_47">OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015        - 46 -
</p>
<p id="p_48">

</p><p id="p_49">            36. The Bank had the proceeds of the alleged sale

deposited by the purchaser from 09.04.2013 onwards, but it was

kept in fixed deposit. When the sale is set aside even on illegality,

on the application of the borrower/mortgagor/owner, the liability to

interest in the loan account revives from the date on which the

deposit was made. Hence, the compensation payable to the

purchaser could be granted from the interest payable in the loan

account as per the agreement between the borrower and the

creditor-Bank. It is submitted by the respondent-Bank that the

interest rate is 17.33% with quarterly rests.

</p><p id="p_50">            37. The 2nd respondent-purchaser is said to have

deposited a total of Rs.1,91,20,000/- [Rupees one crore, ninety

one lakhs and twenty thousand] on 09.04.2013, being the total bid

amount; in respect of both the DRCs. In addition, the 2nd

respondent has also expended Rs.13,38,430/- [Rupees thirteen

lakhs, thirty eight thousand, four hundred and thirty] being the

stamp duty, the registration charges as also the poundage fees.

The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent-Bank would

submit that the amounts deposited in the Bank, being

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015       - 47 -
</p>
<p id="p_51">

Rs.1,91,20,000/-, was kept in a Fixed Deposit account, which has,

as of now, generated an interest of Rs.40,56,120/- [Rupees forty

lakhs, fifty six thousand, one hundred and twenty] (at the rate of

6% per annum). The entire amounts along with interest at the rate

of 6% has to be paid to the 2nd respondent. A further interest at the

rate of 4% for the amount of Rs.1,91,20,000/- [Rupees one crore,

ninety   one    lakhs  and   twenty  thousand]      would  be    just

compensation for the deprivation of such amount caused to the 2nd

respondent by reason of the irregular sale. The 2nd respondent

would also be entitled to approach the registration authorities for

cancellation of the sale deeds; the refund of such amount being

permissible in the name of the 2nd respondent. The additional 4%

interest granted by this Court would also take care of the

poundage fees and registration charges, which cannot be

refunded. The respondent-Bank would not charge any of these

amounts on the petitioners, since the additional interest granted of

4% would be comprised within the interest levy on the

petitioners/borrowers from the date of sale till refund made to the

2nd respondent. The Bank shall comply with the aforesaid

OP(DRT).11 &amp; 12 of 2015           - 48 -

<p id="p_52">

directions within a period of one month and the interest shall be

calculated up to the date of such payment. The sale conducted on

08.05.2013 and confirmed on the said date would stand set aside.

The proceedings for sale would have to commence with a fresh

proclamation of sale, since the proclamations produced in the

above Original Petitions, though were held to be proper, cannot be

pressed into service at this distance of time.

</p><p id="p_53">           The Original Petitions are allowed, setting aside the
