     the Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka relied heavily upon

     the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1060613/" id="a_8">Transmission Corpn. of A.P. Ltd. v. CIT</a>,

     (1999) 7 SCC 266 [“AP Transco”] and held that since no application

     under <a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_9">section 195(2)</a> of the Income Tax Act had been made, the

     resident Indian importers became liable to deduct tax at source, without

<p id="p_24">9.   This view of the High Court was set aside by this Court in GE India

     Technology Centre (P) Ltd. v. CIT, (2010) 10 SCC 29 [“GE

     Technology”], which ultimately found that the judgment of the High

     Court   dated   24.09.2009    had   misread     AP   Transco     (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_25">     Consequently, this Court remanded the matter to the High Court of

     Karnataka to decide, on merits, the question of law framed as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">         “24. In our view, <a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_11">Section 195(2)</a> is based on the “principle of
         proportionality”. The said sub-section gets attracted only in
         cases where the payment made is a composite payment in
         which a certain proportion of payment has an element of
         “income” chargeable to tax in India. It is in this context that
         the Supreme Court stated: (Transmission Corpn. case

                                   (emphasis supplied)

If one reads the observation of the Supreme Court, the
words “such sum” clearly indicate that the observation refers
to a case of composite payment where the payer has a doubt
regarding the inclusion of an amount in such payment which
is exigible to tax in India. In our view, the above observations
of this Court in Transmission Corpn. case [(1999) 7 SCC 266
: (1999) 239 ITR 587] which is put in italics has been
completely, with respect, misunderstood by the Karnataka
High Court to mean that it is not open for the payer to
contend that if the amount paid by him to the non-resident is
not at all “chargeable to tax in India”, then no TAS is required
to be deducted from such payment. This interpretation of the
High Court completely loses sight of the plain words of
<a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_12">Section 195(1)</a> which in clear terms lays down that tax at
source is deductible only from “sums chargeable” under the
provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_13">IT Act</a> i.e. chargeable under <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_14">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_15">5</a>

<p id="p_26">25. Before concluding we may clarify that in the present case
on facts ITO(TDS) had taken the view that since the sale of
the software concerned, included a licence to use the same,
the payment made by the appellant(s) to foreign suppliers
constituted “royalty” which was deemed to accrue or arise in
India and, therefore, TAS was liable to be deducted under
<a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_17">Section 195(1)</a> of the Act. The said finding of ITO(TDS) was
upheld by CIT(A). However, in the second appeal, ITAT held
that such sum paid by the appellant(s) to the foreign
software suppliers was not a “royalty” and that the same did
not give rise to any “income” taxable in India and, therefore,
the appellant(s) was not liable to deduct TAS. However, the
High Court did not go into the merits of the case and it went

       obligation to deduct TAS arises, which view stands hereby
       overruled.

<p id="p_27">       26. Since the High Court did not go into the merits of the
       case on the question of payment of royalty, we hereby set
       aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and remit
       these cases to the High Court for de novo consideration of
       the cases on merits. The question which the High Court will
       answer is: whether on facts and circumstances of the case
       ITAT was justified in holding that the amount(s) paid by the
       appellant(s) to the foreign software suppliers was not
       “royalty” and that the same did not give rise to any “income”

    beneficial to the deductor of tax under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_24">section 195</a> of the Income Tax

    copyright and attract royalty, upon applying the more beneficial

    provisions of the India-Singapore DTAA, it would be made clear that the

    amounts payable were not in the nature of royalty, and no income in the

    hands of the foreign supplier would be deemed to accrue in India. Thus,

    no tax had to be deducted by the Indian importer under <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_25">section 195(1)</a>

copyright was given by IBM Singapore and that even the end-user in

India only received a limited licence to use the product by itself, with no

right to sub-license, lease, make copies etc. The licence to use such

shrink-wrapped computer software was thus incidental to and essential

to effectuate the use of the product. He strongly relied upon the

Commentaries on the Articles of the Model Tax Convention on Income

and on Capital [“OECD Commentary”] by the Organisation for

Economic      Co-operation     and     Development       [“OECD”]     which

distinguishes between the sale of a copyrighted article and the sale of

copyright itself. He further argued that the doctrine of first sale/principle

of exhaustion was cemented in <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_31">section 14(b)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act

post the amendment brought in vide Act 49 of 1999, with effect from

15.01.2000 [“1999 Amendment”], thereby making it clear that the

foreign supplier’s distribution right would not extend to the sale of copies

of the work to other persons beyond the first sale. Importantly, he added

that the importer, IBM India, being only a distributor, had no right to use

the computer software, and merely purchased a sealed, shrink-

    argued that the words “any right, property or information used or

    services utilised” which occur in <a href="/doc/1329236/" id="a_35">section 9(1)(vi)(b)</a>, make it clear that

    explanation 4, read both textually and contextually would only apply to

    Circular No. 10/2002 dated 09.10.2002 by the Central Board of Direct

    Taxes [“CBDT”] in which “remittance for royalties” and “remittance for

    supply of articles or…computer software” were addressed as separate

    and distinct payments, the former attracting the “royalty” provision under

    Systems B.V. Gevers Deynootweg, In Re., (2010) 327 ITR 1 (AAR),

    results would ensue, inasmuch as his client, receiving a 2%

    commission, would, however, after the disallowance of the deduction

    under <a href="/doc/1918609/" id="a_41">section 40(a)(ia)</a> of the Income Tax Act, end up paying tax of a

    amendment, after deleting the words “regardless of whether such copy

    has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasions”, was a statutory

    application of the doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion. This, he

    be said that only the goods, and not the copyright in the goods, had

<p id="p_52">     For this, he relied upon the language of explanation 2(v) and stressed

     that the words “in respect of” have to be given a wide meaning. He then

     relied upon CBDT Circular No. 152 dated 27.11.1974,9 together with the

     statement of the Finance Minister made before the Lok Sabha on

     07.09.1990,10 and CBDT Notification No. 21/2012 dated 13.06.2012,11

     to submit that explanation 4 to <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_54">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax Act is

     clarificatory of the position in law right from 01.06.1976 when <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_55">section

     9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax Act was first brought into force. He then

     argued that the provisions for TDS are distinct from and exist apart from

     provisions for assessment under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_56">Income Tax Act</a>. This being so, it

     is clear that the India-USA DTAA and other such DTAAs would not apply

     to the persons spoken of in <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_57">section 195</a> of the Income Tax Act who are

     not assessees, since the provisions of the DTAAs, when read with

     described as assessees. He also relied upon <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_59">Article 30</a> of the India-USA

       deductions under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_60">section 195</a> of the Income Tax Act do not fall within

       the subject matter of the India-USA DTAA and other such DTAAs. He

       then relied heavily upon AP Transco (supra) and other judgments which

       make it clear that a “payer” under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_61">section 195</a> and an “assessee” under

       <a href="/doc/1958149/" id="a_62">section 2(7)</a> of the Income Tax Act are distinct. He also relied heavily

       deducted at source irrespective of whether tax is otherwise payable by

       the non-resident assessee. He then relied upon CBDT Circular No. 588

       dated 02.01.1991,12 which clarified that tax concessions were not

       available in relation to payments in respect of software imported

installation and use on a particular computer, copyright is parted with by

the original owner. He added that <a href="/doc/1932535/" id="a_72">section 51(b)</a> of the Copyright Act

makes it clear that when any person makes for sale or hire, or sells or

lets for hire, or distributes, either for the purpose of trade or to such an

extent as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright, or imports

into India, any infringing copies of the work, such importation into India

without a licence would amount to infringement of copyright. Further,

<a href="/doc/348788/" id="a_73">section 58</a> of the Copyright Act regards infringing copies of any work as

the property of the owner of the copyright, who accordingly may take

proceedings for the recovery of possession thereof or in respect of the

conversion thereof. From <a href="/doc/74442303/" id="a_74">section 52(1)(ad)</a> of the Copyright Act, the

learned Additional Solicitor General sought to argue that only the

making of copies or the adaptation of a computer programme from a

legally obtained copy for non-commercial, personal use would not

amount to infringement, and therefore in the appeals before us, where

such copies were made for commercial use, the converse would be true.

       Indian Government had expressed its reservations on the OECD

       Report of the High Powered Committee on ‘Electronic Commerce and

       contrary to explanations 2 and 4 of <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_75">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax

    Tax Act</a>, residence in India, as defined by <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_111">section 6</a>, is necessary in

    assessment year at any rate or rates, as defined by <a href="/doc/568949/" id="a_113">section 2(37A)</a> of

    the Income Tax Act, in respect of the total income of the previous year

    of every person. Under <a href="/doc/716328/" id="a_114">section 4(2)</a>, in respect of income chargeable

    or paid in advance, depending upon the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_115">Income Tax

    accrue or arise to such person in India during such year. This, however,

    is subject to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_117">Income Tax Act</a>. Certain income is

    deemed to arise or accrue in India, under <a href="/doc/1369261/" id="a_118">section 9</a> of the Income Tax

    Act, notwithstanding the fact that such income may accrue or arise to a

    non-resident outside India. One such income is income by way of

    royalty, which, under <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_119">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax Act, means the

    transfer of all or any rights, including the granting of a licence, in respect

    <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_130">Income Tax Act</a> and a notification issued under <a href="/doc/68317/" id="a_131">Section 90</a>,
    is no longer res integra.”

    “28. A survey of the aforesaid cases makes it clear that the
    judicial consensus in India has been that <a href="/doc/68317/" id="a_132">Section 90</a> is
    specifically intended to enable and empower the Central
    Government to issue a notification for implementation of the
    terms of a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. When
    that happens, the provisions of such an agreement, with
    respect to cases to which they apply, would operate even if
    inconsistent with the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_133">Income Tax Act</a>. We
    approve of the reasoning in the decisions which we have
    noticed. If it was not the intention of the legislature to make
    a departure from the general principle of chargeability to tax
    under <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_134">Section 4</a> and the general principle of ascertainment
    of total income under <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_135">Section 5</a> of the Act, then there was no
    purpose in making those sections “subject to the provisions
    of the Act”. The very object of grafting the said two sections
    with the said clause is to enable the Central Government to
    issue a notification under <a href="/doc/68317/" id="a_136">Section 90</a> towards
    implementation of the terms of DTACs which would
    automatically override the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_137">Income Tax Act</a>

</p>
<p id="p_137">28. However, the learned Additional Solicitor General relied strongly upon

    the recent judgment of this Court in PILCOM (supra). This judgment

    dealt with payments made to non-resident sportspersons or sports

    associations, the relevant provision under <a href="/doc/435423/" id="a_147">section 194E</a> of the Income

    Tax Act reading as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_16">         “194-E. Payments to non-resident sportsmen or sports
         associations. - Where any income referred to in <a href="/doc/728943/" id="a_148">Section

         an athlete) who is not a citizen of India or a non-resident

        provisions of the Act” occurring in <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_150">Section 195(1)</a> of the Act,
        it was held “the obligation to deduct TAS, is however, limited
        to the appropriate proportion of the income chargeable

</blockquote><p id="p_139">30. It was in the context of <a href="/doc/435423/" id="a_151">section 194E</a> of the Income Tax Act, that the

    Court went on to observe:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">        “18. We now come to the issue of applicability of DTAA. As
        observed by the High Court, the matter was not argued
        before it in that behalf, yet the issue was dealt with by the
        High Court. In our view, the reasoning that weighed with the
        High Court is quite correct. The obligation to deduct Tax at
        Source under <a href="/doc/435423/" id="a_152">Section 194E</a> of the Act is not affected by the
        DTAA and in case the exigibility to tax is disputed by the
        assessee on whose account the deduction is made, the
        benefit of DTAA can be pleaded and if the case is made out,
        the amount in question will always be refunded with interest.
        But, that by itself, cannot absolve the liability under <a href="/doc/435423/" id="a_153">Section
        194E</a> of the Act.</blockquote>

<p id="p_140">        19. In the premises, it must be held that the payments made
        to the Non Resident Sports Associations in the present case
        represented their income which accrued or arose or was
        deemed to have accrued or arisen in India. Consequently,



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">                                                                          41</span>
         the Appellant was liable to deduct Tax at Source in terms of
         <a href="/doc/435423/" id="a_154">Section 194E</a> of the Act.”


</p><p id="p_141">31. It will be seen that <a href="/doc/435423/" id="a_155">section 194E</a> of the Income Tax Act belongs to a set

    of various provisions which deal with TDS, without any reference to

    chargeability of tax under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_156">Income Tax Act</a> by the concerned non-
</p>
<p id="p_142">    resident assessee. This section is similar to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_157">sections 193</a> and <a href="/doc/1340652/" id="a_158">194</a> of the

    Income Tax Act by which deductions have to be made without any

    reference to the chargeability of a sum received by a non-resident

    assessee under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_159">Income Tax Act</a>. On the other hand, as has been

    noted in GE Technology (supra), at the heart of <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_160">section 195</a> of the

    Income Tax Act is the fact that deductions can only be made if the non-
</p>
<p id="p_143">    resident assessee is liable to pay tax under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_161">Income

    Tax Act</a> in the first place.
</p>
<p id="p_144">32. Thus, the judgment of this Court in PILCOM (supra), dealing with a

    completely different provision in a completely different setting, has no

    application to the facts of this case.

</p><p id="p_174">34. A reading of the aforesaid provisions leads to the following conclusions.
</p>
<p id="p_175">    Under <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_167">section 2(o)</a> of the Copyright Act, a literary work includes a

    computer programme and a computer programme has been defined

    under <a href="/doc/124202294/" id="a_168">section 2(ffc)</a> of the Copyright Act to mean a set of instructions

    expressed in words, codes, schemes or in any other form capable of

    causing a computer to perform a particular task or achieve a particular

    result.
</p>
<p id="p_176">35. Though the expression “copyright” has not been defined separately in

    the “definitions” section of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_169">Copyright Act</a>, yet, <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_170">section 14</a> makes it

    clear that “copyright” means the “exclusive right”, subject to the




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                                                          50</span>
provisions of the Act, to do or authorise the doing of certain acts “in

respect of a work”. When an “author” in relation to a “literary work” which

includes a “computer programme”, creates such work, such author has

the exclusive right, subject to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_171">Copyright Act</a>, to do

or authorise the doing of several acts in respect of such work or any

substantial part thereof. In the case of a computer programme, <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_172">section

14(b)</a> specifically speaks of two sets of acts – the seven acts

enumerated in sub-clause (a) and the eighth act of selling or giving on

commercial rental or offering for sale or for commercial rental any copy

of the computer programme. Insofar as the seven acts that are set out

in sub-clause (a) are concerned, they all delineate how the exclusive

right that is with the owner of the copyright may be parted with, i.e., if

there is any parting with the right to reproduce the work in any material

form; the right to issue copies of the work to the public, not being copies

already in circulation; the right to perform the work in public or

communicate it to the public; the right to make any cinematograph film

or sound recording in respect of the work; the right to make any

translation of the work; the right to make any adaptation of the work; or

the right to do any of the specified acts in relation to a translation or an

adaptation.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                                                         51</span>
<p id="p_177">36. In essence, such right is referred to as copyright, and includes the right

    to reproduce the work in any material form, issue copies of the work to

    the public, perform the work in public, or make translations or

    adaptations of the work. This is made even clearer by the definition of

    an “infringing copy” contained in <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_173">section 2(m)</a> of the Copyright Act, which

    in relation to a computer programme, i.e., a literary work, means

    reproduction of the said work. Thus, the right to reproduce a computer

    programme and exploit the reproduction by way of sale, transfer, license

    etc. is at the heart of the said exclusive right.

<p id="p_178">37. <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_174">Section 14(b)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act was amended twice, first in 1994

    and then again in 1999, with effect from 15.01.2000. Prior to the 1999

    Amendment, <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_175">section 14(b)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act read as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_54">         “(ii) to sell or give on hire, or offer for sale or hire any copy
         of the computer programme, regardless of whether such
         copy has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasions;”

    What is conspicuous by its absence is the phrase “regardless of

    whether such copy has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasions”.

consideration, the assignee of such right becomes entitled to all such

rights comprised in the copyright that is assigned, and shall be treated

as the owner of the copyright of what is assigned to him (see <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_180">section

18(2)</a> read with <a href="/doc/185418821/" id="a_181">section 19(3)</a> of the Copyright Act). Also, under <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_182">section

30</a> of the Copyright Act, the owner of the copyright in any literary work

may grant any interest in any right mentioned in <a href="/doc/56089611/" id="a_183">section 14(a)</a> of the

Copyright Act by licence in writing by him to the licensee, under which,

for parting with such interest, royalty may become payable (see <a href="/doc/163050210/" id="a_184">section

30A</a> of the Copyright Act). When such licence is granted, copyright is

infringed when any use, relatable to the said interest/right that is

licensed, is contrary to the conditions of the licence so granted.
</p>
<p id="p_180">Infringement of copyright takes place when a person “makes for sale or

hire or sells or lets for hire” or “offers for sale or hire” or “distributes…so

as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright”, vide <a href="/doc/1932535/" id="a_185">section 51(b)</a>

of the Copyright Act. Importantly, the making of copies or adaptation of

a computer programme in order to utilise the said computer programme

for the purpose for which it was supplied, or to make up back-up copies

as a temporary protection against loss, destruction or damage so as to

be able to utilise the computer programme for the purpose for which it

was supplied, does not constitute an act of infringement of copyright

    under <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_186">section 52(1)(aa)</a> of the Copyright Act. In short, what is referred

    to in <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_187">section 52(1)(aa)</a> of the Copyright Act would not amount to

    reproduction so as to amount to an infringement of copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_181">39. <a href="/doc/134990/" id="a_188">Section 52(1)(ad)</a> is independent of <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_189">section 52(1)(aa)</a> of the Copyright

    Act, and states that the making of copies of a computer programme from

    a personally legally obtained copy for non-commercial personal use

    would not amount to an infringement of copyright. However, it is not

    possible to deduce from this what is sought to be deduced by the

    learned Additional Solicitor General, namely, that if personally legally

    obtained copies of a computer programme are to be exploited for

    commercial use, it would necessarily amount to an infringement of

    copyright. <a href="/doc/74442303/" id="a_190">Section 52(1)(ad)</a> of the Copyright Act cannot be read to

    negate the effect of <a href="/doc/134990/" id="a_191">section 52(1)(aa)</a>, since it deals with a subject matter

    that is separate and distinct from that contained in <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_192">section 52(1)(aa)</a> of

     has to be construed with reference to <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_201">Article 12</a> of the DTAA. This

<blockquote id="blockquote_69">          2. The correct legal position is that where a specific provision

          in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_203">Income-tax Act</a>. In fact that the double taxation

    is granted to the distributor is only a non-exclusive, non-transferable

    licence to resell computer software, it being expressly stipulated that no

    copyright in the computer programme is transferred either to the

    distributor or to the ultimate end-user. This is further amplified by stating

    that apart from a right to use the computer programme by the end-user

    himself, there is no further right to sub-license or transfer, nor is there

    any right to reverse-engineer, modify, reproduce in any manner

    otherwise than permitted by the licence to the end-user. What is paid

    by way of consideration, therefore, by the distributor in India to the

    foreign, non-resident manufacturer or supplier, is the price of the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">                                                                              72</span>
    computer programme as goods, either in a medium which stores the

    software or in a medium by which software is embedded in hardware,

    which may be then further resold by the distributor to the end-user in

    India, the distributor making a profit on such resale. Importantly, the

    distributor does not get the right to use the product at all.
</p>
<p id="p_263">46. When it comes to an end-user who is directly sold the computer

    programme, such end-user can only use it by installing it in the

    computer hardware owned by the end-user and cannot in any manner

    reproduce the same for sale or transfer, contrary to the terms imposed

    by the EULA.
</p>
<p id="p_264">47. In all these cases, the “licence” that is granted vide the EULA, is not a

    licence in terms of <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_212">section 30</a> of the Copyright Act, which transfers an

    interest in all or any of the rights contained in <a href="/doc/56089611/" id="a_213">sections 14(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_214">14(b)</a>

    of the Copyright Act, but is a “licence” which imposes restrictions or

    conditions for the use of computer software. Thus, it cannot be said that

    any of the EULAs that we are concerned with are referable to <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_215">section

    30</a> of the Copyright Act, inasmuch as <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_216">section 30</a> of the Copyright Act

    speaks of granting an interest in any of the rights mentioned in <a href="/doc/56089611/" id="a_217">sections

    14(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_218">14(b)</a> of the Copyright Act. The EULAs in all the appeals

    interest to reproduce the computer software. In point of fact, such

    reproduction is expressly interdicted, and it is also expressly stated that

    no vestige of copyright is at all transferred, either to the distributor or to

    the end-user. A simple illustration to explain the aforesaid position will

    suffice. If an English publisher sells 2000 copies of a particular book to

    an Indian distributor, who then resells the same at a profit, no copyright

    in the aforesaid book is transferred to the Indian distributor, either by

    way of licence or otherwise, inasmuch as the Indian distributor only

    makes a profit on the sale of each book. Importantly, there is no right in

    the Indian distributor to reproduce the aforesaid book and then sell

    copies of the same. On the other hand, if an English publisher were to

    sell the same book to an Indian publisher, this time with the right to

    reproduce and make copies of the aforesaid book with the permission

    of the author, it can be said that copyright in the book has been

    transferred by way of licence or otherwise, and what the Indian

    publisher will pay for, is the right to reproduce the book, which can then

    be characterised as royalty for the exclusive right to reproduce the book

    in the territory mentioned by the licence.

    <a href="/doc/193821545/" id="a_219">State Bank of India v. Collector of Customs</a>, (2000) 1 SCC 727. In

    which says that the charges for the right to reproduce the
    imported goods in the country of importation shall not be
    added to the price actually paid or payable for the imported
    goods in determining the customs value. Further payments
    made by the buyer for the right to distribute or resell the

</p><p id="p_268">    11. What we have now to see is if under the agreement SBI
    has the right to reproduce the imported software and for that
    purpose SBI has paid “royalties and licence fee” which have
    been added to the price actually paid for the imported
    software for use at the principal place called the Support
    Centre. If that is so under the press note no customs duty is
    leviable on the royalty so paid. This takes us to the relevant
    terms of the agreement which would indicate as to whether



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">                                                                       75</span>
        or not the royalty/licence fees needed to be included in the
        value of the imported goods.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_269">49. The contention of the State Bank of India that the countrywide licence

    fee paid by it by way of royalty was for the reproduction of the said

    software and was thus exempt from customs duty, was turned down by

    this Court as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">        “17. The question that arises for consideration is if licence
        fee charged towards countrywide use of software in the
        second invoice could be the charges for the right to
        reproduction and were these added to the price actually paid
        or payable for the imported goods. If we refer to the
        agreement, software is not sold to SBI as such but it was to
        remain the property of Kindle. There is no other value of the
        software indicated in the agreement except the licence fee.
        Price is payable only for allowing SBI to use the software in
        a limited way at its own centres for a limited period and that
        is why the amount charged is called the licence fee. After
        five years SBI is required to pay only recurring licence fee.
        Countrywide use of the software and reproduction of
        software are two different things and licence fee for
        countrywide use cannot be considered as the charges for
        the right to reproduce the imported goods. Under the
        agreement copying, storage, removal, etc. are under the
        strict control of Kindle and all copies are the property of
        Kindle. SBI can use the software for its internal requirements
        only. Licence has been given to SBI to use the property of
        Kindle at its branches and not for reproduction of the
        software as claimed by SBI. The words in the agreement are
        specific that “SBI shall pay the licensor the initial licence fee
        and the recurring licence fees for use under the provisions
        of this agreement”.”



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">                                                                            76</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_270">50. The Court then made an important observation, stating:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_96">        “21. Reproduction and use are two different things. Now
        under the agreement user is specifically limited to licence
        sites. The transaction as a whole is to be seen. The press
        note is of no help to SBI. Rule 9(1)(c) and the interpretative
        note thereto did not apply as nothing was added to the price
        actually paid for the imported goods by way of royalties etc.
        Refund would be allowable only if there was something
        added on to the royalty payment which was not in the
        present case. The invoice originally presented was complete
        in itself. The second invoice was not filed along with the bill
        of entry. In the second invoice also it is the licence fee for
        the right to use countrywide and it is not the right to
        reproduce as claimed by SBI. Schedule I to the agreement
        is module and copies are modalities for the use of software
        by SBI with various restrictions. If we again refer to clause
        6.4 of the agreement there is a complete restraint on SBI
        which says SBI shall not use, print, copy, reproduce or
        disclose the software or documentation in whole or in part
        except as is expressly permitted by the agreement nor shall
        SBI permit any of the foregoing. SBI is also barred from
        allowing access to its software or documentation except
        what is permitted under the agreement. Again SBI is barred
        from selling, charging or otherwise making the software or
        documentation available to any person except what is
        expressly permitted under the agreement. Clause 6.5 of the
        agreement says that SBI shall not copy or permit copying of
        the software supplied to it by Kindle save as may be strictly
        required for delivery to licence sites. The terms of the
        agreement also apply to the copies.”
                                                         (emphasis supplied)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_119">                                                                         77</span>
    Though this judgment has been delivered under the <a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_221">Customs Act</a> 1962,

    yet the important differentiation made between the right to reproduce

    and the right to use computer software has been recognized by this

    judgment. Whereas the former would amount to a parting of copyright

    by the owner thereof, the latter would not.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_271">51. An argument was advanced by the learned Additional Solicitor General

    that in some of the aforestated EULAs, it was clearly stated that what

    was licensed to the distributor/end-user by the non-resident, foreign

    supplier would not amount to a sale, thereby making it clear that what

    was transferred was not goods. This argument has no legs to stand on.
</p>
<p id="p_272">    It is settled law that in all such cases, the real nature of the transaction

    must be looked at upon reading the agreement as a whole. Thus, in

    <a href="/doc/1331666/" id="a_222">Sundaram Finance Ltd. v. State of Kerala</a>, (1966) 2 SCR 828, one of

    the questions that was raised before this Court was as to the execution

    of a “sale letter” acknowledging the sale of a vehicle. This “sale letter”

    was dealt with by the Court as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_97">        “The appellants are financiers and their business is to
        advance loans on favourable terms on the security of
        vehicles. This is effected by obtaining a promissory-note for
        repayment of the amount advanced, and a hire-purchase
        agreement which provides a mechanism for recovery of the
        amount. It is true that a “sale letter” is obtained from the
        customer, but the consideration for the sale letter is only the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                                                                             78</span>
balance remaining payable to the dealer, after giving credit
against the price of the vehicle the amount paid by the
customer. The application for a loan, and the letter
addressed to the appellants undertaking to insure the
vehicle expressly mention that a loan is asked for and
granted on the security of the motor-vehicle under the hire-
</blockquote><p id="p_273">purchase agreement. It is the customer who insures the
vehicle, and in the books of the Motor Vehicle Authorities he
remains, with the consent of the appellants, owner of the
vehicle. Undue importance to the acknowledgment of sale in
the “sale letter” and the recital of sale in the bill and in the
receipt cannot therefore be attached. These documents —
“sale letter”, bill and receipt — must be read with the
application for granting a loan on the security of the vehicles,
the letter in which the customer requests the appellants to
pay the balance of the price remaining to be paid by him to
the dealer, the promissory-note executed by him for that
amount, the undertaking to insure the vehicle, and intimation
to the Motor Vehicles Authorities to make note of the hire-
purchase agreement.”
                                                            (page 839)

“The true effect of a transaction may be determined from the
terms of the agreement considered in the light of the
surrounding circumstances. In each case, the Court has,
unless prohibited by statute, power to go behind the
documents and to determine the nature of the transaction,
whatever may be the form of the documents. An owner of
goods who purports absolutely to convey or acknowledges
to have conveyed goods and subsequently purports to hire
them under a hire-purchase agreement is not estopped from
proving that the real bargain was a loan on the security of
the goods. If there is a bona fide and completed sale of
goods, evidenced by documents, anterior to and
independent of a subsequent and distinct hiring to the
vendor, the transaction may not be regarded as a loan


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                                                                   79</span>
transaction, even though the reason for which it was entered
into was to raise money. If the real transaction is a loan of
money secured by a right of seizure of the goods, the
property ostensibly passes under the documents embodying
the transaction, but subject to the terms of the hiring
agreement, which become part of the buyer&#x27;s title, and
confer a licence to seize. When a person desiring to
purchase goods and not having sufficient money on hand
borrows the amount needed from a third person and pays it
over to the vendor, the transaction between the customer
and the lender will unquestionably be a loan transaction. The
real character of the transaction would not be altered if the
lender himself is the owner of the goods and the owner
accepts the promise of the purchaser to pay the price or the
balance remaining due against delivery of goods. But a hire-
purchase agreement is a more complex transaction. The
owner under the hire-purchase agreement enters into a
transaction of hiring out goods on the terms and conditions
set out in the agreement, and the option to purchase
exercisable by the customer on payment of all the
instalments of hire arises when the instalments are paid and
not before. In such a hire-purchase agreement there is no
agreement to buy goods; the hirer being under no legal
obligation to buy, has an option either to return the goods or
to become its owner by payment in full of the stipulated hire
and the price for exercising the option. This class of hire-
purchase agreements must be distinguished from
transactions in which the customer is the owner of the goods
and with a view to finance his purchase he enters into an
arrangement which is in the form of a hire-purchase
agreement with the financier, but in substance evidences a
loan transaction, subject to a hiring agreement under which
the lender is given the license to seize the goods.”
                                                     (pages 841-842)

“In the light of these principles the true nature of the
transactions of the appellants may now be stated. The
appellants are carrying on the business of financiers: they
are not dealing in motor-vehicles. The motor-vehicle
purchased by the customer is registered in the name of the
customer and remains at all material times so registered in
his name. In the letter taken from the customer under which
the latter agrees to keep the vehicle insured, it is expressly
recited that the vehicle has been given as security for the
loan advanced by the appellants. As a security for
repayment of the loan, the customer executes a promissory-
note for the amount paid by the appellants to the dealer of
the vehicle. The so-called “sale letter” is a formal document
which is not made effective by registering the vehicle in the
name of the appellants and even the insurance of the vehicle
has to be effected as if the customer is the owner. Their right
to seize the vehicle is merely a licence to ensure compliance
with the terms of the hire-purchase agreement. The
customer remains qua the world at large the owner and
remains in possession, and on condition of performing the
covenants, has a right to continue to remain in possession.
The right of the appellants may be extinguished by payment
of the amount due to them under the terms of the hire-
purchase agreement even before the dates fixed for
payment. The agreement undoubtedly contains several
onerous covenants, but they are all intended to secure to the
appellants recovery of the amount advanced. We are
accordingly of the view that the intention of the appellants in
obtaining the hire-purchase and the allied agreements was
to secure the return of loans advanced to their customers,
and no real sale of the vehicle was intended by the customer
to the appellants. The transactions were merely financing
transactions.”

    made by the Revenue in the earlier round of litigation in GE

    Technology (supra) which led to this Court framing the question of law

    and sending it back to the High Court to decide “on merits”. He sought

    to argue, based in particular on <a href="/doc/1983234/" id="a_224">Article 30</a> of the India-USA DTAA, that

    the DTAA’s provisions in these cases would not apply at all, inasmuch

    as provisions relatable to deduction of TDS under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_225">section 195</a> of the

    be made before assessments to tax are made. He argued that these

    Income Tax Act speaking of “any person responsible to pay”, as

    opposed to an “assessee”. He therefore differentiated between the

    argued that the deductions made under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_229">section 195</a>, not being in the

    nature of tax at all and at a stage prior to the person responsible for

    paying defaulting, and being declared an assessee in default (under

    is also no doubt that the “person responsible for paying” spoken of in

    <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_233">section 195</a> of the Income Tax Act is not a non-resident assessee, but

    a person resident in India, who is liable to make deductions under

Income Tax Act, held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_98">    “8. The most important expression in <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_236">Section 195(1)</a>
    consists of the words chargeable under the provisions of the
    Act. A person paying interest or any other sum to a non-
    resident is not liable to deduct tax if such sum is not
    chargeable to tax under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_237">IT Act</a>. For instance, where there
    is no obligation on the part of the payer and no right to
    receive the sum by the recipient and that the payment does
    not arise out of any contract or obligation between the payer
    and the recipient but is made voluntarily, such payments
    cannot be regarded as income under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_238">IT Act</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_99">    9. It may be noted that <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_239">Section 195</a> contemplates not merely
    amounts, the whole of which are pure income payments, it
    also covers composite payments which have an element of
    income embedded or incorporated in them. Thus, where an
    amount is payable to a non-resident, the payer is under an
    obligation to deduct TAS in respect of such composite
    payments. The obligation to deduct TAS is, however, limited
    to the appropriate proportion of income chargeable under
    the Act forming part of the gross sum of money payable to
    the non-resident. This obligation being limited to the
    appropriate proportion of income flows from the words used
    in <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_240">Section 195(1)</a>, namely, “chargeable under the provisions
    of the Act”. It is for this reason that vide Circular No. 728
    dated 30-10-1995 CBDT has clarified that the tax deductor
    can take into consideration the effect of DTAA in respect of
    payment of royalties and technical fees while deducting
    TAS. It may also be noted that <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_241">Section 195(1)</a> is in identical
    terms with <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_242">Section 18</a>(3-B) of the 1922 Act.

</blockquote><p id="p_278">11. While deciding the scope of <a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_243">Section 195(2)</a> it is important
to note that the tax which is required to be deducted at
source is deductible only out of the chargeable sum. This is
the underlying principle of <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_244">Section 195</a>. Hence, apart from
<a href="/doc/492579/" id="a_245">Section 9(1)</a>, <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_246">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_247">5</a>, <a href="/doc/1369261/" id="a_248">9</a>, <a href="/doc/68317/" id="a_249">90</a>, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_250">91</a> as well as the
provisions of DTAA are also relevant, while applying tax
deduction at source provisions.

<p id="p_279">     xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_280">13. If the contention of the Department that the moment
there is remittance the obligation to deduct TAS arises is to
be accepted then we are obliterating the words “chargeable
under the provisions of the Act” in <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_251">Section 195(1)</a>. The said
expression in <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_252">Section 195(1)</a> shows that the remittance has
got to be of a trading receipt, the whole or part of which is
liable to tax in India. The payer is bound to deduct TAS only
if the tax is assessable in India. If tax is not so assessable,
there is no question of TAS being deducted. (<a href="/doc/889240/" id="a_253">See Vijay Ship
Breaking Corpn. v. CIT</a> [(2010) 10 SCC 39 : (2009) 314 ITR

</p><p id="p_281">14. One more aspect needs to be highlighted. <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_254">Section 195</a>
falls in Chapter XVII which deals with collection and
recovery. Chapter XVII-B deals with deduction at source by
the payer. On analysis of various provisions of Chapter XVII
one finds the use of different expressions, however, the
expression “sum chargeable under the provisions of the Act”
is used only in <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_255">Section 195</a>. For example, <a href="/doc/1195538/" id="a_256">Section 194-C</a>
casts an obligation to deduct TAS in respect of “any sum
paid to any resident”. Similarly, <a href="/doc/197649/" id="a_257">Sections 194-EE</a> and <a href="/doc/1683528/" id="a_258">194-F</a>
inter alia provide for deduction of tax in respect of “any
amount” referred to in the specified provisions. In none of
the provisions we find the expression “sum chargeable
under the provisions of the Act”, which as stated above, is



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">                                                                  85</span>
an expression used only in <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_259">Section 195(1)</a>. Therefore, this
Court is required to give meaning and effect to the said
expression. It follows, therefore, that the obligation to deduct
TAS arises only when there is a sum chargeable under the
Act.
</p>
<p id="p_282">     xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_283">18. If the contention of the Department that any person
making payment to a non-resident is necessarily required to
deduct TAS then the consequence would be that the
Department would be entitled to appropriate the monies
deposited by the payer even if the sum paid is not
chargeable to tax because there is no provision in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_260">IT Act</a>
by which a payer can obtain refund. <a href="/doc/139284/" id="a_261">Section 237</a> read with
<a href="/doc/480388/" id="a_262">Section 199</a> implies that only the recipient of the sum i.e. the
payee could seek a refund. It must therefore follow, if the
Department is right, that the law requires tax to be deducted
on all payments. The payer, therefore, has to deduct and
pay tax, even if the so-called deduction comes out of his own
pocket and he has no remedy whatsoever, even where the
sum paid by him is not a sum chargeable under the Act. The
interpretation of the Department, therefore, not only requires
the words “chargeable under the provisions of the Act” to be
omitted, it also leads to an absurd consequence. The
interpretation placed by the Department would result in a
situation where even when the income has no territorial
nexus with India or is not chargeable in India, the
Government would nonetheless collect tax. In our view,
<a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_263">Section 195(2)</a> provides a remedy by which a person may
seek a determination of the “appropriate proportion of such
sum so chargeable” where a proportion of the sum so
chargeable is liable to tax.

</p><p id="p_285">20. We find no merit in these contentions. As stated
hereinabove, <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_264">Section 195(1)</a> uses the expression “sum
chargeable under the provisions of the Act”. We need to give
weightage to those words. Further, <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_265">Section 195</a> uses the
word “payer” and not the word “assessee”. The payer is not
an assessee. The payer becomes an assessee-in-default
only when he fails to fulfil the statutory obligation under
<a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_266">Section 195(1)</a>. If the payment does not contain the element
of income the payer cannot be made liable. He cannot be
declared to be an assessee-in-default.
</p>
<p id="p_286">21. The abovementioned contention of the Department is
based on an apprehension which is ill-founded. The payer is
also an assessee under the ordinary provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_267">IT Act</a>.
When the payer remits an amount to a non-resident out of
India he claims deduction or allowances under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_268">Income
Tax Act</a> for the said sum as an “expenditure”. Under <a href="/doc/420239/" id="a_269">Section
40(a)(i)</a>, inserted vide the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_270">Finance Act</a>, 1988 w.e.f. 1-4-1989,
payment in respect of royalty, fees for technical services or
other sums chargeable under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_271">Income Tax Act</a> would not
get the benefit of deduction if the assessee fails to deduct
TAS in respect of payments outside India which are
chargeable under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_272">IT Act</a>. This provision ensures
effective compliance with <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_273">Section 195</a> of the IT Act relating
to tax deduction at source in respect of payments outside
India in respect of royalties, fees or other sums chargeable
under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_274">IT Act</a>. In a given case where the payer is an
assessee he will definitely claim deduction under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_275">IT Act</a>
for such remittance and on inquiry if the AO finds that the
sums remitted outside India come within the definition of
royalty or fees for technical service or other sums
chargeable under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_276">IT Act</a> then it would be open to the AO
to disallow such claim for deduction. Similarly, vide the

inserted in <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_278">Section 195</a> which requires the payer to furnish
information relating to payment of any sum in such form and
manner as may be prescribed by the Board. This provision
is brought into force only from 1-4-2008. It will not apply for
the period with which we are concerned in these cases
before us. Therefore, in our view, there are adequate
safeguards in the Act which would prevent revenue leakage.
</p>
<p id="p_287">     xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_288">24. In our view, <a href="/doc/1899692/" id="a_279">Section 195(2)</a> is based on the “principle of
proportionality”. The said sub-section gets attracted only in
cases where the payment made is a composite payment in
which a certain proportion of payment has an element of
“income” chargeable to tax in India. It is in this context that
the Supreme Court stated: (Transmission Corpn. case
[(1999) 7 SCC 266 : (1999) 239 ITR 587] , SCC p. 274, para
</p><p id="p_289">10)

    “10. … If no such application is filed income tax on
    such sum is to be deducted and it is the statutory
    obligation of the person responsible for paying
    such ‘sum’ to deduct tax thereon before making
    payment. He has to discharge the obligation [to
    TDS].”
                                         (emphasis supplied)

If one reads the observation of the Supreme Court, the
words “such sum” clearly indicate that the observation refers
to a case of composite payment where the payer has a doubt
regarding the inclusion of an amount in such payment which
is exigible to tax in India. In our view, the above observations
of this Court in Transmission Corpn. case [(1999) 7 SCC 266
: (1999) 239 ITR 587] which is put in italics has been
completely, with respect, misunderstood by the Karnataka

        contend that if the amount paid by him to the non-resident is
        not at all “chargeable to tax in India”, then no TAS is required
        to be deducted from such payment. This interpretation of the
        High Court completely loses sight of the plain words of
        <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_280">Section 195(1)</a> which in clear terms lays down that tax at
        source is deductible only from “sums chargeable” under the
        provisions of the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_281">IT Act</a> i.e. chargeable under <a href="/doc/339978/" id="a_282">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_283">5</a>

<p id="p_290">        25. Before concluding we may clarify that in the present case
        on facts ITO(TDS) had taken the view that since the sale of
        the software concerned, included a licence to use the same,
        the payment made by the appellant(s) to foreign suppliers
        constituted “royalty” which was deemed to accrue or arise in
        India and, therefore, TAS was liable to be deducted under
        <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_285">Section 195(1)</a> of the Act. The said finding of ITO(TDS) was
        upheld by CIT(A). However, in the second appeal, ITAT held
        that such sum paid by the appellant(s) to the foreign
        software suppliers was not a “royalty” and that the same did
        not give rise to any “income” taxable in India and, therefore,
        the appellant(s) was not liable to deduct TAS. However, the
        High Court did not go into the merits of the case and it went
        straight to conclude that the moment there is remittance an
        obligation to deduct TAS arises, which view stands hereby
        overruled.”

</p><p id="p_291">55. What is made clear by the judgment in GE Technology (supra) is the

    fact that the “person” spoken of in <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_286">section 195(1)</a> of the Income Tax Act

    is liable to make the necessary deductions only if the non-resident is

    liable to pay tax as an assessee under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_287">Income Tax Act</a>, and not

    No. 728 dated 30.10.1995, that the tax deductor must take into

    consideration the effect of the DTAA provisions. The crucial link,

    therefore, is that a deduction is to be made only if tax is payable by the

    non-resident assessee, which is underscored by this judgment, stating

    that the charging and machinery provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1369261/" id="a_288">sections 9</a> and

section (3) of Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest
(Restrictions) Act, 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 17), held that the
expression “in respect of” must be read as equivalent to
“attributable”. The Privy Council in <a href="/doc/416340/" id="a_321">Bicher Ltd. v. CIT</a> [(1962)
3 All ER 294] observed that the said words could mean more
than “consisting of” or “namely”.
</p>
<p id="p_342">It is not necessary to refer to other decisions. It may be
accepted that the said expression received a wide
interpretation, having regard to the object of the provisions
and the setting in which the said words appeared. On the
other hand, Indian tax laws use the expression “in respect
of” as synonymous with the expression “on”: see <a href="/doc/1823156/" id="a_322">Article 288</a>
of the Constitution of India; <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_323">Section 3</a> of the Indian Income
Tax Act, 1922; <a href="/doc/46570/" id="a_324">Sections 3(2)</a> and <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_325">3(5)</a>, Second Proviso, of

the Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_327">Salt Act</a>, 1944; and Section 9 of the
Kerala Sales Tax Act. We should not be understood to have
construed the said provisions, but only have referred to them
to state the legislative practice. Consistent with the said
practice, Rule 5(1)(i) of the Rules uses the same expression.
When the said Rule says “excise duty paid in respect of the
goods”, the excise duty referred to is the excise duty paid
under <a href="/doc/1826275/" id="a_328">Section 3(1)</a>, read with the Schedule of the Central
Excises and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_329">Salt Act</a>, 1944 (1 of 1944). Under the said
Section, read with the Schedule, excise duty is levied on the
goods described in the Schedule. Therefore, when Rule
5(1)(i) of the Rules refers to the duty paid in respect of the
goods to the Central Government, it necessarily refers to the
duty paid on the goods mentioned in the Schedule. As the
duty exempted from the gross turnover is the duty so paid

            under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_330">Central Act</a>, read with the Schedule, the
            expression “in respect of” in the context can only mean
            excise duty paid on goods. In our view, the expression “in
            respect of the goods” in Rule 5(1)(i) of the Rules means only
            “on the goods”. Even if the word “attributable” is substituted
            for the words “in respect of”, the result will not be different,
            for the duty paid shall be attributable to the goods. If it was
            paid on the raw material it can be attributable only to raw
            material and not to the goods. We, therefore, hold that only
            excise duty paid on the goods sold by the assessee is
            deductible from the gross turnover under Rule 5(1)(i) of the
            Rules.”

         rightly observed that the CIT(A) had erred in coming to the

    subject matter of explanation 4, explanation 4 not expanding the scope

    of the definition of royalty contained in explanation 2, which does not

    contain the aforesaid expression. A reference to the Memorandum

    explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill 2012 set out hereinabove,

    would make it clear that the expression “as mentioned in Explanation 2”

    in sub-para (i) of the aforesaid Memorandum shows that explanation 4

    was inserted retrospectively to expand the scope of explanation 2(v).
</p>
<p id="p_361">    In any case, explanation 2(v) contains the expression, “the transfer of

    all or any rights” which is an expression that would subsume “any right,

    property or information” and is wider than the expression “any right,

    property or information”. It is therefore difficult to accept Shri

    Pardiwala’s argument that explanation 4 does not expand the scope of

    the expression “royalty” as contained in explanation 2 to <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_366">section 9(1)(vi)</a>

    of the Income Tax Act.
</p>
<p id="p_362">77. It is equally difficult to accept the learned Additional Solicitor General’s

    submission that explanation 4 to <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_367">section 9(1)(vi)</a>of the Income Tax Act

    is clarificatory of the position as it always stood, since 01.06.1976, for

    which he strongly relied upon CBDT Circular No. 152 dated 27.11.1974.
</p>
<p id="p_363">    Quite obviously, such a circular cannot apply as it would then be

</p>
<p id="p_364">    Secondly, insofar as <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_371">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax Act relates to

    computer software, explanation 3 thereof, refers to “computer software”

    for the first time with effect from 01.04.1991, when it was introduced,

    which was then amended vide the <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_372">Finance Act</a> 2000. Quite clearly,

    explanation 4 cannot apply to any right for the use of or the right to use

    computer software even before the term “computer software” was

    inserted in the statute. Likewise, even qua <a href="/doc/797096/" id="a_373">section 2(o)</a> of the Copyright

    Act, the term “computer software” was introduced for the first time in the

    definition of a literary work, and defined under <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_374">section 2(ffc)</a> only in 1994

    (vide Act 38 of 1994).
</p>
<p id="p_365">78. Furthermore, it is equally ludicrous for the aforesaid amendment which

    also inserted explanation 6 to <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_375">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax Act, to

    apply with effect from 01.06.1976, when technology relating to

    these reasons, it is clear that explanation 4 to <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_377">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the

    Income Tax Act is not clarificatory of the position as of 01.06.1976, but

<p id="p_366">79. The learned Additional Solicitor General then relied upon the Finance

    Minister’s statement made before the Lok Sabha on 07.09.1990, which

    allowed lump sum payments to be made without the deduction of tax at

    source under <a href="/doc/260037/" id="a_379">section 195(1)</a> of the Income Tax Act and did away with

    the dual levy, both by way of customs duty and income tax, on royalty

    payments for the licensing of software. This statement, again, in no

    manner furthers the case of the Revenue that explanation 4 is merely

    clarificatory of the legal position as it always stood. Likewise,

    Notification No. 21/2012 dated 13.06.2012, which deals with <a href="/doc/503717/" id="a_380">section

    194J</a> of the Income Tax Act, does no more than providing that a

    transferee is exempt from deducting TDS under <a href="/doc/503717/" id="a_381">section 194J</a> when TDS

    has already been deducted under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_382">section 195</a> on the payment made in

    the previous transfer of the same software which the transferee

    acquires without any modification. In any case, this notification being

    issued on 13.06.2012, i.e., after explanation 4 was inserted vide the

    <a href="/doc/104566/" id="a_383">Finance Act</a> 2012, it would not assist the Revenue in asserting that

    explanation 4 clarifies the legal position as it always stood.

    by explanation 4 of <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_384">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax Act, the persons

    liable to deduct TDS under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_385">section 195</a> of the Income Tax Act ought to

    have deducted tax at source on the footing that explanation 4 existed

    on the statute book with effect from 1976. We have, therefore, to

    examine as to whether persons liable to deduct TDS under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_386">section 195</a>

    of the Income Tax Act can be held liable to deduct such sums at a time

    when explanation 4 was factually not on the statute book, all deductions

<p id="p_368">81. This question is answered by two latin maxims, lex non cogit ad

    impossibilia, i.e., the law does not demand the impossible and

    impotentia excusat legem, i.e., when there is a disability that makes it

    impossible to obey the law, the alleged disobedience of the law is

    excused. Recently, in the judgment in Arjun Panditrao Khotkar v.
</p>
<p id="p_369">    Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal, (2020) 7 SCC 1 delivered by this

    Court, this Court applied the said maxims in the context of the

    requirement of a certificate to produce evidence by way of electronic

    record under <a href="/doc/35556724/" id="a_387">section 65B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 and held that

unable to obtain it for reasons beyond his control, the respondent in the

facts of the case, was relieved of the mandatory obligation to furnish a

certificate. In so holding, this Court referred to previous judgments

dealing with the doctrine of impossibility and concluded as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_129">    “47. However, a caveat must be entered here. The facts of
    the present case show that despite all efforts made by the
    respondents, both through the High Court and otherwise, to
    get the requisite certificate under <a href="/doc/112805442/" id="a_388">Section 65-B(4)</a> of the
    Evidence Act from the authorities concerned, yet the
    authorities concerned wilfully refused, on some pretext or
    the other, to give such certificate. In a fact-circumstance
    where the requisite certificate has been applied for from the
    person or the authority concerned, and the person or
    authority either refuses to give such certificate, or does not
    reply to such demand, the party asking for such certificate
    can apply to the court for its production under the provisions
    aforementioned of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_389">Evidence Act</a>, CPC or <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_390">CrPC</a>. Once
    such application is made to the court, and the court then
    orders or directs that the requisite certificate be produced by
    a person to whom it sends a summons to produce such
    certificate, the party asking for the certificate has done all
    that he can possibly do to obtain the requisite certificate.</blockquote>
<p id="p_370">    Two Latin maxims become important at this stage. The first
    is lex non cogit ad impossibilia i.e. the law does not demand
    the impossible, and impotentia excusat legem i.e. when
    there is a disability that makes it impossible to obey the law,
    the alleged disobedience of the law is excused. This was
    well put by this Court in Presidential Poll, In re [Presidential
    Poll, In re, (1974) 2 SCC 33] as follows : (SCC pp. 49-50,
    paras 14-15)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_164">                                                                       115</span>
“14. If the completion of election before the
expiration of the term is not possible because of the
death of the prospective candidate it is apparent
that the election has commenced before the
expiration of the term but completion before the
expiration of the term is rendered impossible by an
act beyond the control of human agency. The
necessity for completing the election before the
expiration of the term is enjoined by the
Constitution in public and State interest to see that
the governance of the country is not paralysed by
non-compliance with the provision that there shall
be a President of India.

election to fill the vacancy in the office of the
President before the expiration of the term of office
in the case of death of a candidate as may appear
from <a href="/doc/1849490/" id="a_391">Section 7</a> of the 1952 Act does not rob <a href="/doc/1682236/" id="a_392">Article
62(1)</a> of its mandatory character. The maxim of law
impotentia excusat legem is intimately connected
with another maxim of law lex non cogit ad
impossibilia. Impotentia excusat legem is that
when there is a necessary or invincible disability to
perform the mandatory part of the law that
impotentia excuses. The law does not compel one
to do that which one cannot possibly perform.
</p><p id="p_372">‘Where the law creates a duty or charge, and the
party is disabled to perform it, without any default
in him, and has no remedy over it, there the law will
in general excuse him.’ Therefore, when it appears
that the performance of the formalities prescribed
by a statute has been rendered impossible by
circumstances over which the persons interested
had no control, like the act of God, the

    circumstances will be taken as a valid excuse.
    Where the act of God prevents the compliance with
    the words of a statute, the statutory provision is not
    denuded of its mandatory character because of
    supervening impossibility caused by the act of
    God. (See Broom&#x27;s Legal Maxims, 10th Edn. at pp.
    162-63 and Craies on Statute Law, 6th Edn. at p.
</p><p id="p_373">    268.)”


It is important to note that the provision in question in
Presidential Poll, In re [Presidential Poll, In re, (1974) 2 SCC
33] was also mandatory, which could not be satisfied owing
to an act of God, in the facts of that case. These maxims
have been applied by this Court in different situations in
other election cases — See Chandra Kishore Jha v. Mahavir
Prasad [Chandra Kishore Jha v. Mahavir Prasad, (1999) 8
SCC 266] (at paras 17 and 21); Special Reference No. 1 of
2002, In re (Gujarat Assembly Election matter) [Special
Reference No. 1 of 2002, In re (Gujarat Assembly Election
matter), (2002) 8 SCC 237] (at paras 130 and 151) and <a href="/doc/1985739/" id="a_393">Raj

other contexts by this Court. In Cochin State Power &amp; Light
Corpn. Ltd. v. State of Kerala [Cochin State Power &amp; Light
Corpn. Ltd. v. State of Kerala, (1965) 3 SCR 187 : AIR 1965

of purchasing an undertaking by the State Electricity Board
under <a href="/doc/115820892/" id="a_394">Section 6(4)</a> of the Electricity Act, 1910. The provision
required a notice of at least 18 months before the expiry of
the relevant period to be given by such State Electricity
Board to the State Government. Since this mandatory
provision was impossible of compliance, it was held that the

State Electricity Board was excused from giving such notice,
as follows : (1965) 3 SCR 187, at p. 193 : AIR pp. 1691-92,
para 8

    “8. Sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_395">Section 6</a> expressly vests in
    the State Electricity Board the option of purchase
    on the expiry of the relevant period specified in the
    licence. But the State Government claims that
    under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_396">Section 6</a> it is now vested
    with the option. Now, under sub-section (2) of
    <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_397">Section 6</a>, the State Government would be vested
    with the option only ‘where a State Electricity Board
    has not been constituted, or if constituted, does not
    elect to purchase the undertaking’. It is common
    case that the State Electricity Board was duly
    constituted. But the State Government claims that
    the State Electricity Board did not elect to purchase
    the undertaking. For this purpose, the State
    Government relies upon the deeming provisions of
    sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_398">Section 6</a>, and contends that as
    the Board did not send to the State Government
    any intimation in writing of its intention to exercise
    the option as required by the sub-section, the
    Board must be deemed to have elected not to
    purchase the undertaking. Now, the effect of sub-
    section (4) read with sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_399">Section 6</a> is
    that on failure of the Board to give the notice
    prescribed by sub-section (4), the option vested in
    the Board under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_400">Section 6</a> was
    liable to be divested. Sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_401">Section 6</a>
    imposed upon the Board the duty of giving after the
    coming into force of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_402">Section 6</a> a notice in writing of
    its intention to exercise the option at least 18
    months before the expiry of the relevant period.
    <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_403">Section 6</a> came into force on 5-9-1959, and the

    relevant period expired on 3-12-1960. In the
    circumstances, the giving of the requisite notice of
    18 months in respect of the option of purchase on
    the expiry of 2-12-1960, was impossible from the
    very commencement of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_404">Section 6</a>. The
    performance of this impossible duty must be
    excused in accordance with the maxim, lex non
    cogitia ad impossibilia (the law does not compel the
    doing of impossibilities), and sub-section (4) of
    <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_405">Section 6</a> must be construed as not being
    applicable to a case where compliance with it is
    impossible. We must, therefore, hold that the State
    Electricity Board was not required to give the notice
    under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_406">Section 6</a> in respect of its
    option of purchase on the expiry of 25 years. It
    must follow that the Board cannot be deemed to
    have elected not to purchase the undertaking
    under sub-section (4) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_407">Section 6</a>. By the notice
    served upon the appellant, the Board duly elected
    to purchase the undertaking on the expiry of 25
    years. Consequently, the State Government never
    became vested with the option of purchasing the
    undertaking under sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/191105/" id="a_408">Section 6</a>.
    The State Government must, therefore, be
    restrained from taking further action under its
    notice, Ext. G, dated 20-11-1959.”

prejudice no man. In Broom&#x27;s Legal Maxims, 10th
Edn., 1939 at p. 73 this maxim is explained that this
maxim was founded upon justice and good sense;
and afforded a safe and certain guide for the
administration of the law. The above maxim
should, however, be applied with caution. The
other maxim is lex non cogit ad impossibilia
(Broom&#x27;s Legal Maxims, p. 162) — The law does
not compel a man to do that which he cannot
possibly perform. The law itself and the
administration of it, said Sir W. Scott, with
reference to an alleged infraction of the revenue
laws, must yield to that to which everything must
bend, to necessity; the law, in its most positive and
peremptory injunctions, is understood to disclaim,
as it does in its general aphorisms, all intention of
compelling impossibilities, and the administration
of laws must adopt that general exception in the
consideration of all particular cases.

<p id="p_376">7. In this case indisputably during the period from
26-7-1978 to December 1982 there was subsisting
injunction preventing the arbitrators from taking
any steps. Furthermore, as noted before the award
was in the custody of the court, that is to say, 28-1-
1978 till the return of the award to the arbitrators on
24-11-1983, arbitrators or the parties could not
have presented the award for its registration during
that time. The award as we have noted before was
made on 28-11-1977 and before the expiry of the
four months from 28-11-1977, the award was filed
in the court pursuant to the order of the court. It was
argued that the order made by the court directing
the arbitrators to keep the award in the custody of

arbitrator could be compelled to disobey the order
of the court and if in compliance or obedience with
court of doubtful jurisdiction, he could not take back
the award from the custody of the court to take any
further steps for its registration then it cannot be
said that he has failed to get the award registered
as the law required. The aforesaid two legal
maxims — the law does not compel a man to do
that which he cannot possibly perform and an act
of the court shall prejudice no man would, apply
with full vigour in the facts of this case and if that is
the position then the award as we have noted
before was presented before the Sub-Registrar,
Arambagh on 25-11-1983 the very next one day of
getting possession of the award from the court. The
Sub-Registrar pursuant to the order of the High
Court on 24-6-1985 found that the award was
presented within time as the period during which
the judicial proceedings were pending that is to
say, from 28-1-1978 to 24-11-1983 should be
excluded in view of the principle laid down in

the only period which should be excluded was from

this position. 26-7-1978 was the date of the order

         and the case is not covered by <a href="/doc/1551566/" id="a_425">Section 17(2)(ii)</a> of the Act.
         In other words, even after the substitution of Rule 3 with
         effect from 1/4/2001, in the absence of any specific provision
         under the Act, it was open to the assessee not to deduct tax
         at source relating to the accommodation given to the
         employees on the ground that no concession in rent has
         been given to the employees. This contention of the

         the employer after deducting tax at source as per the law
         prevailing on the date of paying the salary, then any
         subsequent      amendment       in   law    brought      about
         retrospectively cannot require the employer to deduct tax at
         source for the past period, because the salary for that period
         has already been paid. Consequently, the employer cannot
         be made liable for the consequences set out in <a href="/doc/726238/" id="a_427">Section 201</a>

        We may, in this connection, refer to some passages from the
        classic treatise of Copinger and Skone James on Copyright
        (1999 Edn):
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_135">             “Copyright gives the owner of the copyright in a

             right to copy the work itself and also to use the work
             in other ways protected under the law”.(p. 26)

        Copyright is often described as a negative right. This idea is
        conveyed by Copinger in the following words:</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_136">             “Copyright, however, does not essentially mean a
             right to do something, but rather a right to restrict
             others from doing certain acts, and, when copyright
             is referred to as “an exclusive right,” the emphasis
             is on the word ‘exclusive’. Thus, the 1988 Act,

    whilst not defining “copyright” otherwise than as a
    property right, which is transmissible as personal
    or moveable property, provides that the owner of
    the copyright in a work has the exclusive right to do
    the acts restricted by the copyright in a work of that
    description specified in the 1988 Act. [Copyright,
    Designs and <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_437">Patents Act</a>, 1988 of UK.]” (p. 27)

The following passage also deserves notice:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_137">    “It is important to recognize that ownership of
    copyright in a work is different from the ownership
    of the physical material in which the copyright work
    may happen to be embodied. Just as the owner of
    the physical material on which a copyright work is
    first recorded is not necessarily the first owner of
    the copyright, so the transfer of title to the original
    physical material does not by itself operate to
    transfer the title to the copyright… Thus, to take an
    obvious example, the purchaser of a book or video
    recording becomes the owner of the physical
    article but he does not thereby become the owner
    of any part of the copyright in the works reproduced
    in it. The copyright in the literary work remains with
    the copyright owner, who enjoys and is entitled to
    enforce all the exclusive rights of copying,
    publication, adaptation, sale, rental and so on
    conferred on him by copyright law. The purchaser
    does not acquire by his purchase any right, either
    by way of assignment or licence, to exercise any of
    those exclusive rights. (p. 217)”

Referring to the position of a licensee and an exclusive
licensee, the legal position was stated as follows at p. 310:

<blockquote id="blockquote_138">             “A mere licence from the copyright owner confers

             name, unless coupled with the grant of some other
             interest, for example, the right to take property

             a promise not to do, or give anyone else
             permission to do that thing, gives the licensee no
             right to sue in his own name for infringement nor
             any other proprietary interest. In copyright law this
             general rule is altered by statute in the case of
             exclusive licences which comply with prescribed
             formalities. The 1988 Act confers on such a

none of the rights vesting in the applicant as copyright-
holder can be claimed or enjoyed by the licensee and that
they will remain intact and are preserved. The entire tenor of
the Agreement and the various stipulations contained
therein make it clear that no rights in derogation of the
applicant&#x27;s exclusive rights in relation to the copyright have
been conferred on the licensee i.e., the end-user or VAR.
The core of the transaction is to authorize the end-user to
have access to and make use of the licensed software
products over which the applicant has exclusive copyright,
without giving any scope for dealing with them any further.
</p>
<p id="p_389">Passing on a right to use and facilitating the use of a product
for which the owner has a copyright is not the same thing as
transferring or assigning rights in relation to the copyright.
The enjoyment of some or all the rights which the copyright
owner has, is necessary to trigger the royalty definition.
Viewed from this angle, a non-exclusive and non-
transferable licence enabling the use of a copyrighted
product cannot be construed as an authority to enjoy any or
all of the enumerated rights ingrained in a copyright. Where
the purpose of the licence or the transaction is only to
establish access to the copyrighted product for internal
business purpose, it would not be legally correct to state that
the copyright itself has been transferred to any extent. It
does not make any difference even if the computer
programme passed on to the user is a highly specialized
one. The parting of intellectual property rights inherent in
and attached to the software product in favour of the
licencee/customer is what is contemplated by the definition
clause in the Act as well as the Treaty. As observed earlier,
those rights are incorporated in <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_440">Section 14</a>. Merely
authorizing or enabling a customer to have the benefit of
data or instructions contained therein without any further
right to deal with them independently does not, in our view,

amount to transfer of rights in relation to copyright or
conferment of the right of using the copyright. However,
where, for example, the owner of copyright over a literary
work grants an exclusive license to make out copies and
distribute them within a specified territory, the grantee will
practically step into the shoes of the owner/grantor and he
enjoys the copyright to the extent of its grant to the exclusion
of others. As the right attached to copyright is conveyed to
such licencee, he has the authority to commercially deal with
it. In case of infringement of copyright, he can maintain a suit
to prevent it. Different considerations will arise if the grant is
non-exclusive, that too confined to the user purely for in-
house or internal purpose. The transfer of rights in or over
copyright or the conferment of the right of use of copyright
implies that the transferee/licencee should acquire rights -
either in entirety or partially co-extensive with the
owner/transferor who divests himself of the rights he
possesses pro tanto. That is what, in our view, follows from
the language employed in the definition of ‘royalty’ read with
the provisions of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_441">Copyright Act</a>, viz., <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_442">Section 14</a> and other
complementary provisions.
</p>
<p id="p_390">We may refer to one more aspect here. In the definition of
royalty under the Act, the phrase “including the granting of a
licence” is found. That does not mean that even a non-
exclusive licence permitting user for in-house purpose would
be covered by that expression. Any and every licence is not
what is contemplated. It should take colour from the
preceding expression “transfer of rights in respect of
copyright”. Apparently, grant of ‘licence’ has been referred
to in the definition to dispel the possible controversy [that a]
licence — whatever be its nature, can be characterized as
transfer.”

</p><p id="p_391">90. The AAR then concluded:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_140">        “As stated in Copinger&#x27;s treatise on Copyright, “the exclusive
        right to prevent copying or reproduction of a work is the most
        fundamental and historically oldest right of a copyright
        owner”. We do not think that such a right has been passed
        on to the end-user by permitting him to download the
        computer programme and storing it in the computer for his
        own use. The copying/reproduction or storage is only
        incidental to the facility extended to the customer to make
        use of the copyrighted product for his internal business
        purpose. As admitted by the Revenue&#x27;s representative, that
        process is necessary to make the programme functional and
        to have access to it and is qualitatively different from the right
        contemplated by the said provision because it is only integral
        to the use of copyrighted product. Apart from such incidental
        facility, the customer has no right to deal with the product
        just as the owner would be in a position to do. In so far as
        the licensed material reproduced or stored is confined to the
        four corners of its business establishment, that too on a non-</blockquote>
<p id="p_392">        exclusive basis, the right referred to in sub-clause (i) of
        <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_443">Section 14(a)</a> would be wholly out of place. Otherwise, in
        respect of even off the shelf software available in the market,
        it can be very well said that the right of reproduction which
        is a facet of copyright vested with the owner is passed on to
        the customer. Such an inference leads to unintended and
        irrational results. We may in this context refer to Section
        52(aa) of C.R. Act (extracted supra) which makes it clear
        that “the making of copies or adaptation” of a computer
        program by the lawful possessor of a copy of such program,
        from such copy (i) in order to utilize the computer program,
        for the purpose for which it was supplied or (ii) to make back
        up copies purely as a temporary protection against loss,
        destruction, or damage in order to utilize the computer
        program for the purpose of which it was supplied” will not
        constitute infringement of copyright. Consequently,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_180">                                                                             131</span>
customization or adaptation, irrespective of the degree, will
not constitute ‘infringement’ as long as it is to ensure the
utilization of the computer program for the purpose for which
it was supplied. Once there is no infringement, it is not
possible to hold that there is transfer or licensing of
‘copyright’ as defined in CR Act and as understood in
common law. This is because, as pointed out earlier,
copyright is a negative right in the sense that it is a right
prohibiting someone else to do an act, without authorization
of the same, by the owner.
</p>
<p id="p_393">It seems to us that reproduction and adaptation envisaged
by <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_444">Section 14(a)(i)</a> and (vi) can contextually mean only
reproduction and adaptation for the purpose of commercial
exploitation. Copyright being a negative right (in the sense
explained in para 9 supra), it would only be appropriate and
proper to test it in terms of infringement. What has been
excluded under<a href="/doc/134990/" id="a_445"> S. 52(aa)</a> is not commercial exploitation, but
only utilizing the copyrighted product for one&#x27;s own use. The
exclusion should be given due meaning and effect;
otherwise, <a href="/doc/134990/" id="a_446">Section 52(aa)</a> will be practically redundant. In
fact, as the law now stands, the owner need not necessarily
grant licence for mere reproduction or adaptation of work for
one&#x27;s own use. Even without such licence, the buyer of
product cannot be said to have infringed the owner&#x27;s
copyright. When the infringement is ruled out, it would be
difficult to reach the conclusion that the buyer/licensee of
product has acquired a copyright therein.

         right to sell or offer for sale the applicant&#x27;s software product
         has been conferred on the VAR and therefore such authority

         copyright in view of cl. (b)(ii) of <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_449">Section 14</a>. We are unable to
         sustain this contention. First of all, this contention of
         Revenue goes contrary to its stand that the product was
         licensed but not sold. Be that as it may, even for other
         reasons, the contention has to be rejected. VAR has not
         been given an independent right to sell or offer for sale the
         software products of the applicant to the end-users. What
         the VAR does in the course of carrying out its marketing
         function is to canvass for orders, collect the purchase order
         from the interested customer and forward that offer to the
         applicant. It is the applicant that accepts or rejects that offer.</blockquote>

         transaction emanating from the order of the end-user
         followed up by back to back order of VAR is finalized by the
         applicant and unless the purchase order is accepted by the
         applicant, the transaction does not materialize. The VAR&#x27;s

        account of supplies of software products to the end-
        customers (from whom the licence fee is collected and
        appropriated by VAR) does not result in income in the nature

    referring to and relying upon the determination in Dassault (AAR)

    (supra), the AAR concluded that the amount payable to the applicant

    [“Citrix Systems (AAR)”], which ruling is impugned in C.A. No.

    the AAR in the earlier two cases, namely Dassault (AAR) (supra) and

    Geoquest (AAR) (supra), arose. The case concerned an applicant

    incorporated in Australia that had entered into a distribution agreement

    with an independent Indian company engaged in the business of

    distribution of computer software and hardware. “Ingram” was

    appointed as the non-exclusive distributor of the products of the

    applicant in India. This time, the AAR, after referring to the provisions of

    the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_455">Income Tax Act</a> and the Convention between the Government of

     Taxes on Income,39 [“India-Australia DTAA”], together with the

     provisions of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_456">Copyright Act</a>, arrived at a conclusion diametrically

     opposite to that contained in the rulings in Dassault (AAR) (supra) and

     Geoquest (AAR) (supra). The AAR held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_144">         “Thus, a reference to the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_457">Copyright Act</a> indicates that use of
         a copyright either by an owner or a licensee, would not be
         an infringement of a copyright. The transfer of ownership
         can be by an assignment to another of the copyright either
         wholly or partially, either generally or with special limitations
         and either for the whole term of the copyright or any part
         thereof. Similarly, a license can be granted by the owner of
         the copyright of any interest in the right. An exclusive right
         also can be granted excluding even oneself from the right to
         use the copyright owned. So, a transgression of the
         limitations of an assignment or of a license would prime facie
         be an infringement of the copyright and invite the
         consequences provided for under the Act. Similarly, the act
         of taking copies or act of adaptation will not be an
         infringement only if it is done by a lawful possessor of a copy
         of the computer programme. A lawful possessor can only be
         an assignee, an exclusive licensee or a licensee of the
         programme. When he acquires a computer programme, he
         also gets the right to use that programme to a limited extent.
         This in our view, is on the basis that in so acquiring the
         computer programme, he has also got a right, absolute or
         limited to use the copyright.</blockquote>

         an agent. When he sells or licenses the software for use, he
         is also selling or licensing the right to use the copyright
         embedded therein. If a software is used without being
         lawfully acquired either by purchase or by license, that would
         amount to an infringement of the copyright obviously
         because of the copyright embedded in the software. The
         software is a literary work and clearly the copyright of the
         creator over the software is an important and commercially
         valuable right. So, whenever a software is assigned or
         licensed for use, there is involved an assignment of the right
         to use the embedded copyright in the software or a license
         to use the embedded copyright, the Intellectual Property
         Right in the software. Therefore, it appears to us that it is not
         possible to divorce the software from the Intellectual
         Property Right of the creator of the software embedded
         therein. The amendment to <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_458">Section 14(1)(b)</a> of the Copyright
         Act, by Act 49 of 1999, clarifying that in the case of a
         computer programme, copyright means the right to sell or
         give on commercial rental or offer for sale or commercial
         rental any copy of the computer programme, seems to be
         significant. This addition would suggest that even the right
         to sell or give on rental, would amount to a copyright and
         would be a right to be dealt with as a copyright.”

    stating:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_145">         “In Dassault (AAR 821 of 2009), it was noticed that the core
         of the transaction in that case was to authorise the end-user

<p id="p_405">        The reasoning or the line of reasoning in Factset on
        applicability of the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_459">Copyright Act</a>, in this context, was
        followed. It was also noticed that in Tata Consultancy
        Services (271 ITR 401), the Supreme Court had held that “a
        software programme may consist of various commands
        which enable the computer to perform a designated task.
        The copyright in that programme may remain with the
        originator of the programme. But, the moment copies are
        made and marketed it becomes goods which are susceptible
        to sales-tax.” The Supreme Court was speaking in the
        context of the <a href="/doc/1645178/" id="a_460">Sales-tax Act</a>. The Court had no occasion to
        consider what was involved in the sale of a software
        programme. The Court had no occasion to consider what all
        are the rights that pass on to the grantee when a software
        programme is transferred or licensed to him. It was
        concluded in Dassault, that in the absence of an
        independent right to conclude a sale or offer for sale, <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_461">section
        14</a> could not be invoked to bring the case within <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_462">Section
        9(1)(vi)</a> of the Act by invoking sub-clause (ii) of Clause (b) of
        that section. It was concluded that no right to use the
        copyright as such has been conferred on the licensee. In our
        view whenever software is transferred or licensed for use, it
        takes within it the copyright embedded in the software and
        the one cannot be divorced from the other.”
                                                                     (page 17)

</p><p id="p_406">96. The AAR then reasoned that the fact that a licence had been granted

    would be sufficient to conclude that there was a transfer of copyright,

    and that there was no justification for the use of the doctrine of noscitur

    a sociis to confine the transfer by way of a licence to only include a

    licence which transferred rights in respect of copyright, by referring to

    explanation 2 to <a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_463">section 9(1)(vi)</a> of the Income Tax Act. It then held:

<p id="p_407">         “Considerable arguments are raised on the so-called
         distinction between a copyright and copyrighted articles.
         What is a copyrighted article? It is nothing but an article
         which incorporates the copyright of the owner, the assignee,
         the exclusive licensee or the licencee. So, when a
         copyrighted article is permitted or licensed to be used for a
         fee, the permission involves not only the physical or
         electronic manifestation of a programme, but also the use of
         or the right to use the copyright embedded therein. That
         apart, the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_464">Copyright Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_465">Income-tax Act</a> or the DTAC
         does not use the expression ‘copyrighted article’, which
         could have been used if the intention was as claimed by the
         applicant. In the circumstances, the distinction sought to be
         made appears to be illusory.”
                                                                    (page 19)

</p><p id="p_408">97. This ruling of the AAR flies in the face of certain principles. When, under

    a non-exclusive licence, an end-user gets the right to use computer

    software in the form of a CD, the end-user only receives a right to use

    the software and nothing more. The end-user does not get any of the

    rights that the owner continues to retain under <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_466">section 14(b)</a> of the

    Copyright Act read with sub-section (a)(i)-(vii) thereof. Thus, the

    conclusion that when computer software is licensed for use under an

    EULA, what is also licensed is the right to use the copyright embedded

    therein, is wholly incorrect. The licence for the use of a product under

    an EULA cannot be construed as the licence spoken of in <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_467">section 30</a> of

    the Copyright Act, as such EULA only imposes restrictive conditions

    Copinger and Skone James on Copyright (14th Edition) (1999) referred

    to in Dassault (AAR) (supra) makes it clear that the ownership of

    copyright in a work is different from the ownership of the physical

    material in which the copyrighted work may happen to be embedded.

<p id="p_410">    This important passage correctly relied upon by the AAR in the

    Dassault (AAR) (supra) ruling has been completely missed.

<p id="p_411">99. Further, it is difficult to understand the reasoning contained in this

    determination. It is self-contradictory when it says that the DTAA which

    defines “royalties” must somehow be given a go-bye, as this term must

    be understood as it is commonly understood. It is also difficult to

    understand the holding that the AAR need not be constrained by the

    definition of “copyright” contained in <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_470">section 14</a> of the Copyright Act,

    when construing a DTAA, when we have already seen how <a href="/doc/1454107/" id="a_471">section 16</a>

    of the Copyright Act makes it clear that no person shall be entitled to

    ignored if it is wider and less beneficial to the assessee than the

<p id="p_413">    Further, the expression “copyright” has to be understood in the context

    of the statute which deals with it, it being accepted that municipal laws

    determination of the AAR in Citrix Systems (AAR) (supra) does not

transaction of purchase of the book or prerecorded music

the Legislature in its wisdom, has treated the literary work

the Act is broader than the definition of “royalty” under the
DTAA as the right that is transferred in the present case is
the transfer of copyright including the right to make copy of
software for internal business, and payment made in that
regard would constitute “royalty” for imparting of any
information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or

         not give rise to any “income” taxable in India and wherefore,

used the words “in respect of”, the intention is clear and
manifest. The said phrase being capable of a broader
meaning, the same is used in the section to bring within the
tax net all the incomes from the transfer of all or any of the
rights in respect of a copyright. In a taxing statute provisions
enacted to prevent tax evasion are to be given a liberal
construction to effectuate the purpose of suppressing tax
evasion, although provisions imposing a charge are
construed strictly there being no a priori liability to pay a tax
and the purpose of charging section being only to levy a
charge on persons and activities brought within its clear
terms. Therefore, the specific words used in a taxing statute,
charging tax cannot be ignored. It is not the consideration
for transfer of all or any of the rights in the copyright. Without
transferring a right in the copyright it is possible to receive
consideration for the use of the intellectual property for
which the owner possesses a copyright. Ultimately, the
consideration paid is for the usefulness of the material object
in respect of which there exists a copyright. Therefore, the
intention was not to exclude the consideration paid for the
use of such material object which is popularly called as
copyrighted article. Even in respect of a copyrighted article
the same is transferred, no doubt the right in the copyright is
not transferred, but a right in respect of a copyright contained
in the copyrighted article is transferred. Therefore, the
Parliament thought it fit to use the phrase “in respect of” as
contra distinct from the word “in” copyright. The meaning is
clear, intention is clear, there is no ambiguity. Therefore,
there is no scope for interpretation of this expressed term
inasmuch as in the context in which it is used in the
provision. Any other interpretation would lead to the
aforesaid provision becoming otiose.”

         legislature advisedly used the word &#x27;in respect of a copyright&#x27;
         it cannot be construed as a right in the copyright and assign
         the meaning assigned in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_495">Copyright Act</a> to the second
         explanation. The language in Explanation (2) explicitly
         makes it clear for the purpose of clause (vi) of sub-section
         (1) of <a href="/doc/1369261/" id="a_496">section 9</a> royalty means consideration for transfer of
         all or any rights including the granting of a licence in respect
         of any copyright, literary, artistic or scientific work.
         Therefore, the word exclusive right used in <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_497">section 14</a> of the
         Act do not fit into the meaning of the word &#x27;royalty&#x27; in
         Explanation 2 because royalty means the consideration for
         the transfer of all or any rights including the granting of a
         licence which is certainly not an exclusive right or transfer of
         all rights in the copyright or literary work. Payments made
         for the acquisition of partial rights in the copyright without the
         transfer fully alienating the copyright rights will represent a
         royalty where the consideration is for granting of lights to use
         the program[m]e in a manner that would, without such
         license, constitute an infringement of copyright. In these
         circumstances, the payments are for the right to use the
         copyright in the program i.e., to exploit the rights that would
         otherwise be the sole prerogative of the copyright holder.
         Therefore, to constitute royalty under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_498">Income-tax Act</a> it
         is not necessary that there should be transfer of exclusive
         right in copyright, it is sufficient if there is transfer of any
         interest in the right and also a licence and consideration paid
         for grant of a licence constitutes royalty for the purpose of
         the said clause in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_499">Income-tax Act</a>. It is in this
         background, the discussion whether the payment is for a

</p><p id="p_431">43. A licence is a permission to do something that would
otherwise be unlawful. The question arises, therefore, as to
what legal permission is granted by a software licence. The
answer is, briefly, that in some cases the licence will be a
permission to use confidential information, and in virtually
[...] all cases it will be a permission to copy a copyright work.
If the software has been kept secret by the producer, or only
supplied on conditions of confidentiality and has not been
published too widely, then the software licence will be akin
to a licence of confidential information or know-how. The
owner or licensor of a copyright, has a right to grant
permission to use the software or a computer programme,
in respect of which they have a copyright, without
transferring the right in copyright. It is one of the right[s] of a
copyright owner or licensor. Without such right being
transferred, the end-user has no right to use the software or
computer programme. If he uses it, it amounts to
infringement of copyright. For transfer of such right if
consideration is paid, it is not a consideration for transfer of
a copyright but for use of intellectual property embedded in
the copyright, and therefore it is for transfer of one of those
rights of the owner of the copyright. It is not a right in
copyright but it is in respect of a copyright. When a
copyrighted article is sold also, the end-user gets the right to
use the intellectual property embedded in the copyright and
not a right in the copyright as such. Therefore the mode
adopted or the terminology given is not decisive to decide
the nature of transfer. Ultimately, it is the substance which
has to be looked into.”

    with the provisions of this Act or of any other law for the time being in

    366(12)</a> of the Constitution of India and as defined
    under the said Act are very wide and include all
    types of movable properties, whether those
    properties be tangible or intangible. We are in
    complete agreement with the observations made
    by this Court in Associated Cement Companies
    Ltd. (supra). A software programme may consist of
    various commands which enable the computer to
    perform a designated task. The copyright in that
    programme may remain with the originator of the
    programme. But the moment copies are made and
    marketed, it becomes goods, which are susceptible
    to sales tax. Even intellectual property, once it is
    put on to a media, whether it be in the form of books
    or canvas (In case of painting) or computer discs
    or cassettes, and marketed would become
    “goods”. We see no difference between a sale of a
    software programme on a CD/floppy disc from a
    sale of music on a cassette/CD or a sale of a film
    on a video cassette/CD. In all such cases, the
    intellectual property has been incorporated on a
    media for purposes of transfer. Sale is not just of
    the media which by itself has very little value. The
    software and the media cannot be split up. What
    the buyer purchases and pays for is not the disc or
    the CD. As in the case of paintings or books or
    music or films the buyer is purchasing the
    intellectual property and not the media i.e. the
    paper or cassette or disc or CD. Thus a transaction

    sale of computer software is clearly a sale of
    “goods” within the meaning of the term as defined

    intangible/incorporeal property which is capable of
    abstraction, consumption and use and which can

    these attributes.”

In Advent Systems Ltd. v. Unisys Corpn, 925 F. 2d 670 (3rd
Cir. 1991), relied on by Mr. Sorabjee, the court was
concerned with interpretation of uniform civil code which
“applied to transactions in goods”. The goods therein were
defined as “all things (including specially manufactured
goods) which are moveable at the time of the identification

clear that a computer programme is to be regarded as a

the cellular operator, by making such payment, obtains all or
any of the copyright rights of such literary work. In the

</blockquote><p id="p_452">This issue really is the key to the entire controversy
and we may now proceed to address this issue.
</p>
<p id="p_453">156. We must look into the meaning of the word
“copyright” as given in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_536">Copyright Act</a>, 1957.
<a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_537">Section 14</a> of this Act defines “Copyright” as “the
exclusive right subject to the provisions of this Act,
to do or authorize the doing of any of the following
acts in respect of a work or any substantial part
thereof [ … ]
It is clear from the above definition that a computer
programme mentioned in Clause (b) of the section
has all the rights mentioned in Clause (a) and in
addition also the right to sell or give on commercial
rental or offer for sale or for commercial rental any
copy of the computer programme. This additional
right was substituted w.e.f. 15.1.2000. The
difference between the earlier provision and the
present one is not of any relevance. What is to be
noted is that the right mentioned in Sub-clause (ii)
of Clause (b) of <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_538">Section 14</a> is available only to the
owner of the computer programme. It follows that if
any of the cellular operators does not have any of
the rights mentioned in Clauses (a) and (b) of
<a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_539">Section 14</a>, it would mean that it does not have any
right in a copyright. In that case, the payment made
by the cellular operator cannot be characterized as



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_214">                                                         159</span>
royalty either under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_540">Income-tax Act</a> or under
the DTAA. The question, therefore, to be answered
is whether any of the operators can exercise any of
the rights mentioned in the above provisions with
reference to the software supplied by the
Assessee.
</p>

<p id="p_454">157. We may first look at the supply contract itself
to find out what JTM, one of the cellular operators,
can rightfully do with reference to the software. We
may remind ourselves that JTM is taken as a
representative of all the cellular operators and that
it was common ground before us that all the
contracts with the cellular operators are
substantially the same. Clause 20.1 of the
Agreement, under the title “License”, says that JTM
is granted a non-exclusive restricted license to use
the software and documentation but only for its
own operation and maintenance of the system and
not otherwise. This clause appears to militate
against the position, if it were a copyright, that the
holder of the copyright can do anything with
respect to the same in the public domain. What
JTM is permitted to do is only to use the software
for the purpose of its own operation and
maintenance of the system. There is a clear bar on
the software being used by JTM in the public
domain or for the purpose of commercial
exploitation.
</p>

<p id="p_455">158. Secondly, under the definition of “copyright” in
<a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_541">Section 14</a> of the Copyright Act, the emphasis is
that it is an exclusive right granted to the holder
thereof. This condition is not satisfied in the case
of JTM because the license granted to it by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_215">                                                         160</span>
               Assessee is expressly stated in Clause 20.1 as a
               “non exclusive restricted license”. This means that
               the supplier of the software, namely, the Assessee,
               can supply similar software to any number of
               cellular operators to which JTM can have no
               objection and further all the cellular operators can
               use the software only for the purpose of their own
               operation and maintenance of the system and not
               for any other purpose. The user of the software by
               the cellular operators in the public domain is totally
               prohibited, which is evident from the use of the
               words in <a href="/doc/1501707/" id="a_542">Article 20.1</a> of the agreement, “restricted”
               and “not otherwise”. Thus JTM has a very limited
               right so far as the use of software is concerned. It
               needs no repetition to clarify that JTM has not been
               given any of the seven rights mentioned in Clause
</p><p id="p_456">               (a) of <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_543">Section 14</a> or the additional right mentioned
               in Sub-clause (ii) of Clause (b) of the section which
               relates to a computer programme and, therefore,
               what JTM or any other cellular operator has
               acquired under the agreement is not a copyright
               but is only a copyrighted article.””

              see fit. He has an individual right of exclusive

              them to the public” (underline is ours).”

         The above observations of the author show that one cannot
         have the copyright right without the copyrighted article but at
         the same time just because one has the copyrighted article,
         it does not follow that one has also the copyright in it. Mr.

    does not follow that one has also the copyright in it. It does
    not amount to transfer of all or any right including licence in
    respect of copyright. Copyright or even right to use copyright
    is distinguishable from sale consideration paid for
    “copyrighted” article. This sale consideration is for purchase
    of goods and is not royalty.

<p id="p_462">        89. There is a clear distinction between royalty paid on
        transfer of copyright rights and consideration for transfer of
        copyrighted articles. Right to use a copyrighted article or
        product with the owner retaining his copyright, is not the
        same thing as transferring or assigning rights in relation to
        the copyright. The enjoyment of some or all the rights which
        the copyright owner has, is necessary to invoke the royalty
        definition. Viewed from this angle, a non-exclusive and non-
        transferable licence enabling the use of a copyrighted
        product cannot be construed as an authority to enjoy any or
        all of the enumerated rights ingrained in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_546">Article 12</a> of DTAA.
        Where the purpose of the licence or the transaction is only
        to restrict use of the copyrighted product for internal
        business purpose, it would not be legally correct to state that
        the copyright itself or right to use copyright has been
        transferred to any extent. The parting of intellectual property
        rights inherent in and attached to the software product in
        favour of the licensee/customer is what is contemplated by
        the Treaty. Merely authorizing or enabling a customer to
        have the benefit of data or instructions contained therein
        without any further right to deal with them independently
        does not, amount to transfer of rights in relation to copyright
        or conferment of the right of using the copyright. The transfer
        of rights in or over copyright or the conferment of the right of
        use of copyright implies that the transferee/licensee should
        acquire rights either in entirety or partially co-extensive with
        the owner/transferor who divests himself of the rights he
        possesses pro tanto.”

Therefore, the copyright owner&#x27;s rights are spelt out
comprehensively by this provision. In the context of the facts
of this case, the assessee is the copyright proprietor; it made
available, through one time license fee, the software to its
customers; this software without the hardware which was
sold, is useless. Conversely the hardware sold by the
assessee to its customers is also valueless and cannot be
used without such software. This analysis is to show that
what was conveyed to its customers by the assessee bears
a close resemblance to goods-significantly enough, <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_557">Section
14(1)</a> talks of sale or rental of a “copy”. The question of
conveying or parting with copyright in the software itself
would mean that the copyright proprietor has to assign it,
divesting itself of the title implying that it has divested itself
of all the rights under <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_558">Section 14</a>. This would mean an

<p id="p_470">          In the present case, the facts are closely similar to Ericsson.
          The supplies made (of the software) enabled the use of the
          hardware sold. It was not disputed that without the software,
          hardware use was not possible. The mere fact that separate
          invoicing was done for purchase and other transactions did
          not imply that it was royalty payment. In such cases, the
          nomenclature (of license or some other fee) is indeterminate
          of the true nature. Nor is the circumstance that updates of
          the software are routinely given to the assessee&#x27;s
          customers. These facts do not detract from the nature of the
          transaction, which was supply of software, in the nature of
          articles or goods. This court is also not persuaded with the
          submission that the payments, if not royalty, amounted to
          payments for the use of machinery or equipment. Such a
          submission was never advanced before any of the lower tax
          authorities; moreover, even in Ericsson (supra), a similar
          provision existed in the DTAA between India and Sweden.”

</p><p id="p_471">117. The conclusions that can be derived on a reading of the aforesaid

    judgments are as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_472">   i)    Copyright is an exclusive right, which is negative in nature, being a

         right to restrict others from doing certain acts.
</p>
<p id="p_473">   ii)   Copyright is an intangible, incorporeal right, in the nature of a

         privilege, which is quite independent of any material substance.
</p>
<p id="p_474">         Ownership of copyright in a work is different from the ownership of

       the physical material in which the copyrighted work may happen to

       be embodied. An obvious example is the purchaser of a book or a

       CD/DVD, who becomes the owner of the physical article, but does

       not become the owner of the copyright inherent in the work, such

       copyright remaining exclusively with the owner.
</p>
<p id="p_475">iii)   Parting with copyright entails parting with the right to do any of the

       acts mentioned in <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_561">section 14</a> of the Copyright Act. The transfer of

       the material substance does not, of itself, serve to transfer the

       copyright therein. The transfer of the ownership of the physical

       substance, in which copyright subsists, gives the purchaser the right

       to do with it whatever he pleases, except the right to reproduce the

       same and issue it to the public, unless such copies are already in

       circulation, and the other acts mentioned in <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_562">section 14</a> of the

       Copyright Act.
</p>
<p id="p_476">iv)    A licence from a copyright owner, conferring no proprietary interest

       on the licensee, does not entail parting with any copyright, and is

       different from a licence issued under <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_563">section 30</a> of the Copyright Act,

        with and consequently, no infringement takes place, as is

        recognized by <a href="/doc/257434/" id="a_566">section 52(1)(aa)</a> of the Copyright Act. It makes no

</p><p id="p_482">119. The learned Additional Solicitor General argued that on the facts of

    these cases, the doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion would have

    no application inasmuch as this doctrine is not statutorily recognised in

    <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_569">section 14(b)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act. This being so, since the

    distributors of copyrighted software “license” or sell such computer

    software to end-users, there would be a parting of a right or interest in

    copyright inasmuch as such “license” or sale would then be hit by

    <a href="/doc/98017403/" id="a_570">section 14(b)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act.

                                                             (emphasis supplied)

    After the 1999 Amendment, what is conspicuous by its absence is the

    phrase “regardless of whether such copy has been sold or given on hire

    on earlier occasions”. This is a statutory recognition of the doctrine of

    first sale/principle of exhaustion.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_484">121. The doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion is explained by the

    locus classicus on this subject, Copinger and Skone James on

    Copyright (14th Edition) (1999), as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_167">         “The distribution right: general. One of the acts restricted
         by the copyright in all work is the issue of the original or
         copies of the work to the public, often called the “distribution
         right”. This right is provided for in <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_573">section 18</a> of the 1988 Act.</blockquote>
<p id="p_485">         Infringement of the distribution right is a primary
         infringement under UK law, and so there is no need to prove
         knowledge or reason to believe that the copy in question is
         infringing. Thus it is a powerful weapon against those at the
         top of a chain of distribution. In accordance with general
         principles, <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_574">section 18</a> must be interpreted so far as possible
         in such a way as to conform with relevant EU Directives, in
         this instance, the Software Directive and the Information
         Society Directive. Recent case law of the CJEU has made a
         conforming interpretation more difficult. An important aspect
         of the distribution right is that it is exhausted in relation to a
         particular article by the first sale (and, in the case of the
         Information Society Directive, the first transfer of ownership)
         of that article in the Community by the rightholder or with his
         consent. For the purposes of the Software Directive, certain
         forms of distribution of electronic copies are considered to
         exhaust the distribution right in respect of such copies.”
                                                                 (pages 613-614)

“Exhaustion of the distribution right: tangible objects.
Exhaustion applies to the tangible object into which a
protected work or its copy is incorporated if it has been
placed on the market with the copyright holder’s consent. In
the case of artistic works, the consent of the copyright holder
does not cover the distribution of an object incorporating his
work if that object has been altered after its initial marketing
in such a way that it constitutes a new reproduction of the
work; in such an event, the distribution right is exhausted
only upon the first sale or transfer of ownership of that new
object with the consent of the rightholder. Accordingly,
where a defendant (without the licence of the rightholder)
transferred an image of a work of a famous painter from a
poster onto canvas by physically lifting the ink from the
poster, producing a result closer to the original and leaving
a blank piece of paper behind, and this amounted to copying,
the rightholder’s distribution right had not been exhausted.
</p>
<p id="p_486">Exhaustion: computer programs. Similar considerations
apply in relation to tangible copies of computer programs as
to other works: the first sale of a copy of a program by the
rightholder or with his consent exhausts the distribution right
with the exception of the right to control further rental of the
program or a copy thereof. As to copies made available in
intangible form (e.g. by downloading from a website), for
these purposes the word “sale” is to be given an
autonomous Community interpretation. Where a seller
makes a program available for download under a licence for
an unlimited period in return for a licence fee, the intention
is to make the copy usable by the customer, permanently, in
return for payment of a fee designed to enable the copyright
owner to obtain a remuneration corresponding to the
economic value of the copy of the work. Accordingly, that

question and thus a sale for the purposes of the exhaustion

             available by means of a material medium such as a CD-
             ROM or DVD and if the download is free but the licence is
             granted and paid for separately. It does not matter if the

                   has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasion”

</p><p id="p_491">123. The learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi explained the

    principle of exhaustion as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_169">        “57. The doctrine of exhaustion of copyright enables free
        trade in material objects on which copies of protected works
        have been fixed and put into circulation with the right
        holder&#x27;s consent. The “exhaustion” principle in a sense
        arbitrates the conflict between the right to own a copy of a
        work and the author&#x27;s right to control the distribution of
        copies. Exhaustion is decisive with respect to the priority of
        ownership and the freedom to trade in material carriers on
        the condition that a copy has been legally brought into
        trading. Transfer of ownership of a carrier with a copy of a
        work fixed on it makes it impossible for the owner to derive
        further benefits from the exploitation of a copy that was
        traded with his consent. The exhaustion principle is thus
        termed legitimate by reason of the profits earned for the
        ownership transfer, which should be satisfactory to the
        author if the work is not being exploited in a different
        exploitation field.</blockquote>

<p id="p_492">        58. Exhaustion of rights is linked to the distribution right. The
        right to distribute objects (making them available to the
        public) means that such objects (or the medium on which a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_232">                                                                                 175</span>
         work is fixed) are released by or with the consent of the
         owner as a result of the transfer of ownership. In this way,
         the owner is in control of the distribution of copies since he
         decides the time and the form in which copies are released
         to the public. Content-wise the distribution right are to be
         understood as an opportunity to provide the public with
         copies of a work and put them into circulation, as well as to
         control the way the copies are used. The exhaustion of rights
         principle thus limits the distribution right, by excluding control
         over the use of copies after they have been put into
         circulation for the first time.”
                                                            (emphasis in original)

</p><p id="p_493">124. The learned Single Judge then arrived at the following conclusion:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_170">         “62. … The court is of opinion therefore that the existence or
         applicability of the “exhaustion” principle cannot be inferred
         automatically; it would have to depend on the situation, and
         the structure of the legislation in question.”

</blockquote><p id="p_494">125. Coming to <a href="/doc/120622438/" id="a_581">section 14(a)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act, the learned Single

    Judge then held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_171">         “63. The defendant in this case, accepts that the
         renting/hiring of films carried on by it is without the plaintiffs&#x27;
         license. The Plaintiffs urge that since the importation, for the
         purpose of renting of these cinematographic films has not
         been authorized by them in India, the copies are infringing
         copies. Hence their import would be barred under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_582">Section
         51(b)(iv)</a>. The defendant&#x27;s argument, however, is that the
         copies were legitimately purchased in the course of trade;</blockquote>
<p id="p_495">         they are rental copies, and can be used for purpose of
         renting, in India. He says that the device of zoning, whereby
         the plaintiffs restrict the licensee owner to use it in territories
         other than what is indicated by them, is artificial, and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_233">                                                                               176</span>
unenforceable. Such “long arm” conditions are inapplicable.
Particular reference is made to the explanation to <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_583">Section
14</a>, which describes the content of copyright; it clarifies that
“For the purposes of this section, a copy which has been
sold once shall be deemed to be a copy already in
circulation.” Though attractive, this contention is unfeasible
for more than one reason. The reference to copies in
circulation is in the context of copyright in literary, artistic,
dramatic or musical work, — not computer programme —
(<a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_584">Section 14(a)</a>; the statute enables the copyright owner to
“issue copies of the work to the public not being copies
already in circulation”. But for the explanation, it could
arguably be said that the copyright owner lost his domain, or
right to control the manner of further dealing in copies which
were in circulation. Yet, a careful reading of <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_585">Section 14</a>
would reveal that the content of copyrights in respect of each
nature of work (literary, dramatic, or musical work, on the
one hand, computer programme, artistic work,
cinematograph film, etc on the other) are distinct — evident
from the listing out of such rights, separately, in clauses (a)
to (f) of the section. The reference to “copies in circulation”
has to be therefore, in the context; the phrase is used to limit
the copyright owner&#x27;s right to dictate further use of a literary,
musical and dramatic work (<a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_586">Section 14(a)(ii)</a>). None of the
owners of other classes of work are subject to that limitation.
The restriction of one class of copyright owner, structured in
the statute serves a dual purpose- it limits the owner of that
class of copyright; and at the same time leaves it open to the
copyright owner of other kinds of work, to place such
restrictions.”
                                                (emphasis in original)




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_234">                                                                 177</span>
</p><p id="p_496">126. Contrasting the aforesaid with <a href="/doc/63259693/" id="a_587">section 14(d)(ii)</a> of the Copyright Act, as

    it stood prior to the amendment in 2012, the learned Single Judge then

    went on to hold:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_172">         “64. The second reason is that <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_588">Section 14(1)(d)</a> provides
         that the copyright owner has, in case of cinematographic
         films, the exclusive right to sell or give on hire or offer for
         sale or hire, any copy of the film, regardless of whether such
         copy has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasion. The
         copyright owner, therefore continues to be entitled to
         exercise rights in a particular copy of the film regardless of
         whether it has been sold previously- in express contrast to
         literary works, which are “already in circulation”. This is
         reinforced by <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_589">Section 51(b)(i)</a>, which unambiguously
         provides that copyright in a work shall be infringed if a
         person does anything the exclusive right do which is by the
         Act, conferred upon the owner of the copyright; it is also
         emphasized by <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_590">Section 51(b)(i)</a> which makes for sale or hire,
         or sells or lets for hire, or by way of trade displays or offers
         for sale or hire, any infringing copies of the work. The
         proviso, crucially, exempts from the definition importation of
         a single infringing copy for “the private and domestic use of
         the importer”. As noted earlier, importation of a copy into
         India, in contravention of the Act — for instance, without the
         license, or authorization of the copyright owner, is an
         infringement; such copy is an infringing copy under <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_591">Section
         2(m)</a>.”
                                                          (emphasis in original)

</blockquote><p id="p_497">127. Thus, the Single Judge concluded:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_173">         “67. The express indication in <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_592">Section 14(a)(ii)</a> that a
         copyright owner of literary works cannot exercise domain
         over copies in circulation, shows that exhaustion, if one may



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_235">                                                                           178</span>
        term it, applies only in relation to the class of copyrights in
        <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_593">Section 14(a)</a> and to the extent specified in clause (ii). Thus,
        the copyright owner of a literary work, cannot dictate how
        and under what conditions a copy can be re-sold, once it is
        “circulated”. This limited “exhaustion” negates the
        applicability of the principle in regard to other classes of
        copyrights. Thus, Parliament having intervened in one
        category of copyrights to grant a limited kind of “exhaustion”
        and consciously chosen not to extend it to others, sleight of
        judicial reasoning cannot extend its application…”

</blockquote><p id="p_498">128. However, the learned Additional Solicitor General relied upon the

    judgment of another learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi

    who had occasion to consider the aforesaid doctrine in <a href="/doc/777762/" id="a_594">John Wiley &amp;

    Sons Inc. v. Prabhat Chander Kumar Jain, IA No</a>. 11331/2008 in

    CS(OS) No. 1960/2008 reported in 2010 SCC OnLine Del 2000. The

    case involved the sale of low-priced editions of books meant for the

    Indian market in foreign territories, contrary to the terms prescribed by

    the copyright licence. After referring to a number of authorities, the

    learned Single Judge held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_174">        “68. The legal propositions which emanate from this
        discussion are as under:

            copyright from the rights of the owner of the copyright

            rights.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_176">            b) That the rights of the owner may be broader than the

    exclusive licencee has the independent right to sue for
    infringement of the copyright.
</blockquote><p id="p_499">    c) The rights of the owner and exclusive licencee may
    not be the same and the rights of the exclusive licensee
    shall also be subject to the fetters imposed by the
    agreement between the licensor and licencee.
</p>
<p id="p_500">69. Applying these principles to the present case, it can be
seen that the plaintiff no. 1, 3 and 5 are the worldwide
owners of the books and their copyright as mentioned and
averred in the plaint. The plaintiff nos. 2, 4 and 6 are the
exclusive licensees licensed to publish the said books in
India and other territories. The plaintiffs&#x27; grievance is that
Defendant no. 3 Technischer Overseas Pvt. Ltd. which is a
bookseller in Delhi is purchasing the said Low Price Editions
of the books meant for the Indian market and the territories
defined from the plaintiffs no. 2, 4, 6 and is offering the said
low prize books from the websites www.alibris.com,
www.biblio.com to territories outside the prescribed ones on
the book is infringing the copyright of the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_501">70. The said acts of the defendants of purchase of the books
from the exclusive licensees/licensees are legitimate in
nature and do not hinder or take away anyone&#x27;s rights
including the rights of exclusive licensees/licensee. But once
the said defendant no. 3 offers for sale the books or
publications (which are fettered by territorial restrictions
purchased from exclusive licensees) and puts them into
circulation by selling or offering for sale or by taking orders
for sale to the territories beyond the ones for which
permission has been granted by the owners of the copyright,
the said acts are prima facie tantamount to putting into
circulation or issuance of copies not being in circulation in
other territories where the right to do so is of the owner to
exercise and violates the rights of the owner of the copyright



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_237">                                                                   180</span>

rights of the exclusive licensee. In other words, the said acts
of selling the books from India or offering for sale from India
through website and thereafter accepting the money and
couriering the books to an unauthorized territory will violate
the right of the owners of the copyright which are plaintiff no.
1, 3, 5 to issue the copies to the public not already in
circulation (not of exclusive licensees) and thus will, prima
facie, infringe their copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_502">     xxx xxx xxx

</p><p id="p_503">79. The said position of the licensee is equally applicable in
cases of computer software and is seen in normal course
when anyone purchases the software. Computer software
are mostly licensed and are sold and distributed with their
own conditions and limitations. The purchasers of the said
computer software either from the owner or from the
licensee is aware of the arrangement or license agreement
that the said computer software for instance is meant for
single user or multiple usage. The said purchaser is within
notice while making purchase of the said software and is
thus bound by the said conditions of the license. Once the
said purchaser violates the condition of the said license,
he/she becomes liable for infringement of copyright of the
owner.
</p>
<p id="p_504">80. Likewise is the case with the books in the present matter.
Once the defendants purchase the Low Price Editions books
of the plaintiffs from their exclusive licensee, they are
conscious of the fact that the said editions are subject to
territorial restrictions which are meant to be sold within the
limited territories only. The notice on the book itself gives
knowledge to the purchaser about the said territorial
restriction. The said knowledge is also evident when the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_238">                                                                   181</span>
        defendant themselves offer the same books to the
        customers outside the territories while representing that “it is
        an international edition in paperback. The contents are
        identical to the American Edition, word for word. The ISBN
        differs from the American Edition and the book is in black
        and white but the contents are completely same as the
        American Edition at a great price.””

</p><p id="p_505">129. The learned Single Judge then embarked upon a discussion of the

    doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion, finding the absence of an

    express provision in the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_597">Copyright Act</a> recognising international

    exhaustion, and summed up its impact in the context of the facts before

    him as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_177">        “100. a) At the outset, again, I would like to reiterate the three
        propositions a) the meaning of copyright has been defined
        under <a href="/doc/1129646/" id="a_598">Section 14</a> of the Copyright Act as is clear from the
        opening words of the Section; b) The rights of the owner
        have to be looked into as per <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_599">Section 51</a> of the Act while
        measuring infringement; c) The rights of the owner may be
        broader than that of the licensee. In the present case, the
        first sale has been effected by the exclusive licensees
        plaintiff nos. 2, 4, 6 and their rights are limited and are
        subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by the
        agreement. That being so, the applicability of the first sale
        doctrine qua the sales effected by the exclusive licensee to
        the defendants will at best exhaust the rights of the exclusive
        licensees to complain and not the rights of the owner. The
        right of the owner to complain for remaining infringement in
        unauthorised territories for violation of the permission
        granted and violation of the rights will remain intact. Thus,
        the applicability of first sale doctrine will partially exhaust the

        rights of the licencee and not of the owner of the copyright
        i.e. plaintiff nos. 1, 3 and 5.

<blockquote id="blockquote_178">             xxx xxx xxx

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_179">        104. The discussion makes it apparent that the learned
        single judge has doubted the mode of the applicability of the
        first sales doctrine in India as per the existing law. The same
        may lead to partial or regional exhaustion or international
        exhaustion. As per my opinion, as the express provision for
        international exhaustion is absent in our Indian law, it would
        be appropriate to confine the applicability of the same to
        regional exhaustion. Be that as it may, in the present case,
        the circumstances do not even otherwise warrant this
        discussion as the rights if at all are exhausted are to the
        extent to which they are available with the licensees as the
        books are purchased from the exclusive licensees who have
        limited rights and not from the owner. In these
        circumstances, the question of exhaustion of rights of owner
        in the copyright does not arise at all.”


</blockquote><p id="p_506">130. Thus, since copies of the low-priced editions could not be said to be

    “copies already in circulation” in the foreign territories that they were

    resold in, the learned Single Judge concluded that the principle of

    exhaustion would not apply. On the other hand, in the facts of the

    appeals before us, the distributors resell shrink-wrapped copies of the

</p><p id="p_512">132. Coming to <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_604">Article 4(2)</a> of EC Directive 2001/29, the ECJ posed a

    question, thus:
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_241">                                                                           184</span>
<p id="p_513">      “35. By its second question, which should be addressed first,
      the referring court essentially seeks to know whether and
      under what conditions the downloading from the internet of a
      copy of a computer program, authorised by the copyright
      holder, can give rise to exhaustion of the right of distribution of
      that copy in the European Union within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_605">Article
      4(2)</a> of Directive 2009/24.
</p>
<p id="p_514">      36. It should be recalled that under <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_606">Article 4(2)</a> of Directive
      2009/24 the first sale in the European Union of a copy of a
      computer program by the rightholder or with his consent
      exhausts the distribution right within the European Union of
      that copy.
</p>
<p id="p_515">      37. According to the order for reference, the copyright holder
      itself, in this case Oracle, makes available to its customers in
      the European Union who wish to use its computer program a
      copy of that program which can be downloaded from its
      website.
</p>
<p id="p_516">      38. To determine whether, in a situation such as that at issue
      in the main proceedings, the copyright holder’s distribution
      right is exhausted, it must be ascertained, first, whether the
      contractual relationship between the rightholder and its
      customer, within which the downloading of a copy of the
      program in question has taken place, may be regarded as a
      ‘first sale … of a copy of a program’ within the meaning of
      <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_607">Article 4(2)</a> of Directive 2009/24.”

</p><p id="p_517">133. Concluding that the transfer of a copy of a computer programme,

    accompanied by the conclusion of an EULA constituted a “first sale… of

    a copy of a program” within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_608">Article 4(2)</a> of EC Directive




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_242">                                                                            185</span>
2001/29 (see paragraph 48), the ECJ then went on to describe the

principle of exhaustion as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_518">  “70. An original acquirer who resells a tangible or intangible
  copy of a computer program for which the copyright holder’s
  right of distribution is exhausted in accordance with <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_609">Article 4(2)</a>
  of Directive 2009/24 must, in order to avoid infringing the
  exclusive right of reproduction of a computer program which
  belongs to its author, laid down in <a href="/doc/989492/" id="a_610">Article 4(1)(a)</a> of Directive
  2009/24, make his own copy unusable at the time of its resale.
  In a situation such as that mentioned in the preceding
  paragraph, the customer of the copyright holder will continue
  to use the copy of the program installed on his server and will
  not thus make it unusable.
</p>
<p id="p_519">  71. Moreover, even if an acquirer of additional user rights for
  the computer program concerned did not carry out a new
  installation — and hence a new reproduction — of the program
  on a server belonging to him, the effect of the exhaustion of
  the distribution right under <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_611">Article 4(2)</a> of Directive 2009/24
  would in any event not extend to such user rights. In such a
  case the acquisition of additional user rights does not relate to
  the copy for which the distribution right was exhausted at the
  time of that transaction. On the contrary, it is intended solely to
  make it possible to extend the number of users of the copy
  which the acquirer of additional rights has himself already
  installed on his server.
</p>
<p id="p_520">  72. On the basis of all the foregoing, the answer to Question 2
  is that <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_612">Article 4(2)</a> of Directive 2009/24 must be interpreted as
  meaning that the right of distribution of a copy of a computer
  program is exhausted if the copyright holder who has
  authorised, even free of charge, the downloading of that copy
  from the internet onto a data carrier has also conferred, in
  return for payment of a fee intended to enable him to obtain a

      remuneration corresponding to the economic value of the copy
      of the work of which he is the proprietor, a right to use that copy
      for an unlimited period.”

</p><p id="p_521">134. The ECJ concluded that the copyright owner exhausts his distribution

    right in copies of a computer programme upon making the first sale,

    provided that the copy is made unusable by the first acquirer, as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_522">      “78. Admittedly, as stated in paragraph 70 above, the original
      acquirer of a tangible or intangible copy of a computer program
      for which the copyright holder’s distribution right is exhausted
      in accordance with <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_613">Article 4(2)</a> of Directive 2009/24 who resells
      that copy must, in order to avoid infringing that rightholder’s
      exclusive right of reproduction of his computer program under
      <a href="/doc/989492/" id="a_614">Article 4(1)(a)</a> of Directive 2009/24, make the copy
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_244">      downloaded onto his computer unusable at the time of its</span>
      resale.
</p><p id="p_523">      79. As Oracle rightly observes, ascertaining whether such a
      copy has been made unusable may prove difficult. However, a
      copyright holder who distributes copies of a computer program
      on a material medium such as a CD‑ROM or DVD is faced with
      the same problem, since it is only with great difficulty that he
      can make sure that the original acquirer has not made copies
      of the program which he will continue to use after selling his
      material medium. To solve that problem, it is permissible for
      the distributor — whether ‘classic’ or ‘digital’ — to make use of
      technical protective measures such as product keys.
</p><p id="p_524">      80. Since the copyright holder cannot object to the resale of a
      copy of a computer program for which that rightholder’s
      distribution right is exhausted under <a href="/doc/1244046/" id="a_615">Article 4(2)</a> of Directive
      2009/24, it must be concluded that a second acquirer of that
      copy and any subsequent acquirer are ‘lawful acquirers’ of it
      within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_616">Article 5(1)</a> of Directive 2009/24.
</p>

<p id="p_525">      81. Consequently, in the event of a resale of the copy of the
      computer program by the first acquirer, the new acquirer will
      be able, in accordance with <a href="/doc/1001719/" id="a_617">Article 5(1)</a> of Directive 2009/24,
      to download onto his computer the copy sold to him by the first
      acquirer. Such a download must be regarded as a reproduction
      of a computer program that is necessary to enable the new
      acquirer to use the program in accordance with its intended
      purpose.”


</p><p id="p_526">135. The learned Additional Solicitor General, however, strongly relied upon

    the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

    in Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., 621 F.3d 1102 (9th Cir. 2010), wherein it

    dealt with the doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion. The facts of

    the case were set out as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_181">         “A. Autodesk&#x27;s Release 14 software and licensing
         practices
         The material facts are not in dispute. Autodesk makes
         computer-aided design software used by architects,
         engineers, and manufacturers. It has more than nine million
         customers. It first released its AutoCAD software in 1982. It
         holds registered copyrights in all versions of the software
         including the discontinued Release 14 version, which is at
         issue in this case. It provided Release 14 to customers on
         CD-ROMs.</blockquote>

<p id="p_527">         Since at least 1986, Autodesk has offered AutoCAD to
         customers pursuant to an accompanying software license
         agreement (“SLA”), which customers must accept before
         installing the software. A customer who does not accept the
         SLA can return the software for a full refund. Autodesk offers
         SLAs with different terms for commercial, educational

institution[s], and student users. The commercial license,
which is the most expensive, imposes the fewest restrictions
on users and allows them software upgrades at discounted
prices.
</p>
<p id="p_528">The SLA for Release 14 first recites that Autodesk retains
title to all copies. Second, it states that the customer has a
nonexclusive and nontransferable license to use Release
</p><p id="p_529">14. Third, it imposes transfer restrictions, prohibiting
customers from renting, leasing, or transferring the software
without Autodesk&#x27;s prior consent and from electronically or
physically transferring the software out of the Western
Hemisphere. Fourth, it imposes significant use restrictions:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_182">    YOU MAY NOT: (1) modify, translate, reverse
    engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software
    … (3) remove any proprietary notices, labels, or
    marks from the Software or Documentation; (4) use
    the Software outside of the Western Hemisphere;
    (5) utilize any computer software or hardware
    designed to defeat any hardware copy-protection
    device, should the software you have licensed be
    equipped with such protection; or (6) use the
    Software for commercial or other revenue-
    generating purposes if the Software has been
    licensed or labeled for educational use only.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_530">Fifth, the SLA provides for license termination if the user
copies the software without authorization or does not comply
with the SLA&#x27;s restrictions. Finally, the SLA provides that if
the software is an upgrade of a previous version:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_183">     [Y]ou must destroy the software previously
     licensed to you, including any copies resident on
     your hard disk drive ․ within sixty (60) days of the

             update․ Autodesk reserves the right to require you
             to show satisfactory proof that previous copies of
             the software have been destroyed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_184">        Autodesk takes measures to enforce these license
        requirements. It assigns a serial number to each copy of
        AutoCAD and tracks registered licensees. It requires
        customers to input “activation codes” within one month after
        installation to continue using the software.1 The customer
        obtains the code by providing the product&#x27;s serial number to
        Autodesk. Autodesk issues the activation code after
        confirming that the serial number is authentic, the copy is not
        registered to a different customer, and the product has not
        been upgraded. Once a customer has an activation code, he
        or she may use it to activate the software on additional
        computers without notifying Autodesk.”’

</blockquote><p id="p_531">136. The Court noted that the application of the doctrine turned on the

    following question:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_185">        “This case requires us to decide whether Autodesk sold
        Release 14 copies to its customers or licensed the copies to
        its customers. If CTA owned its copies of Release 14, then
        both its sales to Vernor and Vernor&#x27;s subsequent sales were
        non-infringing under the first sale doctrine. However, if
        Autodesk only licensed CTA to use copies of Release 14,
        then CTA&#x27;s and Vernor&#x27;s sales of those copies are not
        protected by the first sale doctrine and would therefore
        infringe Autodesk&#x27;s exclusive distribution right.”

</blockquote><p id="p_532">137. On these facts, the doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion, as

    applicable in USA, was set out as follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_186">         “A. The first sale doctrine
         The Supreme Court articulated the first sale doctrine in
         1908, holding that a copyright owner&#x27;s exclusive distribution
         right is exhausted after the owner&#x27;s first sale of a particular
         copy of the copyrighted work. See Bobbs-Merrill Co. v.
         Straus, 210 U.S. 339, 350-51 (1908). In Bobbs-Merrill, the
         plaintiff-copyright owner sold its book with a printed notice
         announcing that any retailer who sold the book for less than
         one dollar was responsible for copyright infringement. (Id. at
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_187">         341). Plaintiff sought injunctive relief against defendants-
         booksellers who failed to comply with the price restriction.
         (Id. at 341-42). The Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff&#x27;s
         claim, holding that its exclusive distribution right applied only
         to first sales of copies of the work. (Id. at 350-51). The
         distribution right did not permit [the] plaintiff to dictate that
         subsequent sales of the work below a particular price were
         infringing. Id. The Court noted that its decision solely applied
         to the rights of a copyright owner that distributed its work
         without a license agreement. (Id. at 350) (“There is no claim
         in this case of contract limitation, nor license agreement
         controlling the subsequent sales of the book.”).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_188">         Congress codified the first sale doctrine the following year.
         See 17 U.S.C. § 41 (1909). In its current form, it allows the
         “owner of a particular copy” of a copyrighted work to sell or
         dispose of his copy without the copyright owner&#x27;s
         authorization. (Id. § 109(a) (enacted 1976)). The first sale
         doctrine does not apply to a person who possesses a copy
         of the copyrighted work without owning it, such as a

</p><p id="p_534">138. Given the restrictions specifically imposed by the software licence

    agreement in the facts of the case, the Court held that the copyright

    owner retained the title to the copies of the software, and thus the resale

    of such copies violated the distribution right of the copyright owner, as

    follows:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_189">        “B. Analysis

        We hold today that a software user is a licensee rather than
        an owner of a copy where the copyright owner (1) specifies
        that the user is granted a license; (2) significantly restricts
        the user&#x27;s ability to transfer the software; and (3) imposes
        notable use restrictions.12 Applying our holding to
        Autodesk&#x27;s SLA, we conclude that CTA was a licensee
        rather than an owner of copies of Release 14 and thus was
        not entitled to invoke the first sale doctrine or the essential
        step defense.

<blockquote id="blockquote_190">        Autodesk retained title to the software and imposed
        significant transfer restrictions: it stated that the license is
        non-transferable, the software could not be transferred or
        leased without Autodesk&#x27;s written consent, and the software
        could not be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere.</blockquote>
<p id="p_535">        The SLA also imposed use restrictions against the use of the
        software outside the Western Hemisphere and against
        modifying, translating, or reverse-engineering the software,
        removing any proprietary marks from the software or



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_250">                                                                           192</span>

</p><p id="p_536">         Furthermore, the SLA provided for termination of the license
         upon the licensee&#x27;s unauthorized copying or failure to
         comply with other license restrictions. Thus, because
         Autodesk reserved title to Release 14 copies and imposed
         significant transfer and use restrictions, we conclude that its
         customers are licensees of their copies of Release 14 rather
         than owners.
</p><p id="p_537">         CTA was a licensee rather than an “owner of a particular
         copy” of Release 14, and it was not entitled to resell its
         Release 14 copies to Vernor under the first sale doctrine. 17
         U.S.C. § 109(a). Therefore, Vernor did not receive title to the
         copies from CTA and accordingly could not pass ownership
         on to others. Both CTA&#x27;s and Vernor&#x27;s sales infringed
         Autodesk&#x27;s exclusive right to distribute copies of its work. Id.

</p><p id="p_538">139. As a result, given the conditions of the software licence agreement in

    the facts before it, the Court held that the doctrine of first sale would not

    apply, as Autodesk, the copyright owner, did not part with title to the

    copies of the software. On the other hand, as has been held in

    paragraph 52 of this judgment, the EULAs and distribution agreements

    that the appeals before us are concerned with, do not grant a licence in

    terms of <a href="/doc/291394/" id="a_618">section 30</a> of the Copyright Act, but do in fact convey title to the

    material object embedded with a copy of the computer software to the

<p id="p_539">140. A conspectus of the aforesaid authorities would show that the doctrine

    of first sale/principle of exhaustion is dependent, in the first place, upon

    legislation which either recognises or refuses to recognise the doctrine

    (thereby continuing to vest distribution rights in the copyright owner,

    even beyond the first sale of the copyrighted work). Thus, for example,

    prior to the amendment of <a href="/doc/588056/" id="a_619">section 14(d)(ii)</a> in 2012, dealing with a

    cinematograph film, the distribution right to sell or give on hire or offer

    for sale or hire, any copy of the film, would continue to vest in the

    copyright owner, “regardless of whether such copy ha[d] been sold or

    intent against the application of the doctrine of first sale/principle of

    exhaustion. Post 2012, however, the balance between the copyright

    owner’s distribution right and the right of the purchaser to further resale,

    was tilted in favour of the latter, the words “regardless of whether such

    copy has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasion” being deleted

    by the amendment. Likewise, when it comes to <a href="/doc/120622438/" id="a_620">section 14(a)(ii)</a> of the

    Copyright Act, the distribution right subsists with the owner of copyright

    to issue copies of the work to the public, to the extent such copies are

    not copies already in circulation, thereby manifesting a legislative intent

    to apply the doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion, as has been

    found by the High Court of Delhi in Warner Bros. (supra).

once a book is sold, on further resale of the same book, the purchaser

loses the material book altogether, as such purchaser has, for

consideration, parted with the book once and for all. This may not be so

in the case of a computer programme, which is why the ECJ in

UsedSoft v. Oracle (ECJ) (supra) held that unless a further resale of a

computer software stored on a floppy disc/CD is accompanied by the

destruction of the said software on the computer of the reseller/first

reproduction thereof. This is also recognised in <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_628">section 65A</a> of the

“Interpretation of treaties
</p><p id="p_548">130. The principles adopted in interpretation of treaties are
not the same as those in interpretation of a statutory
legislation. While commenting on the interpretation of a
treaty imported into a municipal law, Francis Bennion
observes:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_193">    “With indirect enactment, instead of the substantive
    legislation taking the well-known form of an Act of
    Parliament, it has the form of a treaty. In other
    words, the form and language found suitable for
    embodying an international agreement become, at
    the stroke of a pen, also the form and language of
    a municipal legislative instrument. It is rather like
    saying that, by Act of Parliament, a woman shall be
    a man. Inconveniences may ensue. One
    inconvenience is that the interpreter is likely to be
    required to cope with disorganised composition
    instead of precision drafting. The drafting of
    treaties is notoriously sloppy usually for a very
    good reason. To get agreement, politic uncertainty
    is called for.</blockquote>
<p id="p_549">    … The interpretation of a treaty imported into
    municipal law by indirect enactment was described
    by Lord Wilberforce as being ‘unconstrained by
    technical rules of English law, or by English legal

     precedent, but conducted on broad principles of
     general acceptation. This echoes the optimistic
     dictum of Lord Widgery, C.J. that the words ‘are to
     be given their general meaning, general to lawyer
     and layman alike … the meaning of the diplomat
     rather than the lawyer’.” [Francis Bennion:
</p><p id="p_550">     Statutory Interpretation, p. 461 [Butterworths, 1992
     (2nd Edn.)].]

</p><p id="p_551">131. An important principle which needs to be kept in mind
in the interpretation of the provisions of an international
treaty, including one for double taxation relief, is that treaties
are negotiated and entered into at a political level and have
several considerations as their bases. Commenting on this
aspect of the matter, David R. Davis in Principles of
International Double Taxation Relief [ David R. Davis:
Principles of International Double Taxation Relief, p. 4
(London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1985).] , points out that the main
function of a Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty should be
seen in the context of aiding commercial relations between
treaty partners and as being essentially a bargain between
two treaty countries as to the division of tax revenues
between them in respect of income falling to be taxed in both
jurisdictions. It is observed (vide paragraph 1.06):
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_194">     “The benefits and detriments of a double tax treaty
     will probably only be truly reciprocal where the flow
     of trade and investment between treaty partners is
     generally in balance. Where this is not the case,
     the benefits of the treaty may be weighed more in
     favour of one treaty partner than the other, even
     though the provisions of the treaty are expressed
     in reciprocal terms. This has been identified as
     occurring in relation to tax treaties between




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_257">                                                                     199</span>
             developed and developing countries, where the
             flow of trade and investment is largely one-way.
             Because treaty negotiations are largely a
             bargaining process with each side seeking
             concessions from the other, the final agreement
             will often represent a number of compromises, and
             it may be uncertain as to whether a full and
             sufficient quid pro quo is obtained by both sides.”

        And, finally, in paragraph 1.08:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_195">             “Apart from the allocation of tax between the treaty
             partners, tax treaties can also help to resolve
             problems and can obtain benefits which cannot be
             achieved unilaterally.””

        similar language in all agreements, is derived, I believe, from
        a set of model clauses proposed by the financial commission
        of the League of Nations. The aim is to provide by treaty for
        the tax claims of two governments, both legitimately
        interested in taxing a particular source of income either by
        resigning to one of the two the whole claim or else by

         to the reservations contained therein and their tax authorities
         should follow these Commentaries, as modified from time to
         time and subject to their observations thereon, when
         applying and interpreting the provisions of their bilateral tax
         conventions that are based on the Model Convention.”

         “29.2      Similarly, taxpayers make extensive use of the

       difficult problems but is a matter of considerable importance
       in view of the rapid development of computer technology in
       recent years and the extent of transfers of such technology
       across national borders. In 1992, the Commentary was
       amended to describe the principles by which such
       classification should be made. Paragraphs 12 to 17 were
       further amended in 2000 to refine the analysis by which
       business profits are distinguished from royalties in computer
       software transactions. In most cases, the revised analysis
       will not result in a different outcome.</blockquote>

<p id="p_561">       12.1 Software may be described as a program, or series of

       either for the operational processes of the computer itself
       (operational software) or for the accomplishment of other

tasks (application software). It can be transferred through a
variety of media, for example in writing or electronically, on
a magnetic tape or disk, or on a laser disk or CD-Rom. It
may be standardised with a wide range of applications or be
tailor-made for single users. It can be transferred as an
integral part of computer hardware or in an independent
form available for use on a variety of hardware.
</p>
<p id="p_562">12.2 The character of payments received in transactions
involving the transfer of computer software depends on the
nature of the rights that the transferee acquires under the
particular arrangement regarding the use and exploitation of
the program. The rights in computer programs are a form of
intellectual property. Research into the practices of OECD
member countries has established that all but one protect
rights in computer programs either explicitly or implicitly
under copyright law. Although the term “computer software”
is commonly used to describe both the program — in which
the intellectual property rights (copyright) subsist — and the
medium on which it is embodied, the copyright law of most
OECD member countries recognises a distinction between
the copyright in the program and software which
incorporates a copy of the copyrighted program. Transfers
of rights in relation to software occur in many different ways
ranging from the alienation of the entire rights in the
copyright in a program to the sale of a product which is
subject to restrictions on the use to which it is put. The
consideration paid can also take numerous forms. These
factors may make it difficult to determine where the
boundary lies between software payments that are properly
to be regarded as royalties and other types of payment. The
difficulty of determination is compounded by the ease of
reproduction of computer software, and by the fact that
acquisition of software frequently entails the making of a




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_266">                                                                 207</span>
copy by the acquirer in order to make possible the operation
of the software.
</p>
<p id="p_563">13. The transferee’s rights will in most cases consist of
partial rights or complete rights in the underlying copyright
(see paragraphs 13.1 and 15 below), or they may be (or be
equivalent to) partial or complete rights in a copy of the
program (the “program copy”), whether or not such copy is
embodied in a material medium or provided electronically
(see paragraphs 14 to 14.2 below). In unusual cases, the
transaction may represent a transfer of “know-how” or secret
formula (paragraph 14.3).
</p>
<p id="p_564">13.1 Payments made for the acquisition of partial rights in
the copyright (without the transferor fully alienating the
copyright rights) will represent a royalty where the
consideration is for granting of rights to use the program in
a manner that would, without such license, constitute an
infringement of copyright. Examples of such arrangements
include licenses to reproduce and distribute to the public
software incorporating the copyrighted program, or to modify
and publicly display the program. In these circumstances,
the payments are for the right to use the copyright in the
program (i.e. to exploit the rights that would otherwise be the
sole prerogative of the copyright holder). It should be noted
that where a software payment is properly to be regarded as
a royalty there may be difficulties in applying the copyright
provisions of the Article to software payments since
paragraph 2 requires that software be classified as a literary,
artistic or scientific work. None of these categories seems
entirely apt. The copyright laws of many countries deal with
this problem by specifically classifying software as a literary
or scientific work. For other countries treatment as a
scientific work might be the most realistic approach.
Countries for which it is not possible to attach software to



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_267">                                                                  208</span>
any of those categories might be justified in adopting in their
bilateral treaties an amended version of paragraph 2 which
either omits all references to the nature of the copyrights or
refers specifically to software.
</p>
<p id="p_565">14. In other types of transactions, the rights acquired in
relation to the copyright are limited to those necessary to
enable the user to operate the program, for example, where
the transferee is granted limited rights to reproduce the
program. This would be the common situation in
transactions for the acquisition of a program copy. The rights
transferred in these cases are specific to the nature of
computer programs. They allow the user to copy the
program, for example onto the user’s computer hard drive or
for archival purposes. In this context, it is important to note
that the protection afforded in relation to computer programs
under copyright law may differ from country to country. In
some countries the act of copying the program onto the hard
drive or random access memory of a computer would,
without a license, constitute a breach of copyright. However,
the copyright laws of many countries automatically grant this
right to the owner of software which incorporates a computer
program. Regardless of whether this right is granted under
law or under a license agreement with the copyright holder,
copying the program onto the computer’s hard drive or
random access memory or making an archival copy is an
essential step in utilising the program. Therefore, rights in
relation to these acts of copying, where they do no more than
enable the effective operation of the program by the user,
should be disregarded in analysing the character of the
transaction for tax purposes. Payments in these types of
transactions would be dealt with as commercial income in
accordance with <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_654">Article 7.</a>
</p>



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_268">                                                                  209</span>
<p id="p_566">14.1 The method of transferring the computer program to the
transferee is not relevant. For example, it does not matter
whether the transferee acquires a computer disk containing
a copy of the program or directly receives a copy on the hard
disk of her computer via a modem connection. It is also of
no relevance that there may be restrictions on the use to
which the transferee can put the software.
</p>
<p id="p_567">14.2 The ease of reproducing computer programs has
resulted in distribution arrangements in which the transferee
obtains rights to make multiple copies of the program for
operation only within its own business. Such arrangements
are commonly referred to as “site licences”, “enterprise
licenses”, or “network licences”. Although these
arrangements permit the making of multiple copies of the
program, such rights are generally limited to those
necessary for the purpose of enabling the operation of the
program on the licensee’s computers or network, and
reproduction for any other purpose is not permitted under
the license. Payments under such arrangements will in most
cases be dealt with as business profits in accordance with
<a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_655">Article 7.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_568">14.3 Another type of transaction involving the transfer of
computer software is the more unusual case where a
software house or computer programmer agrees to supply
information about the ideas and principles underlying the
program, such as logic, algorithms or programming
languages or techniques. In these cases, the payments may
be characterised as royalties to the extent that they
represent consideration for the use of, or the right to use,
secret formulas or for information concerning industrial,
commercial or scientific experience which cannot be
separately copyrighted. This contrasts with the ordinary




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_269">                                                                210</span>
case in which a program copy is acquired for operation by
the end user.
</p>
<p id="p_569">14.4 Arrangements between a software copyright holder and
a distribution intermediary frequently will grant to the
distribution intermediary the right to distribute copies of the
program without the right to reproduce that program. In
these transactions, the rights acquired in relation to the
copyright are limited to those necessary for the commercial
intermediary to distribute copies of the software program. In
such transactions, distributors are paying only for the
acquisition of the software copies and not to exploit any right
in the software copyrights. Thus, in a transaction where a
distributor makes payments to acquire and distribute
software copies (without the right to reproduce the software),
the rights in relation to these acts of distribution should be
disregarded in analysing the character of the transaction for
tax purposes. Payments in these types of transactions would
be dealt with as business profits in accordance with Article
</p><p id="p_570">7. This would be the case regardless of whether the copies
being distributed are delivered on tangible media or are
distributed electronically (without the distributor having the
right to reproduce the software), or whether the software is
subject to minor customisation for the purposes of its
installation.
</p>
<p id="p_571">15. Where consideration is paid for the transfer of the full
ownership of the rights in the copyright, the payment cannot
represent a royalty and the provisions of the Article are not
applicable. Difficulties can arise where there is a transfer of
rights involving:

<p id="p_572">              — consideration in the form of a substantial lump sum
              payment.
</p>
<p id="p_573">        16. Each case will depend on its particular facts but in
        general if the payment is in consideration for the transfer of
        rights that constitute a distinct and specific property (which
        is more likely in the case of geographically-limited than time
        limited rights), such payments are likely to be business
        profits within <a href="/doc/735354/" id="a_656">Article 7</a> or a capital gain within <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_657">Article 13</a> rather
        than royalties within <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_658">Article 12.</a> That follows from the fact that
        where the ownership of rights has been alienated, the
        consideration cannot be for the use of the rights. The
        essential character of the transaction as an alienation
        cannot be altered by the form of the consideration, the
        payment of the consideration in instalments or, in the view
        of most countries, by the fact that the payments are related
        to a contingency.
</p>
<p id="p_574">        17. Software payments may be made under mixed
        contracts. Examples of such contracts include sales of
        computer hardware with built-in software and concessions
        of the right to use software combined with the provision of
        services. The methods set out in paragraph 11 above for
        dealing with similar problems in relation to patent royalties
        and know-how are equally applicable to computer software.
        Where necessary the total amount of the consideration
        payable under a contract should be broken down on the
        basis of the information contained in the contract or by
        means of a reasonable apportionment with the appropriate
        tax treatment being applied to each apportioned part.”

<p id="p_602">    CONCLUSION

</p><p id="p_603">168. Given the definition of royalties contained in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_678">Article 12</a> of the DTAAs

    obligation on the persons mentioned in <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_679">section 195</a> of the Income Tax

    Act to deduct tax at source, as the distribution agreements/EULAs in

    the facts of these cases do not create any interest or right in such

    distributors/end-users, which would amount to the use of or right to use

    any copyright. The provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_680">Income Tax Act</a> (<a href="/doc/674541/" id="a_681">section

    9(1)(vi)</a>, along with explanations 2 and 4 thereof), which deal with

    royalty, not being more beneficial to the assessees, have no application

    in the facts of these cases.

   of the computer software through EULAs/distribution agreements, is not

   the payment of royalty for the use of copyright in the computer software,

   and that the same does not give rise to any income taxable in India, as

   a result of which the persons referred to in <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_682">section 195</a> of the Income

   Tax Act were not liable to deduct any TDS under <a href="/doc/1329583/" id="a_683">section 195</a> of the
