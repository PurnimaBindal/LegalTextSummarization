                          JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">Prathiba M. Singh, J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">1.     The well-known proverb &quot;health is wealth&quot; has deep and varying
connotations. Historically, it connoted physical health but in modern society
the word &quot;health&quot; would include physical, mental and emotional health of a
person. The plight of an extremely well to do mentally ill person
(hereinafter `Mr. DMP&#x27;) with a large family is the subject matter of the
present petition. Due to the sensitive nature of this case and the persons
involved, all the individuals are referred to by their abbreviated initials and
not by full name. The Petitioner is the wife of the mentally ill Mr. DMP. An
application has been moved by the Respondent no. 5 in respect of the
nomenclature used for the Petitioner which is dealt with below, before
proceeding further.
</p><p id="p_3">CM APPL. 21096/2021 (for modification of o/d 4th June, 2021)
</p><p id="p_4">2.     This application has been filed on behalf of Respondent No.5 seeking
partial modification of order dated 4th June, 2021, to the extent that it refers
to the Petitioner - Mrs. SD as the &quot;wife of DMP&quot;. During the course of
hearing, Respondent Nos.5 and 6 have repeatedly objected to Mrs. SD being
referred to as Mr. DMP&#x27;s wife.
</p><p id="p_5">3.     It is seen from the record that, Mrs. SD has been shown as the wife in
the election records of Mr. DMP since inception. She has also borne three
children with Mr. DMP. Mr. DMP himself has never challenged the fact that

she was his wife. The judgment of the Patna High Court in Civil Writ No.
22948/2011 titled Smt S.D.&amp; Ors. v. Bihar State Housing Board &amp; Ors.,
relating to a land dispute also clearly acknowledges that Mrs. SD is the wife
of Mr. DMP. The ld. Division Bench of this Court in W.P. (Crl.) 2255/2019
titled <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_1">R.S. v. State &amp; Ors</a>. has also referred to Mrs. SD as the wife of Mr.
DMP repeatedly.
</p><p id="p_6">4.       Thus, the objections of Respondent Nos.5 and 6 are bereft of any
merit.
</p><p id="p_7">5.       With these observations, the application is dismissed.

Brief Facts:
</p><p id="p_8">6.       The Petitioner - Mrs. SD is a 76 year-old lady and the wife of the
mentally ill individual who is referred to as Mr. DMP. He was diagnosed
with Fronto-temporal Dementia (hereinafter, &#x27;FTD&#x27;) in 2019, the details of
which shall be gone into hereinafter. He is a 7th term Member of Parliament
from Bihar and from the facts that have emerged in this case, he is a man of
means. Mr. DMP had three sons, one of whom has pre-deceased him. His
current family consists of his wife, his other two sons, their wives and their
children, as also the wife and children of his deceased son. Mr. DMP&#x27;s
younger son - Mr. RJS is Respondent No.3 in this petition and his older son
</p><p id="p_9">- Mr. RS is Respondent No.4 in this petition. He also has a younger brother
</p><p id="p_10">- Mr. US, who has filed an intervention application in this matter. Mr. DMP
has also been in the company of one Ms. UD, who is stated to have been
living with him for approximately 47 years, who also claims that she is the

wife. In so far as Ms. UD is concerned, this Court has not expressed any
opinion on the status of Ms. UD, though it appears to have been broadly
accepted that Ms. UD was the companion of Mr. DMP. Whether Ms. UD
was his wife or not is clearly not an issue which has been raised in the
present petition, for adjudication. Mr. DMP currently lives in his official
residence in New Delhi, along with Ms. UD and Mrs. KR i.e., his daughter-
in-law from the deceased son. Ms. UD is Respondent No.5 in this petition
and Mrs. KR is Respondent No.6 in this petition.
</p><p id="p_11">7.     Mr. DMP is the owner of various moveable and immoveable assets.
His assets, as have been declared before this Court, run into more than
Rs.3,000/- crores or even higher. He is a substantial investor in a
pharmaceutical company and its group companies. He also has other
investments such as shares, bonds, provident funds etc. Conflict has arisen
between the wife of Mr. DMP, his two sons and their families on the one
hand and his companion - Ms. UD, his brother - Mr. US and his daughter-
in-law from his deceased son - Mrs. KR, on the other hand. Owing to the
mental condition of Mr. DMP, his wife has filed the present petition praying
that this Court exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to grant the following
reliefs:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       &quot;(a) Pass a writ, order or direction in the nature of

<p id="p_12">8.     By the above prayers, the Petitioner prays that she be appointed as the
sole guardian of Mr. DMP, being his lawfully wedded wife and considering
his mental condition.
</p><p id="p_13">Genesis of the Dispute
</p><p id="p_14">9.     In 2019, Mr. DMP&#x27;s younger son, Mr. RJS, filed a writ of habeas
corpus, being W.P. (Crl.) 2255/2019 titled <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_2">R.S v. State &amp; Ors</a>., before a
Division Bench of this Court. The prayer in the said writ petition was for
production of his mother, Mrs. SD, who, according to him, was illegally
confined by Mr. DMP, Ms. UD and others acting on their behalf. Mr. RJS
also sought the custody of his mother. The facts which thereafter unfolded
before the ld. Division Bench revealed an extremely sorry state of affairs.
</p><p id="p_15">10.    On 14th August, 2019, when the writ petition was listed before the ld.
Division Bench, the Court directed Mrs. SD, Mr. DMP etc. to be personally
present on the next date. An attempt was made to seek exemption from their
appearance. However, on 19th August, 2019, Mrs. SD, Mr. DMP and their
son - Mr. RJS appeared before Court. After interacting with them in

Chamber, the Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">         &quot;While Mrs. SD was hard of hearing and it was difficult
         to communicate with her, we found that respondent no. 2
         Mr. DMP did not recognize either the petitioner (his son)
         or Mrs. SD (his wife). He, in fact, told us that Mrs. SD
         was his mother and the petitioner&#x27;s name was Aradhya
         and not Mr. RJS. Respondent no. 2 repeated ad nauseam
         that he had travelled to all the countries of the world.
            Enquiry from the staff who accompanied Mrs. SD and
         respondent no. 2 revealed that respondent no. 2&#x27;s
         younger brother was managing the business empire.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_16">The Court, thus, concluded that the situation is quite grave as Mr. DMP
could not even identify his own wife and son or give their correct names.
</p><p id="p_17">11.      The Division Bench, keeping in mind the allegations levelled in the
case, directed investigation by the Crime Branch and called for a status
report from the DCP on 27th August, 2019. The DCP filed two Status
Reports dated 3rd September, 2019 and 19th September, 2019.
</p><p id="p_18">12.      As per the first Status Report dated 3rd September, 2019, enquiry was
conducted by the DCP, Crime Branch. The police made enquiries from 15
persons, including Mrs. SD, Mr. DMP, Ms. UD, Mr. US, Mrs. RD - who is
the wife of Mr. US, Mr. RJS, various staff and employees and the domestic
help working at the residence of Mr. DMP. The conclusions of the said
enquiry proceedings as recorded in Status Report dated 3rd September, 2019
is summarized as under:
</p><p id="p_19">• As per the son - Mr. RJS, he was not allowed to meet his mother, Mrs.
      SD, since 2013. He further alleged that in the year 2017, when his mother
      was admitted in Fortis Escorts hospital, she was discharged one day
      early, against medical advice, at the behest of Ms. UD.
• As per Mrs. SD, she was not allowed to meet her son - Mr. RJS.

   Accordingly, the police arranged a meeting between Mr. RJS and Mrs.
   SD, who, as per the report, were happy to meet each other. Mrs. RD, wife
   of Mr. US i.e., the brother of Mr. DMP, was living in the same bedroom
   as Mrs. SD. She expressed her desire to meet her son and her husband -
   Mr. US. When asked as to whether they were illegally detained or beaten
   up, both, Mrs. SD and Mrs. RD remained silent.
</p><p id="p_21">• Mr. DMP made a statement to the police that he had three sons, one of
   whom had passed away. He claimed Ms. UD to be his wife but did not
   deny that Mrs. SD was his wife. He further stated to the police that he
   has disowned his son Mr. RJS and did not wish to meet him.
• During examination of Mr. DMP, the police found that Mr. DMP was
   suffering from amnesia and was repeating his sentences again and again.
   He was unable to recognize the police officers he had met on 30th
   August, 2019, when they met for the second time on 2nd September,
   2019.
</p><p id="p_22">• Ms. UD told the police that she met Mr. DMP in 1973 and they mutually
   agreed to live together as husband and wife. She admitted that Mrs. SD is
   the lawfully wedded wife of Mr. DMP. As per the report, Ms. UD had a
   diplomatic passport where Mr. DMP was shown as her husband. She has
   no children from Mr. DMP. During the examination, it was observed that
   she was managing all the domestic affairs at Mr. DMP&#x27;s house.
• Mr. US, who is the younger brother of Mr. DMP and the husband of Mrs.
   RD, was also examined. As per the report, he is the Managing Director of
   M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. He stated that he manages the
   affairs of all the companies owned by his brother. The police observed
   that Mr. US did not live with his wife Mrs. RD. Mrs. SD and Mrs. RD

   his statement. He informed the police that Ms. UD had taken control of
   the affairs of the company and had fired several employees. She
   employed persons with whom she could take control of the company.
   Shares of the company were transferred by getting signatures on blank

   run by Ms. UD, who was earlier the Secretary of Mr. DMP.
• The nephew of Mrs. SD i.e., Mrs. SD&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son, who was working as

   made to resign on 23rd August, 2019 at the behest of Ms. UD, however,
   with the intervention of his cousin - Mr. RJS, he was transferred to
   another plant. He claims that he was repeatedly ill-treated at this plant,

      all the property to her nephew Mr. K. She further stated that she was
      locked up by the servants at Ms. UD&#x27;s behest. She claimed that she was
      subjected to physical torture by Ms. UD, who was responsible for
      instigating Mr. DMP and creating disharmony in the family. She was
      happy to live in the Vasant Vihar house.

       equally noteworthy that during the pendency of the
       habeas corpus petition, the petitioner had moved an
       application for recall of the previous order to the extent
       it recorded the conduct of the parties post the in-chamber
       meeting, seeking to explain the petitioner&#x27;s speech and
       dictation as inaccurate on account of his shot up thyroid
       levels and depleted sodium levels. This Court clarifies
       that the findings of AIIMS in Report dated 12.9.2019 to
       the effect that the petitioner suffers from fronto temporal
       dementia cannot be discredited. Yet, the Ld. Senior
       Counsel for Petitioner&#x27;s submission to the effect that the
       decision making capacity of the petitioner continues to
       remain intact cannot be ignored. If such were the
       condition of the Petitioner, the law rather encourages
       him to approach the mental healthcare establishment
       himself for assessment and proper diagnosis. The
       argument of the Ld. Senior Counsel to the effect that the
       recourse for assessment as would precede any admission
       is not provided for under <a href="/doc/186381338/" id="a_4">Section 85</a>/<a href="/doc/170794703/" id="a_5">86</a>, fails to appeal to
       reason, for <a href="/doc/170794703/" id="a_6">Section 86</a> requires a preliminary
       &#x27;satisfaction&#x27; of the medical officer or mental health
       professional with respect to, inter-alia, severity of mental
       illness as would necessitate admission in a mental health
       facility. Even otherwise, once cannot contemplate any
       admission without a prior assessment of the patient. If
       voluntary exercise of discretion by the patient himself for
       the purpose of admission is recognized by the law,
       willingness for having self subjected to assessment, is
       also covered under <a href="/doc/186381338/" id="a_7">Sections 85</a> and <a href="/doc/170794703/" id="a_8">86</a>.

illness. Despite this, the Metropolitan Magistrate wrongly declared him to be
mentally fit, based on the false statement of his daughter-in-law - Mrs. KR.
Mr. DMP himself is being kept in confinement under the complete control
of Ms. UD, who claims to be his wife, and the Petitioner, who is his lawfully
wedded wife, has been separated from her husband and two sons/families
for the last two years. Considering the mental condition of Mr. DMP, it is
prayed that this Court appoint the Petitioner as the nominated representative
of Mr. DMP.

sheet, the passport authorities are of the view that Ms. UD falsely claimed to
be the wife of Mr. DMP. No evidence was led to prove a valid or legally
acceptable marriage with Ms. UD under Hindu Law. Thus, it is submitted
that the admitted position is that there has been no marriage which took
place between Mr. DMP and Ms. UD. Mrs. SD cannot therefore be expected
to seek any declaration in respect of the void nature of their marriage.
</blockquote><p id="p_60">42.    Ld. Senior counsel thereafter recapitulates the entire life history of
Mr. DMP. He stresses on the fact that Mr. DMP initially worked in a school
and it was only from the jewellery which was given to him by Mrs. SD did
Mr. DMP start his business. It is submitted that Mr. DMP had first
incorporated a business in which 70% shareholding was of Mrs. SD and
their sons. The marriage between the Petitioner and Mr. DMP is stated to
have taken place in 1960. It is submitted that since 1960, Mr. DMP has
always shown Mrs. SD as his wife. The Petitioner is not very highly
educated and has studied only till the 5th standard. She is, however, fluent in
the regional dialect and can converse in Hindi.

chronology of events leading up to the present situation. His submission is
that the photographs exhibit the fact that Mr. DMP always lived with his
family, though Ms. UD was part of that family. Mr. DMP never lived alone
with Ms. UD and in fact, right up till 2018-19, when Mr. DMP&#x27;s mental
condition deteriorated, Mr. DMP was living with his wife, Ms. UD, his sons
and their families as one big family. Till 2018, both the sons were also part
of the company and businesses. Since then, the Petitioner has been
completely separated from her husband as well as both her sons. Mr. DMP&#x27;s
complete assets are under the control of Ms. UD. Mrs. KR i.e., Mr. DMP&#x27;s

affidavits of disownment of his sons, after the onset of his mental illness.
Ld. Senior counsel submits that thus, while the actual family of Mr. DMP
has been completely deprived of him and his company, Ms. UD has been in
control of his personal life as also his businesses.

in the frontal lobe in 1997, which is clear from the brain report taken at
Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai. Thereafter, in 2019, during the proceedings
before the ld. Division Bench, he was diagnosed with FTD. In 2019 itself,
the Respondents had approached the Metropolitan Magistrate under the
MHA-2017 seeking a declaration regarding Mr. DMP&#x27;s mental health.
However, even before the Metropolitan Magistrate, the stand taken by Mrs.
KR was that Mr. DMP was instructing the lawyers in the proceedings before
the ld. Division Bench and that no medical assessment of Mr. DMP was
required.

14 (1) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (hereinafter,

partial disability. Reference is made to Rule 7 of the Delhi Rights of Persons
with Disabilities Rules, 2018 (hereinafter, &#x27;RPWD (Delhi) Rules-2018&#x27;),
enacted under the 2016 Act, to argue that the fact that the limited guardian
has to consult the person with the disability shows that the disability is one
of a limited nature and not a complete disability. It is further submitted that
RPWD-2016 deals only with limited guardianship, which, according to Mr.

education, jobs, reservation, etc.
</p><p id="p_64">46.    Coming to the MHA-2017, the argument of Mr. Singh is that under
the <a href="/doc/185191195/" id="a_16">Mental Health Act</a>, 1987 (hereinafter, &#x27;MHA-1987&#x27;), <a href="/doc/189330246/" id="a_17">Sections 53</a> and <a href="/doc/145540096/" id="a_18">54</a>
specifically provided for how the property of a mentally ill person was to be
dealt with. However, the MHA-2017 does not contain any provisions in this
regard. On the strength of various provisions of the Act, it is submitted that a
nominated representative is the person who is supposed to take care of the
mentally ill person. Under <a href="/doc/5126886/" id="a_19">Section 2(a)</a> read with <a href="/doc/29761666/" id="a_20">Section 5</a>, an advance
directive can be issued by a mentally ill person. In the present case, since no
Mental Health Review Board (hereinafter, &#x27;Board&#x27;) had been constituted in
Delhi, Mr. DMP did not give any advance directive. In the absence of an
advance directive, a nominated representative would be appointed under
<a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_21">Section 14</a>. The order of precedence for appointing a nominated
representative is given in <a href="/doc/166363552/" id="a_22">Sections 2</a> and <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_23">14</a>, as per which the Petitioner
would clearly be put at a higher pedestal than a caregiver. Ld. counsel also
relies on the judgment in <a href="/doc/192421140/" id="a_24">Indra Sarma v. V.K.V. Sarma</a>, (2013) 15 SCC 755
to argue that a concubine can never be considered a relative.

a nominated representative which itself shows that a nominated
representative plays the role of a guardian. It is further submitted that
<a href="/doc/32463852/" id="a_26">Section 17</a>, which sets out the duties of a nominated representative, would
take within its fold the best interests of Mr. DMP, which would include
management of the assets of Mr. DMP. Section 120 of MHA-2017 Act is
also relied upon to argue that MHA-2017 has an overriding effect, thus,

submit that under the parens patriae jurisdiction, which can be exercised by
a writ court in exceptional cases, the Court has to bear in mind the best
interests of Mr. DMP. The judgment in Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh
Admn., (2009) 9 SCC 1, is relied upon to argue that there are two different
tests i.e., the best interest test and the substituted judgment test which are
applied. Further, reliance is placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court in
<a href="/doc/235821/" id="a_27">Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v. Union of India</a>, (2011) 4 SCC 454, in
which case, the Court, while considering whether or not to withdraw life

It is submitted that in the present case, the best interest test ought to be
applied by the Court.
</p><p id="p_67">49.    Ld. Senior Counsel submits that the following facts reflect Mr.

domestic relationship, is also relied on to argue that Ms. UD cannot be
treated as being married to Mr. DMP. Ld. Senior Counsel further submits
that Respondent No. 5 never objected to being referred to in the pleadings as
not his wife and there is no assertion or proof of a marriage having been
conducted. Reliance was placed on three judgments i.e., <a href="/doc/1141333/" id="a_30">Gunwant Kaur v.

on the judgment in <a href="/doc/187104390/" id="a_33">Preeti Satija v. Raj Kumari and Anr., ILR</a> (2014) 2 Del
1246, where the Court has observed that disownment would not take away
the right of the son to be an heir if the person dies intestate. It is therefore

</p><p id="p_79">58.    Insofar as the affidavits of disownment are concerned, a comparison
is made between the two affidavits to show how the language in the two
affidavits is the exact same. This, according to Mr. Rai, ld. Senior counsel,
establishes the fact that the affidavits are not genuine. The disownment
affidavits are also challenged on the ground that even as late as 2018, a lease
agreement has been entered into in favour of the second son by the DMP&#x27;s
company - M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., which shows that there
was no ill-will between the father and sons.
</p><p id="p_80">59.    Insofar as the two enactments are concerned i.e., the RPWD-2016 and
the MHA-2017, it is his submission that both statutes are to be harmonised
and read together, however, if there is any conflict then the MHA-2017
would apply due to <a href="/doc/185191195/" id="a_34">Section 120</a>, as also due to the fact that it is a later
enactment which is a special statute.
</p><p id="p_81">60.    Ld. Senior Counsel also points out the difference in wording of the
preambles of the two acts. While the RPWD-2016 records that the intention
of the statute is to &quot;implement the Convention&quot;, the MHA-2017 records that
it has been enacted in order to &quot;align and harmonise the existing laws with
the said Convention&quot;.

suffering of PwDs and specifies the role of the State in such alleviation.
However, MHA-2017 provides for the manner in which a mentally ill
person is to be cared for. He submits that the person and the property i.e., the
mentally ill person and his/her assets, are inseparable from each other and
are, in fact, integral to each other. Reference is made to the Universal

Naidu</a>, (2004) 1 SCC 769. Therefore, it is argued that the distinction
between the assets/property of the person and the person himself/herself
cannot be read into the statute. Thus, it is submitted that even if the MHA-
2017 does not contain any provision for the protection of a mentally ill
person&#x27;s property, the Court cannot be rendered helpless, especially while
exercising parens patriae jurisdiction.

did not disturb the institution of his family. However, when he was in
captivity, his mental condition deteriorated. The entire conspiracy was
unearthed during the proceedings in the writ of habeas corpus, being W.P.
(Crl.) 2255/2019 titled <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_39">R.S v. State &amp; Ors. It</a> is submitted that a deliberate
attempt has been made to conceal Mr. DMP&#x27;s mental condition, which is
clear from a reading of the order of the Division Bench dated 19th August,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">W.P.(C) 1271/2020                                                       Page 38 of 147</span>

2019 and the order dated 20th September, 2019. The Division Bench was
given the impression that the reason why Mr. DMP could not recognise his
wife and his son was due to a change in his thyroid levels and depletion of
his sodium levels. Ld. Senior counsel submits that Mr. DMP was, in fact,
incapable of engaging a counsel on his behalf but in the proceedings before
the Division Bench, a counsel was engaged on his behalf. This shows that
the conduct of Ms. UD was not bonafide.
</p><p id="p_85">64.      It is submitted that in fact, attempts were made to avoid production of
Mrs. SD in Court. At that stage, the Court suspected that something was
amiss and directed the entire family to be present in Court. A shocking
observation made by the Court was that Mr. DMP did not recognize his own
wife and son.
</p><p id="p_86">65.      The pleadings of Ms. UD are also relied upon to argue that even the
stand of Ms. UD shows her poor conduct. On page 1440 of the pleadings, in
a reply filed by Ms. UD, it is denied that Mrs. SD is the wife of the DMP
and that the DMP is incapable of taking cogent and intelligent decisions,
which is contrary to what has been recorded by the Division Bench of this
Court.
</p><p id="p_87">66.      Ld. Senior counsel took the Court through Mr. DMP&#x27;s medical
records to argue that since 1997, the DMP has been detected with some
cognitive impairment, which has only worsened with time.
</p><p id="p_88">67.      Ld. Senior Counsel emphasizes upon the fact that Ms. UD, who is
described in different documents as Manager (Public Relations), Vice-
President (Public Relations) etc., was merely an employee who had come
into the household. It is the Petitioner who is Mr. DMP&#x27;s lawfully wedded
wife. He argued that the present case raises a question of public policy i.e.,

whether the Court can recognise an extra-marital affair? It is submitted that
Mr. DMP has repeatedly filed declarations in Parliament declaring Mrs. SD
as his wife. Even during the Court ordered investigation, Ms. UD has stated
that Mrs. SD is the wife of Mr. DMP. Ld. Senior counsel submits that if the
institution of marriage is being pitted against the role of Ms. UD, who, in his
words, is nothing but a &quot;concubine&quot;, public policy would require the Court
to side with the institution of marriage.
</p><p id="p_89">68.    It is further submitted that recognising Ms. UD as the wife of Mr.
DMP would also be contrary to <a href="/doc/284588/" id="a_40">Section 16</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
and <a href="/doc/60014/" id="a_41">Section 18(2)(e)</a> of the Hindu Adoptions and <a href="/doc/902835/" id="a_42">Maintenance Act</a>, 1956.
The acceptance of any arrangement apart from marriage would also demean
the institution of marriage, which cannot be done as per the judgment of the
Madras High Court in Chinnammal and 8 <a href="/doc/1734949/" id="a_43">Others v. Elumalai</a> and 4
Others, 2000 (II) CTC 214 and the triple talaq judgment in <a href="/doc/115701246/" id="a_44">Shayara Bano
v. UOI &amp; Ors</a>., (2017) 9 SCC 1.
</p><p id="p_90">69.    Finally, it is submitted that Mrs. SD is the most non-controversial
person against whom no allegations have been levelled by any of the parties.
Though Mrs. SD may be an illiterate person but it is not necessary that every
illiterate person does not understand the finer values which are enjoyed
within families. In any event, she is a good human being who has taken care
of the entire family and therefore, she is entitled to the guardianship of the
DMP.

sour with the intervention of Ms. UD, who is taking advantage of Mr.
DMP&#x27;s mental condition.
</p><p id="p_93">71.    Ld. Senior Counsel challenges the validity of the affidavits of
disownment on the ground that they are completely unbecoming of any
father. It is submitted that the language used in the affidavits seems to be of
a third party and only the signatures have been obtained from Mr. DMP,
whose mental condition was degenerating. It is further submitted that no
mention was made of any disownment affidavit to the police and in fact,
even the statement of Mr. DMP to the police, that he did not want his son in
his house, was a tutored statement. Mr. Jethmalani emphasizes that the
affidavits may have been signed at an earlier point of time as the date of the
affidavits, as also the age of Mr. DMP, are not up to date.
</p><p id="p_94">72.    Ld. Senior counsel submits that from 2016 onwards, various financial
decisions have been taken, undermining Mr. DMP&#x27;s financial capacity, in
respect of shares, bank accounts, disownment of sons, etc., which clearly
shows that since the time Mr. DMP has been suffering from this condition,
Respondent No.5 has taken over his decision-making powers. It is further
submitted that the manner in which Respondent No.4&#x27;s shares and joint
accounts have been transferred without his signatures also shows that during
this period Mr. DMP did not take any decision on his own.
</p><p id="p_95">73.    Insofar as the conduct of Mr. US i.e., the younger brother of Mr. DMP
is concerned, ld. Senior Counsel claims that there is collusion and
conspiracy involving Mr. US, who is now controlling the company along
with Ms. UD. It is submitted that there can otherwise be no explanation as to
why Mr. US is not willing to acknowledge Mrs. SD as the wife of Mr. DMP.

Reliance was placed on a writ petition filed by Mrs. SD and Mr. US, as
Petitioner Nos.1 and 2 in Civil Writ No. 22948/2011 in the Patna High
Court. It is submitted that in the said writ petition, Mrs. SD has been
described as the wife of Mr. DMP and Mr. US is Petitioner No.2. Thus, in
judicial proceedings, Mr. US has admitted that Mrs. SD is the wife of Mr.
DMP. It is thus argued that Mr. US is guilty of suppresio veri and suggestio
falsi.
</p><p id="p_97">74.      Insofar as the applicability of RPWD-2016 is concerned, Mr.
Jethmalani, ld. Senior Counsel submits that FTD would not be a disability as
defined under the RPWD-2016. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/166363552/" id="a_45">Section 2(s)</a>, as per
which, a &#x27;person with disability&#x27; would be a person with a partial
impairment. It is submitted that only those mental conditions which do not
completely destroy the person&#x27;s full and effective participation in society
would come under this definition. In the case of a person with FTD, such
participation is foreclosed, owing to the permanent nature of the condition
and the gradual degeneration it causes to the person&#x27;s senses. The aim of
RPWD-2016 is primarily to ensure that PwDs are duly empowered, in light
of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its
Optional Protocol published on 13th December, 2006 and entered into force
on 3rd May, 2008 (hereinafter, &#x27;UNCRPD&#x27;).

enabled and empowered to take decisions in consultation with the limited

who are unable to take decisions in consultation with a guardian. RPWD-
2016 would therefore only extend to persons with partial impairments and
not to persons such as Mr. DMP.

used in Section 2(s) of MHA-2017, which uses terminology such as
&#x27;substantial disorder&#x27; and &#x27;grossly impairs&#x27;, to argue that in the case of a
person suffering from a condition such as FTD, RPWD-2016 would have no
application.

behind it is to empower a PwD to control his/her own financial affairs. It is
submitted that as per order dated 23rd July, 2021, it is clear that Mr. DMP
does not have any comprehension of or powers of decision making. Reliance
is placed upon the medical assessment of the DMP by both the Neurologists

ld. Senior Counsel distinguishes the situation in the United Kingdom with
India. Reference is made to the judgment in In re F. (Mental Patients:
Sterilisation) to demonstrate the manner in which the parens patriae
jurisdiction of the Court was revoked in the United Kingdom. It is submitted
that even in the United Kingdom, the parens patriae jurisdiction, which
existed for several hundreds of years, was taken away only with the
enactment of the <a href="/doc/185191195/" id="a_51">Mental Health Act</a>, 1959 and the revocation of the Crown&#x27;s
Warrant, which was signed at the time when the <a href="/doc/185191195/" id="a_52">Mental Health Act</a>, 1959
was enacted. Reliance is also placed upon the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Canada in E v. Eve (1986) 2 SCR 388, where the Court cautioned
that this jurisdiction cannot be taken away unless and until it is removed by
a specific legislation.
</p><p id="p_104">80.    Ld. Senior counsel submit that in the <a href="/doc/185191195/" id="a_53">Mental Health Act</a>, 1959 of the

relating to the financial affairs of patients. In the absence of such provisions
in India, it cannot be inferred that the parens patriae jurisdiction does not

Mr. DMP is comfortable with the persons with whom he is currently living
i.e., Ms. UD and Mrs. KR. Taking Mr. DMP away from them would put

the following propositions are urged by Dr. Singhvi:

all and the entire jurisdiction for granting limited guardianship lies with the
District Court. <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_59">Section 14(2)</a> also makes it abundantly clear that any

<p id="p_115">87.    On the issue of maintainability, Dr. Singhvi submits that as a matter
of law, the parens patriae jurisdiction cannot be invoked if a statute is
applicable. Reliance is placed upon the judgment of the House of Lords in
In re F. (Mental Patient: Sterilisation), [1990] 2 A.C. 1. Dr. Singhvi
submits that the RPWD-2016 does not exclude property from the enquiry by
the designated authority, which deals with the care of a mentally ill person.
It is submitted that all these issues are to be gone into by the designated
authority by adducing oral evidence and not in writ jurisdiction where
factual enquiry would not be permitted. Thereafter, reliance is placed upon
E. v. Eve, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 388 passed by the Canadian Supreme Court to
argue that the parens patriae jurisdiction cannot be exercised for the benefit
of a third party.
</p><p id="p_116">88.    It is further submitted that the exercise of parens patriae jurisdiction
cannot be contrary to the doctrine of privacy and the right to live with

</p><p id="p_117">89.    Ld. Senior Counsel relies upon various international conventions to
emphasize that the changes in the law bear in mind the interests of the
mentally ill person. He submits that even people with lucid intervals need
not be confined to care institutions and should be allowed to live in familiar
surroundings. It is submitted that neither Mr. DMP nor the parties on behalf
of the Respondents have any objection to the regular visits by Mrs. SD,
accompanied by a nursing attendant and one family member. However, to
deprive Mr. DMP of the ecosystem to which he is used to i.e., living along
with Ms. UD and Mrs. KR, under the support of Mr. US, would be
completely violative of Mr. DMP&#x27;s right to privacy and dignity.
</p><p id="p_118">90.    Reliance is placed upon pages 1593, 1604, 1613 and 1616 to argue
that the contentions being raised today are the same as those raised in an
application filed before the ld. Division Bench, which was dismissed with
costs vide order dated 23rd October, 2020.
</p><p id="p_119">91.    Two judgments, being <a href="/doc/183214526/" id="a_63">Minu Seth v. Binu Seth</a>, AIR 2018 Delhi 54

person seeking appointment as a guardian would be extremely relevant
while exercising parens patriae jurisdiction.
</p><p id="p_120">92.    Insofar as Mrs. SD is concerned, it is submitted that she herself is a
person who is around 76 years of age and who has been using her thumb
impression to sign the pleadings before this Court. Her medical condition
does not entitle her to be appointed as the guardian of Mr. DMP by any
stretch of one&#x27;s imagination.

were disowned by him. One was disowned in 2016 and the second in 2017,
which was a conscious act which Mr. DMP took prior to him having been
diagnosed with a mental illness. It is submitted that the factum of
disownment not being under challenge, judicial review of the two
disownment affidavits is not possible in this writ petition. One of the sons is
stated to have made completely unfounded allegations against Mr. DMP and
given media briefings with a view to embarrass him in public. It is submitted
that the mere fact that the language in the affidavits of disownment is
identical would not take away from the fact that Mr. DMP took a conscious
step in this regard.
</p><p id="p_122">94.    Insofar as the grandsons of Mr. DMP are concerned, videos were
relied upon by ld. Sr. counsel to show that their conduct towards Mr. DMP
is vicious as they have taken to the media to criticize their grandfather.
</p><p id="p_123">95.    It is submitted that the Petitioner&#x27;s side, including the sons of Mr.
DMP, have grossly abused the process of the Court and have sought the
same reliefs in multiple proceedings. Reliance is placed on a chart to
demonstrate that the intention of the Petitioner has been to keep approaching
different forums for the same relief.
</p><p id="p_124">96.    Various allegations which have been made against Ms. UD are
objected to by Dr. Singhvi on the ground that Ms. UD was, in fact, the
person who kept the family together and brought back Mrs. SD from Patna.
Reliance is placed upon various photographs to establish that Ms. UD was
not a stranger to the family. It is submitted that since 1981, the entire family
has been living together and Ms. UD has been accepted as the wife of Mr.
DMP.

recorded in order dated 2nd June, 2021, that she is not interested in the
money or estate of Mr. DMP. She has even filed an affidavit to this effect.
Ld. Senior counsel submits that if the intention of Respondent No.5 was to
siphon off the funds or the estate of Mr. DMP, she could have done so
earlier as she has been enjoying control over Mr. DMP&#x27;s assets, along with
the brother of Mr. DMP. The fact that the estate is well preserved shows that
Respondent No.5 has no such intentions.
</p><p id="p_126">98.    On a query put by the Court as to who would be the natural guardian
for a married person, the submission of Dr. Singhvi, ld. Sr. counsel is that
this question ought to be worded in the reverse i.e., whether there is any
inhibition in appointing a person, whose companionship Mr. DMP has
enjoyed for the last approximately 47 years, as his guardian? Reliance is
placed upon Rules 7(6) and 7(7) of the RPWD (Delhi) Rules-2018 to argue
that there are various relationships that are recognized in the said provisions
and the ultimate test would be as to what would be in the best interests of the
DMP. A view has to be taken not from the perspective of a third-party or in
the interest of a third-party but in the interest of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_127">99.    It is submitted that irrespective of whether Respondent No.5 is the
wife of Mr. DMP or his companion/partner, unless and until there has been
any misdemeanour which she has exhibited qua Mr. DMP, any other
conduct of hers qua third parties would be irrelevant. If Mr. DMP expressed
his desire to live with Respondent No.5, this ought to be respected by the
Court and there is no prohibition on the Court appointing her only because
of her status as a companion. The Court is not concerned with a legally valid
relationship or a legally recognized relationship, such as a blood relative or a
spouse, but what is important is only the wish of Mr. DMP and the benefit of

Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_128">100. A query was put to Dr. Singhvi as to when was the first time Mr. DMP
was diagnosed with FTD or any other mental illness and since when has he been
administered medicines in respect of any such illness. Dr. Singhvi responded by
referring to order dated 2nd June, 2021, wherein Mrs. SD is recorded as stating that
the first time she noticed changes in Mr. DMP&#x27;s behaviour was in May, 2018 and
he was formally diagnosed with FTD only in September, 2019. When he was
formally diagnosed with FTD, Mr. DMP was advised to continue with Tab.
Aricep. Later, he was advised to start Tab. Admenta by Dr. Kameshwar
Prasad and Dr. Nand Kumar, AIIMS from February, 2020.
</p><p id="p_129">101. However, it is submitted that the fact that fleeting symptoms
of memory loss may be there for a brief period, does not mean that Mr.
DMP had no consciousness while dealing with daily activities. In fact, from
1997 onwards, he has taken oath 5 times. Photographs of Mr. DMP from
Republic Day, where he is interacting with various dignitaries, are relied
upon. Mr. DMP is also stated to have travelled to 87 countries since 1997.
The doctors have also supported the fact that the medicines being
administered to the DMP are proper and no fault has been found with the
current care being given to the DMP.
</p><p id="p_130">102. The judgments cited by the Petitioner, as well as the supporting
Respondents, are distinguished on the ground that all the judgments deal
with comatose patients who do not have any lucid intervals and in which
cases there is no contest by any family member.

of the present writ petition on the ground that the present petition has not
been filed in accordance with law.
</p><p id="p_133">104. Ld. Senior counsel submits that under the Guardians and <a href="/doc/1608688/" id="a_65">Wards Act</a>,
1890, which only applies to minors, Civil Courts have a right to administer
the estate on behalf of the minor who does not have any guardian or parent
etc. Even in the case of a mentally ill person, the matter would have to be
filed in properly constituted proceedings before the Civil Court and not in a
writ petition filed under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_66">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
</p><p id="p_134">105. After taking the Court through <a href="/doc/373687/" id="a_67">The Family Courts Act</a>, 1984, as also
the RPWD-2016 it is submitted that both the statutes do not deal with
persons with mental disabilities. Accordingly, a petition can only be
entertained by a Court exercising original civil jurisdiction under the parens
patriae doctrine, which can be invoked under Section 9 of the CPC. The test
reports, if any, after due medical examination of Mr. DMP, would have to be
verified by cross-examination of the medical expert. Since the matter
involves the taking away of a person&#x27;s right to administer his own estate or
think of his own welfare, the short-cut writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked.
</p><p id="p_135">106. Reference is made to paragraphs 5-6 of the writ petition wherein the
Petitioner seeks to invoke Sections 53 and 54(4) of the MHA-1987.
Admittedly, the said Act is no longer in operation and there are no similar
provisions under the MHA-2017.
</p><p id="p_136">107. Mr. Gopal Subramanium, ld. Sr. counsel has also made submissions
on behalf of Respondent 6. Ld. Senior counsel raises the following major
objections as to maintainability:

public law element involved in the petition. Since, in the present case, there

is no public law element involved and the issues are among private family
members, the appropriate remedy is a suit under Order XXXIIA CPC.
ii.    There are no judicially manageable standards in respect of how a writ
petition like this has to be dealt with, inasmuch as there are allegations made
which are factual in nature.
</p><p id="p_138">iii.   The Court has to bear in mind the dignity/privacy of the individual
i.e., Mr. DMP, as also Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 who are providing care to
Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_139">iv.    The motive behind filing the present writ petition is completely
clouded inasmuch as in the earlier writ petition for habeas corpus, being
W.P. (Crl.) 2255/2019 titled <a href="/doc/322504/" id="a_68">R.S v. State &amp; Ors</a>., allegations were also made
against the mother. The Division Bench made an arrangement in respect of
the care to be given to the mother and the aunt. However, insofar as the
present writ petition is concerned, the mother herself not being in a very
stable medical condition, the averments being made on behalf of the mother
are in doubt.
</p><p id="p_140">108. Ld. Senior Counsel relies upon three medical reports which have been
placed on record by Senior Neurologists/Psychiatrics. The submission is that
Mr. DMP is not completely disorientated and in fact, has various moments
of lucidity and awareness. Therefore, he cannot be held to be a completely
disabled person who requires a guardian to be appointed.
</p><p id="p_141">109. Various photographs of Mr. DMP along with Respondent No. 5 and
other family members are relied upon to argue that Respondent No. 5 has
been recognized as a member of the family and is, in fact, publicly treated as
the wife of Mr. DMP. Mr. DMP is well looked after by Respondent Nos. 5
and 6 and therefore, the current arrangement ought not to be disturbed in any

manner whatsoever.
</p><p id="p_142">110. The documents which have been filed in a sealed cover, including the
bank statements of the joint accounts of Mr. DMP and Ms. UD and the list
of immovable properties and term deposits, are relied upon to show that Mr.
DMP has always held various assets jointly with Ms. UD. It is submitted
that there is no misuse of any assets of Mr. DMP in any manner whatsoever
and Mr. DMP is conducting his own business and is capable of doing so.
</p><p id="p_143">111. Reference is made to order dated 20th September, 2019 in W.P. (Crl.)
2255/2019 to submit that the said order passed by the ld. Division Bench
was a consensual arrangement wherein it was agreed that the Petitioner
could visit Mr. DMP whenever she wanted. However, since 2019, the
acrimony that has been created is extremely high and there are several
criminal complaints and cases being filed by the parties against each other.
This may have resulted in the arrangement recorded by the ld. Division
Bench not being fully implemented. However, the grant of any relief in this
writ petition would interfere with the arrangement put in place by the ld.
Division Bench.
</p><p id="p_144">112. It is further submitted that the credentials of the Petitioner - Mrs. SD
are under severe doubt and it appears that the two sons who are estranged
from their father are using the name of Mrs. SD to file various proceedings
and make allegations against Respondent Nos.5 and 6. Reliance is placed on
a report filed by the police in a connected writ petition which shows that the
son of Mrs. SD is in fact living with her in Vasant Vihar, contrary to the
orders passed by the Division Bench.
</p><p id="p_145">113. Mr. Subramanium has taken this Court through various orders passed
by the Magistrate, as also by the Sessions Judge, to emphasise that the

criminal complaints being filed with various police stations are all mala fide
in nature inasmuch as the same allegations are being repeated across these
proceedings. Reference is made to the orders passed by the Division Bench
on 5th September, 2019 and 20th September, 2019 in the habeas corpus
petition, being W.P.(Crl.) 2255/2019 and I.A. 14889/2020 filed in
W.P.(Crl.) 2255/2019, which was withdrawn with Rs.10 lakhs being
imposed as costs.
</p><p id="p_146">114. Emphasis is also laid on the SDM&#x27;s order dated 27th October, 2020,
which directed production of Mr. DMP before the SDM with medical
assistance through Mrs. SD, which was challenged before the Sessions
Judge. The Sessions Judge clearly notes that wrongful confinement of Mr.
DMP was not established. Various suspicious circumstances surrounding the
record of the SDM were also noticed by the Sessions Judge. The conclusion
of the Sessions Judge, that the proceedings before the SDM were completely
mala fide, is relied on.
</p><p id="p_147">115. While conceding that the parens patriae jurisdiction exists with this
Court, Mr. Subramanium submits that the petition ought not to be
entertained owing to the conduct of the Petitioner and her two sons.
</p><p id="p_148">116. Mr. Mohit Mathur, ld. Senior Counsel has also appeared on behalf of
Respondent No.6.

given an undertaking about funds, moveable and immovable property etc. It
is further submitted that the ld. Division Bench has directly interacted with
her and deemed it fit to appoint her as the care giver, which would itself
show that the Division Bench expressed confidence in her character and
mannerisms.

DMP was so strained that in the marriage of both his grandsons in 2018, Mr.
DMP was not even invited.

There was no ill-intention and in fact, only three properties are covered in

she was herself partly living in Delhi and partly living in Mumbai. Mr. DMP
was the man of the house and had an overbearing personality and therefore
she did not interfere in the manner in which the house was being run. It is
further stated that she is willing to take care of Mrs. SD, as her daughter in

the same are contained in the status report. The denial is on the ground that

Submissions on behalf of Mr. DMP&#x27;s brother
</p><p id="p_155">123. Mr. Sethi, ld. Sr. Counsel appearing for Mr. US submits that he is the
younger brother of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_156">124. The father of Mr. US and Mr. DMP passed away when the brother of
Mr. DMP was two years old. Therefore, Mr. US considers Mr. DMP like a
father and he was treated by Mr. DMP like a son. Mr. US&#x27;s family consists
of his wife and five children i.e., four daughters and one son who are all
married. The family of Mr. US used to reside for long periods in Delhi along
with Mr. DMP and his family and they were treated as one homogenous
family.
</p><p id="p_157">125. Ld. Senior counsel submits that Mr. DMP was always actively
involved in politics and therefore, the companies of Mr. DMP were
entrusted to Mr. US. It is submitted that Mr. US has been managing the
companies since 1979. The companies which are being looked after by him
have manufacturing facilities in Bhopal, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and a
corporate office in Mumbai. Mr. US does not own any shares and he
continues to manage all the companies at the pleasure of Mr. DMP.

and the two sons are concerned, it is submitted that they did have
shareholdings, however, these have either been transferred or gifted. Though
a criminal complaint was filed by Mrs. SD on the ground that her signatures
were forged, the report submitted in those proceedings has found to the
contrary.
</p><p id="p_159">127. Ld. Senior counsel further submits that all the three companies are
doing extremely well and their turn over and profits have grown by leaps
and bounds. In the last few years, the profit of the companies has increased
by 300%. There is no grievance by any of the family members that the
companies are being mis-managed or that the funds are being diverged/mis-
appropriated. None of the family members have approached the NCLT,
which would be the appropriate forum. Even if Mr. DMP&#x27;s mental condition
deteriorates, it would not make any difference as Mr. US has been running
the companies since the last 40 years.

judgments:

transpired before the ld. Division Bench did not come to his notice prior to
the Division bench taking cognizance thereof, he submits that he cannot be
expected to control the adults living with Mr. DMP, so long as he is assured
that Mr. DMP is fully taken care of.
</p><p id="p_162">130. The petition is opposed on the ground that Mr. DMP is with the
people that he wished to be with i.e., Ms. UD and Mrs. KR. Any attempt by
the Court to vary the situation would negatively impact his mental condition.
There is no allegation by the Petitioner that the assets or estate of Mr. DMP
have been destroyed or wasted away. It is further submitted that Mrs. SD
herself has various ailments and would, therefore, not be a proper person to
be appointed as Mr. DMP&#x27;s guardian. The conduct of Mr. DMP&#x27;s sons is
also doubted. Reliance is placed on order dated 13thJanuary, 2021 passed in
Cont. Cas. (C) 892/2020 filed by Mrs. KR against one of the sons of Mr.
DMP for residing in the Vasant Kunj property of Mr. DMP under the guise
of visiting his ailing mother i.e., the Petitioner.

Reliance is placed on the definition of &#x27;mental behavior&#x27; in the Schedule to
the RPWD-2016 in which substantial disorders are also covered. It is in this
background that <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_75">Section 14</a> has to be considered. It is submitted that under
<a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_76">Section 14</a>, the guardianship, even in the case of total disability, is limited in
nature. It is meant for a specific period, for a specific decision and for a
specific situation. The guardian would have to be guided by the will and
desire of the subject. If the mentally ill person cannot express his will, the
same would have to be determined by taking surrounding facts into
consideration, such as written documents or any other form of expression.
The guardianship cannot be plenary.
</p><p id="p_169">136. It is submitted that Mr. DMP is clearly covered by the RPWD-2016.
The Court can consider appointment of a limited guardian for the purposes
of handling the financial affairs, property etc. of Mr. DMP. Directions can
also be issued in respect of the place where Mr. DMP would be residing and
the kind of mental assistance to be granted. The will of Mr. DMP could be
ascertained from written documents and other forms of expressions. The
Court can continue to review the situation, however, no plenary power can
be given to the guardian.

petition in 2019 and the present petition. In the former, it was submitted that
Mr. DMP and Ms. UD have confined Mrs. SD. There is no allegation about
Mr. DMP&#x27;s mental capacity in the habeas corpus petition. However, in the
present petition, allegations have been made to the effect that there was a
pre-existing mental condition since 1997. These grounds have been taken by
way of various applications. If the date of 1997 is considered, it would be 21
years prior to the habeaus corpus petition. It is submitted that there can be

no explanation as to why the relatives did not deem it fit to approach the
Court about the mental condition of Mr. DMP earlier. This proves the
malafide conduct of the family of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_171">138. Insofar as the differences between the UK Act and the <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_77">Indian Act</a>s on
mental health are concerned, ld. Senior counsel submits that this Court
cannot supplant the legislative intent with its own wisdom. The ld. Division
Bench of this Court in the habeas corpus petition could have appointed the
guardian but it did not.
</p><p id="p_172">139. Ld. Senior counsel ends his submissions by stating that his client is
willing to act as the guardian of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_173">Analysis &amp; Findings
</p><p id="p_174">140. The facts of the present case are extremely stark. Mr. DMP is
mentally ill and is suffering from `Fronto Temporal Dementia&#x27;. He barely
has any understanding of the happenings around him. He has a large family
consisting of his wife, sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren and his brother.
He also has a companion who claims to be his wife. The family of Mr.
DMP, including his companion, are split into two groups before this Court.
One group consists of Mr. DMP&#x27;s companion, his brother, his daughter-in-
law from his deceased son and her children. The second group consists of
Mr. DMP&#x27;s wife, his two sons and their wives as well as his four grandsons.
Mr. DMP himself is oblivious to the large scale of the disputes between the
two groups within his family, who have more than 50 cases, mostly
criminal, pending against each other. In the present petition, this Court is
concerned with the following questions -
</p><p id="p_175">   • Who should be the guardian for Mr. DMP?

is for invoking the parens patriae jurisdiction of this Court. The contesting
Respondents challenge the maintainability of this petition and argue that this
Court ought not to exercise parens patriae jurisdiction. It is their submission
that the prevalent arrangement ought not to be disturbed. Since there are
several aspects to be dealt with, this Court has broadly categorised them as

and small strokes since then. In 2013, as per one of the sons of Mr. DMP, he
was diagnosed with Encephalopathy. The MRI reports of Mr. DMP also
record that Encephalopathy existed since 2013. By 2019, when Mr. DMP
was admitted to AIIMS, according to Dr. MV Padma, as per the history
recorded therein, changes were noticed in Mr. DMP&#x27;s behaviour since 2017
i.e., two years before he was admitted to AIIMS. In 2019, Mr. DMP was
conclusively diagnosed with FTD by the medical board constituted by the
ld. Division Bench of this Court in W.P (Crl.) No.2255/2019. Since then, he
has been under medication for FTD. The separate reports: (i) report dated 5th
December, 2020, filed by a doctor at the Apollo Hospital; and (ii) report
dated 1st December, 2020, filed by a doctor at AIIMS, both before the
Metropolitan Magistrate, are sketchy and without any reasoning. These
reports issued by AIIMS and Apollo Hospital seem to suggest that there was
some improvement in his behaviour and he was able to manage some of his
daily activities. However, the reports of 2020 clearly record that Mr. DMP is
suffering from Major Cognitive Disorder.

introduce herself as his wife. He referred to his wife as bhagwan, madam or

<a href="/doc/29761666/" id="a_80">Section 5</a> read with Section 17 of the GWA, the Court can appoint a

Section 12 of the GWA contemplates passing of interlocutory orders for
production of the minor, and for interim protection of person and property,
as the Court thinks proper. If the minor has several properties, Section 15 of
the GWA provides, that the Court can appoint separate guardians for any
one or more of the properties. While considering what is in the welfare of
the minor, the factors to be considered are - age, sex and religion of the
minor, character and capacity of the proposed guardian, his nearness of kin
to the minor, the wish of any deceased parent, and any existing or previous
relations of the proposed guardian with the minor or his property. The
preference of the minor, if the minor is capable of an intelligent preference,
may also be considered. No one can be appointed as a guardian against the
will of the minor. As per <a href="/doc/159924539/" id="a_81">Section 20</a>, the guardians stand in a fiduciary
relationship to the ward and cannot make any profit out of his office. Any
transactions concerning purchase of each other&#x27;s property, entered into
between the guardian and the minor, would also be within the ambit of the
fiduciary relationship. The guardian can be given such remuneration as the
Court thinks fit. The guardian has to take care of the minor&#x27;s support, the
minor&#x27;s health, and education. If the guardian is appointed qua property, the
guardian has to deal with it carefully as a man of ordinary prudence would,
as it were his own. All acts which are reasonable and proper for the
realization, protection or benefit of the property, may be done by the
guardian. <a href="/doc/148885575/" id="a_82">Section 29</a> however, caveats that the guardian would not be
entitled to mortgage, charge, transfer, sale, gift, exchange or in any manner
part with the immovable property of the ward, without previous permission
of the Court. Similarly, without the Court&#x27;s permission, the guardian cannot
lease any part of the property for a term exceeding five years or one year

mental condition of such person by any of the relatives or by certain public
functionaries. The District Court was to appoint two or more persons, as the
assessors. Once the inquisition was complete, the District Court was to
record its findings as to whether the persons were in fact, mentally ill or not,
and whether the person was incapable of taking care of himself and of
managing his property or incapable of managing property only. The District
Court after recording its findings could appoint a guardian to take care of the
mentally ill person and to be the manager for management of his property. If
the person was capable of taking care of himself but required only a
manager, then an order for appointment of a manager was to be passed. If
the Court deemed it fit, the same person could be appointed as a guardian

the manager had no power to mortgage, create any charge on or, transfer by
sale, gift, exchange or otherwise, any immovable property of the mentally ill

adjudicate objections from any relatives or friends of the mentally ill
persons, if any, in such transactions. Regular inventory and accounts were to
be delivered by the manager to the appointing authority. Any relative of a
mentally ill person could sue and seek accounts from the manager.
Therefore, considerable safeguards were contained in the MHA-1987 for
rendering of accounts, performance of contracts, and execution of
conveyances by the manager/guardian. <a href="/doc/71221163/" id="a_94">Section 69</a> also provided for removal
of managers and guardians &quot;for sufficient cause&quot;. The manner of disposal
and dissolution of a partnership or the property thereof, if a person became

be treated. It gives primacy to the wishes of the PwD. It seeks to change
forced decision-making to voluntary decision-making, in respect of the care,
treatment and financial affairs concerning the property and assets of PwDs,
including mentally ill persons. This Court notes that the Committee on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, highlights this shift as below:1
       &quot;21. Where, after significant efforts have been made, it is
       not practicable to determine the will and preferences of
       an individual, the &quot;best interpretation of will and
       preferences&quot; must replace the &quot;best interests&quot;
       determinations. This respects the rights, will and
       preferences of the individual, in accordance with <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_146">article
       12</a>, paragraph 4. The &quot;best interests&quot; principle is not a
       safeguard which complies with <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_147">article 12</a> in relation to
       adults. The &quot;will and preferences&quot; paradigm must
       replace the &quot;best interests&quot; paradigm to ensure that
       persons with disabilities enjoy the right to legal capacity
       on an equal basis with others.
</p><p id="p_220">       22. All people risk being subject to &quot;undue influence&quot;,
       yet this may be exacerbated for those who rely on the
       support of others to make decisions. Undue influence is
       characterized as occurring, where the quality of the
       interaction between the support person and the person
       being supported includes signs of fear, aggression,
       threat, deception or manipulation. Safeguards for the
       exercise of legal capacity must include protection against
       undue influence; however, the protection must respect
       the rights, will and preferences of the person, including
       the right to take risks and make mistakes.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_221">172. Therefore, the crux of the provisions of the UNCRPD, which is
reflected in the two statutes as well, is that to the maximum extent possible,
the PwD or person with illness ought to be consulted.

</p><p id="p_224">173. While both these recently enacted statutes reflect significant progress
in incorporating the crux of the UNCRPD, the statutes have raised several
other concerns. This was also expressed by legislators, when the bills of
these two statutes were still being debated and discussed in the Indian
Parliament. Illustratively, the said concerns were as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_148">       a)      That the details regarding the guardianship of mentally ill
               persons and management of their property were provided for
               only in the MHA-1987, which would be repealed by the
               enactment of the Mental Healthcare Bill, 2013 (hereinafter,
               &#x27;MHA Bill 2013&#x27;). Such guardianship provisions were absent in
               the MHA Bill 2013 and were only provided for in the Rights of
               Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014 (hereinafter, &#x27;RPWD Bill&#x27;)
               which was still being debated in the Parliament. If the MHA
               Bill 2013, were passed without the guardianship provisions and
               without enactment of the RPWD-2016, the MHA-1987 would
               be repealed and consequently, there would be a legal vacuum
               on the law of guardianship of mentally ill persons and their
               property. Thus, the MHA Bill 2013 ought not to be enacted
               prior to the RPWD-2016;2

               parents, so that they can take decisions on behalf of the patient.

</p><p id="p_238">179. Unlike MHA-1987, the MHA-2017 makes a fundamental change in
respect of dealing with property and affairs of mentally ill persons.
</p><p id="p_239">180. In the opinion of this Court, the MHA-2017 has to be interpreted as
having been enacted only to deal with the delivery of mental healthcare, and
services and for connected matters. The deletion of provisions with respect
to property and affairs and the absence of any provisions in respect of
moveable or immovable assets, financial affairs, legal capacity, legal aid,
etc. in the said statute is clearly a conscious departure from the earlier
regime. Such issues are dealt with under the RPWD-2016. Various
submissions have been addressed by all parties in this petition, as to which is
the prior and which is the later enactment. However, for the present
purposes, the said issue does not require adjudication as it is clear that both
these statutes deal with mentally ill persons. It is in fact, the purpose and
scope of both these statutes, that is distinct and different. Thus, the debate as
to which is the earlier and the later enactment would be unnecessary.

<p id="p_240">(ii)    Support/Guardianship Arrangements
</p><p id="p_241">181. Under the MHA-2017, the nominated representative can be decided
by the mentally ill person by giving an advance directive. However, in the
absence of an advance directive under Section 14(4) of the MHA-2017, the
order of precedence has been set out. As per the said order, a relative would
be the person who shall be deemed to be a nominated representative in order
to carry out the duties in accordance with under Section 17 of the MHA-
2017.

respect of decisions of treatment, and for taking all decisions in respect of

providing access to family, rehabilitation services, planning of admission,
planning of discharge, appointments of attendants, give or withhold consent
for research on behalf of the mentally ill persons. However, all these
decisions are to be taken considering the current and past wishes of the
person concerned, the life history, values, cultural background and the best
interest of the person. Credence has to be given to the views of the person
with mental illness to the extent that the person understands the nature of the
decisions. Thus, the treatment and healthcare to be given to the mentally ill
person has to be in the particular context of that person&#x27;s life history.
Further, the nominated representative has to ensure that timely treatment is
also given to the mentally ill person. In fact, access to mental healthcare is a
recognized right under <a href="/doc/190887952/" id="a_152">Section 18</a> and Section 18(2) of the MHA-2017,
contemplates that the mental healthcare and treatment provided should be of
good quality and easily accessible. However, the provision also requires that
the same is provided in a manner that is acceptable to the person with mental
illness and to his/her family. <a href="/doc/190887952/" id="a_153">Section 18</a> reads as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_167">       &quot;18. (1) Every person shall have a right to access mental
       healthcare and treatment from mental health services run
       or funded by the appropriate Government.
       (2) The right to access mental healthcare and treatment
       shall mean mental health services of affordable cost, of
       good quality, available in sufficient quantity, accessible
       geographically, without discrimination on the basis of
       gender, sex, sexual orientation, religion, culture, caste,
       social or political beliefs, class, disability or any other
       basis and provided in a manner that is acceptable to
       persons with mental illness and their families and care-
       givers.&quot;

ensure that the rights of the mentally ill person are not in any manner
prejudiced, curtailed or harmed. In this background, it is notable that Section
14(4) of the MHA-2017, gives precedence to the &#x27;relative&#x27; of a mentally ill
person over a care-giver, and such relative could be person related by blood,
marriage or adoption. The definition of &#x27;relative&#x27; comes from Section 2(za)
of the MHA-2017, as under:-
</p><p id="p_244">       &quot;(za) &quot;relative&quot; means any person related to the person
       with mental illness by blood, marriage or adoption;&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_245">184. Thus, it is clear that under the MHA-2017, while appointing a
nominated representative, a relative by blood or marriage or adoption under
<a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_154">Section 14(4)(b)</a>, is given precedence over a care-giver under <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_155">Section
14(4)(c)</a>. The measures taken qua the mentally ill person ought to be
acceptable to the family members, who cannot be ignored.
</p><p id="p_246">185. Having discussed the scope of the MHA-2017, this Court now turns to
the RPWD-2016. The first and most important right in the context of the
present case would be the right of access to justice and the right to legal
capacity, for PwDs. Some other important rights include the right of the
person to live in community, and to be protected against abuse, violation and
exploitation. It is relevant to note that under Section 13 of the RPWD-2016,
the right to legal capacity is to be ensured, which contemplates the right of
the PwD to take all decisions in respect of his or her financial affairs, and
own or inherit movable or immovable property, have access to bank loans,
etc. To protect this right further, <a href="/doc/60235991/" id="a_156">Section 13(3)</a> provides that if a conflict of
interest arises between the PwD and the person providing support in respect
of financial, property and other economic transactions, the conflicted
persons providing support shall abstain from providing support. Section


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_96">W.P.(C) 1271/2020                                                        Page 92 of 147</span>

13(3) proviso clarifies that the mere fact that the person is related by blood,
affinity or adoption, would not lead to presumption of conflict of interest.
This therefore, leads to the conclusion that there has to be something more
than the existence of a relationship by blood/affinity/adoption, for such a
conflict to arise. <a href="/doc/38053255/" id="a_157">Section 13(5)</a> further protects PwDs from undue influence
and respect is to be accorded to their autonomy, dignity and privacy.
</p><p id="p_247">186. In so far as the question concerning appointment of guardian or
support arrangements under the RPWD-2016 is concerned, Section 14 of the
RPWD-2016 becomes relevant, in addition to <a href="/doc/38053255/" id="a_158">Section 13</a>. While a
nominated representative is contemplated under the MHA-2017 for
healthcare and treatment decisions, under the RPWD-2016, <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_159">Section 14</a>
stipulates the manner in which limited guardians can be appointed, to take
legally binding decisions on behalf of the PwD - only in consultation with
the PwD. If the PwD is unable to do so, despite the support already
provided, the power to appoint a guardian, vests with the District Court or
any designated authority. This provision has been considerably debated
during the course of arguments in the present case. The submission on
behalf of the Respondent Nos. 5 and 6 as also the Intervenor, is that only a
limited guardian can be appointed, as the RPWD-2016 has limited the scope
of all guardianship under law. There cannot be a plenary guardian unlike the
MHA-1987, as per Respondents 5 &amp; 6. It is this submission that needs to be
tested while interpreting Section 14 of the RPWD-2016.
</p><p id="p_248">187. <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_160">Section 14</a> contemplates provision of support by appointing a
guardian. Such a guardian is termed as a limited guardian, as it is presumed
under this provision that a PwD would have expressed or would be able to
express his or her desires to such a limited guardian. This is evident from

both from the language of <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_161">Section 14</a> and from the definition and
categorization of disabilities under the RPWD-2016. There are certain
features of the guardianship contemplated under this provision.
</p><p id="p_249">188. First, the Explanation to <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_162">Section 14(1)</a> deals with limited guardianship
as having the following elements:-
</p><pre id="pre_5">       a)      It is a system of joint decision.
       b)      It operates on mutual understanding and trust between the
               guardian and the PWD.
       c)      It is for a specific period.
       d)      It is for specific decisions.
       e)      It is for specific situations.
       f)      It should operate as per the will of the person with disability.

</pre><p id="p_250">189. All the above elements contemplate an inherent capacity in the person
with disability to express his or her will, which is the basis for operating on
&quot;mutual understanding and trust&quot;. If such will of the person is not capable
of being expressed or if a person is suffering from a mental condition which
can grossly impair his or her judgment, behaviour or capacity to even
understand the ordinary demands of life, such a person cannot be assisted by
a limited guardian. Consequently, <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_163">Section 14</a> envisages limited guardianship
in the case of such PwDs, who have expressed their desires in the past or are
able to express their desires, going forward.

disabilities, as the definition of disabilities is extremely wide. A person who
has low vision and hearing impairment or a physical disability is a PwD as
much as a person with a mental disability or blood disorder. The gamut of

disabilities thus covered under Section 2(s) of the RPWD-2016 is any long-
term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment. Notably, while
specified disabilities are set out in the Schedule to the MHA-2017, general
disabilities are not. Thus, the kind of disabilities which a person can be
afflicted with in terms of <a href="/doc/166363552/" id="a_164">Section 2(s)</a> is broad, elastic and ever-changing. It
is not restricted to a disability that is currently known. As scientific advances
are made in the medical field, there could be disabilities which are unknown
today which may be identified in the future. <a href="/doc/166363552/" id="a_165">Section 2(s)</a> would then have to
cover disabilities which are even yet to be identified.
</p><p id="p_252">191. A perusal of the definitions shows that the categories of PwD are
broadly - simple PwD and persons with benchmark disabilities. In order to
determine who are the `persons with benchmark disabilities&#x27;, the statute
gives guidance through the Schedule, pursuant to Section 2(zc) of the
RPWD-2016. It includes persons with physical disability including visual
impairment, intellectual disability, mental behaviour disability, disability
due to chronic neurological conditions or blood disorders, or a combination
of the above disabilities, and any other categories notified as specified
disabilities by the Central Government. Section 2(r) of the RPWD-2016
further deals with a further sub-category that if a person has such specified
disability which is 40% or higher, it would be a person with &#x27;benchmark
disability&#x27;. Within persons with benchmark disabilities, a further sub-set,
namely, &#x27;persons with disability having high support needs&#x27;. Such persons
could be persons with mental illness whose judgment, behaviour and
capacity are grossly impaired or persons who have chronic neurological
conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, blood disorders,
etc.

</p><p id="p_254">192. Keeping this scope of the RPWD-2016 in mind, it is clear that <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_166">Section
14</a> could not restrict support to only appointment of a limited guardian,
which would cater merely to PwDs who would be able to participate in a
limited guardianship arrangement. This becomes clearer in view of the
proviso to <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_167">Section 14(1)</a> which recognizes the grant of &#x27;total support&#x27; under
two conditions:-
</p><p id="p_255">       a)      In respect of PwDs requiring such support; or
</p><p id="p_256">       b)      If the limited guardianship is to be granted repeatedly.
</p><p id="p_257">193. Since the RPWD-2016 deals with an extremely wide range of
disabilities, <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_168">Section 14</a> is suitably crafted to take into consideration those
persons who are unable to express their will to the limited guardian. A PwD
having high support needs or a PwD requiring such support due to any other
factors, would be squarely covered as a PwD requiring total support under
<a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_169">Section 14</a>.
</p><p id="p_258">194. It is interesting to note that the word used in the Proviso to <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_170">Section 14</a>
is &#x27;total support&#x27; and not &#x27;plenary guardian&#x27;, as was contained in the RPWD
Bill, in the spirit of the UNCRPD which gives primacy to the PwD and to
his or her will, preference or consent. &#x27;Total support&#x27; is also a terminology
which is used in contrast with &#x27;plenary guardian&#x27;, as it recognizes the
possibility of the PwD being treated or cured in a manner which would
enable him or her to take decisions in the future in which case, the nature
and manner of support could also be decreased. This is clear from a reading
of a proviso which contemplates that the provision of total support shall be
reviewed i.e., if the person with disability is treated, cared for and cured or
empowered to take decision, then the nature and manner of support could
also be decreased.

</p><p id="p_260">195. This is also confirmed by a perusal of the drafting history of the
UNCRPD, where during the discussion on <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_171">Article 12</a> of the UNCRPD when
asked how supported decision making would be implemented in a situation
where the PwD was incapable of decision making. The relevant excerpt
reads as under:6
       &quot;The Chair believed that paradigm shift of operating on
       an assumption of competence rather than incompetence
       exists already in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_172">Article 12</a>, via the progression that
       states begin with a premise of legal capacity, proceed to
       supported decision making when required and move to
       substitute decision making only as a matter of last resort.
       Nonetheless, a number of states have asserted that,
       because there will be cases that require substitute
       decision making, or guardianship, it is better to provide
       safeguards in these extreme cases rather than leaving it
       open. The IDC&#x27;s position opposes mentioning
       guardianship at all in the text. The Chair asked for
       clarification regarding whether the IDC does accept that
       there will be circumstances in which there will be a need
       for substitute decision making.
</p><p id="p_261">       The IDC stated that it expects the notion of guardianship
       to be phased out.
</p><p id="p_262">       The difference between supported and substitute
       decision making is that, in a supported situation, the
       person with a disability is at the center of the discourse.
       The premise of supported decision making is that it
       ranges from zero to 100% and is a dynamic concept. As
       capacity increases, support decreases - a concept that is
       not allowed in guardianship.
</p><p id="p_263">       The Chair responded by referring to the IDC&#x27;s assertion
       that the need for support ranges from zero to 100%, and
       asked if 100% support is not the same as substitute
       decision making. While he understood the support

       &quot;100% support &quot;substitute decision making&quot; or
       &quot;guardianship&quot;, the result is the same if the subject of
       the decision does not participate in the decision. When
       this does occur, states are arguing that it is better to
       specify safeguards rather than leaving it open.
       The IDC responded that the point regarding abuse and
       the need to regulate are addressed by text proposed by
       Canada and can also be taken care of in other articles.
       The IDC goal is to not legitimize guardianship. The point
       is that a need for 100% support percent will become 99%
       and then 98% percent if we are talking about supported
       decision making and this would not be possible in a
       guardianship situation.

</p><p id="p_266">       Xxx
       There may be a way to frame the idea of substitution
       within the context of support with some creative thinking
       about the idea of the scale of support ranging from zero
       to 100%.&quot;
</p><p id="p_267">196. Based on this analysis, this Court is of the opinion that the intention of
the RPWD-2016, is to first, examine if the PwD is capable of expressing his
or her will or preferences, and second, under exceptional circumstances,
where consultation is not possible, enable the provision of total support.
</p><p id="p_268">197. In this determination of consultation, and will and preferences, it is
important to understand that the level of consultation required would also

held that consultation required under <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_174">Section 14</a> would depend on the

       &quot;It is pointed out across the bar that, appointment of a
       guardian, in terms of Section 14 of the PwD Act, is to be
       done by the authority in consultation with the ward, and
       that, considering the degree of disability of the ward,
       &quot;consultation&quot; as prescribed under the provision would
       be a near impossibility. Here it is to be noticed that, the
       process of consultation with a person with illness and its
       efficacy, would in each case vary depending on the
       comprehending capacity of the person with illness. It is
       for the authority notified in terms of the Section to make
       its endeavour to have the process of consultation done;
       but it is to be noted that, the term &quot;consultation&quot;
       occuring in <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_175">Section 14</a> will necessarily have to be
       understood and appreciated giving due regard to the
       degree of disability of the person with illness, and his
       capacity to comprehend and interact. Therefore, the term
       &quot;consultation&quot; occuring in <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_176">Section 14</a> has to be
       understood in a practical way, that is, &quot;consultation to
       the extent possible in a given circumstance&quot;.&quot;

capability of the person with mental illness to consult.

Respondents i.e., the sons of Mr. DMP, is that the present petition is
maintainable as:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_171">       (i)     Mr. DMP is mentally ill and the present status as it prevails is
       not in the interest of Mr. DMP as Respondents Nos.5 &amp; 6 have

</p><p id="p_276">202. The question of maintainability has two aspects, one which is legal
and the second, which is factual. This Court will first discuss the legal aspect
of parens patriae jurisdiction. The doctrine of parens patriae traces its
origin back to the 13th Century. The term literally means &#x27;father of his
country&#x27;, which power vested in the Monarch. The doctrine of parens
patriae recognises the power and duty of the Monarch to extend protection
to such persons who are unable to care for themselves as also their property.
In democratic countries, the same power vests in the people and is exercised
by Courts. The said doctrine is elucidated in Corpus Juris Secundum (67A

       the states, the state, as a sovereign, is the parens patriae.
       The doctrine of parens patriae expresses the inherent
       power and authority of the state to provide protection of
       the person and property of a person non sui juris, and
       under the doctrine the state has the sovereign power of
       guardianship over persons of disability, and in the
       execution of the doctrine the legislature is possessed of
       inherent power to provide protection to persons non sui
       juris and to make and enforce such rules and regulations
       as it deems proper for the management of their
       property.&quot;

<p id="p_277">203. Under this jurisdiction, protection is extended to vulnerable sections
of the population, including minors, persons who are mentally ill and any
other category of persons who are considered vulnerable persons or persons
with a legal disability.
</p><p id="p_278">204. In the UK, under the parens patriae jurisdiction Courts would extend
protection to vulnerable persons or persons with legal disability in society.
Under this jurisdiction, directions can be passed in respect of safety and
security of persons, medical treatment, management of property and other
related matters, management of financial affairs etc. The said jurisdiction,
has been held to no longer survive in respect of mentally ill persons after the

       While the history of that jurisdiction and the manner of
       its exercise from its inception until the present day is of
       the greatest interest, I do not consider that it would serve
       any useful purpose to recount it here. I say that because
       it was accepted by the Court of Appeal and not
       challenged by any of the parties to be appeal before your
       Lordships, that the present situation with regard to the

       of the parens patriae jurisdiction as related to minors
       survives now in the form of the wardship jurisdiction of
       the High Court, Family Division. Secondly, so much of
       the parens patriae jurisdiction as related to persons of

even while institutionalising such persons, the participation of close relatives

parents and close relatives of a mentally retarded person, who have cared for

person have to be considered by the Court in deciding the manner in which
care is to be given.
</p><p id="p_302">218. As noted in the concerns raised during the Parliamentary debates
concerning the MHA-2017 and also from the lack of designated authorities
explained above, there are gaps unaddressed by the legislations. The social
fabric of family structures in India ought to be considered. In the same vein,
the Court notes that the MHA-1987 had laid down certain standards and
factors to be considered while determining the &quot;best interest&quot; of the
mentally ill person. However, under RPWD-2016 and the MHA-2017, no
guidance exists as to what would constitute the &quot;wills and preferences&quot; of
the person. Under Section 14 of RPWD-2016, limited guardianship is for a
specific period, a specific decision and a specific situation, in accordance
with the will of the PwD. Even in the proviso to <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_187">Section 14(1)</a>, the factors to
be considered for providing total support are conspicuously absent. The
MHA-2017 has no provision in respect of management of financial affairs,
appointment of guardians or the manner in which the moveable/immovable
property of the mentally ill person is to be taken care of. Thus, there is a
clear statutory vacuum.

the question as to which Court has to exercise it and in what manner is one
of mere procedure. So long as the &quot;wills and preferences&quot; of the mentally ill

Court exercising parens patriae jurisdiction, it cannot be held that the High
Court exercising power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_189">Article 226</a> is denuded of power in view of

relative as defined under the MHA-2017, as extracted above, as a person
related to the person with mental illness by blood, marriage or adoption. On
the other hand, the RPWD-2016 does not define who can be a guardian.
While some institutional mechanisms are contemplated under the RPWD-
2016, the existence and the viability of such institutions has not been
addressed before this Court during the course of submissions by either party.
Under the RPWD (Delhi) Rules-2018, the preference of merit for
appointment as a limited guardian is contained in Rule 7(6). The preference
therein is to blood relatives, adult children, siblings, spouse, and it is only
thereafter that care givers or other personalities can be considered. There,
the common principle seems to be preference to relatives over caregivers or
other unrelated people.
</p><p id="p_308">223. In the opinion of this Court, the nominated representative or total
support arrangement or guardian need not always be an individual.
Guardianship could be exercised by even a guardianship committee,
depending upon the facts, as long as such a committee would be an
appropriate measure for enabling the person to exercise his legal capacity, as
per his will and preferences. If the mentally ill person requires complex
medical decisions to be taken, has an expanse of moveable/immovable
assets, and requires management of complex financial affairs, and the Court
is of the opinion that this entire function cannot be performed by one
individual, a committee can be appointed.
</p><p id="p_309">224. Judicial precedent in India on the appointment of a guardian has
usually related to cases where persons are in comatose condition or are

example:

be appointed. Persons who may have engaged in conduct that is detrimental
to the mentally ill person or who have exercised undue influence, coercion,
duress ought not to be appointed. These factors have been considered by
Courts in various cases, especially under the MHA-1987. For instance:

               properties. Thus, the appeal was dismissed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_227">       b)      In Avinash Chander Mookhy (supra), a family friend had

               friend or the brother of the lady, ought to be appointed as the
               guardian. In respect of one of the brothers who sought
               guardianship, the Court noted that he was resident abroad and
               only wanted legal guardianship, but not to discharge his moral
               obligations. The only other application for guardianship was
               made by the family friend, but the same could also not be

</blockquote><p id="p_313">228. In Rajni Hariom Sharma (supra), the Bombay High Court made
extremely important observations in respect of the status of a wife. The said
paragraphs are set out below:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_229">       &quot;37. Before moving to <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_192">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of
       India, status of the petitioner who seeks to be the
       guardian of Mr. Hariom Sharma, her husband, needs to
       be elaborated upon and discussed a little more in detail.
       In the present case, evidently the parties are Hindus;
       parties not in any adversarial sense but in the context of
       petitioner&#x27;s claim to represent her husband as his
       guardian, considering his medical condition. That brings
       us to the question of status of wife in the Indian social,
       philosophical, religious and legal context.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_230">       38. According to Hindu vedic philosophy, marriage is a
       sanskar or a sacrament. What is essentially contemplated
       is a union of two souls. The eternal being is composed of
       two halves i.e., the man and the woman. Both the halves
       are equal and one-half is incomplete without the other.
       As long as the wife survives, one half of the husband
       survives. Ancient Hindu tradition says that a man&#x27;s life
       can never be complete without a wife i.e., his Ardhangini
       or his better half. They are considered to be equal
       partners. Wife is not only considered to be Ardhangini
       but is also referred to as &#x27;Sahadharmini&#x27;. Literal
       meaning of the concept of Ardhangini is that a Hindu
       woman is associated with her husband in the journey of
       life for fulfillment and for attainment of all goals. She is
       also referred to as Sahayogini co-operating with her
       husband in all his activities as well as a Sahakarmini
       which means having an equal share in the actions of her
       husband. Together they are referred as Dampati. In
       Manusmriti, Manu had declared the wife as not just
       Patni but Dharmapatni meaning thereby that under
       dharma she is under obligation to discharge and perform
       all duties of her husband.

       (2014) 1 SCC 225, Supreme Court was deciding an
       appeal by the husband against the judgment of the High
       Court setting aside judgment and decree of divorce
       granted in favour of the appellant husband by the trial
       Court. High Court had not only set aside the judgment
       and decree of divorce but had also allowed the
       application of respondent wife against the appellant by
       granting restitution of conjugal rights. By the said
       decision, Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of the
       appellant husband and upheld the judgment of the High
       Court. In that context, Supreme Court observed that
       under Hindu Law, marriage is an institution and is
       highly revered in India. Life is made up of good times
       and bad, and the bad times can bring with it terrible
       illnesses and extreme hardships. Partners in a marriage
       must weather these storms.

       doubt that conceptually the wife can be said to be best-

       comatose condition or vegetative state.&quot;

       even a concubine in an etymological sense be a
       &quot;relative&quot;. The word &quot;relative&quot; brings within its purview
       a status. Such a status must be conferred either by blood
       or marriage or adoption. If no marriage has taken place,
       the question of one being relative of another would not
       arise.&quot;

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_236">        &quot;Marriage and marital relationship
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_237">        24. Marriage is often described as one of the basic civil
        rights of man/woman, which is voluntarily undertaken
        by the parties in public in a formal way, and once
        concluded, recognizes the parties as husband and wife.
        Three elements of common law marriage are (1)
        agreement to be married (2) living together as husband
        and wife, (3) holding out to the public that they are
        married. Sharing a common household and duty to live
        together form part of the &#x27;Consortium Omnis Vitae&quot;
        which obliges spouses to live together, afford each other
        reasonable marital privileges and rights and be honest
        and faithful to each other. One of the most important
        invariable consequences of marriage is the reciprocal
        support and the responsibility of maintenance of the
        common household, jointly and severally. Marriage as
        an institution has great legal significance and various
        obligations and duties flow out of marital relationship,
        as per law, in the matter of inheritance of property,
        successionship, etc. Marriage, therefore, involves legal
        requirements of formality, publicity, exclusivity and all
        the legal consequences flow out of that relationship.

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_239">        &quot;Marriage and the family are social institutions of vital
        importance. Entering into and sustaining a marriage is
        a matter of intense private significance to the parties to
        that marriage for they make a promise to one another to
        establish and maintain an intimate relationship for the
        rest of their lives which they acknowledge obliges them
        to support one another, to live together and to be faithful
        to one another. Such relationships are of profound
        significance to the individuals concerned. But such
        relationships have more than personal significance at
        least in part because human beings are social beings
        whose humanity is expressed through their relationships
        with others. Entering into marriage therefore is to enter
        into a relationship that has public significance as well.
        The institutions of marriage and the family are
        important social institutions that provide for the
        security, support and companionship of members of our
        society and bear an important role in the rearing of
        children. The celebration of a marriage gives rise to
        moral and legal obligations, particularly the reciprocal
        duty of support placed upon spouses and their joint
        responsibility for supporting and raising children born
        of the marriage. These legal obligations perform an
        important social function. This importance is
        symbolically acknowledged in part by the fact that
        marriage is celebrated generally in a public ceremony,
        often before family and close friends....&quot;

       projected or conducted themselves as husband and wife
       and treated by friends, relatives and others, as if they are
       a married couple. On the other hand, it is the specific
       case of the appellant that the respondent had never held
       out to the public that she was his wife. No evidence of
       socialization in public has been produced. There is
       nothing to show that there was pooling of resources or
       financial arrangements between them. On the other hand,
       it is the specific case of the appellant that the respondent
       had never opened any joint account or executed any
       document in the joint name. Further, it was also
       submitted that the respondent never permitted to suffix
       his name after the name of the appellant. No evidence is
       forthcoming, in this case, to show that the respondent
       had caused any harm or injuries or endangered the

       physical or sexual abuse on the appellant, except that he

       relationships are not relationships in the nature of
       marriage. Appellant&#x27;s and the respondent&#x27;s relationship

       characteristic of a marriage, but a relationship other
       than &quot;in the nature of marriage&quot; and the appellant&#x27;s

       &quot;domestic relationship&quot; under <a href="/doc/1316495/" id="a_199">Section 2(f)</a> of the DV Act.
       If we hold that the relationship between the appellant and
       the respondent is a relationship in the nature of a
       marriage, we will be doing an injustice to the legally
       wedded wife and children who opposed that relationship.
       Consequently, any act, omission or commission or
       conduct of the respondent in connection with that type of
       relationship, would not amount to &quot;domestic violence&quot;

<p id="p_317">234. The Supreme Court clearly concludes that if a person in a live-in

wedded wife and children.

        Position)

</p><p id="p_321">236. Before answering the above question, some facts surrounding Mr.
DMP need to be noticed. Mr. DMP is a 7th Term Member of Parliament who
lives in the Lutyens Bungalow zone in Delhi. He is a man who has built an
enormous empire and an entrepreneur who has set up an extremely
successful business. He owns moveable and immovable assets, including
immovable property in Delhi and Mumbai, bank deposits in various banks,
shares/debentures in four companies forming part of the Aristo
Pharmaceuticals Group etc.
</p><p id="p_322">237. A perusal of the record reveals that Mr. DMP was a family man. He
hails from Bihar and has extended family in Bihar. However, his immediate
family consists of the following persons:
</p><pre id="pre_6">        i)     Wife - Mrs. SD
        ii)    Son - Mr. RS and his wife
        iii)   Son - Mr. RJS and his wife
        iv)    Daughter-in-law from deceased son - Mrs. KR
        v)     6 Grandsons
        vi)    Brother - Mr. US, who is currently the Managing Director of

wife of the deceased son of Mr. DMP - Mrs. KR and by the younger brother
of Mr. DMP - Mr. US.
</p><p id="p_325">240. The vexed question before this Court is as to who ought to be
appointed as the guardian of Mr. DMP, for taking decisions relating to his
health care and his financial affairs/properties. All the persons who have
appeared before this Court have consented to being appointed as guardians.
</p><p id="p_326">241. From the documents placed on record, certain facts would be required
to be noticed. Mr. DMP was married to Mrs. SD in the year 1960, through
whom he had three sons. One son passed away in 2011. There were
indications of mental illness in Mr. DMP since 1997, as is clear from the
report of Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai. Mr. DMP always lived with his wife
and children in the company of Ms. UD in the same house. Mr. DMP did not
divorce or legally separate himself from his wife - Mrs. SD. Photographs
on record show Mr. DMP along with his children, grandchildren, daughters-
in-law, Mrs. SD and Ms. UD all living in the same house. The photographs
also show that the sons were involved in the business of Mr. DMP and were
travelling for conferences etc. within India till 2013-2014. An apartment was
taken on rent in 2018 for one of the sons - Mr. RS, which was paid for by
Mr. DMP&#x27;s company - M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. Mrs. SD
owned a large number of shares in the company which have, however, been
transferred and now stand in the name of Mrs.KR. As on date, neither Mrs.
SD nor Mr. DMP&#x27;s children own any shareholding in any of Mr. DMP&#x27;s
companies.
</p><p id="p_327">242. Respondent No.5 i.e., Ms. UD has placed on record a passport of Mr.
DMP from the year 2000, wherein Ms. UD has been shown as his wife.

SD is clearly mentioned as Mr. DMP&#x27;s wife.
</p><p id="p_328">243. Several criminal complaints have been filed by the parties against one
another. It is Ms. UD&#x27;s case that Mr. DMP has disowned both his sons.
Affidavits dated 5th July, 2016 and 17th October, 2017 are relied upon.
However, in response to these affidavits, it is argued that the language of
these affidavits is identical and hence, not genuine. Secondly, the genuinity
of the affidavit disowning Mr. RS is contested on the ground that the same
was never placed before or mentioned in the Habeas Corpus proceedings
before the ld. Division Bench. Thus, the disownment affidavits are disputed
documents.
</p><p id="p_329">244. The case of the Petitioner and her sons is that Respondent No.5
prevented the family from meeting Mr. DMP, which led to the filing of the
Habeas Corpus petition. The said petition was filed by Mr. RJS, seeking the
production of his mother Mrs. SD. The proceedings and the status report
filed in the said writ petition by the police show that Mrs. SD and Mr. US&#x27;s
wife - Mrs. RD were living under confinement. This led the Division Bench
to take extremely serious note of the facts revealed in the status reports,
which resulted in the Court directing a medical assessment of Mr. DMP. As
recorded in the orders passed by the ld. Division Bench, the Court had met
Mr. DMP, his wife and his son - Mr. RJS and noticed that Mr. DMP was
incoherent and could not recognise his own family members. These facts
had never been disclosed to the family of Mr. DMP i.e. his wife and
children. The fact that Mr. DMP was suffering from FTD was revealed
during the course of the proceedings in the Habeas Corpus petition. The
Division Bench had directed investigation into the manner and for four
weeks Respondent No.5 was directed to live outside the Bungalow.

However, after the expiry of four weeks, Respondent No.5 has moved back
into the Bungalow.
</p><p id="p_331">245. The present petition has been filed by the wife of Mr. DMP i.e., Mrs.
SD, who had, since being moved by the ld. Division Bench to the property
in Vasant Vihar, not met her husband. During the pendency of this writ
petition, Mrs. SD has met Mr. DMP on a few occasions for a limited time.
The said meetings have been extremely cordial and there has been no breach
of tranquillity or peace. Mr. DMP has enjoyed the company of Mrs. SD, as
is evident from the Local Commissioner&#x27;s Reports, though he does not
remember her name. This Court has also interacted with Mr. DMP, Mrs. SD,
the three daughters-in-law, the two sons and Ms. UD. Decisions relating to
the medical treatment of Mr. DMP, during the period when Mr. DMP was
estranged from his family members, are being taken by Ms. UD. The two
secretaries of Mr. DMP i.e., Mr. T.R. Narayanan and Mr. Shrinath Banerjee,
work under the directions of Ms. UD. The entire household is run by Ms.
UD. There are various bank accounts in which Ms. UD is a joint account
holder. All the shares which were in the name of Mrs. SD now stand in the
name of Mrs. KR. Mrs.KR is also stated to have appointed her brother as a
Director in M/s Mapra Labs.
</p><p id="p_332">246. Since 2016-2017, family&#x27;s access to Mr. DMP has been completely
blocked. A General Power of Attorney is stated to have been executed in
January, 2020 in favour of Mrs. KR to manage three properties of Mr. DMP.
A lease agreement has also been entered into by Mrs. KR as the GPA holder
with M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Private Limited in January, 2020, renting
out the property in Vasant Vihar, where, pursuant to the ld. Division
Bench&#x27;s order, Mrs. SD is presently living. The said lease has been executed

by Mrs. KR on behalf of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_333">247. In the background of the above facts, the status of the various
relatives of Mr. DMP is to be considered:
</p><p id="p_334">Mrs. SD (Wife of Mr. DMP)
</p><p id="p_335">248. Insofar as Mrs. SD is concerned, the only submission against her
being appointed as the guardian is that she is illiterate and may not be
capable of taking decisions for Mr. DMP. It is also alleged that she is under
the control of her sons who have influenced her into filing various litigations
against Ms. UD and Mrs. KR.
</p><p id="p_336">249. The status of Mrs. SD as the wife of Mr. DMP cannot be questioned
as it has been repeatedly reflected in various public records, including a
decision of the Patna High Court in Civil Writ No. 22948/2011
where Mr. US was one of the Petitioners and where Mrs. SD has been
described as the wife of Mr. DMP. Mrs. SD has borne children through Mr.
DMP and has cordial relations with both her sons, daughters-in-law and
grandchildren.
</p><p id="p_337">250. The Court has interacted with her and finds her to be a simple lady
who is a housemaker who has lived in the company of Mr. DMP. She is
visible in various photographs which have been placed on record, along with
other family members. Even Mrs. KR, in her statement to the Court, has
submitted that she respects Mrs. SD and refers to her as &#x27;Maa-ji&#x27; and has no
dispute with Mrs. SD. The Court asked Mrs. SD some questions through the
virtual platform which she was able to answer, though she did experience
some issues hearing. Thus, in effect, there are no serious allegations against
Mrs. SD.

Mr. RJS (youngest son of Mr. DMP)

</p><p id="p_339">251. In respect of this son, it is argued that he is of very aggressive
behaviour and has publicly made statements against his father - Mr. DMP,
who is stated to have been extremely hurt by his conduct and disowned him

has been placed on record and has been viewed by the Court. There are
certain allegations that he, in violation of the order of the ld. Division
Bench, started to live with his mother in the Vasant Vihar property after she
had moved there by virtue of the ld. Division Bench&#x27;s order.
</p><p id="p_340">252. Ld. Counsel for Mr. RJS has, however, placed on record documents to
show that Mr. RJS&#x27;s rent for the year 2018-19 and his car parking charges
for the year 2017 were being paid by M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd.
i.e., Mr. DMP&#x27;s flagship company. It is submitted that Mr. RJS has travelled
with Mr. DMP for conferences in 2013 and 2015 and unlike his brothers,
who were only made Directors, he was made the Joint Managing Director of
M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. It has also been claimed that till about
September, 2019, the employees of M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd.
were reporting to Mr. RJS. It is submitted that the allegations against Mr.
RJS are baseless and in response to him taking a stand against Ms. UD and

Apart from the affidavit of disownment, there is no other allegation raised

       she no longer has any relationship with her son or her
       daughter in law. She based her claim to ownership of the
       suit property on a will. The daughter in law has not
       admitted the will. Nor has it been proved in RFA (OS)
       24/2012 Page 23 probate proceedings. Often, sons move
       out, or transfer properties or ownership rights, or shares
       in immovable properties, at the hint of trouble or discord
       with their wives, in favour of their relatives. Likewise, the
       parents of the husband often in such cases &quot;disown&quot; them
       after the son moves out from the common or &quot;joint&quot;
       premises owned by either or both his parents, when there
       is outbreak of marital discord. Courts have to be
       cautious in their approach, while entertaining and short
       circuiting suits for possession, which are in effect
       directed against the plaintiffs&#x27; daughter-in law, or else
       the right of residence in shared households would be a
       mere chimera, a teasing illusion which the law grandly
       promises, but is seldom, if ever, able to enforce. In fact,
       the strategy of &quot;disowning&quot; sons, through public notices
       or advertisement, is not to be taken lightly. For example,
       even if a son is disowned by either parent, the death of
       that parent would, if intestate, still lead to devolution of
       property upon that son. Indeed, a mere proclamation
       does not have a dispositive legal effect, breaking all

       legally relevant familial ties. Thus, absent a deed of
       relinquishment or other formal deed of partition of the
       family or separation between the members, the Court
       must be cautious in denying statutory rights to wives, as
       against members of the husband&#x27;s family, on the basis of
       such tentative facts. To the contrary, if the Court is to
       place reliance on such acts, benefits enacted by the 2005
       Act in favour of the wife would be bypassed on account of
       alleged, and possibly fleeting, discords between the
       husband and his family. Indeed, such an approach is
       neither legally tenable, nor viable given the scheme of
       the Act.&quot;

<p id="p_343">254. There are no allegations made against the wives of Mr. RJS or Mr. RS
or any of the grandchildren, except one son of Mr. RS - Mr. CS, who is
stated to have produced a rap song criticising his grandfather. A viewing of
the rap song shows that the said grandson of Mr. DMP is a well-known
rapper who has expressed some sadness about how he was always treated as
a rich boy born into a rich family but had to find his own way to earn
money. In this process, he expresses displeasure in a very creative manner
about how Mr. DMP, who was known as &#x27;Raja&#x27;, has sometimes not treated
his family very well and has demeaned himself with his conduct. In the
opinion of this Court, a rap song produced by a grandson would, at worst, be
considered an act of naivety rather than one intended to cause any harm or
injury.

by the Petitioner and the supporting Respondents that he has supported Ms.
UD and turned a blind eye to the ill-treatment of Mrs. SD and his own wife
</p><p id="p_346">- Mrs. RD, at the hands of Ms. UD. It is further alleged that Mr. US has
illegally become the Director of M/s Aristo Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. on 1st
January, 2021 when Mr. DMP, who is the largest shareholder, was not in a
position to appoint a Director of the Company. Reliance has been placed on
order dated 20th September, 2019 of the ld. Division Bench in W.P.(Crl.)
2255/2019, to submit that both, Ms. UD and Mr. US concealed the medical
condition of Mr. DMP from the Court. It is alleged that due to the
concealment of Mr. DMP&#x27;s mental condition from the Management of
Apollo Hospital, Sarita Vihar, the condition of Mr. DMP deteriorated and he
developed metabolic encephalopathy. Mr. US continues to deny that Mr.
DMP is incapable of taking cogent decisions, as is evident from his reply to
CM No. 24330/2021.
</p><p id="p_347">256. The manner in which the businesses and the companies are being run
by him has not been placed before the Court. However, the fact that he has
been involved in the business almost since inception shows that Mr. DMP
trusted him immensely, especially while he himself was involved in political
activities.
</p><p id="p_348">257. From the submissions made before this Court, it is clear that he
supports Ms. UD. Insofar as this Court is concerned, some suspicion does
arise qua the brother as he does not readily accept Mrs. SD as Mr. DMP&#x27;s
wife, though the same is part of public record. It is also unclear as to how he
would have not objected to the condition in which Mrs. SD and his own wife

matter.

Mrs. KR (daughter-in-law of Mr. DMP)

</p><p id="p_351">258. Mrs. KR is the widow of the deceased son of Mr. DMP and Mrs. SD.
She lives in the official Bungalow of Mr. DMP. It is her case that prior to
2019 she was partly living in Delhi and partly in Mumbai. She has two sons.
She was directed to take care of Mr. DMP during the time when
investigation against Ms. UD was directed by the ld. Division Bench. She is
not highly educated, though she appears to know more than what she
informed the Court during her interactions as she is continuously living with
Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_352">259. The fact that all the shareholdings belonging to Mrs. SD are now in
the name of Mrs. KR leads to some suspicion. Further, the execution of the
GPA in her favour and her exercising rights on behalf of Mr. DMP as the
GPA holder casts some doubt as to her bonafide. There is also an allegation
that when Mr. RS was removed from the Directorship of the company, her
brother was made the Director. There is also no explanation as to why she
did not object to the treatment meted out to Mrs. SD and Mrs. RD, while she
was living in the official Bungalow.
</p><p id="p_353">260. Moreover, in 2019, when it was noticed that Mr. DMP&#x27;s mental
condition has considerably deteriorated, she appears to have not taken any
steps to provide proper medical care or treatment to Mr. DMP, or reveal this
condition to other family members, until the intervention of the ld. Division
Bench.

been in the company of Mr. DMP and his family for more than 40 years.
The photographs as also the other documents placed on record go to show
that while Mr. DMP lived in her company, he continued to live with his
family members, including his wife - Mrs. SD. In that sense, Mr. DMP had
not separated himself from his wife, children and grandchildren. It is evident
from the photographs on record that he attended all social occasions,
including marriages, birthdays and anniversaries. It is only since 2016/2017,
when Mr. DMP&#x27;s medical condition, especially his mental condition
deteriorated, that his family members appear to have been completely
alienated from him. With the progressive mental disorder of Mr. DMP, Ms.
UD has clearly taken over the running of the household as also the
businesses of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_356">262. Ms. UD&#x27;s companionship with Mr. DMP may not have been objected
to by Mrs. SD. Considering the educational qualifications of Mrs. SD, as
also the social context of the family, neither Mrs. SD nor the family
members may have had a say in the companionship of Mr. DMP with Ms.
UD. Ms. UD is not merely in charge of the household and Mr. DMP&#x27;s
businesses but also controls all the assets of Mr. DMP, which is evident
from the fact that both the secretaries of Mr. DMP operate from the official
residence and work under her directions. Ms. UD also became the joint
account holder of the bank accounts of Mr. DMP after Mr. DMP was
diagnosed with FTD during the proceedings before the ld. Division Bench.
The manner in which the Banks may have permitted her to become a joint
account holder after Mr. DMP&#x27;s diagnosis would require to be enquired into
in appropriate proceedings as it is not clear as to what documentation was
supplied to the Banks to make her a joint account holder in this manner.

</p><p id="p_358">263. Even in respect of the medical treatment of Mr. DMP, it was only per
chance that Mr. DMP was diagnosed with FTD during the proceedings
before the ld. Division Bench. Until then, it seems that none of the family
members were informed of his mental condition and no care or treatment in
respect of FTD was provided to him. This may have been due to various
apprehensions in respect of his official position as a Member of Parliament.
However, since Ms. UD and Mrs. KR were exclusively living with Mr.
DMP since 2016-2017, the non-disclosure of his mental condition and non-
administration of required medicines shows that Mr. DMP was clearly
deprived of proper medical treatment for his mental condition, until his FTD
diagnosis in 2019.
</p><p id="p_359">264. The blame for not providing proper and timely medical treatment to
Mr. DMP prior to 2019 clearly lies on Ms. UD and Mrs. KR. The filing of
the habeas corpus and the deplorable condition in which Mrs. SD and Mrs.
RD were found in the residence of Mr. DMP also shows that Ms. UD had
over-powered Mrs. SD and the others in the family, while taking control of
the household affairs of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_360">265. The continued exclusive control of Ms. UD over Mr. DMP is clearly
not in the interest of Mr. DMP. The photographs on record prior to his
mental illness i.e., prior to 2016-2017, reveal a person who is extremely
happy with his family members. Disputes between the father and children,
brothers or other family members are natural, and cannot by themselves
result in permanent deprivation of each other&#x27;s company. Such disputes are
usually resolved within the family. However, in the present case, such an
opportunity does not appear to have arisen, at least in the last four or five
years, owing to the exclusive control exercised by Ms. UD over Mr. DMP,

in the backdrop of his deteriorating mental condition.
</p><p id="p_361">266. In conclusion, qua the various persons belonging to the family of Mr.
DMP, Mrs.SD, being the wife of Mr. DMP is related to him by marriage.
There are no allegations against her except the fact that she may not be fully
qualified to act as Mr. DMP&#x27;s guardian, owing to her educational
qualification and lack of exposure. This Court is of the opinion that the role
of the wife/spouse is of prime importance. Merely because the spouse is
illiterate does not mean that she cannot take care of her husband who is
mentally ill. Her visits to meet Mr. DMP have been very amicable and
congenial. She speaks to Mr. DMP in her own native language and enjoys
the confidence of both her sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. She is
also involved in the preparations for the marriage of one of the grandsons.
These facts show that the position of Mrs. SD, as the wife of Mr. DMP and
the primary caregiver deserves to be recognised.
</p><p id="p_362">267. Secondly, there is an allegation against Mr. RJS, i.e., the youngest son
of Mr. DMP. In so far as Mr. RS i.e., Mr. DMP&#x27;s oldest son is concerned,
except the disownment affidavit of 2017, there are no major allegations
against him. Even the said disownment affidavit is under a serious cloud as
the same was neither mentioned in the proceedings before the ld. Division
Bench or by Mr. DMP to the police when the ld. Division Bench sought a
status report. Further, Mr.RS was active in Mr. DMP&#x27;s business for an
extremely long time, even as late as September, 2018. Ms. UD is also stated
to have approached Mr.RS to explore the possibility of a resolution of
disputes after the proceedings before the ld. Division Bench.
</p><p id="p_363">268. Thirdly, Mr. US, i.e., the younger brother of Mr. DMP has been
actively involved in the running of his businesses since inception i.e., for

more than 45 years. Though doubts have been expressed as to his credibility,
including an allegation that he concealed the mental health condition of Mr.
DMP, considering his long association with the businesses of Mr. DMP and
the fact that the businesses are still extremely successful, Mr. US is being
considered by this Court for the purposes of being appointed to a
Guardianship Committee. Moreover, in the order of preference, both under
the MHA-2017, as also the RPWD (Delhi) Rules-2018, relatives by blood
and marriage get precedence over others, in the absence of an advance
directive.
</p><p id="p_364">269. In the present case, admittedly, there is no advance directive by Mr.
DMP. The will and preference of Mr. DMP has been deciphered on the basis
of the documents that have been placed on record, including photographs
etc., as also the interaction of the Court with Mr. DMP and other parties,
including the Local Commissioner.
</p><p id="p_365">270. Thus, this Court is of the opinion that there is a clear need to change
the status quo as it exists today. Mr. DMP ought to be permitted to live in a
happy and congenial atmosphere with his wife, children and grandchildren.
He should also be allowed to enjoy the company of his siblings and
extended family, without pressure from any quarter. Ms. UD can continue to
live in the residence of Mr. DMP, however, she cannot be given exclusive
control of Mr. DMP, as is the position currently. There is an imminent and
urgent need for the family to start living together as a family, while
maintaining peace and tranquillity in the residence and providing a happy
atmosphere for Mr. DMP. A person suffering from &#x27;Fronto-Temporal
Dementia&#x27; also requires a comfortable, vibrant and congenial atmosphere,
which does not necessarily mean the company of a limited number of

persons. Mr. DMP, having been a family man all along, a public figure, as
also an entrepreneur, is used to living in an expanded social network, of
which he has been deprived of in the last four to five years. Thus, this Court
is of the opinion that the exclusive control and association of Mr. DMP
cannot be continued - to the exclusion of the wife, children, siblings and
other family members - solely with Ms. UD/Mrs. KR.
</p><p id="p_366">271. In the above legal and factual background, this Court holds that the
present case is one which reveals exceptional circumstances for exercise of
parens patriae jurisdiction as also jurisdiction under the RPWD-2016 and
MHA-2017. Under <a href="/doc/178367283/" id="a_201">Section 14(1)</a> proviso of the RPWD-2016, total support
would have to be provided considering that Mr. DMP is unable to take any
decisions for his own welfare whatsoever. Under the MHA-2017, nominated
representative has to also be appointed for taking decisions for medical care
and treatment of Mr. DMP.
</p><p id="p_367">272. Moreover, the nominated representative or the guardian need not
always be a single individual. Especially in the present case, the movable
and immovable assets and financial affairs of Mr. DMP are vast; it would be
physically impossible for any particular individual to be able to exercise
control and judgment, or to take proper decisions in respect of Mr. DMP&#x27;s
healthcare. Accordingly, this Court is of the opinion that a Guardianship
Committee would deserve to be appointed for the purpose of taking care of
Mr. DMP and his financial affairs. In the above circumstances, the following
directions are issued:
