</p><p id="p_9">6.       The applicant has taken the following grounds in

his OA. The grounds are further substantiated by the

counsel for the Applicant, Shri Saurabh Kumar

alongwith Ors. that:-
</p>
<p id="p_10">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">        i) That the transfer order dated 12.9.2022 and the

        relieving order dt. 6.2.2023 are against the

        Transfer Guidelines, 2021. These guidelines were

        formulated to maintain transparency and to avoid

        arbitrariness and discrimination. The Order date

        12.9.2022 suspending Clause 6 of the said

        guidelines defeats the very objective of ensuring

        transparency and fair play. There is no cogent

        reason given as to why this clause has been

        suspended.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">        (ii) The transfer Order dt 12.9.2022 violates the

        Clauses 6,7,9 and 16 of the Transfer guidelines.</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">        Clause           5   talks   about   the   Administrative

        Transfers. Clause -6 assigns Displacement Count

        and the higher the displacement count, the more

        likely the employee will get transferred. Clause -7

Court No.6 (item No.2)



        stipulates the modes of Administrative Transfers

        and Clause -16 deals with request Transfers.

        None of these processes were followed while

        effecting the transfers on 12.9.2022.    In view of

        this the transfers are arbitrary and smacks of

        non-application of mind.

<p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">        (iii) The transfer order dated 12.9.2022 is against

        DOPT OM dated 23.8.2004 which states that, as

        far as possible, the husband and wife will be

        posted at the same station. The applicant&#x27;s

        husband is serving in IPL and posted in UP. She

        should not have been transferred on account of

        as the old parents-in-law who require nursing and

</p><p id="p_19">7. The counsel for the applicant has further averred

that the         coordinated   bench of this   Tribunal       at

Ahmedabad has adjudicated the matter in OA No. 347

of 2022 and another 13 OAs passing the following

orders on 16.1.2023:-
</p>
<p id="p_20">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">        &quot;13. In view of the above circumstances, we are of
        the view that if the impugned transfer order qua
        the applicants are not quashed, it will create more
        inconvenience to all the concerned than to serve
        the purpose behind effecting the impugned
        transfer . It will not be in the interest of the
        students for which the teachers are meant. As
        stated earlier the academic session is going to
        complete soon and status quo is already in
        existence regarding posting place of the present
        applicants. In the facts and circumstances of the
        case discussed above, we set aside the transfer
        order dated 16.09.2022 qua the applicants.
        However, it is made clear that after completion of
        the current academic session, the respondents
        are at liberty to pass fresh transfer order in
        accordance with the latest transfer guidelines and
        Government Order as also principles of natural
        justice.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_21">The counsel for the applicant argued that the Transfer

order qua the applicants in said OAs was quashed

because it would create more inconvenient to the

Court No.6 (item No.2)



applicants and the said transfer orders are not in the

interest of students as these orders were issued in the

middle of the academic session. Drawing parallel with

these OAs, the counsel for the applicant argued that

the transfer in the instant case has been effected in the

middle of the academic session and she has all the

personal and family issues to attend. Being transferred

to a far off place, she would face grave personal

difficulty. The Transfer Guidelines of 2021 have

provision to look into such eventualities to consider the

personal and family of employees of KVS. However, the

respondents have squarely rejected her request to

cancel the impugned orders dt.12.9.2022. Vide order

dated13.1.2023, the respondent Commissioner has

rejected        her      prayers     of   personal   difficulties      in

pursuance of the order of CAT Principal Bench dated

23.9.2022 in OA no. 2692/2022. The rejection of her

prayers is not accompanied by a reasoned and

speaking order.
</p>
<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">8.      The counsel for the applicant further argued that

the suspension of Clause 6 of the Transfer Guidelines

suffers       from       want   of    competency.    The     Transfer

Guidelines, 2021 were issued after being approved by

the Board of Governor of KVS but the suspension order

Court No.6 (item No.2)



has been issued in pursuance to the minutes of

meeting of senior officials of Ministry of Education and

KVS under the Chairmanship of the Union Education

minister. <a href="/doc/1678224/" id="a_1">Article 11(ii) (c)</a> of the Education Code of KVS

2012 provides that the BOG of the KVS shall have the

power        to determine, inter alia, the           conditions of

service including terms and tenure                  of appointment

and      transfers.      Hence,       the   order    dt    12.9.2022

suspending clause 6 of transfer guidelines is defective

and ultra vires since it has been issued by Respondent

No.2        without any reference,           to authorization or

approval         from the BOG. He cited the order of the

Transfer orders are not merely transfers.           He argued

that the suspension of Clause -6 and the Annual

Transfers has effectively taken away the provisions

under clauses 5, 7 and 9. Moreover, the order dated

12.9.2022 has also mentioned that the said orders are

not only transfer orders; these are also redistribution of

the teaching staff for effecting rationalization of the

deployment of teaching staff in various Kendriya

Vidyalays in the country.               The rationale for the

rationalization          and   redistribution   comes   from       a

detailed exercise undertaken by the KVS authorities to

access the staff strength, existing deployment and

vacancies in various KVS. It was a massive exercise to

find out the KVS having less than 50% of sanctioned

strength and KVs having 80% or more regular teaching

staff. As per station Seniority, the staff having longest

stay at a particular station having existing staff to the

tune of 80% or more of regular vacancies existing staff

were transferred out to locations having 50% or less

regular staff.           He further stated that the Transfer

guidelines allow the KVS Authorities to transfer any

employee on administrative Exigencies. These transfers

are called Administrative Transfers which are defined

as &quot;those transfers which KVS orders suomotu in the

exigencies of service and administration and public

interest.&quot;

</p><p id="p_30">10.       The counsel for the Respondent quoted the

following Order Dated 20.12.2022 (Annexure A-1) [in

respect of the representation of the present applicant,

which reads as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_31">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">        Whereas the above transfers have been effected
        recently in KVS for reasons that due to disruption
        in normal schooling for past two years owing to
        the pandemic situation, there has been significant
        learning loss amongst students due to online
        blended mode of teaching. According to the
        mental health and well being of school students
        2022 report published by NCERT in the chapter
        relating to KVS, it has been stated that during
        COVID-19, as classes were taking place in online
        mode, 54% of the students who participated in
        the survey reported facing difficulties in
        understanding and learning of content through
        online mode. Hence the need was felt to address
        on priority, the learning challenges being faced by
        the students for the past two years due to
        pandemic through administrative means. The
        rationalization of teachers &amp; redistribution of the
        existing teaching staff have been effected to
        address the above core challenges after the
        pandemic so that at least 50% of regular teaching
        staff (inclusive of all cadres) are available in all
        KVs.</blockquote><p id="p_32">

        Whereas, KVS has identified around 237 KVs
        having less than 50% of regular teaching staff on
        its rolls and about 481 KVs having 80% or more
        regular teaching staff on its rolls in all over India
        on the basis of available vacancy. As per Station
        Seniority (All India /cadre/subject wise), who has
        the longest stay in a station, as per date of joining
        at the station was taken as the criteria for
        transfer. Most of the teachers who have been
        transferred have had a stay in a particular station
        for more than 10 years. Out of the total teaching
        staffs in position, only 1455 transfers have been
        effected which is less than 4 % of the total
        teaching strength in position.

that The Transfer Guidelines of 2021 have the following

objectives:
</p>
<p id="p_36">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">        &quot;Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangthan (KVS) shall strive
        to maintain equitable distribution of its employees

        amongst employees. All employees are liable to be
        transferred anywhere in India at any point of time
        and transfer to a desired location cannot be
        claimed as a matter of right. While effecting
        transfers the organizational interest shall be given

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">         &quot;4.Transfer of a Government servant appointed to
        a particular cadre of transferable posts from one
        place to the other is an incident of service. No
        Government servant or employee of Public
        Undertaking has legal tight for being posted at
        any particular place. Transfer from one place to
        other is generally a condition of service and the
        employee has no choice in the matter. Transfer
        from one place to other is necessary in public
        interest     and    efficiency   in     the    Public
        administration. Whenever, a public servant is
        transferred he must comply with the order but if
        there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on
        transfer it is open to him to make representation
        to the competent authority for stay, modification
        or cancellation of the transfer order. If the order of
        transfer is not stayed, modified or cancelled the
        concerned public servant must carry out the
        order of transfer. In the absence of any stay of the
        transfer order a public servant has no
        justification to avoid or evade the transfer order
        merely on the ground of having made a
        representation, or on the ground of his difficulty
        in moving from one place to the other. If he fails

        order of his transfer from one place to the other.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">14.     The counsel for the respondents countered the

argument that the Order dated 12.9.2022 suspending

Clause 6 was ultra vires because of lack of competency.

The decision to suspend clause 6 of the Transfer

Guidelines, 2021 was taken in a meeting chaired                        by

the Union Education Minister                   (who is Chairman of

BOG)          wherein senior Officers of the Education

department           and KVS      (who are ex-officio member of

BOG) were present . Hence, the assertion that the

order is ultra vires of the Education Code 2012 falls

flat.     As the annual transfers were suspended and the

transfers        vide    order    dt.    12.9.2022       effected     for

administrative exigencies, other clauses of the Transfer

guidelines are not attracted in such exigencies.


</p><p id="p_44">15. The counsel for the respondent                 further averred,

that in pursuance of the order dated 23.9.2022, of this

tribunal, the representation of the applicant was duly

considered. Her personal and family problems were

also considered. Because of administrative exigencies,

the personal discomfort of the present applicant was

considered          subservient    to    the    public    interest      of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                         15</span>

providing adequate teaching staff at KVS having 50%

or less of the sanctioned strength of teaching staff .In

view of this, the applicant has no valid cause of action

to agitate. He averred that the OA lacks merit and

pleaded that it should be dismissed.


</p><p id="p_45">16. I have gone through the records of the case

thoroughly and heard the arguments carefully. It has

been held in several judgments by the Apex court that

transferring an employee and reassigning duties and

responsibilities at the same place of posting or at a new

location is the prerogative of the competent authorities.


</p><p id="p_46">17.          Transfers,      deployments,            redeployment         or

placement of organizational human resources are

essential           components           of      Human            Resources

Management Strategies of any organization, be it in

private sector or in the Government or Public sector.

These       strategies      are    s         aimed   at    realizing     the

organizational           goals    for        furtherance     of     mission

objectives of the organization. For a government

department or autonomous organization or Public

Sector Undertaking, Public Interest in the form of

discharging the assigned responsibilities to these

subordinate legislation or delegated competencies is

the charter for mission objectives.


</p><p id="p_47">18.      Deployment or transfer is also the process of

providing sub-entities and subordinate offices                         with

the required human resources and support they need

to be successful in their roles. This is akin to allocation

of organizational resources to achieve organizational

goals. Modern governments and organizations begin

the     process          prior   to    adopting        transfers     as     a

redeployment tool by assessing the organization&#x27;s

current and future human resources needs. Following

these assessments, the competent authority makes

decisions how best to deploy the human resources to

meet the identified needs. These include the type of

human resources required, the number of human

resources         required,      the        location   of   the    human

resources, and the timing of the deployment. In

Government, generally this task is assigned to an

Administrative/Establishment/                      Placement/Transfer

Committee.

the very core of administrative exigency. It is the

prerogative of the employer to transfer his employee at

any point of time and to any work station based on

administrative exigencies. Deployment of staff in the

form of transfers enables realignment of human

resources          to    new   work    assignments    or      job

responsibilities to meet organizational needs or to

provide opportunities to the employees gain skills and

experience. Such activities are aimed at supporting

employee&#x27;s          engagement,   employee   motivation      and

increased productivity and leadership development

across all level of employees within the organization.


</p><p id="p_50">20. The position that the competent administrative

authorities have a prerogative to redeploy or transfer

an employee for better utilization of human resources

of the organization for furtherance of organizational

mission objectives have been well settles in several case

laws by the Apex court. The employee in a transferable

job does not have any vested right to remain at a

particular place or post. The counsel for the respodents

has cited the judgments in Gujrat electricity <a href="/doc/1661941/" id="a_3">Board vs

Atmaram Sungomal Poshani (CA No</a> 3561 0f 1986

        The transfer policies are in the form of executive
        guidelines. And hence, these have no statutory
        force. The aforementioned case laws affirm the
        prerogative of the government to transfer its
        employees to ant place of posting for
        administrative exigencies. The transfer guidelines
        are subservient to public interest.

        transfers or containing transfer policies at best
        may afford an opportunity to the officer or servant
        concerned to approach their higher authorities for
        redress but cannot have the consequence of
        depriving or denying the competent authority to
        transfer a particular officer/servant to any place
        in public interest and as is found necessitated by
        exigencies of service as long as the official status
        is not affected adversely and there is no infraction
        of any career prospects such as seniority, scale of
        pay and secured emoluments. This Court has
        often reiterated that the order of transfer made
        even in transgression of administrative guidelines
        cannot also be interfered with, as they do not
        confer any legally enforceable rights, unless, as

        though they are Appellate Authorities over such
        orders, which could assess the niceties of the
        administrative needs and requirements of the
        situation concerned. This is for the reason that

        decisions in the matter of transfer for that of

<p id="p_72">30. Sometimes, employees or employee groups assail

the transfer policy or suspension of any particular

clause or clauses of the transfer policy as it may create

difficulties for individual or group of employees. As the

transfer policies/circulars are only guidelines for the

by the courts [Punjab and Sind Bank &amp;Ors. Vs.

        substitute it with another which is considered to
        be more appropriate, once the attack on the
        ground of arbitrariness is successfully repelled by
        showing that the act which was done, was fair
        and reasonable in the facts and circumstances of

<p id="p_73">31. The aforementioned judgments of the Apex Court

have       given         upper   hand   to   the   administrative

authorities or the Government in matters of Transfers.

However, transfers may affect negatively the level of

productivity, motivation, innovation quality, relations,

and participation and communication patterns among

other core human resources activities. When handled

well      and       in      accordance            with    the     employees&#x27;

circumstances,                  deployment          increase        employee

performance through increased innovation, creativity,

quality, productivity, profitability, loyalty flexibility,

efficiency, effectiveness, and low levels of discontents,

dysfunctional conflicts. In other words, em[ployee

welfare is also in the interest of the organizations. The

principles of effectiveness, efficiency and economy in

matters of deployment of human resources are sought

to be aligned with organizational mission goals.




</p><p id="p_74">32.      While effecting redeployment through transfers,

the organizations should also treat all such employees

fairly      and          without     any         bias    or     malafide      or

discrimination. Moreover, a model employer like the

government               also    treats    its     employees       far    more

transparently and it is expected that the government

ensures that there is no violation of Articles 14 and 16

Indian Constitution.               Based on the twin objectives of

satisfying organizational goals (public interest and

better governance for delivery of public services ) and

employee            welfare,         growth         and         development,

organizations              including       government           departments

Court No.6 (item No.2)



formulate transfer /placement policies. These policies

ensure         transparency          and     also     provide      better

opportunities to officers for excellence and more

planned approach to cadre planning.                     Such transfer

policies develop some sort of reasonable employee

expectations             to   be   treated   fairly    while    effective

redeployment              through      transfers.     Similarly,       the

government               departments       also     have   reasonable

expectations from its employees to cooperate in such

deployment to achieve mission goals of departments

and other entities.

<p id="p_75">


</p><p id="p_76">33. Redeployment in the form of transfers inter alia

should also satisfy the test of reasonable expectations

of the employees to be treated fairly and such

administrative action should not be based on malafide,

bias and unreasonable factors.                      There are several

judgments of the Apex court which have moderated the

absolute power of the government/ administrative

authorities in the matters of transfer. The earliest of

this genre is the judgment of the Apex court in E.P.

Royappa Vs State Of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr [ 1974 AIR

555, 1974 SCR (2) 348; Dated 23/11/1973]. The

Apex court has held that:

Court No.6 (item No.2)



          &quot;It is an accepted principle that in public service
          transfer is an incident of service. It is also an
          implied condition of service and appointing
          authority has a wide discretion in the matter. The
          Government is the best judge to decide how to
          distribute and utilize the services of its employees.
          However, this power must be exercised honestly,
          bona fide and reasonably. It should be exercised
          in public interest. If the exercise of power is based
          on extraneous considerations or for achieving an
          alien purpose or an oblique motive it would
          amount to mala fide and colorable exercise of
          power. Frequent transfers, without sufficient
          reasons to justify such; transfers, cannot, but be
          held as mala fide. A transfer is mala fide when it
          is made not for professed purpose, such as in
          normal course or in public or administrative
          interest or in the exigencies of service but for
          other purpose, than is to accommodate another
          person for undisclosed reasons. It is the basic
          principle of rule of law and good administration
          that even administrative actions should be just
          and fair.&quot;

review         in        transfer   matters   under     certain

circumstances: It was held that a judicial review of an

administrative action is of course permissible, but

orders of transfer are interfered when:-

assert that the transfer order dt 12.9.2022 is based on

non-application of mind and it suffers from malafide or

bias on the part of the competent authority. The

assertion that the order dated 12.9.2022 suffers from

competency has been squarely rebutted by the counsel

for the respondent. The BOG Chairman, i.e. the Union

Education Minister held meeting of senior officers of

the education department and the KVS , who are ex-

officio Members of the BOG. Hence, it has the

equivalent competency of the BOG. A formal meeting of

BOG would not have taken any different decision as

most of the members of BOG were present in the

meeting        chaired   by   the        Education   minister,     the

chairperson of BOG.

suspension of the clause 6 of the Transfer Guidelines

and also ordering the transfer in three tranches. The

transfers are part of rationalization and redistribution

of the human resources following a well-thought-out

exercise to find out KVs having 50% or less staff

compared to their sanctioned strength and also KVs

having 80% or more staff. As it has been stated in the

impugned           order   dated   13.01.2023,   most    of    the

teachers, who were transferred out, were based on the

seniority roster maintained at each station and most of

the transferred teachers had a stay of more than 10

years at their respective previous KVs. In view of this

well thought out exercise, the suspension of clause-6 of

the Transfer guidelines and non-operationaliation of

other clauses of the transfer guidelines applicable for

annual transfers and request transfers cannot be said

arbitrary or non-application of mind.

the administrative authorities or the Government in

such administrative exercises and there is very limited

scope for judicial review in the matters of transfer. As it

has been held in the other set of judgments cited in

infringement             of     statutory          provisions,      lack       of

competency, non-application of mind, etc, the courts
