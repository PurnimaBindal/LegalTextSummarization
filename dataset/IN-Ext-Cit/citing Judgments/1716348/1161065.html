<p id="p_1">           This revision petition is preferred against the order dated

30.10.2008 by which the charge against the petitioner has been

framed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">           The principal grievance of the petitioner is that the copy

of FIR, which is a part of the challan, was not supplied to him, and

this has vitiated the entire proceedings. The Court was precluded from

taking cognizance of any offence against him. Reliance has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1"> Crl.Rev.No.160 of 2009                 -2-</span>

placed on     <a href="/doc/1148786/" id="a_1">Smt. Kalpana Ghosh v. State and others</a> 1996

Cri.L.J.1406 and Sharadechandra Vinayak Dongre and others etc.

v. State of Maharashtra 1991 Cri.L.J. 3329.
</p>
<p id="p_3">            The respondents have contested the claim of the petitioner

primarily on facts. It has been stated that the FIR was registered on

10.5.2003 and the challan under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_2">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. was prepared on

18.9.2003, and it was presented to the court on 12.12.2006. In this

interregnum, the petitioner filed two petitions under the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_3">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. praying for quashing of the FIR and all

consequent proceedings arising therefrom in which the copy of the

FIR was appended. For the first time an application was made before

the learned trial court for obtaining the certified copy of the FIR on

8.3.2008 wherein it was discovered that the same was missing from

the file of the court. On an application to the police the response

given by them was that pursuant to the FIR dated 10.5.2003, the

incharge of Police Station Kharkhoda had prepared the challan on

18.9.2006 and submitted the same to the court on 12.12.2006. It is

thus contended that the petitioner being aware of the FIR having

appended the same with the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_4">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.,

initiated by him in this court, no prejudice has been caused to him

even if his argument is to be accepted. But in any eventuality, the

petitioner kept quiet for about 15 months after the receipt of the copy

of challan by him to make such a grievance. It was further contended

that according to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1329851/" id="a_5">Section 461</a> Cr.P.C., these are not

irregularities contemplated under<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_6"> the Code</a> which vitiate the

proceedings, and since the FIR has gone missing after the submission
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2"> Crl.Rev.No.160 of 2009                  -3-</span>

of     challan, at best the matter ought to be inquired into on the

administrative side by the court but under no circumstances         the

proceedings can be said to have been vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_4">             I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have

perused the record.
</p>
<p id="p_5">             <a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_7">Section 157</a> Cr.P.C. requires that the copy of FIR has to

be sent to the Magistrate, which is received by him under his seal and

signatures. <a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_8">Section 207</a> Cr.P.C. also requires that the copies of FIR

and other documents have to be supplied to the accused. There is no

dispute about these facts that the report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_9">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. has

to include the FIR and all other relevant material which the police

might have collected during the course of investigation and which

have to be supplied to the accused by the court itself.

</p><p id="p_6">             But the question that arises in the instant proceedings is

as to whether the contention of the petitioner that he was not supplied

with the copy of the FIR can be accepted and that further, if it has not

been supplied to him, then does it vitiate the entire proceedings or

not?
</p>
<p id="p_7">             On examination of the facts and material on record it

transpires that the petitioner on two different occasions had

approached this Court by way of filing proceedings under the

provisions of <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_10">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. He sought the quashing of the FIR.

The copy of the FIR was specifically appended thereto.

</p><p id="p_8">             The FIR was also placed on record by way of separate

application. In this view of the matter, when these proceedings were

initiated between 2006 and 2008, it cannot be expected by this Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> Crl.Rev.No.160 of 2009                 -4-</span>

that the petitioner had no knowledge of the contents of the FIR when

he himself had been agitating for quashing of the same. For the first

time he made an attempt to get the certified copy of the FIR in the

year 2008 when he had already initiated the quashing proceedings

twice over before this court and the FIR was placed by him on record.

In the opinion of this court, it seems to be a clever ploy to create a

situation seemingly to his advantage to show an imaginary prejudice

and claim that the entire proceedings stand vitiated. There is indeed

no doubt that the supply of copy of the FIR and all other relevant

material which is required to be given pursuant to the provisions of

<a href="/doc/1613898/" id="a_11">Section 207</a> Cr.P.C. are essential which go a long way to ensure the

rights of an accused person against whom prima facie material has

been collected by the police and report submitted under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_12">Section 173</a>

Cr.P.C. But at the same time if the document in question is already in

his knowledge and possession, then it cannot be said that even if the

same was not a part of the report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_13">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C., some

prejudice has been caused to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_9">             Strangely enough, the petitioner has cleverly concealed

the fact of filing the quashing petitions earlier and has chosen to

retain his silence even when the reply was filed by the respondent and

this objection was taken by them. Counsel for the petitioner also

made no attempt to refer to the proceedings during the course of his

arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_10">             The court is also of the opinion that the petitioner

deliberately concealed the material facts from this court. The Supreme

Court in <a href="/doc/1716348/" id="a_14">MCD v. State of Delhi and another</a> 2005 Supreme Court
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> Crl.Rev.No.160 of 2009                -5-</span>

Cases (Cri) 1322 has observed as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">           "21. This apart, the respondent did not also disclose the

           fact in the criminal revision filed before the High Court

           that he has also been convicted in another Criminal Case

           No.202 of 1997 by the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate,

           Patiala House, new Delhi. Thus, the contesting respondent

           has come to the High Court with unclean hands and

           withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on

           the other side. In our opinion, he would be guilty of

           playing fraud on the Court as well as on the opposite

           party. A person whose case is based on falsehood can be

           summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. We

           have no hesitation to say that a person whose case is

           based on false hood has no right to approach the court and

           he can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the

           litigation. In the instant case, non-production of the order

           and even non-mentioning of the conviction and sentence

           in Criminal Case No.202 of 1997 tantamounts to playing

           fraud on the Court. A litigant who approaches the court is

           bound to produce all documents which are relevant to the

           litigation. If he withholds a vital document in order to

           gain advantage on the other side then he would be guilty

           of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite

           party. The second respondent in our opinion, was not

           justified in suppressing the material fact that he was

           convicted by the Magistrate on an earlier occasion. Since
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> Crl.Rev.No.160 of 2009               -6-</span>

          the second respondent deliberately suppressed the crucial

          and   important   fact,   we     disapprove   strongly   and

          particularly, the conduct of the second respondent and by

          reason of such conduct, the second respondent disentitled

          himself from getting any relief or assistance from this

          court. We, however, part with this case with a heavy heart

          expressing our strong disapproval of the conduct and

          behaviour but direct that the second respondent to pay a

          sum of Rs.10,000/- by way of cost to the appellant herein.</blockquote><p id="p_11">

</p><p id="p_12">          <a href="/doc/825525/" id="a_15">In Sharadchandra Vinayak Dongre and others v. State

of Maharashtra</a> (supra), the following observations have been

made :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">          "A plain reading of<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_16"> S. 173</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_17">Cr.P.C</a>. shows that every

          investigation must be completed without unnecessary

          delay and as soon as it is completed, the Officer-in-charge

          of the Police Station shall forward a report to the

          Magistrate in the form prescribed. Therefore, there is no

          question of sending up of a "police report" within the

          meaning of<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_18"> S. 173</a> and sub-sec. (2) until the investigation

          is completed. Any report sent before the investigation is

          completed will not be a police report within the meaning

          of sub-sec. (2) of<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_19"> S. 173</a> read with S.2(r) and there is no

          question of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the

          offence within the meaning of<a href="/doc/867855/" id="a_20"> S. 190(1)(b)</a> on the basis

          of an incomplete charge-sheet. The incomplete charge-

          sheets cannot be treated as a "police report" at all as
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> Crl.Rev.No.160 of 2009                -7-</span>

           contemplated under<a href="/doc/461024/" id="a_21"> S. 173(2)</a> to entitle the Magistrate to

           take cognizance      of the offences. A police report as

           defined in<a href="/doc/1741324/" id="a_22"> S. 2(r)</a>     can only be filed "as soon as the

           investigation is completed." If it is not complete, no such

           report can be filed. When no report is forwarded as

           required by<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_23"> the Code</a>, the Magistrate cannot take

           cognizance. Thus, unless all these steps are crossed, sub-

           sec. (8) cannot be pressed in aid for collecting further

           evidence which really can be called in aid if further

           evidence is discovered after the filing of the charge- sheet

           or the police report on the completion of the investigation.

           Unless cognizance has been taken, sub-sec. (8) cannot be

           set in motion. The Magistrate cannot take cognizance on

           the admittedly "incomplete charge-sheet" forwarded by

           the police. In case the Magistrate is allowed to take

           cognizance on basis of incomplete charge sheet then the

           provisions of S.167 (2) or to say S.468 of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_24">Cr.P.C</a>., can

           always be circumvented by the prosecution and the

           apparent legislative intents under those provisions would

           not only be not effectuated but undoubtedly stultified."</blockquote><p id="p_13">

           documents under Sub Section (5) of <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_25">Section 173</a> of the

           Code do not appear to have accompanied the Chargesheet

           submitted before the learned Magistrate, and that the

            him taking cognizance of the alleged offence could not

            accordingly liable to be quashed."</blockquote><p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">            The petition, therefore, deserves to be dismissed on the

following counts :-

<p id="p_17">i)          For concealment of material facts from the court;

by the petitioner in March 2008 asking for a certified copy of the FIR.
