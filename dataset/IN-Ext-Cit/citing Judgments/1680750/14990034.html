         Dated this the 9th day of January, 2017

                        JUDGMENT
</pre>
<p id="p_1">Shircy V.,J.
</p>
<p id="p_2">     Challenge in this appeal is to the legality of the

impugned common order of dismissal dated 31.10.2013

rendered by the learned Forest Tribunal, Kozhikode in O.A.

Nos.51/2009,     52/2009   and    53/2009.    The   Original

Applications were filed under Section 8 of the Kerala Private

Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, 1971 (hereinafter

referred to as the Vesting Act), for a declaration that the

application scheduled properties are not private forest

vested in the Government under the Vesting Act and the

appellants/petitioners are entitled to the benefits under

Sections 3(2) and 3(3) of the Vesting Act.

</p><p id="p_3">   2. The material facts in brief for disposal of the appeal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">MFA (Forest) 116/2014          2</span>


are as follows:      The appellants have alleged that all the

properties scheduled in the applications originally belonged

to their common ancestor Chathu Nair as puthravakasam

thavazhi and on his demise the properties devolved upon his

children viz Subhadra Amma, Sakunthala Amma, Sarojini

Amma, Viswanathan Nair and Vasu Nair. The properties are

lying contiguously and are in Survey Nos. 334/8, 337/1 &amp;

2 of Erimayoor Village. After the death of Chathu Nair, his

children partitioned the properties as per partition deed No.

1284/1972 of SRO, Alathur.        As per the partition deed,

Item B schedule property was allotted to Subhadra Amma.

Her legal heirs are the appellants 1 to 7. O.A.No.51/2009

was filed by them. D schedule property in the partition deed

was    allotted to the share of Sakunthala Amma and C

schedule property was allotted in favour of Sarojini Amma

(9th appellant). O.A. No.52/2009 was filed by Sakunthala

Amma (8th appellant).      O.A. No.53/2009 was       filed by

Sarojini Amma. According to the appellants, the properties

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">MFA (Forest) 116/2014          3</span>


belong to them as per the partition deed and they also

purchased jenmam rights over the same.            While the

properties were in their possession and enjoyment, the

officials of the Forest Department on 29.7.2009 prevented

them from enjoying the properties alleging that it is the

forest land.       But no forest species or trees are in the

properties, even though the properties are lying in the bed

of a small hillock. The entire property is known by name

Cheruvaparambu. The properties are being cultivated by the

members of the family of the appellants and it is not a

forest land as defined under the Vesting Act and it is not

coming under the Madras Preservation of Private Forests

Act, 1949 ( for short 'MPPF Act'). The lands are abutting to

the paddy land and used for fugitive cultivation. No

notification as envisaged under Rule 2A(2) of the Kerala

Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Rules, 1974 (for

short    `the Vesting Rules') was published regarding the

disputed land. Hence, they have filed the applications for a

MFA (Forest) 116/2014         4


declaration that the properties in question are not forest

lands and they are entitled to get the benefit under Sections

3(2) and 3(3) of the Vesting Act.
</p>
<p id="p_4">     3. The Divisional Forest Officer refuted their claim

contending that the properties scheduled in the applications

form part of Malavaram known as Erattode Muringamala

Malavaram having a total extent of 121.46 hectares of land

and is vested with the Government by virtue of the vesting

act with effect from 10.5.1971. The properties are part of a

contiguous tract of Erattode Muringamala which leads to

Choolannur Peafowl Sanctuary and is        near to drought

affected Palakkad gap which forms catchments area for

Gayathripuzha and Bharathapuzha.       That part of forest is

highly sensitive and is of high ecological value and the

inhabitants residing around this region are fully dependent

on the springs, nullas and streams originate from these hill

tracts.    The ground vegetation along the slopes of rocky

outcrops in these forests are the typical habitat of many

MFA (Forest) 116/2014         5


endemic, rare and endangered species of flora and fauna.

Hence, the protection of this land is of utmost importance

for the preservation of the edaphic climatic and other

environmental factors of this region.   So, the properties

scheduled in the applications are private forest attracting

the provisions of the Vesting Act and the appellants are not

eligible for exemption under the provisions of the Vesting

Act. The respondents have also raised a contention that the

claim is barred by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">     4. The court below conducted trial of all these cases

together treating O.A.No.51/2009 as the leading case.

PWs.1 to 5 were examined and Exts.A1 to A4 were marked

on the side of the appellants. Exts.C1 to C1(3) series were

also marked. RW1 was examined and Exts.B1 to B6 were

marked on the side of the respondents. After evaluating the

evidence, the learned Forest Tribunal dismissed all the

applications on the finding that the properties involved are

forest lands and the appellants are not entitled to get the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">MFA (Forest) 116/2014           6</span>


properties exempted from vesting under Sections 3(2) and 3

(3) of the Vesting Act.     The said findings of the learned

Forest Tribunal is assailed in this appeal.

</p><p id="p_6">     5. Heard the learned counsel for the appellants as well

the learned Special Government Pleader (Forest).

</p><p id="p_7">     6.     The definite case of the appellants is that the

properties scheduled in the       applications are not private

forests as defined under the Vesting Act. At the outset, it is

to be noted that the respondents have raised a contention

that the applications filed by the appellants are barred by

limitation as per Section 3 of the Kerala Private Forest

(Tribunal) Rules, but the said contention has been rightly

held otherwise as the respondents did not produce

documents to conclude that the notification as provided

under Rules 3(2) and 3(3) of the Forest Tribunal Rules have

been published in the Village Office, Panchayat Office, Office

of the Forest Tribunal, Range Office, Office of the Divisional

Forest Officer and in the Office of the Custodian of the forest

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">MFA (Forest) 116/2014          7</span>


as well in two or more newspapers having circulation in the

locality simultaneously as contemplated in the above Rules.

As publication of the notification was not made in respect

of the properties involved, the learned Land Tribunal has

rightly held that the claim raised by the appellants are not

barred by limitation.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     7.       The appellants claimed their title over the

properties scheduled in the applications on the basis of

partition deed No. 1284/1972 of SRO, Alathur which has

been produced and marked as Ext.A1. According to them,

Chathu       Nair,    their predecessor  in   interest   had

puthravakasam thavazhi right over the property and on his

demise the properties devolved upon his five children, viz.

Subhadra Amma, Sakunthala Amma, Sarojini Amma,

Viswanathan Nair and Vasu Nair and partition was effected

as per Ext.A1 partition deed and they are holding possession

of their respective shares after effecting cultivation in the

property.        But their claim has been denied by the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">MFA (Forest) 116/2014               8</span>


respondents contending that the properties are part of a

contiguous tract of Erattode Muringamala Malavaram having

a vast extent governed by erstwhile MPPF Act and now

vested with the Government under Section 3 of the Vesting

Act. So, the first question to be answered is whether the

disputed properties are private forest coming under the

Vesting Act. The Vesting Act came into force on 10.5.1971.

Execution of Ext.A1 was after the Act came into force. As

per Section 2(a) of the Vesting Act, the appointed day

means the 10th May, 1971.           Section 2(f) of the Vesting Act

defines 'private forest' which reads as follows:

<a href="/doc/197743596/" id="a_3">Section 2(f)(1)</a> (i) defines private forest as any land

Preservation of Private Forests Act, 1949 (Madras Act XXVII

of 1949) was applicable to the land in 1949 and it continued

to apply upto 10.5.1971, and that land would be treated as

a private forest for the purpose of this Act.        The lands,

which are exempted from the definition of forest lands, are

enumerated as items (A) to (D). So as per Section 2(f)(1)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">MFA (Forest) 116/2014              11</span>


sub clause (i), any land to which the Madras Preservation of

</p><p id="p_20">      8. In the Madras Preservation of Private Forests Act,

which Madras Preservation of Private Forest Act, 1949

applied immediately before the appointed day has to be

treated as private forest excluding the categories of land

enumerated as (A) to (D). Of course, it is to be noted that

even though the `forest' is defined in the MPPF Act, no

definition has been given to the word 'forest' in the Vesting

Act. But in <a href="/doc/253563/" id="a_7">State of Kerala v. Moosa Haji</a> (1984 KLT

494 (FB)), a Division Bench of this Court held as follows:




</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "3.    As for the Madras Preservation of Private

     Forests Act, 1949 ("M P. P. F Act"), its object was to

     prevent indiscriminate destruction of private forests

     and interference with customary and prescriptive

     rights therein, pending further legislation. The Act was

     conceived as a temporary measure, but it continued to

     be in force by a series of amendments, till it was

     repealed in 1971 by the Vesting Act. The M. P. P. F.

     Act applied to private forests in the Malabar and South

     Kanara districts of the erstwhile Madras State, and the

     key provision was the one contained in Section 3

     which prohibited alienation of any part of the forest,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">MFA (Forest) 116/2014             13</span>


      and the cutting of trees or the doing of any act likely

      to denude or diminish the utility of the forest, except

      with the previous permission of the District Collector.

      Section 6 empowered the Government, by notification,

      to prohibit or regulate the doing of any act detrimental

      to preservation, and to regulate exercise of customary

      or prescriptive rights. The other provisions which dealt

      with institution of prosecutions, bar of suits, rule

      making power etc. are not material for our present

      purposes."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_24">It is further observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">      "8. Speaking for a Division Bench of this Court in

      State of Kerala v. Anglo American D. T. T. Co. (1980

      Ker LT 215), Poti J. (as he then was) had said :--

       " "Forest'' is not a term defined in the Act. With refer-

       ence to lands in the Malabar area and to which the

       Madras Preservation of Private Forests Act applies on

       the appointed day the test for determination whether

       the land is 'private forest' is different. Evidently the

       scheme of that section appears to be that if the land is

       shown to be private forest on the date the Madras

       Preservation of Private Forests Act came into force, it

       would continue to be private forest even if it has actu-

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">MFA (Forest) 116/2014            14</span>


      ally ceased to be a forest unless one or other of the

      exclusions in clauses A to D in the definition applies."

      We respectfully think that that was true approach to

      be made to the definition in Section 2(f) (1) of the

      Vesting Act. The contrary view taken by another

      Division Bench in M. F. A. No. 480 of 1978, without

      much of a discussion, and without reference to the

      specific statutory provisions, does not appeal to us."</blockquote><p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">     9.     Admittedly,  the    properties    scheduled     in the

applications are in the Malabar area. It is not having a

contiguous area exceeding 100 acres. Since the appellants

have a definite contention that the disputed area is not

having the characteristic features of a forest land and is not

a forest land coming under the provisions of the Vesting Act,

the burden is upon them to prove the said facts on solid

and definite evidence. Section 3 of the Vesting Act reads as

follows:

It is significant to note that the appellants have sought for

the benefits under Sub-<a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_8">sections 3</a> (2) and 3( 3) of Section 3

of the Vesting Act, which are substantially different. Under

sub-section(2) the appellants have to prove that the land

was under personal cultivation, but under sub-section (3)

the appellants have to prove that the land was held under a

valid registered document of title and was intended for

cultivation. In order to claim the benefit of <a href="/doc/76749005/" id="a_9">Section 3</a> (2) of

the Act the applicant should prove that he is the owner and

he had personal cultivation in the land prior to the appointed

day.
</p>
<p id="p_28">     10. As mentioned earlier, the appellants claimed title

over the properties as per Ext.A1 partition deed dated

28.6.1972.        Ext.A8 executed in the year 1968 has been

produced as the prior title deed of the partition deed. In

Ext.A1, the property is described as paramba, but as per

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">MFA (Forest) 116/2014          17</span>


Ext.A8 except two items all other items are described as

wet lands. The survey numbers are also different. Exts.A3,

A4, A9 are only tax receipts and tax receipts issued by

village officer cannot be taken as conclusive proof of title.

Even though the appellants have a case that the entire

property had been cultivated, the nature of cultivation

alleged to have been effected in the property has not been

narrated in the application. But PW1, who is the legal heir of

Subhadra Amma, has admitted that there was no cultivation

when the partition deed was executed in the year 1972 and

it was lying as Valarthukadu planted with pullanthi and other

shurbs for green manure for paddy cultivation. So, his case

that land was under cultivation is absolutely incorrect as he

has admitted in cross examination that the        B Schedule

property in Ext.A1 in his possession (which has been

allotted to the share of Subhadra Amma) was not under

cultivation. The person who claims that the property was

cultivated has to prove its existence on the appointed day.

</p><p id="p_29">     11. Of-course the appellants examined PWs.2 to 5 to

prove that the land in question was not a private forest on

the appointed day. PW2 has deposed that she has not

effected any cultivation in the disputed area and most of the

boundaries of the properties are forest lands. Though she

deposed that tapioca was cultivated in the property before

1971 for sometime there was no pleadings to that effect

in the application. PW3 even though deposed that the

property was cultivated with paddy till 1971, it is admitted

by her in cross-examination that         no    cultivation was

effected in the disputed land and now it is covered with

shrubs and trees. The deposition of Pws. 4 and 5 also would

also establish the fact      that the properties were not

cultivated with any fugitive cultivation as claimed by the

appellants and their deposition will not any way help the

appellants to substantiate their case that the property was

having fugitive cultivation or other cultivation, to infer non-

application of MPPF Act on the appointed day.

</p><p id="p_30">     12. Exts.C1 to C1(3) series also will not support their

case that they cultivated the property, on the other hand, it

could be gathered that most of the areas are covered with

forest species and shrubs. The commission report will not

support the case of the appellants that paddy has been

cultivated in the property as claimed by the appellants. On

evaluating the evidence adduced by the appellants, it is not

possible to infer that the properties were lands under

cultivation      and  that  they  had  cultivated  the  same

immediately prior to the commencement of 1971 Act and

that therefore the properties are not private forest as

defined in the Vesting Act.

<p id="p_31">     13.      On the other hand, RW1, the Range Officer of

Alathur,      who    conducted  personal  inspection  of the

properties, has deposed that it is the portion of Erattode

Muringamala Malavaram and the Malavaram has a total

extent of 241.6 hectares. Ext.B1 is the sketch with respect

to the property scheduled in O.A. No.51/2009 and Ext.B3 is

Ext.B5 is the sketch of the property scheduled in O.A.No.

No.53/2009 and Ext.B2, Ext.B4, Ext.B6 respectively are the

notifications pertaining to the disputed properties. He has

deposed that the properties are fully covered with forest

trees and it is lying contiguously and           the rocky region

having an extent of more than 100 acres comes within the

purview of erstwhile MPPF Act.

<blockquote id="blockquote_10">             14. In this connection we might refer to a decision

     of this Court in <a href="/doc/1680750/" id="a_11">K.C.Alexander v. State of Kerala</a> AIR

     1966 Kerala 72. The question arose in that case was

     whether the trees would come within the ambit of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_14">             "S.9 speaks of 'any crop or other product raised

       meant by 'crop or other product raised on the land'

       must be what is familiarly known in the law as

       'Emblements' . According to Black's Law Dictionary the

       word 'Crop' or 'Emblements' means:

       severed, and saved by manual labour, as cereals,

       vegetables, grass maturing for harvest or harvested

</blockquote><p id="p_33">It is further held that

       "The word 'cultivation' here is used in the general or

       broad sense in which the term "agricultural operations"

       was understood by the Supreme Court in Benoy

       Kumar's case AIR 1957 S.C.768. In this wider sense,

       planting     of eucalyptus  may    be   an   agricultural

       operation, and any land planted with eucalyptus may

       qualify for being treated as land under personal

       cultivation, for the purposes of that section. But when

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">MFA (Forest) 116/2014               23</span>


      we turn to S.2, the scheme is different. The exclusion

      there are:
</p>
<p id="p_34">             (i) gardens and nilams;
</p>
<p id="p_35">             (ii) tea, cocoa, coffee, rubber, cardamom and

      cinnamon plantation; and

     bearing trees or other agricultural crops.

</p><p id="p_37">             Every form of cultivation or agricultural operation

     is not within the scope of the exclusions here; the

     exclusions are limited to well-known classes. The first

     is garden land and nilams, a class with its own

     characteristics. The second is plantations of the

     specified categories, again a class with distinctive

     features. The third is land cultivated with fruit-bearing

     trees like cashew or other agricultural crops. The very

     setting and the order in which the exclusions are

     enumerated indicate that it is not the intention of the

     legislature to include in category (iii) above the product

     of every kind of cultivation or agricultural operation. If

     "agricultural crops" were to be construed widely, the

     detailed enumeration of the classes and the different

     kinds of crops comprised therein, would have been

     unnecessary."
</p>
<p id="p_38">     15. Applying the principles laid down in this decision,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">MFA (Forest) 116/2014           24</span>


with the materials available on record,       it is difficult to

conclude that any agricultural crop has been planted in the

properties in dispute, even though the appellants asserts so.

It is also to be noted that no reliable evidence was adduced

by the appellants so as to indicate that fruit bearing trees or

any other agricultural crop had been cultivated in the

properties prior to the appointed day so as to exclude the

lands in dispute from the definition of forest land. Under

the Vesting Act exception is given to private forest under

personal       cultivation within  the   ceiling   limits.   No

documentary evidence is available on record to infer that

they are only holding properties within the ceiling limits. In

State of Kerala Vs Thomas( 1987( 1 )KLT 530) it is held

that, it is elementary that a person who claims exception

under either of these sub-sections has to affirmatively prove

by positive evidence that he fulfills all the requirements of

the provision. A mere assertion by him will not be sufficient

substitute for affirmative evidence or positive proof. As it

MFA (Forest) 116/2014         25


has also come out in evidence that the boundaries of the

properties are forest lands covered with forest trees, the

learned Tribunal is justified in presuming that originally it

was a forest land and continues as a forest.

</p><p id="p_39">     16. Apart from Exts.A1 to A14, the appellants have not

produced any documents so as to conclude that the

properties were planted with agricultural crops or they are

having the intention to plant the area with agricultural crops

and their holdings are within the ceiling limits . But in the

appeal,      they    have produced  certain  documents      as

Annexures A1 to A6 along with an application under Order

41 Rule 27 of CPC to accept the same in evidence.

According to the learned counsel for the appellants, the

documents produced as Annexures A1 to A6 would show

that Chathu Nair, their predecessor in interest, was holding

possession of the properties for cultivation and as his legal

heirs, the properties were used for agricultural operations

prior to the appointed day.       So it is not having the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">MFA (Forest) 116/2014            26</span>


characteristic features of a forest land and that MPPF Act is

not applicable. So, their prayer is to accept the documents

produced as Annexures A1 to A6 and to set aside the

impugned order under challenge.          Before going into the

details of the documents referred above, the question to be

looked into is whether the relevant provision can be made

applicable to the facts of this case .
</p>
<p id="p_40">     17. Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC reads as follows:

</p><p id="p_41">         R.27(1) -The parties to an appeal shall not be

      entitled to produce additional evidence, whether

      oral or documentary, in the Appellate Court. But

      (aa) the party seeking to produce additional

      evidence, establishes that notwithstanding the

      exercise of due diligence, such evidence was not

      within his knowledge or could not, after the

      exercise of due diligence be produced by him at

      the time when the decree appealed against was

      passed, or

</p><p id="p_43">              (b)the appellate court requires any document

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">MFA (Forest) 116/2014           27</span>


      to be produced or any witness to be examined to

      enable it to pronounce judgment, or for any other

      substantial cause,

              the Appellate Court may allow such evidence

      or document to be produced, or witness to be

      examined.
</p>
<p id="p_44">              (2) Wherever additional evidence is allowed

      to be produced by an appellate Court, the Court

      shall record the reason for its admission.."



</p><p id="p_45">      18. It is well settled that normally the appellate court

should not travel outside the records produced before the

trial court and cannot take any evidence in appeal.     Order

41 Rule 27 of CPC enables the court to take additional

evidence only in the circumstances specifically enumerated

therein. The first point to be established by a person seeking

introduction of additional evidence is that even after due

diligence such evidence was not within his knowledge or

could not after exercise of due diligence be produced by him

at the time when the decree appealed against was passed.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">MFA (Forest) 116/2014          28</span>


Therefore, the appellate court is entitled to call for fresh

evidence only on satisfaction of the conditions laid down in

the rules.       Here, it is to be noted that in the appeal

memorandum, there is no mention that the documents

produced along with the petition were not within their

knowledge or could not produce before the trial court even

after exercise of due diligence. It is also well established

that the power under Order 41 Rule 27 of CPC should be

used sparingly and only if the party is able to establish that

even after their best efforts, such additional evidence could

not be adduced at the first instance and the documents are

relevant for deciding the issue. Here it is to be noted that

there is no whisper regarding the same in the appeal

memorandum,          but they   have  simply   produced    the

documents, without any satisfactory explanation for not

having produced it before the trial court. So, it is not just

and proper to accept Exts.A1 to A6 produced along with the

appeal memorandum in evidence as prayed for by the

MFA (Forest) 116/2014         29


appellants. Moreover, most of the documents have been

obtained only much later after disposal of the O.As. by the

learned Forest Tribunal. So, the prayer for acceptance of

additional documents under Order 41 Rule 27 is rejected.

In short, we find absolutely no justification to interfere with

the findings of the learned Forest Tribunal.
