    aforementioned report authored by Hon'ble Judges Committee is





    a mere exercise on Administrative side, rather said report is result

    of judicial scrutiny and application of the minds of the Members of

    the Hon'ble Judges Committee. Respondents have stated in the





    aforesaid affidavits that there is reasonable apprehension in their

    minds that they may not be able to persuade me (Justice Sandeep

    Sharma) to change my mind and thereafter return a judicial

    finding, which is not in consonance with the judicial conclusions

    already reached by the Hon'ble Judges Committee in the report

    respondents No.3 and 4, while inviting the attention of this Court




    to para-9 of affidavit, which has otherwise been taken note





    hereinabove, contended that though deponents have complete and

    absolutely firm faith, and believes in the fairness in the present





    Bench, but since one of us (Justice Sandeep Sharma,J.) has

    authored report Annexure P-12, which is being relied upon by the

    petitioners, it would be in the interest of justice in case Justice

    Sandeep Sharma,J. recuses from hearing the case. While referring

    to the report Annexure P-12, Mr.Sood made a serious attempt to

    persuade this Court to agree with this contention that Hon'ble

</p>
<p id="p_12">    6.          Mr.Sood further contended that perusal of specific

    reference made to Hon'ble Judges Committee for adjudication itself





    suggests that report Annexure P-12 is result of judicial scrutiny,

    based upon judgments passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in <a href="/doc/1977799/" id="a_2">All India

    Judges' Association and Others vs. Union of India and Others</a>

    (2002)4 SCC 247 and <a href="/doc/1977799/" id="a_3">All India Judges' Association and

    Others vs. Union of India and Others</a> (2010)15 SCC 170 (for

    short 'All India Judges Association') and as such it would not be



    proper and in the interest of justice in case, cases at hand are

    heard and decided by a Bench in which one of us (Justice Sandeep




    Sharma,J.) is a Member.
</p>




<p id="p_13">    7.          Mr.Sood, while referring to the report Annexure P-12

    submitted by Hon'ble Judges Committee, also contended that





    Committee has held petitioners senior to respondents No.2 and 3,

    while interpreting judgment laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in

    All India Judges Association's case (supra) and as such it can

    be easily interferred and presumed that Justice Sharma, being a

    Member of that Committee, has/had formed a definite opinion

    with regard to claim of seniority, which is cause of dispute interse

    has already formed an opinion, being a Member of Committee in

    favour of one of the parties, the respondents, who are definitely




                                                             .
</p>
<p id="p_14">    aggrieved of the report Annexure P-12, cannot be presumed to

    have unreasonable apprehension in their mind with regard to bias,





    rather they are well within their rights to contend that since

    Justice Sharma, being Member of the Committee, has already

    applied his mind and arrived at one decision, they may not be able





    to persuade him to change his mind.
</p>
<p id="p_15">    8.          Lastly, Mr.Sood contended that since Justice Sandeep

    Sharma has given report Annexure P-12 alonwith Justice Vivek

    Singh Thakur, who has already recused, he would be pre-

<p id="p_16">    determined to hold the same to be valid and legal. In support of

    his contention, Mr.Sood placed reliance upon the judgments of

<p id="p_35">    19.          One thing is quiet apparent from the discussion made

    hereinabove that entire exercise done by the Committee is strictly

    in terms of orders dated 28.4.2016 and 25.10.2017 passed by

    Hon'ble Apex Court in I.A. No.334 of 2014 in Writ Petition (Civil)

    India Judges Association's case (supra), Committee, while

    submitting its report in terms of orders dated 28.4.2016 and





    25.10.2017, has certainly interpreted the judgment in its own

    had cited certain judgments before Committee to distinguish

    judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in All India Judges

    which bothered me was that once report submitted by Committee

<blockquote id="blockquote_15">          57.    It is, thus, evident that the English Courts have

                 decision. Many judges have laid down and applied
                 the `real likelihood' formula, holding that the test for




                 disqualification is whether the facts, as assessed by
                 the court, give rise to a real likelihood of bias. Other
                 judges have employed a `reasonable suspicion' test,

                 that no person should adjudicate in any way if it

              they cannot have confidence in the decision." The

              time, two things need to be remembered: the

              being observed is "a professional judge whose
              training, tradition and oath or affirmation require
              [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial

<p id="p_49">     71.   The principles which emerge from the aforesaid
           decisions are that no man can be a Judge in his own





           cause and justice should not only be done, but
           manifestly be seen to be done. Scales should not only
           be held even but it must not be seen to be inclined. A
           person having interest in the subject matter of cause
           is precluded from acting as a Judge. To disqualify a
           person from adjudicating on the ground of interest in

           the subject matter of lis, the test of real likelihood of
           the bias is to be applied. In other words, one has to

           enquire as to whether there is real danger of bias on
           the part of the person against whom such
           apprehension is expressed in the sense that he might
           favour or disfavour a party. In each case, the Court
           has to consider whether a fair minded and informed
           person, having considered all the facts would


           reasonably apprehend that the Judge would not act
           impartially. To put it differently, the test would be
           whether a reasonably intelligent man fully apprised
           of all the facts would have a serious apprehension of




           bias. In cases of non-pecuniary bias, the `real
           likelihood' test has been preferred over the
           `reasonable suspicion' test and the Courts have





           consistently held that in deciding the question of
           bias one has to take into consideration human
           probabilities and ordinary course of human conduct.
           We may add that real likelihood of bias should
           appear not only from the materials ascertained by





           the complaining party, but also from such other facts
           which it could have readily ascertained and easily
           verified by making reasonable inquiries.

                facts could give rise to reasonable apprehension in
                the mind of an intelligent person that respondent
                No.3 was likely to be biased. A reasonable, objective
                and informed person may say that respondent No.3
                would not have opposed elevation of the petitioner if
                he was not satisfied that there was some substance

                be objective and have the capacity to decipher grain
                from the chaff, truth from the falsehood and we have
                no doubt that respondent No.3 possesses these





                qualities. We also agree with the Committee that
                objection by both sides perhaps "alone apart from
                anything     else   is  sufficient   to  confirm    his
                impartiality". However, the issue of bias of
                respondent No.3 has not to be seen from the view

                paramount importance. From the facts narrated in
                the earlier part of the judgment it can be said that
                petitioner's apprehension of likelihood of bias against

                respondent No.3 is reasonable and not fanciful,
                though, in fact, he may not be biased."

<p id="p_54">    25.         In nutshell, what emerges from the aforesaid judgment

    is that while determining whether non-pecuniary bias would vitiate



    judicial or quasi judicial decision, one should rely a `reasonable

    suspicion' test emphasizing that justice must be seen to be done,




    and that no person should adjudicate in any way if it might





    reasonably be thought that he ought not to act because of some

    personal interest.    Another principle, which emerge from the





    aforesaid judgment, which has otherwise taken note of, is that no

    man can be a Judge in his own cause and justice should not only

    be done, but manifestly be seen to be done. Scales should not only

    be held even but it must not be seen to be inclined. A person

    having interest in the subject matter of cause is precluded from

    acting as a Judge. To disqualify a person from adjudicating on the

    ground of interest in the subject matter of lis, the test of real

    in the aforesaid judgment that one has to enquire as to whether

<p id="p_59">     13.   Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal, (1852) 10 ER 301, is
           one of the earliest cases where the question of
           disqualification of a Judge was considered. The




           ground was that he had some pecuniary interest in
           the matter. We are not concerned with the details of
           the dispute between the parties to the case. Lord





           Chancellor Cottenham heard the appeal against an
           order of the Vice-Chancellor and confirmed the order.
           The order went in favour of the defendant company. A
           year later, Dimes discovered that Lord Chancellor





           Cottenham had shares in the defendant company. He
           petitioned the Queen for her intervention. The
           litigation had a long and chequered history, the
           details of which are not material for us. Eventually,
           the matter reached the House of Lords. The House
           dismissed the appeal of Dimes on the ground that
           setting aside of the order of the Lord Chancellor
           would still leave the order of the Vice-Chancellor
           intact as Lord Chancellor had merely affirmed the
           order of the Vice-Chancellor. However, the House of
           Lords held that participation of Lord Cottenham in
           the adjudicatory process was not justified. Though
           Lord Campbell observed: (Dimes case, ER p.315)

              "...No one can suppose that Lord Cottenham could
              be, in the remotest degree, influenced by the interest

               he had in this concern: but, my Lords, it is of the
               last importance that the maxim that no man is to
               be a judge in his own cause be held sacred. And that
               is not to be confined to a cause in which he is a
               party, but applies to a cause in which he has an
               interest




                                                                .

               influenced by their personal interest, but to avoid
               the appearance of labouring under such an
               influence."
</p>




<p id="p_61">     14.   Summing up the principle laid down by the
            abovementioned case, Hammond Op cit fn 5 observed
            as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_62">               "The 'no-pecuniary interest' principle as expressed
               in Dimes requires a judge to be automatically





               disqualified when there is neither actual bias nor
               even an apprehension of bias on the part of that
               judge. The fundamental philosophical underpinning
               of Dimes is therefore predicated on a conflict of
              rinterest approach."
</p>
<p id="p_63">     15.    The next landmark case on the question of "bias" is
            R. v. Gough, (1993) AC 646. Gough was convicted for

            an offence of conspiracy to rob and was sentenced to
            imprisonment for fifteen years by the Trial Court. It
            was a trial by Jury. After the conviction was
            announced, it was brought to the notice of the Trial
            Court that one of the jurors was a neighbour of the
            convict. The convict appealed to the Court of Appeal


            unsuccessfully. One of the grounds on which the
            conviction was challenged was that, in view of the
            fact that one of the jurors being a neighbour of the
            convict presented a possibility of bias on her part and
            therefore the conviction is unsustainable. The Court




            of Appeal noticed that there are two lines of
            authority propounding two different tests for
            determining disqualification of a Judge on the





            ground of bias:
</p>
<p id="p_64">               (1) "real danger" test; and





               (2) "reasonable suspicion" test.
</p>
<p id="p_65">            The Court of Appeal confirmed the conviction by
            applying the "real danger" test.
</p>
<p id="p_66">     16.    The matter was carried further to the House of Lords.
</p><p id="p_67">            Lord Goff noticed that there are a series of
            authorities which are "not only large in number but
            bewildering in their effect". After analyzing the
            judgment in Dimes, Lord Goff held: (R. v. Gough, 1993
            AC 646, AC p.661 F-G)

               "In such a case, therefore, not only is it irrelevant
               that there was in fact no bias on the part of the
               tribunal, but there is no question of investigating,
               from an objective point of view, whether there was

              any real likelihood of bias, or any reasonable
              suspicion of bias, on the facts of the particular
              case. The nature of the interest is such that public
              confidence in the administration of justice requires
              that the decision should not stand."
</p>



<p id="p_68">                                                            .
</p><p id="p_69">           In other words, where a Judge has a pecuniary
           interest, no further inquiry as to whether there was a





           "real danger" or "reasonable suspicion" of bias is
           required to be undertaken. But in other cases, such
           an inquiry is required and the relevant test is the
           "real danger" test. (ough case, AC pp.661 G-H-662 A-B)





              "...But in other cases, the inquiry is directed to the
              question whether there was such a degree of
              possibility of bias on the part of the tribunal that
              the court will not allow the decision to stand. Such
              a question may arise in a wide variety of
              circumstances. These include .... cases in which the





              member of the tribunal has an interest in the
              outcome of the proceedings, which falls short of a
              direct pecuniary interest. Such interests may vary
              widely in their nature, in their effect, and in their
              relevance to the subject matter of the proceedings;
              and there is no rule .... that the possession of such

              an interest automatically disqualifies the member
              of the tribunal from sitting. Each case falls to be
              considered on its own facts. "
</p>
<p id="p_70">     17.   The learned Judge examined various important cases
           on the subject and finally concluded: (Gough case, AC
           p.670 E-G)


              "...Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer to
              state the test in terms of real danger rather than
              real likelihood, to ensure that the court is thinking
              in terms of possibility rather than probability of
              bias. Accordingly, having ascertained the relevant




              circumstances, the court should ask itself whether,
              having regard to those circumstances, there was a
              real danger of bias on the part of the relevant
              member of the tribunal in question, in the sense





              that he might unfairly regard (or have unfairly
              regarded) with favour, or disfavour, the case of a
              party to the issue under consideration by him...."
</p>




<p id="p_71">     18.   Lord Woolf agreed with Lord Goff in his separate
           judgment. He held:
</p>
<p id="p_72">              "... There is only one established special category
              and that exists where the tribunal has a pecuniary
              or proprietary interest in the subject matter of the
              proceedings as in Dimes v. Proprietors of Grand
              Junction Canal, 3 H.L. Case 759. The courts should
              hesitate long before creating any other special
              category since this will immediately create
              uncertainty as to what are the parameters of that
              category and what is the test to be applied in the
              case of that category. The real danger test is quite
              capable of producing the right answer and ensure
              that the purity of justice is maintained across the
              range of situations where bias may exist."

<p id="p_73">     19.   In substance, the Court held that in cases where the
           Judge has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the
           proceedings, his disqualification is automatic. No
           further enquiry whether such an interest lead to a
           "real danger" or gave rise to a "reasonable suspicion"
           is necessary. In cases of other interest, the test to

</p>
<p id="p_75">     20.   The Pinochet case added one more category to the
           cases of automatic disqualification for a judge.
           Pinochet, a former Chilean dictator, was sought to be





           arrested and extradited from England for his conduct
           during his incumbency in office. The issue was
           whether Pinochet was entitled to immunity from such
           arrest or extradition. Amnesty International, a
           charitable organisation, participated in the said
           proceedings with the leave of the Court. The House of





           Lords held that Pinochet did not enjoy any such
           immunity. Subsequently, it came to light that Lord
           Hoffman, one of the members of the Board which
           heard the Pinochet case, was a Director and
           Chairman of a company (known as A.I.C.L.) which was
           closely linked with Amnesty International. An

           application was made to the House of Lords to set
           aside the earlier judgment on the ground of bias on

           the part of Lord Hoffman.

<blockquote id="blockquote_30">                        "The fundamental principle is that a man may
                   not be a judge in his own cause. This principle, as
                   developed by the courts, has two very similar but
                   not identical implications. First it may be applied
                   literally: if a judge is in fact a party to the
                   litigation or has a financial or proprietary interest
                   in its outcome then he is indeed sitting as a judge in
                   his own cause. In that case, the mere fact that he is
                   a party to the action or has a financial or
                   proprietary interest in its outcome is sufficient to
                   cause his automatic disqualification. The second

              application of the principle is where a judge is not a
              party to the suit and does not have a financial
              interest in its outcome, but in some other way his
              conduct or behaviour may give rise to a suspicion
              that he is not impartial, for example because of his
              friendship with a party. This second type of case is
              not strictly speaking an application of the principle




                                                            .

              since the judge will not normally be himself
              benefiting, but providing a benefit for another by
              failing to be impartial.
</p>
<p id="p_79">                  In my judgment, this case falls within the first





              category of case, viz. where the judge is disqualified
              because he is a judge in his own cause. In such a
              case, once it is shown that the judge is himself a
              party to the cause, or has a relevant interest in its
              subject matter, he is disqualified without any
              investigation into whether there was a likelihood or
              suspicion of bias. The mere fact of his interest is





              sufficient to disqualify him unless he has made
              sufficient disclosure...."
</p>
<p id="p_80">           And framed the question: (AC p.134B-C)

              "....the question then arises whether, in non-
</p>
<p id="p_81">              financial litigation, anything other than a financial
              or proprietary interest in the outcome is sufficient

              automatically to disqualify a man from sitting as
              judge in the cause."
</p>
<p id="p_82">                                             (emphasis supplied)

           He opined that although the earlier cases have



              "all dealt with automatic disqualification on the
              grounds of pecuniary interest, there is no good
              reason in principle for so limiting automatic




              disqualification." (AC p.135B)

</p><p id="p_83">     23.   Lord Wilkinson concluded that Amnesty International





           and its associate company known as A.I.C.L., had a
           non-pecuniary interest established that Senator
           Pinochet was not immune from the process of
           extradition. He concluded that,





              "....the matter at issue does not relate to money or
              economic advantage but is concerned with the
              promotion of the cause, the rationale disqualifying
              a judge applies just as much if the judge's decision
              will lead to the promotion of a cause in which the
              judge is involved together with one of the parties"

           whether the fact that Lord Hoffman was only a
           member of A.I.C.L. but not a member of Amnesty
           International made any difference to the principle,
           Lord Wilkinson opined that: (Pinochet case, AC

              following principles emerge;
</p>
<p id="p_89">           25.1   If a Judge has a financial interest in the
                  outcome of a case, he is automatically
              r   disqualified from hearing the case.
</p>
<p id="p_90">           25.2   In cases where the interest of the Judge in the
                  case is other than financial, then the

                  disqualification is not automatic but an
                  enquiry is required whether the existence of
                  such an interest disqualifies the Judge tested
                  in the light of either on the principle of "real
                  danger" or "reasonable apprehension" of bias.
</p>

<p id="p_91">           25.3   The Pinochet case added a new category i.e
                  that the Judge is automatically disqualified
                  from hearing a case where the Judge is
                  interested in a cause which is being promoted




                  by one of the parties to the case.
</p>
<p id="p_92">     26.      It is nobody's case that, in the case at hand, Justice





              Khehar had any pecuniary interest or any other
              interest falling under the second of the above-
              mentioned categories. By the very nature of the case,
              no such interest can arise at all.
</p>




<p id="p_93">     27.      The question is whether the principle of law laid
              down in Pinochet case is attracted. In other words,
              whether Justice Khehar can be said to be sharing any
              interest which one of the parties is promoting. All the
              parties to these proceedings claim to be promoting
              the cause of ensuring the existence of an impartial
              and independent judiciary. The only difference of
              opinion between the parties is regarding the process
              by which such a result is to be achieved. Therefore, it
              cannot be said that Justice Khehar shares any
              interest which any one of the parties to the
              proceeding is seeking to promote."

           recusing from the case so that the litigants or the
           well- meaning public may not entertain any

            irrelevant reasons like the cases being very old,
            involving detailed consideration, decision on several
            questions of law, a situation where the Judge is not

            any motive for the recusal. To put it differently, it is
            part of his duty to be accountable to the Constitution





            by upholding it without fear or favour, affection or

            constitutional duty, as reflected in one's oath, to be
            transparent and accountable, and hence, a Judge is
            required to indicate reasons for his recusal from a

            v. Pollak, 1952 SCC OnLine US SC 69, the Supreme
            Court of United States dealt with a question whether
            in the District of Columbia, the Constitution of the

            United States precludes a street railway company
            from receiving and amplifying radio programmes

            through loudspeakers in its passenger vehicles.
            Justice Frankfurter was always averse to the practice
            and he was of the view that it is not proper. His
            personal philosophy and his stand on the course
            apparently, were known to the people. Even
            otherwise, he was convinced of his strong position on


            this issue. Therefore, stating so, he recused from
            participating in the case. To quote his words: (SCC
            OnLine US SC paras 33-34)




           "33. The judicial process demands that a judge move
                within the framework of relevant legal rules and
                the covenanted modes of thought for ascertaining
                them. He must think dispassionately and submerge





                private feeling on every aspect of a case. There is a
                good deal of shallow talk that the judicial robe does
                not change the man within it. It does. The fact is
                that on the whole judges do lay aside private views





                in discharging their judicial functions. This is
                achieved through training, professional habits, self-
                discipline and that fortunate alchemy by which men
                are loyal to the obligation with which they are
                entrusted. But it is also true that reason cannot
                control the subconscious influence of feelings of
                which it is unaware. When there is ground for
                believing that such unconscious feelings may
                operate in the ultimate judgment, or may not
                unfairly lead others to believe they are operating,
                judges recuse themselves. They do not sit in
                judgment. They do this for a variety of reasons. The
                guiding consideration is that the administration of
                justice should reasonably appear to be disinterested
                as well as be so in fact.

</p>




<p id="p_103">            State of A.P., (1974)3 SCC 459], in case, the right-
            minded persons entertain a feeling that there is any
            likelihood of bias on the part of the Judge, he must
            recuse. Mere possibility of such a feeling is not





            enough. There must exist circumstances where a
            reasonable and fair-minded man would think it
            probably or likely that the Judge would be prejudiced
            against a litigant. To quote: (SCC pp.465-66, para 16)

           "16. The tests of "real likelihood" and "reasonable
                suspicion" are really inconsistent with each other.
</p>




<p id="p_104">                We think that the reviewing authority must make a
                determination on the basis of the whole evidence
                before it, whether a reasonable man would in the
                circumstances infer that there is real likelihood of
                bias. The Court must look at the impression which
                other people have. This follows from the principle
              r that Justice must not only be done but seen to be
                done. If right minded persons would think that

                there is real likelihood of bias on the part of an
                inquiring officer, he must not conduct the inquiry;
                nevertheless, there must be a real likelihood of bias.
                Surmise or conjecture would not be enough. There
                must exist circumstances from which reasonable
                men would think it probable or likely that the
                inquiring officer will be prejudiced against the


                delinquent. The Court will not inquire whether he
                was really prejudiced. If a reasonable man would
                think on the basis of the existing circumstances
                that he is likely to be prejudiced, that is sufficient
                to quash the decision [see per Lord Denning, H.R. in




                (Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd. v. Lannon
                etc. (1968) 3 WLR 694 at 707). We should not,
                however, be understood to deny that the Court





                might with greater propriety apply the "reasonable
                suspicion" test in criminal or in proceedings
                analogous to criminal proceedings."

<p id="p_105">     74.    There may be situations where the mischievous





            litigants wanting to avoid a Judge may be because he
            is known to them to be very strong and thus making
            an attempt for forum shopping by raising baseless
            submissions on conflict of interest.          In the
            Constitutional Court of South Africa in The President
            of the Republic of South Africa etc. v. South African
            Rugby Football Union,(1999)4 SA 147, has made two
            very relevant observations in this regard: (ZACC para

            "46. ... 'Although it is important that justice must be

</p>
<p id="p_107">                'It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the

</p><p id="p_109">     75.    Ultimately, the question is whether a fair-minded and
            reasonably informed person, on correct facts, would





            reasonably entertain a doubt on the impartiality of
            the Judge. The reasonableness of the apprehension
            must be assessed in the light of the oath of Office he
            has taken as a Judge to administer justice without
            fear or favour, affection or ill-will and his ability to
            carry out the oath by reason of his training and
            experience whereby he is in a position to disabuse his





            mind of any irrelevant personal belief or pre-
            disposition or unwarranted apprehensions of his
            image in public or difficulty in deciding a
            controversial issue particularly when the same is
            highly sensitive.
</p>
<p id="p_110">     76.

            These issues have been succinctly discussed by the

            Constitutional Court in The President of the Republic
            of South Africa, (1999)4 SA 147 on an application for
            recusal of four of the Judges in the Constitutional
            Court. After elaborately considering the factual
            matrix as well as the legal position, the Court held as
            follows: (ZACC para 104)



           "104. ...While litigants have the right to apply for the
                recusal of judicial officers where there is a
                reasonable apprehension that they will not decide a
                case impartially, this does not give them the right




                to object to their cases being heard by particular
                judicial officers simply because they believe that
                such persons will be less likely to decide the case in





                their favour, than would other judicial officers
                drawn from a different segment of society. The
                nature of the judicial function involves the
                performance of difficult and at times unpleasant
                tasks. Judicial officers are nonetheless required to





                "administer justice to all persons alike without
                fear, favour or prejudice, in accordance with the
                Constitution and the law". To this end they must
                resist all manner of pressure, regardless of where it
                comes from. This is the constitutional duty common
                to all judicial officers. If they deviate, the
                independence of the judiciary would be undermined,
                and in turn, the Constitution itself."
