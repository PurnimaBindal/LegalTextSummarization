</p>
<p id="p_4">	Leave granted.
</p><p id="p_5">      I	 have  carefully  gone through	the  draft  judgment
prepared  by  our  esteemed   colleague	 Justice  Sujata  V.
Manohar.   I respectfully agree with some of the conclusions
arrived	 at  therein at pages 61 and 62, namely,  conclusion
nos.   1 and 4.	 However, so far as conclusion nos.  2 and 3
are  concerned,	 I respectfully record my  reservations	 and
partially  dissent  as noted hereinafter.  In my  view,	 the
common	entrance examination envisaged under the regulations
framed	by  the	 Medical Council of India  for	Postgraduate
Medical	 Education  does not curtail the power of the  State
Authorities,  legislative as well as executive, from  fixing
suitable  minimum  qualifying marks differently for  general
category  candidates  and for SCs/STs and OBC candidates  as
highlighted in my present judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_6">      So  far as conclusion no.3 is concerned, with respect,
it  is	not possible for me to agree with the reasoning	 and
the final conclusion to which our esteemed colleague Justice
Sujata	V.  Manohar has reached, namely, that fixing minimum
qualifying marks for passing the entrance test for admission
to  postgraduate  courses is concerned with the standard  of
Postgraduate Medical Education.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      I,  however,  respectfully  agree	 to  that  part	  of
conclusion  no.3  which states that there cannot be  a	wide
disparity  between the minimum qualifying marks for reserved
category  candidates  and the minimum qualifying  marks	 for
general	  category  candidates	at   this  level.   I	also
respectfully  agree that there cannot be dilution of minimum
qualifying marks for such reserved category candidates up to
almost	a vanishing point.  The dilution can be only up to a
reasonable  extent  with  a rock bottom,  below	 which	such
dilution   would   not	be   permissible   as	demonstrated
hereinafter  in this judgment.	In my view, maximum dilution
can  be up to 50% of the minimum qualifying marks prescribed
for  general  category	candidates.  On that  basis  if	 45%
passing	  marks	 are  prescribed   for	 general   category,
permissible  dilution can then go up to 22 and 1/2 % (50% of
45%).	Any  dilution  below this rock bottom would  not  be
permissible  under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_1">Article  15(4)</a> of  the  Constitution  of
India.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      For  reaching  the  aforesaid   conclusions,  I	have
independently	considered  the	 scheme	  of  the   relevant
provisions  of the Constitution in the light of the  various
judgments of this Court as detailed hereinafter :
</p>
<p id="p_9">      Entry  66	 of List I, Old Entry 11(2) of List  II	 and
Entry 25 of List III:
</p>
<p id="p_10">      Entry  66	 of List I of the Seventh Schedule reads  as
under  :   Co-ordination and determination of standards	 in
institutions for higher education or research and scientific
and technical institutions.
</p>

<p id="p_11">      Old  Entry  11 of List II, as earlier existing in	 the
Constitution of India, read as under :
</p>
<p id="p_12">      Education	 including  universities,  subject  to	the
provisions  of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I and entry
25 of List III.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      While  Entry  25	of List III as now existing  in	 the
Seventh	 Schedule  of  the  Constitution reads	as  under  :
Education, including technical education, medical education
and  universities, subject to the provisions of entries	 63,
64,  65 and 66 of List I;  vocational and technical training
of labour.
</p>

<p id="p_14">      A	 conjoint  reading of these entries makes  it  clear
that  as  per Entry 11 of List II which then existed on	 the
statute book, all aspects of education, including university
education,  were within the exclusive legislative competence
of  the	 State Legislatures subject to Entries 63 to  66  of
List I and the then existing Entry 25 of List III.  The then
existing  Entry 25 of the Concurrent List conferred power on
the   Union  Parliament	 and   State  Legislature  to  enact
legislation  with  respect  to	 vocational  and   technical
training of labour.  Thus, the said Entry 25 of List III had
nothing	 to  do	 with	Medical	 Education.   Any  provision
regarding  Medical Education, therefore, was thus covered by
Entry  11  of List II subject of course to the	exercise  of
legislative  powers by the Union Legislature as per  entries
63  to 66 of List I.  In the light of the aforesaid relevant
entries,  as  they stood then, a Constitution Bench of	this
court  in  <a href="/doc/1627518/" id="a_2">The	Gujarat University, Ahmedabad  vs.   Krishna
Ranganath Mudholkar &amp; Ors</a>., 1963 Suppl.(1) SCR 112, speaking
through	 J.C.Shah,  J.,	 for the majority, had	to  consider
whether	 the  State  Legislature could impose  an  exclusive
medium of instruction Gujarati for the students who had to
study	and  take  examination	 conducted  by	the  Gujarat
University.   It was held that If a legislation imposing  a
regional  language  or	Hindi  as the  exclusive  medium  of
instruction is likely to result in lowering of standards, it
must  necessarily  fall	 within	 Item 66 of List  I  and  be
excluded  to that extent from Item 11 of List II as it then
stood  in the Constitution.  Medium of instruction was	held
to  have  an  important	 bearing  on  the  effectiveness  of
instruction  and  resultant standards achieved thereby.	  In
this  connection, pertinent observations were made at  pages
142  and  143  of  the	 aforesaid  Report:   If  adequate
text-books are not available or competent instructors in the
medium,	  through  which  instruction  is  directed  to	  be
imparted, are not available, or the students are not able to
receive	 or imbibe instructions through the medium in  which
it  is	imparted,  standards  must of  necessity  fall,	 and
legislation  for co-ordination of standards in such  matters
would include legislation relating to medium of instruction.
If legislation relating to imposition of an exclusive medium
of  instruction	 in a regional language or in Hindi,  having
regard	to the absence of text-books and journals, competent
teachers  and  incapacity of the students to understand	 the
subjects,  is likely to result in the lowering of standards,
that  legislation  would, in our judgment, necessarily	fall
within	item 66 of List I and would be deemed to be excluded
to  that extent from the amplitude of the power conferred by
item No.11 of List II.
</p>

<p id="p_15">      However,	after the deletion of Entry 11 from List  II
and re-drafting of Entry 25 in the Concurrent List as in the
present	 form,	it  becomes  clear   that  all	aspects	  of
education,   including	 admission  of	 students   to	 any
educational  course,  would be covered by the general  entry
regarding   education	including   technical  and   medical
education  etc.	  as found in the Concurrent List  but	that
would  be  subject to the provisions of Entries 63 to 66  of
List  I.   Therefore, on a conjoint reading of Entry  66  of
List  I and Entry 25 of List III, it has to be held that  so
long  as the Parliament does not occupy the field  earmarked
for  it	 under	Entry  66 of List I or for  that  matter  by
invoking  its  concurrent  powers  as per Entry	 25  in	 the
Concurrent  List,  the question of admission of students  to
any  medical  course would not remain outside the domain  of
the  State  Legislature.  It is not in dispute that up	till
now  the  Parliament, by any legislative exercise either  by
separate  legislation  or  by amending	the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_3">Indian  Medical
Council	 Act</a>, 1956 has not legislated about the	 controlling
of  admissions	of  students  to  higher  medical  education
courses	 in  the  country.   Therefore,	 the  only  question
remains	 whether  the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_4">Indian Medical Council Act</a> enacted  as
per Entry 66 of List I covers this aspect.  If it covers the
topic  then obviously by the express language of Entry 25 of
List  III,  the	 said  topic would  get	 excluded  from	 the
legislative  field  available to the State Legislature	even
under  Entry  25  of Concurrent List.	For  answering	this
question, we have therefore, to see the width of Entry 66 of
List  I.  It deals with Co-ordination and determination	 of
standards  in  institutions for higher education... A  mere
reading	 of this Entry shows that the legislation which	 can
be  covered  by	 this  entry  has  to  deal  basically	with
Co-ordination	and   determination    of   standards	 in
institutions  for  higher education.  Meaning thereby,	the
standards  of  education  at   the  institutions  of  higher
education   where  students  are   taking  education   after
admission  are	to be monitored by such a legislation or  in
other  words  after  their enrolment for  studying  at	such
institutions  for  higher  education such students  have  to
undertake  the prescribed course of education evolved with a
view  to  having  uniform and well laid	 down  standards  of
higher	medical	 education.   It  cannot  be  disputed	that
postgraduate teaching in medical education is being imparted
by  institutions  for  higher medical  education.   But	 the
question  is  whether  the topic of  admission	of  eligible
candidates/students   for   taking     education   in	such
institutions  has  anything  to do  with  co-ordination	 and
determination  of  standards  in  these	 institutions.	 Now
standards  in  the institutions have been prefixed by  two
words,	namely,	 co-ordination and determination  of  such
standards   as	per  Entry  66	of   List  I.	So  far	  as
co-ordination  is  concerned, it is a topic  dealing  with
provision  of  uniform standards of education  in  different
institutions  so  that	there  may  not	 be  any  hiatus  or
dissimilarity  regarding  imparting  of education  by  these
institutions  to the students taking up identical courses of
study  for  higher medical education in these  institutions.
That  necessarily  has	a  nexus  with	the  regulations  of
standards  of  education to be imparted to already  admitted
students  to the concerned courses of higher education.	 But
so  far	 as  the  phrase   determination  of  standards	 in
institutions   for  higher  education	is  concerned,	 it
necessarily  has  to take in its sweep the  requirements  of
having	a  proper  curriculum of studies and  the  requisite
intensity  of practical training to be imparted to  students
attaining  such courses.  But in order to maintain the fixed
standard   of	such  higher   medical	education   in	 the
institutions,	basic  qualification  or   eligibility	 for
admission of students for being imparted such education also
would assume importance.  Thus, the phrase determination of
standards  in institutions for higher education would  also
take  in  its sweep the basic qualifications or	 eligibility
criteria   for	admitting  students  to	 such	courses	  of
education.   It	 can,  therefore, be held  that	 the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_5">Indian
Medical	 Council Act</a>, 1956 enacted under Entry 66 of List  I
could  legitimately authorise Medical Council of India which
is the apex technical body in the field of medical education
and  which  is enjoined to provide  appropriately  qualified
medical	 practitioners for serving the suffering humanity to
prescribe  basic standards of eligibility and  qualification
for  medical  graduates	 who  aspire  to  join	postgraduate
courses	 for obtaining higher medical degrees by studying in
the institutions imparting such education.
</p>
<p id="p_16">      But  the	next question survives as to  whether  after
laying down the basic qualifications or eligibility criteria
for  admission	of graduate medical students to	 the  higher
medical education courses which may uniformly apply all over
India  as  directed by the Medical Council of India, it	 can
have  further  power  and authority to	control	 the  intake
capacity  of  these  eligible  students in  a  given  course
conducted  by  the  institutions   for	higher	postgraduate
medical	 education.  In other words, whether it can  control
the admissions of eligible candidates to such higher medical
education courses or lay down any criteria for short-listing
of  such  eligible candidates when the available  seats	 for
admission  to  such  higher postgraduate  medical  education
courses	 are  limited  and the	eligible  claimants  seeking
admission to such courses are far greater in number?  So far
as  this question is concerned, it immediately projects	 the
problem	 of short- listing of available eligible  candidates
competing  for	admission  to the  given  medical  education
course	and  how  such	admissions could  be  controlled  by
short-listing  a  number of eligible candidates out  of	 the
larger	number	of  claimants  who  are	 also  eligible	 for
admission.   In other words, there can be too many  eligible
candidates  chasing too few available seats.  So far as this
question  is concerned, it clearly gets covered by Entry  25
of Concurrent List III rather than Entry 66 of List I as the
latter	entry  would  enable,  as seen	above,	the  Medical
Council	 of  India  only  to   lay  down  the  standards  of
eligibility  and  basic	 qualification of  graduate  medical
students  for  being  admitted to  any	higher	postgraduate
medical	 course.  Having provided for the queue of basically
eligible  qualified graduate medical students for  admission
to  postgraduate medical courses for a given academic  year,
the  role  of  Medical Council of India would  end  at	that
stage.	 Beyond this stage the field is covered by Entry  25
of  List III dealing with education which may also cover the
question  of controlling admissions and short-listing of the
eligible candidates standing in the queue for being admitted
to  a  given course of study in institutions depending	upon
the  limited number of seats available in a given discipline
of  study, the number of eligible claimants for it and	also
would cover the further question whether any seats should be
reserved  for  SC,ST  and OBCs as permissible to  the  State
authorities  under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_6">Article  15(4)</a> of  the  Constitution  of
India.	 So  far as these questions are concerned, it is  no
doubt  true  that  Entry  25 of Concurrent  List  read	with
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_7">Article	  15(4)</a>	  of   the   Constitution   of	 India	 may
simultaneously	authorise both the Parliament as well as the
State  Legislatures  to	 make necessary provisions  in	that
behalf.	 The State can make adequate provisions on the topic
by resorting to its legislative power under Entry 25 of List
III  as well as by exercising executive power under  <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_8">Article
162</a>  of the Constitution of India read with entry 25 of List
III.   Similarly, the Union Government, through	 Parliament,
may  make adequate provisions regarding the same in exercise
of  its legislative powers under Entry 25 of List III.	 But
so  long  as  the  Union Parliament does  not  exercise	 its
legislative  powers under Entry 25 of List III covering	 the
topic  of short-listing of eligible candidates for admission
to  courses  of	 postgraduate medical education,  the  field
remains wide open for the State authorities to pass suitable
legislations  or executive orders in this connection as seen
above.	 As we have noted earlier, the Union Parliament	 has
not  invoked  its  power  under Entry 25  of  List  III	 for
legislating  on	 this topic.  Therefore, the field  is	wide
open  for the State Governments to make adequate  provisions
regarding  controlling	admissions to postgraduate  colleges
within	their  territories imparting medical  education	 for
ultimately  getting  postgraduate degrees.  However,  I	 may
mention	 at  this  stage  that	 reliance  placed  by	Shri
Chaudhary,  learned  senior counsel for the State of  Madhya
Pradesh	 on  a Constitution bench judgment of this Court  in
<a href="/doc/367125/" id="a_9">Tej  Kiran Jain &amp; Ors.	vs.  N.Sanjiva Reddy &amp; Ors</a>., 1970(2)
SCC  272,  interpreting	 the  word in in  the  phrase  in
Parliament to mean during the sitting of Parliament and in
the  course of the business of Parliament cannot be of	any
avail to him while interpreting the phrase determination of
standards  in institutions for higher education as found in
Entry  66  of  List  I.	  His  submission,  relying  on	 the
aforesaid  decision that directions regarding standards	 in
institutions  mean  only  those directions of  the  Medical
Council	 of India which regulate the actual courses of study
after  the  students are admitted into the institutions	 and
cannot cover the situation prior to their admission, meaning
thereby,  pre-admission stage for students seeking entry  to
the  institution of higher education cannot be countenanced.
The  reason  is obvious.  Once it is held that	the  Medical
Council	 of  India  exercising its statutory  functions	 and
powers	under  the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_10">Indian Medical Council Act</a>,	 1956  which
squarely  falls	 within Entry 66 of List I can lay down	 the
eligibility and basic qualifications of students entitled to
be  admitted  to such postgraduate courses of  study,  their
eligibility   qualification   would   naturally	 project   a
consideration  which  is prior to their actual entry in	 the
institutions   as  students  for   being   imparted   higher
education.   That would obviously be a pre-admission  stage.
Therefore,  the	 phrase	 determination	 of  standards	 in
institutions   does   not   necessarily	 mean	controlling
standards  of  education  only after the stage of  entry  of
students  in these institutions and necessarily not prior to
the  entry  point.   However,  as  seen	 earlier,  the	real
question   is  whether	determination	of   standards	 in
institutions  would go beyond the stage of controlling	the
eligibility  and basic qualification of students for  taking
up such courses and would also cover the further question of
short-listing of such eligible students by those running the
institutions  in the States.  For every academic year, there
will  be  limited  number of seats in  postgraduate  medical
courses	 vis-a-vis a larger number of eligible candidates as
per  guidelines	 laid down by the Medical Council of  India.
Short-listing  of  such	 candidates, therefore,	 has  to  be
resorted  to.	This  exercise	 will  depend  upon  various
imponderables  like i) limited number of seats for admission
in  a  given  course  vis-a-vis larger	number	of  eligible
candidates  seeking admissions and the question of  fixation
of their inter se merits so as to lay down rational criteria
for  selecting	better candidates as compared to  candidates
with  lesser degree of competence for entry in such courses;
</p><p id="p_17">ii)  Whether  at  a given point of time there  are  adequate
chances	 and  scope  for SC,ST and OBC	candidates  who	 can
equally	 be eligible for pursuing of such courses but who on
account	 of  their social or economic backwardness  may	 lag
behind in competition with other general category candidates
who  are equally eligible for staking their claims for	such
limited number of seats for higher educational studies, iii)
availability  of  limited   infrastructural  facilities	 for
training in institutions for higher medical education in the
State or in the colleges concerned.  All these exigencies of
the  situations	 may  require	State  authorities,   either
legislatively  or by exercise of executive powers, to  adopt
rational  standards  or methods for  short-listing  eligible
candidates  for being admitted to such medical courses	from
year to year also keeping in view the requirement of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_11">Article
15(4)</a>  of  the	Constitution of India.	While  dealing	with
Entry 25 of List III it has also to be kept in view that the
word  education	 is of wide import.  It would  necessarily
have in its fold (i) the taught, (ii) the teacher, (iii) the
text  and  also	 (iv)  training	 as  practical	training  is
required  to be imparted to students pursuing the course  of
postgraduate  medical education.  Who is to be the taught is
determined  by	Medical Council of India by prescribing	 the
basic	qualifications	for  admission	 of  the   students.
Adequate  number of teachers keeping in view teacher  taught
ratio is also relevant.	 Prescribing appropriate courses for
study	i.e.   curricula  is  also   covered  by  the	term
education.   Training to be imparted to the students has a
direct	nexus with infrastructural facilities like number of
beds  of patients to be attended to by postgraduate  medical
students,  providing appropriate infrastructure for surgical
training  etc.	also would form part of education.  Role  of
Medical Council of India is exclusive in the field of laying
down  of  basic	 qualifications of the taught and  also	 the
requirement  of	 qualified  teachers,	their  numbers	 and
qualifications,	 prescribing text and requisite training  to
be  imparted  to students undertaking  postgraduate  medical
courses.  All these provisions quite clearly fall within the
domain of Medical Council of Indias jurisdiction.  However,
the  only  field left open by the Parliament while  enacting
the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_12">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 under Entry 66 of List
III  of	 Schedule  VII is the solitary	exercise  of  short-
listing	 of  eligible  taught  for being  admitted  to	such
courses.   That	 field can validly be operated upon  by	 the
State authorities so long as Parliament, in its wisdom, does
not  step  in  to block even that solitary  field  otherwise
remaining  open	 for State authorities to function  in	that
limited	 sphere.  Infrastructure facilities, therefore,	 for
giving	such practical training to the taught also would  be
an  important  part of medical education.  It is  of  course
true that not only the eligibility of students for admission
to  medical courses but also the quality of students seeking
to  get	 medical education especially  postgraduate  medical
education  with	 a  view to turning  out  efficient  medical
practitioners  for serving the suffering humanity would	 all
be  covered by the term education.  So far as the  quality
of  admitting  students	 to the courses	 of  higher  medical
education  i.e.	 postgraduate medical courses is  concerned,
the  admission	of  students may get  sub-divided  into	 two
parts;	 i)  basic  eligibility or qualification  for  being
permitted  to  enter the arena of contest for occupying	 the
limited	  number  of  seats   available	 for  pursuing	such
education;   and ii) the quality of such eligible candidates
for  being  admitted  to  such courses.	  As  we  have	seen
earlier,  the  first part of exercise for admission  can  be
covered	 by the sweep of the parliamentary legislation	i.e.
the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_13">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 enabling the  delegate
of  the	 Parliament namely, Medical Council of India to	 lay
down  proper  criteria for that purpose as  per	 regulations
framed	by it under <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_14">Section 33</a> of the Indian Medical Council
Act.   This aspect is clearly covered by Entry 66 of List  I
but  so	 far  as the second part of admissions	of  eligible
students  is concerned, it clearly remains in the domain  of
Entry  25 of List III and it has nothing to do with Entry 66
of List I and as this field is wide open till the Parliament
covers it by any legislation under Entry 25 of List III, the
State  can certainly issue executive orders and instructions
or  even  pass appropriate legislations for controlling	 and
short-listing  the admissions of eligible candidates to such
higher postgraduate medical courses in their institutions or
other  institutions imparting such medical education in	 the
States concerned.  A three Judge bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/104556519/" id="a_15">Ajay
Kumar  Singh &amp; Ors.  vs.  State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>., 1994(4) SCC
401, has taken the same view on these entries which commands
acceptance.   Jeevan Reddy, J., speaking for the three Judge
bench  placing	reliance  on an earlier	 three	Judge  bench
judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_16">State of M.P.	 vs.  Nivedita Jain</a>,
1981(4)	 SCC  296,  and	 agreeing with	the  view  expressed
therein	 observed in para 22 of the Report as under :  The
power  to  regulate  admission to the courses  of  study  in
medicine is traceable to Entry 25 in List III.	(Entry 11 in
List  II,  it  may be remembered, was deleted  by  the	42nd
Amendment  to  the  Constitution and Entry 25  of  List	 III
substituted).	The  States,  which establish  and  maintain
these  institutions  have the power to regulate all  aspects
and  affairs  of  the  institutions  except  to	 the  extent
provided  for  by  Entries 63 to 66 of List I.	 Shri  Salve
contended  that	 the  determination   and  coordination	  of
standards of higher education in Entry 66 of List I takes in
all  incidental	 or  ancillary matters, that  Regulation  of
admission  to  courses	of  higher  education  is  a  matter
incidental  to the determination of standards and if so, the
said subject- matter falls outside the field reserved to the
States.	 He submits that by virtue of Entry 66 List I, which
overrides  Entry  25 of List III, the States are denuded  of
all  and  every	 power	to   determine	and  coordinate	 the
standards  of higher education, which must necessarily	take
in  regulating the admission to these courses.	Even if	 the
Act  made  by parliament does not regulate the admission  to
these  courses, the States have no power to provide for	 the
same  for  the	reason that the	 said  subject-matter  falls
outside	 their purview.	 Accordingly, it must be held,	says
Shri  Salve, that the provision made by the State Government
reserving certain percentage of seats under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_17">Article 15(4)</a> is
wholly	incompetent  and  outside the purview of  the  field
reserved  to  the States under the Constitution.  We  cannot
agree.	 While	Regulation  of admission  to  these  medical
courses	 may be incidental to the power under Entry 66	List
I,  it	is integral to the power contained in Entry 25	List
III.   The  State which has established and  is	 maintaining
these  institutions  out  of public funds must	be  held  to
possess	  the  power  to   regulate  the  admission   policy
consistent  with  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_18">Article  14.</a>	Such power  is	an  integral
component  of  the  power to maintain and  administer  these
institutions.	Be  that  as  it may, since  we	 have  held,
agreeing  with the holding in Nivedita Jain that Entry 66 in
List  I	 does  not take in the selection  of  candidates  or
regulation of admission to institutions of higher education,
the argument of Shri Salve becomes out of place.  The States
must  be  held	perfectly  competent  to  provide  for	such
reservations.

<p id="p_18">      It  is  also pertinent to note that decision  of	this
Court  in  Kumari  Nivedita Jain (supra) is  approved  by  a
Constitution  bench  of nine Judges of this court  in  <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_19">Indra
Sawhney	 vs.  Union of India</a>, 1992 Supp.  3 SCC 217 at	page
751,  to  which I will make a detailed reference  later	 on.
II.   Role  of	the  Medical Council  of  India:   As  noted
earlier, the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_20">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956 was enacted by
the  Union Parliament in exercise of its powers under  Entry
66  of	List I of the Seventh Schedule of the  Constitution.
The statement of objects and reasons of the said Act read as
under  :  The objects of this Bill are to amend the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_21">Indian
Medical	 Council Act</a>, 1933 (Act XXVII of 1933) - (a) to give
representation	 to  licentiate	 members   of  the   medical
profession,  a large number of whom are still practising  in
the  country;	(b) to provide for the registration  of	 the
names of citizens of India who have obtained foreign medical
qualifications which are not at present recognised under the
existing  Act;	(c) to provide for the temporary recognition
of medical qualifications granted by medical institutions in
countries  outside India with which no scheme of reciprocity
exists	in  cases where the medical practitioners  concerned
are  attached for the time being to any medical	 institution
in  India for the purpose of teaching or research or for any
charitable  object;   (d) to provide for the formation of  a
Committee  of Postgraduate Medical Education for the purpose
of  assisting  the  Medical Council of	India  to  prescribe
standards of postgraduate medical education for the guidance
of  Universities and to advise Universities in the matter of
securing   uniform   standards	 for  postgraduate   medical
education   throughout	India;	 (e)  to  provide  for	 the
maintenance  of an all-India register by the Medical Council
of  India,  which will contain the names of all the  medical
practitioners possessing recognised medical qualifications.
</p>

<p id="p_19">      Amongst  others, the object and reason no.(d)  clearly
indicated that the Act was to provide for the formation of a
Committee  of Postgraduate Medical Education for the purpose
of  assisting  the  Medical Council of	India  to  prescribe
standards of postgraduate medical education for the guidance
of Universities.  This necessarily meant conferring power on
Medical	 Council  of India to be the approving body for	 the
universities  for  enabling them to prescribe  standards  of
postgraduate  medical education.  Naturally that referred to
the  courses  of  study to be prescribed and  the  types  of
practical  training to be imparted to the admitted  students
for  such  courses.   We  may  now  refer  to  the  relevant
statutory  provisions of the Act.  <a href="/doc/161280593/" id="a_22">Section 10-A</a> empowers the
Central	 Government  to	 give	clearance  for	establishing
medical	  colleges  at	given	centres	 and  the  statutory
requirements  for  establishing	 such colleges.	 It  is	 the
Medical	 Council  of  India  which   has  to  recommend	  in
connection  with  such	proposed   scheme  for	establishing
medical colleges.  Sub-section (7) of <a href="/doc/161280593/" id="a_23">Section 10-A</a> lays down
the  relevant  considerations  to  be kept in  view  by	 the
Medical	 Council of India while making such  recommendations
in  connection	with  any scheme proposing  to	establish  a
medical	 college.   They  obviously refer to  the  types  of
education  to be imparted to admitted students and the basic
requirement  of infrastructure for imparting such  education
which  only  would  enable  the	  proposed  college  to	  be
established.   None of these requirements has anything to do
with  the  controlling	of admissions out of  qualified	 and
eligible  students who can take such education.	 <a href="/doc/187216512/" id="a_24">Section  11</a>
deals  with medical qualifications granted by any University
or  medical  institution which can be recognised as  medical
qualifications for the purpose of the Act.  Meaning thereby,
only  such  qualified persons can be registered	 as  medical
practitioners  under the Act.  None of the other  provisions
of  the Act deal with the topic of short-listing of eligible
and  otherwise	qualified candidates for being	admitted  to
medical	 courses  either  at  MBBS level or  even  at  post-
graduate  level.  As we are concerned with minimum standards
for  medical education at postgraduate level, <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_25">Section 20</a>  of
the  Act  becomes  relevant.   It reads	 as  under  :	20.
Postgraduate  Medical  Education   Committee  for  assisting
Council	  in  matters  relating	  to  postgraduate   medical
education  -  (1)  The Council may  prescribe  standards  of
postgraduate   medical	education  for	 the   guidance	  of
Universities,  and may advise Universities in the matter  of
securing   uniform   standards	 for  postgraduate   medical
education throughout India, and for this purpose the Central
Government  may	 constitute  from among the members  of	 the
Council	  a   Postgraduate   Medical   Education   Committee
(hereinafter  referred	to as the  Postgraduate	 Committee).
(2) The Postgraduate Committee shall consist of nine members
all  of	 whom  shall  be,  persons  possessing	postgraduate
medical	 qualifications	 and  experience   of  teaching	  or
examining postgraduate students of medicine.  (3) Six of the
members	 of the Postgraduate Committee shall be nominated by
the Central Government and the remaining three members shall
be elected by the Council from amongst its members.  (4) For
the  purpose  of  considering	Postgraduate  studies  in  a
subject,  the Postgraduate Committee may co-opt, as and when
necessary,  one	 or more members qualified to assist  it  in
that  subject.	 (5)  The views and recommendations  of	 the
Postgraduate Committee on all matters shall be placed before
the  Council;	and if the Council does not agree  with	 the
views	expressed  or  the   recommendations  made  by	 the
Postgraduate  Committee	 on  any matter, the  Council  shall
forward	 them together with its observations to the  Central
Government for decision.
</p>

<p id="p_20">      Sub-section  (1)	of  <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_26">Section 20</a>	while  dealing	with
prescription  of standards of postgraduate medical education
by  the Council for the guidance of Universities does not by
itself	touch upon the topic of controlling of admission  of
eligible  medical graduates or short-listing them  according
to the exigencies of the situations at a given point of time
by those running medical institutions imparting postgraduate
medical	 courses in the colleges.  Standards of postgraduate
medical education as mentioned in sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_27">Section
20</a>  therefore, would include guidance regarding the  minimum
qualifications or eligibility criteria for such students for
admission  and after they are admitted having undergone	 the
process	 of  short-listing  at	the   hands  of	 the   State
authorities  or	 authorities running the  institutions,	 how
they  are  to be trained and educated in such  courses,	 how
practical training has to be given to them and what would be
the   course  of  study,  the	syllabi	 and  the  types  of
examination  which they have to undertake before they can be
said  to  have successfully completed  postgraduate  medical
education  in  the  concerned States.  But having  seen	 all
these  it  has to be kept in view that all that	 Sub-section
(1) of <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_28">Section 20</a> enables the Medical Council of India is to
merely give guidance to the Universities.  What is stated to
be  guidance  can never refer to the quality of a  candidate
who  is	 otherwise  eligible  for admission.   None  of	 the
remaining provisions up to <a href="/doc/190896350/" id="a_29">Section 32</a> deal with the question
of controlling of admission by process of short-listing from
amongst	 eligible  and	duly  qualified	 candidates  seeking
admission  to  postgraduate medical courses.  We then go  to
<a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_30">Section	 33</a>  which confers power on the Medical	 Council  of
India  to  make regulations.  It provides that the  Council
may,  with the previous sanction of the Central	 Government,
make regulations generally to carry out the purposes of this
Act.  Therefore, this general power to make regulations has
to  be	with  reference	 to any of  the	 statutory  purposes
indicated  in  any other provisions of the Act.	 As none  of
the  provisions	 in the Act enables the Medical	 Council  of
India  to  regulate the admission of eligible candidates  to
the  available seats for pursuing higher medical studies  in
institutions,  the general power to make regulations  cannot
cover such a topic.  So far as the express topics enumerated
in  <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_31">Section  33</a>	 on  which regulations	can  be	 framed	 are
concerned,  the relevant topics for our purpose are found in
clauses	 (fc) and (j).	So far as clause (fc) is  concerned,
it  deals  with the criteria for identifying a student	who
has  been granted a medical qualification referred to in the
Explanation  to	 sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/142206541/" id="a_32">Section 10B</a>.   When	 we
turn  to  <a href="/doc/142206541/" id="a_33">Section  10B</a>,	 we find that it  deals	 with  those
students  who  are admitted on the basis of the increase  in
its  admission	capacity without previous permission of	 the
Central	 Government.  Any medical qualification obtained  by
such  student  will not enable him or her to be	 treated  as
duly  medically	 qualified.   The medical  qualification  is
obviously  obtained  by	 the student  who  has	successfully
completed  his	course of study and obtained  the  requisite
degree.	  It  is  the obtaining of  such  requisite  medical
degree	and qualification that entitles him to get  enrolled
as  per <a href="/doc/57393585/" id="a_34">Section 15</a> on any State Medical Register so that  he
can   act  as  a   Registered  Medical	Practitioner.	That
obviously  has nothing to do with the admission of  students
desirous  of  obtaining	 medical  degrees  after  undergoing
requisite   educational	  training  at	 the   institutions.
Therefore,  no	regulation framed under <a href="/doc/197154214/" id="a_35">Section	 33(fc)</a>	 can
cover  the topic of short-listing of eligible candidates for
admission.   Then  remains  in the filed  clause  (j)  which
provides  as  under :  [(j)the courses and period of  study
and  of practical training to be undertaken, the subjects of
examination  and the standards of proficiency therein to  be
obtained,  in Universities or medical institutions for grant
of  recognised	medical qualifications; A mere look at	the
said  provision shows that regulations under this  provision
can  be	 framed by the Medical Council of India	 for  laying
down  the  courses  and	 period of study  and  of  practical
training  to be undertaken, the subjects of examination	 and
the  standard  of proficiency therein to be obtained by	 the
admitted   students   for   obtaining	recognised   medical
qualifications.	   They	 all  deal   with  post-   admission
requirements  of  eligible students in the  medical  courses
concerned.   That has nothing to do with pre-entry stage  of
such  students	eligible for admission.	  Consequently,	 any
regulation  framed  by	the Medical Council of	India  under
<a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_36">Section	 33</a> which seeks to give any guidelines in connection
with  the  method of admission of such eligible students  to
medical	 courses  would obviously remain in the realm  of  a
mere  advise  or guidance and can obviously  therefore,	 not
have  any  binding  force qua  admitting  authorities.	 It,
therefore,  must  be held that once the Medical	 Council  of
India  has laid down basic requirements of qualifications or
eligibility  criteria for a student who has passed his	MBBS
examination  for being admitted to postgraduate courses	 for
higher	medical	 education  in institutions and	 once  these
basic  minimum	requirements are complied with	by  eligible
students seeking such admissions the role of Medical Council
of  India comes to an end.  As seen earlier, the question of
short-listing	falls  squarely	 in   the  domain  of  State
authorities  as	 per  entry 25 of List III  till  Parliament
steps  in to cover this field.	We may now briefly deal with
decisions  of  this  Court  rendered from time	to  time  in
connection  with this question.	 A three Judge bench of this
Court  in  <a href="/doc/1276295/" id="a_37">D.N.	 Chanchala vs.	State of Mysore &amp;  Ors</a>.etc.,
1971 Supp.  SCR 608, speaking through Shelat, J., emphasised
the  necessity	for  a screening test and  short-listing  of
eligible candidates for being admitted to medical courses in
view of the fact that claimants are many and seats are less.
Dealing with three universities set up in the territories of
the  then State of Mysore catering to medical education, the
following relevant observations were made at page 619 of the
Report	:   The	 three universities were set  up  in  three
different  places presumably for the purpose of catering  to
the   educational  and	academic   needs  of  those   areas.
Obviously  one	university for the whole of the State  could
neither	 have  been adequate nor feasible to  satisfy  those
needs.	 Since	it  would  not	be  possible  to  admit	 all
candidates  in	the medical colleges run by the	 Government,
some  basis  for screening the candidates had to be set	 up.
There  can be no manner of doubt, and it is now fairly	well
settled,   that	 the  Government,  as  also  other   private
agencies,  who found such centres for medical training, have
the  right  to	frame rules for admission so long  as  those
rules  are not inconsistent with the university statutes and
regulations   and   do	 not	suffer	 from	infirmities,
constitutional	or  otherwise. Similar	observations  were
made at page 628 of the Report :
</p>
<p id="p_21">      On  account  of  paucity	of  institutions  imparting
training  in technical studies and the increasing number  of
candidates seeking admission therein, there is obviously the
need  for  classification  to	enable	fair  and  equitable
distribution  of available seats.  The very decisions relied
on  by	counsel for the petitioner implicitly recognise	 the
need  for classification and the power of those who run such
institutions to lay down classification.
</p>
<p id="p_22">      A	 three Judge bench of this Court in <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_38">State of  Madhya
Pradesh	 &amp;  Anr.  vs.  Kumari Nivedita Jain &amp; Ors</a>.,  (supra)
had to consider the legality of order passed by the State of
Madhya	Pradesh completely relaxing the conditions  relating
to  the	 minimum qualifying marks for SC,ST  candidates	 for
admission  to medical courses of study on non-	availability
of  qualified  candidates  from these categories.   Such  an
exercise  was  held permissible under Articles 14 and 15  of
the  Constitution of India.  A.N.  Sen, J., speaking for the
Court  in  this	 connection  referred to  Entry	 25  of	 the
Concurrent  List and also the constitutional scheme of Entry
66  of	List I and held that:  By virtue of  the  authority
conferred  by  the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_39">Medical Council Act</a>, the Medical  Council
may prescribe the eligibility of a candidate who may seek to
get admitted into a Medical College for obtaining recognised
medical	 qualifications.  But as to how the selection has to
be  made  out of the eligible candidates for admission	into
the Medical College necessarily depends on circumstances and
conditions prevailing in particular States and does not come
within	the purview of the Council.  Regulation I which lays
down  the  conditions or qualifications for  admission	into
medical	 course	 comes within the competence of the  Council
under  <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_40">Section	33</a>  of	the Act and  is	 mandatory,  whereas
Regulation  II which deals with the process or procedure for
selection  from amongst eligible candidates for admission is
outside the authority of the Council under <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_41">Section 33</a> of the
Act,  and is merely in the nature of a recommendation and is
directory  in nature.  (paras 19 and 21) Entry 25 in List II
is  wide enough to include within its ambit the question  of
selection  of  candidates to Medical Colleges and  there  is
nothing in the Entries 63, 64 and 65 of List I to suggest to
the contrary.  (para 22) As there is no legislation covering
the  field  of	selection  of candidates  for  admission  to
Medical	 Colleges, the State Government would,	undoubtedly,
be  competent to pass executive orders in this regard  under
<a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_42">Article	 162.</a>	(para 24) Thus Regulation II of the  Council
which	is  merely  directory  and  in	the  nature   of   a
recommendation	has no such statutory force as to render the
Order  in  question  which contravenes the  said  Regulation
illegal,  invalid  and	unconstitutional.    The  Order	 can
therefore  be supported under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_43">Article 15(4).</a>  (paras 22	 and
</p><p id="p_23">25)  The  State	 is entitled to make  reservations  for	 the
Scheduled  Castes  and	Scheduled Tribes in  the  matter  of
admission  to medical and other technical institutions.	  In
the absence of any law to the contrary, it must also be open
to  the	 Government to impose such conditions as would	make
the  reservation effective and would benefit the  candidates
belonging  to these categories for whose benefit and welfare
the   reservations  have  been	 made.	 In  any  particular
situation,  taking  into  consideration	 the  realities	 and
circumstances prevailing in the State it will be open to the
State  to vary and modify the conditions regarding selection
for  admission,	 if such modification or  variation  becomes
necessary  for	achieving the purpose for which	 reservation
has  been made and if there be no law to the contrary.	Note
</p><p id="p_24">(ii)  of  Rule 20 of the Rules for admission framed  by	 the
State  Government  specifically empowers the  Government  to
grant such relaxation in the minimum qualifying marks to the
extent considered necessary.  Such relaxation neither can be
said  to  be  unreasonable,  nor  constitutes  violation  of
<a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_44">Article	 15(1)</a>	and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_45">(2)</a> or <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_46">Article 14</a> of  the  Constitution.
The  impugned  order does not affect any relaxation  in	 the
standard  of  medical education or curriculum of studies  in
Medical	 Colleges for those candidates after their admission
to  the	 College  and the standard of  examination  and	 the
curriculum remains the same for all.  (paras 26 and 27)

      (Emphasis supplied)


      The  aforesaid  observations  of the  court  are	well
sustained  on  the scheme of the relevant entries  in  VIIth
Schedule  to  which  we have made a reference  earlier.	  As
noticed	 herein before, this judgment of three member  bench
is  approved  by the Constitution bench in its	judgment  in
Indra  Sawhneys	 case (supra).	It is of course	 true  that
these  observations are made with reference to admission  to
MBBS course and not to postgraduate medical courses.  But on
the  constitutional scheme of the relevant entries, the very
same  result  can  follow  while  regulating  admissions  to
postgraduate  medical  courses	also.  Before  parting	with
discussion on the topic regarding role of Medical Council of
India,	we  may also usefully refer to the  observations  of
Jeevan	Reddy,	J., in the case of <a href="/doc/104556519/" id="a_47">Ajay Kumar Singh  &amp;	Ors.
vs.   State  of	 Bihar &amp; Ors</a>., (supra).	 Jeevan	 Reddy,	 J.,
speaking  for the three Judge Bench in para 18 of the Report
on  the review and relevant provisions of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_48">Indian Medical
Council Act</a> has made the following pertinent observations in
the  said para of the Report at page 415 :  A review of the
provisions of the Act clearly shows that among other things,
the Act is concerned with the determination and coordination
of   standards	 of  education	 and  training	in   medical
institutions.	<a href="/doc/118212773/" id="a_49">Sections 16</a>, <a href="/doc/157301342/" id="a_50">17</a>, <a href="/doc/182483007/" id="a_51">18</a> and <a href="/doc/2556393/" id="a_52">19</a> all speak of the
courses of study and examinations to be undergone to obtain
the  recognised medical qualification.	They do not speak of
admission  to such courses.  <a href="/doc/198734806/" id="a_53">Section 19-A</a> expressly empowers
the  council to prescribe the minimum standards of  medical
education  required  for   granting  undergraduate  medical
qualification.	 So  does <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_54">Section 20</a> empower the council  to
prescribe  standards  of postgraduate medical education	 but
for  the  guidance of universities only.  It further  says
that the council may also advise universities in the matter
of  securing  uniform  standards  for  postgraduate  medical
education  throughout India.  (The distinction between	the
language  of <a href="/doc/198734806/" id="a_55">Section 19-A</a> and <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_56">Section 20</a> is also a  relevant
factor,	 as would be explained later.) Clause (j) of <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_57">Section
33</a>  particularises  the	 subjects   with  respect  to  which
Regulations  can  be made by the council.  It speaks of	 the
courses and period of study and the practical training to be
undergone by the students, the subjects of examination which
they  must  pass and the standards of proficiency they	must
attain	to obtain the recognised medical qualifications	 but
it  does  not speak of admission to such courses  of  study.
Indeed,	 none  of  the sections aforementioned	empower	 the
council	  to  regulate	or   prescribe	 qualifications	  or
conditions for admission to such courses of study.  No other
provision  in  the Act does.  It is thus clear that the	 Act
does  not  purport  to deal with, regulate  or	provide	 for
admission  to  graduate	 or  postgraduate  medical  courses.
Indeed,	 insofar as postgraduate courses are concerned,	 the
power  of  the	Indian	Medical Council	 to  prescribe	the
minimum	 standards of medical education is only advisory in
nature and not of a binding character.	In such a situation,
it  would be rather curious to say that the Regulations made
under  the Act are binding upon them.  The Regulations	made
under  the Act cannot also provide for or regulate admission
to postgraduate courses in any event.
</p>

<p id="p_25">      In  our view, these observations are clearly borne out
from the statutory scheme of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_58">Indian Medical Council Act</a>,
as seen earlier.
</p>
<p id="p_26">      III.   Role of States for short-listing of  admissions
to postgraduate courses:
</p>
<p id="p_27">      As seen earlier, so far as the field consisting of the
short-	listing	 of  admission	out  of	 eligible  and	duly
qualified   medical   graduates	 for   being   admitted	  to
postgraduate  medical courses in institutions is  concerned,
as  the	 Union	Parliament has not said anything  about	 the
same,  the  field is wide open for the State authorities  to
regulate  such	admissions  by short-listing  the  available
candidates  keeping  in view the concept of  reservation  of
seats as permitted by <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_59">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution.  In
the  case of <a href="/doc/203735/" id="a_60">R.	 Chitralekha &amp; Anr.  vs.  State of Mysore  &amp;
Ors</a>.,  1964 (6) SCR 368, a Constitution bench of this  Court
while  dealing with Entry 66 of List I and <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_61">Article 15(4)</a>  of
the  Constitution  of  India had to  consider  the  question
whether	 the  State Government could prescribe the  criteria
for selection of students having minimum qualifications laid
down  by the university for admission to medical courses and
whether	 it  would  affect the central	legislation  enacted
under  Entry  66 of List I of the  Constitution?   Answering
this  question	in favour of the State authorities,  it	 was
observed  at  page  379	 of the Report	by  Subba  Rao,	 J.,
speaking  on  behalf  of the Constitution bench as  under  :
If  the	 impact	 of  the  State	 law  providing	 for  such
standards  on entry 66 of List I is so heavy or	 devastating
as  to wipe out or appreciably abridge the central field, it
may  be	 struck down.  But that is a question of fact to  be
ascertained  in each case.  It is not possible to hold	that
if  a  State  legislature made a law  prescribing  a  higher
percentage  of marks for extra-curricular activities in	 the
matter	of  admission  to  colleges, it	 would	be  directly
encroaching  on	 the field covered by entry 66 of List I  of
the  Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.  If so, it is not
disputed  that	the  State Government would  be	 within	 its
rights to prescribe qualifications for admission to colleges
so long as its action does not contravene any other law.  It
is  then said that the Mysore University Act conferred power
to  prescribe  rules  for  admission   to  Colleges  on	 the
University  and	 the Government cannot exercise that  power.
It  is	true that under s.23 of the Mysore  University	Act,
1956, the Academic Council shall have the power to prescribe
the  conditions for admission of students to the  University
and,  in  exercise  of	its power,  it	has  prescribed	 the
percentage of marks which a student shall obtain for getting
admission in medical or engineering colleges.  The orders of
the  Government do not contravene the minimum qualifications
prescribed  by the University;	what the Government did	 was
to  appoint  a selection committee and prescribe  rules	 for
selection  of  students who have the minimum  qualifications
prescribed  by the University.	The Government runs most  of
the  medical and engineering colleges.	Excluding the  State
aided  colleges	 for a moment, the position is as follows  :
The  Colleges  run  by	the  Government,  having  regard  to
financial commitments and other relevant considerations, can
only  admit  a	specific  number of  students  to  the	said
Colleges.   They  cannot obviously admit all the  applicants
who have secured the marks prescribed by the University.  It
has  necessarily to screen the applicants on some reasonable
basis.	  The  aforesaid  orders  of  the  Government	only
prescribed  criteria for making admissions to Colleges	from
among  students	 who  secured the minimum  qualifying  marks
prescribed  by the University.	Once it is conceded, and  it
is not disputed before us, that the State Government can run
medical	 and  engineering colleges, it cannot be denied	 the
power  to  admit  such	qualified   students  as  pass	 the
reasonable  tests  laid down by it.  This is a	power  which
every  private	owner  of  a  College  will  have,  and	 the
Government which runs its own Colleges cannot be denied that
power.
</p>

<p id="p_28">      At  page	381  of	 the   same  Report,  the  following
observations  are  made by the Constitution Bench,  speaking
through Subba Rao, J.  :
</p>
<p id="p_29">      We,  therefore, hold that the Government has power to
prescribe a machinery and also the criteria for admission of
qualified  students to medical and engineering colleges	 run
by the Government and, with the consent of the management of
the Government aided colleges, to the said colleges also.
</p>

<p id="p_30">      Another  decision	 of the Constitution bench  of	this
Court  was rendered in the case of <a href="/doc/195765/" id="a_62">Chitra Ghosh &amp; Anr.	 vs.
Union  of  India  &amp;  Ors</a>., 1970 (1) SCR	 413.	Grover,	 J.,
speaking  for the Constitution bench observed at page 418 as
under  :   It  is the Central Government  which	 bears	the
financial  burden of running the medical college.  It is for
it  to lay down the criteria for eligibility.  From the very
nature	of things it is not possible to throw the  admission
open  to students from all over the country.  The Government
cannot	be denied the right to decide from what sources	 the
admission  will be made.  That essentially is a question  of
policy	and depends inter-alia on an overall assessment	 and
survey	of  the	 requirements  of  residents  of  particular
territories  and other categories of persons for whom it  is
essential  to provide facilities for medical education.	  If
the  sources are properly classified whether on territorial,
geographical  or  other reasonable basis it is not  for	 the
courts to interfere with the manner and method of making the
classification.
</p>
<p id="p_31">      At  page 419 of the Report it has been further  stated
as  under :  The next question that has to be determined is
whether	 the  differentia on which classification  has	been
made  has rational relation with the object to be  achieved.
The  main  purpose of admission to a medical college  is  to
impart education in the theory and practice of medicine.  As
noticed	 before	 the sources from which students have to  be
drawn  are  primarily  determined  by  the  authorities	 who
maintain   and	run  the   institution,	 e.g.,	the  Central
Government  in	the present case.  <a href="/doc/1342109/" id="a_63">In Minor  P.Rajendran  v.
State  of  Madras</a>  it  has been stated that  the  object  of
selection  for	admission  is to secure	 the  best  possible
material.   This  can  surely be achieved by  making  proper
rules  in the matter of selection but there can be no  doubt
that  such selection has to be confined to the sources	that
are  intended  to supply the material.	If the sources	have
been classified in the manner done in the present case it is
difficult  to  see how that classification has	no  rational
nexus  with  the object of imparting medical  education	 and
also of selection for the purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      In  the  case of <a href="/doc/1295463/" id="a_64">State of Andhra Pradesh &amp;  Anr.	 vs.
Lavu  Narendranath &amp; Ors</a>.etc., 1971(1) SCC 607, a four Judge
bench  of  this Court had to consider whether  the  entrance
test prescribed by the Government for short-listing eligible
candidates for being admitted to medical courses in colleges
was  legally permissible or not.  Upholding the power of the
State  Government on the anvil of the Constitution,  Mitter,
J.,  speaking on behalf of the four Judge bench held that  :
Merely	because	 the  University   had	made   regulations
regarding  the admission of students to its degree  courses,
it  did not mean that any one who had passed the  qualifying
examination such as the P.U.C.	or H.S.C.  was ipso facto to
be  entitled to admission to such courses of study.  If	 the
number of candidates applying for such admission far exceeds
the  number  of seats available the University can  have  to
make its choice out of the applicants to find out who should
be  admitted and if instead of judging the candidates by the
number	of  marks  obtained  by	  them	in  the	  qualifying
examination  the University thinks fit to prescribe  another
test  for admission no objection can be taken thereto.	What
the  University	 can do in the matter of admissions  to	 the
degree	courses	 can certainly be done by the Government  in
the matter of admission to the M.B.B.S.	 course.  9.  In our
view  the  test	 prescribed  by the  Government	 in  no	 way
militates  against the power of Parliament under Entry 66 of
List  I	 of the Seventh Schedule to the	 Constitution.	 The
said entry provides :
</p>
<p id="p_33">      Co-ordination  and  determination	 of  standards	 in
institutions for higher education or research and scientific
and technical institutions.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      The  above  entry gives Parliament power to make	laws
for  laying down how standards in an institution for  higher
education  are	to  be determined and how they	can  be	 co-
ordinated.   It	 has no relation to a test prescribed  by  a
Government  or by a University for selection of a number  of
students  from out of a large number applying for  admission
to  a  particular course of study even if it be	 for  higher
education in any particular subject.
</p>

<p id="p_35">      Similar  observations  were  found in para 15  of	 the
Report,	 wherein  it was observed that :  .<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_65">The	University
Act</a>,   as   pointed  out,   merely  prescribed	 a   minimum
qualification  for  entry into the higher courses of  study.
There  was  no	regulation to the effect that  admission  to
higher	course	of study was guaranteed by the	securing  of
eligibility.   The  Executive  have  a	power  to  make	 any
regulation  which would have the effect of a law so long  as
it  does not contravene any legislation already covering the
field  and  the	 Government  order in this case	 in  no	 way
affected the rights of candidates with regard to eligibility
for admission :	 the test prescribed was a further hurdle by
way  of competition when mere eligibility could not be	made
the determining factor.
</p>

<p id="p_36">      The aforesaid observations of the four Judge bench, in
our  view,  correctly  bring out the permissible  scheme  of
short-listing  of  eligible candidates in the light  of	 the
relevant  provisions  with which we are concerned.   In	 the
case  of  <a href="/doc/168778115/" id="a_66">Dr.  Ambesh Kumar vs.	 Principal,  L.L.R.M.Medical
College,  Meerut  &amp; Ors</a>., 1986 (Supp) SCC 543, a  two  Judge
bench of this court had to consider the question whether out
of  the	 eligible candidates qualified for being  considered
for  admission	to  medical education  imparted	 in  medical
colleges  of  the  State, looking to the limited  number  of
seats  available,  the State could resort to the process  of
weeding	  out	by   laying   down  further   criteria	 for
short-listing  such candidates.	 Upholding such an  exercise
undertaken  by	the  State  in the  light  of  the  relevant
provisions  of	the Constitution, B.C.Ray, J., speaking	 for
the  court, made the following observations at pages 544 and
545  of the Report as under :  The State Government can	 in
exercise  of  its executive power under <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_67">Article 162</a> make  an
order  relating	 to matters referred to in Entry 25  of	 the
Concurrent  List in the absence of any law made by the State
Legislature.	The  impugned  order   made  by	 the   State
Government pursuant to its executive powers was valid and it
cannot	be  assailed  on the ground that it  is	 beyond	 the
competence  of	the  State  Government to  make	 such  order
provided  it does not encroach upon or infringe the power of
the Central Government as well as the Parliament provided in
Entry  66 of List I.  The order in question merely specified
a further eligibility qualification for being considered for
selection  for admission to the postgraduate courses (degree
and  diploma)  in  the	Medical Colleges  in  the  State  in
accordance  with  the criteria laid down by  Indian  Medical
Council.   The	number	of seats for  admission	 to  various
postgraduate  courses  both  degree and diploma	 in  Medical
Colleges  is limited and a large number of candidates  apply
for   admission	 to  these  courses   of  study.   In	such
circumstances  the  impugned order cannot be said to  be  in
conflict  with	or  repugnant  to   or	encroach  upon	 the
Regulations framed under the provisions of <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_68">Section 33</a> of the
Indian	Medical	 Council Act.  On the other hand  by  laying
down  a further qualification of eligibility it promotes and
furthers  the determination of standards in institutions for
higher education.
</p>
<p id="p_37">      In  this	connection,  we may also refer	to  a  later
Constitution bench Judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/861069/" id="a_69">Indra Sawhney &amp;
Ors.   vs.   Union  of	India &amp;	 Ors</a>.,	(supra).   As  noted
earlier,  judgment  of this Court in Kumari Nivedita  Jains
case  (supra)  was  approved  therein.	 Jeevan	 Reddy,	 J.,
speaking on behalf of the Constitution bench, at page 751 of
the  Report in para 837 has referred to, with approval,	 the
observations  of  this Court in <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_70">State of Madhya Pradesh	 vs.
Kumari	Nivedita Jain, (Supra</a>) to the effect that  admission
to  medical  courses was regulated by an entrance  test	 for
general candidates, the minimum qualifying marks were 50% in
the   aggregate	 and  33%  in	each  subject.	 For   SC/ST
candidates,  however, it was 40% and 30% respectively.	 The
said  deviation	 was upheld in Kumari Nivedita	Jains  case
(supra)	 and the same was also approved by the	Constitution
Bench in the aforesaid decision.  In this connection, we may
also usefully refer to the relevant observations in the case
of <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_71">State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Anr.  vs.	Kumari Nivedita Jain
&amp;  Ors</a>.	  (supra) which got imprimatur of  the	Constitution
bench  of  this court in Indra Sawhneys case  (supra).	 At
page  751 of the Report in Indra Sawhneys case (supra), the
following  pertinent observations are found in the  majority
judgment  wherein Jeevan Reddy, J., in paragraph 837 of	 the
Report observed as under :
</p>
<p id="p_38">      Having   said  this,  we	must   append  a  note	 of
clarification.	In some cases arising under <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_72">Article 15</a>, this
Court has upheld the removal of minimum qualifying marks, in
the  case of Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates,  in
the matter of admission to medical courses.  For example, in
<a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_73">State of M.P.  v.  Nivedita Jain</a> admission to medical course
was regulated by an entrance test (called Pre-Medical Test).
For  general  candidates, the minimum qualifying marks	were
50% in the aggregate and 33% in each subject.  For Scheduled
Caste/Scheduled	 Tribe	candidates, however, it was 40%	 and
30% respectively.  On finding that Scheduled Caste/Scheduled
Tribe  candidates equal to the number of the seats  reserved
for  them  did	not  qualify  on  the  above  standard,	 the
Government   did  away	with   the  said  minimum   standard
altogether.   The Governments action was challenged in this
Court but was upheld.  Since it was a case under <a href="/doc/609295/" id="a_74">Article 15</a>,
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_75">Article	 335</a>  had no relevance and was not applied.  But  in
the  case  of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_76">Article 16</a>, <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_77">Article 335</a> would be relevant	 and
any  order  on the lines of the order of the  Government  of
Madhya	Pradesh (in Nivedita Jain) would not be permissible,
being  inconsistent  with the efficiency of  administration.
To  wit,  in the matter of appointment of Medical  Officers,
the  Government or the Public Service Commission cannot	 say
that  there  shall  be	no   minimum  qualifying  marks	 for
Scheduled    Caste/Scheduled	Tribe	 candidates,   while
prescribing a minimum for others.  It may be permissible for
the  Government to prescribe a reasonably lower standard for
Scheduled   Castes/Scheduled  Tribes/Backward	 Classes   -
consistent   with   the	 requirements	of   efficiency	  of
administration	-  it  would  not   be	permissible  not  to
prescribe   any	 such  minimum	 standard  at  all.    While
prescribing   the  lower  minimum   standard  for   reserved
category,  the nature of duties attached to the post and the
interest of the general public should also be kept in mind.
</p>
<p id="p_39">      In  para	20  of the Report in the case  of  <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_78">State  of
Madhya	Pradesh	 &amp;  Anr.  vs.  Kumari Nivedita Jain  &amp;	Ors</a>.
(supra)	 the  following pertinent observations are  found  :
Undoubtedly,  under  <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_79">Section 33</a> of the Act, the Council	 is
empowered  to make regulations with the previous sanction of
the  Central Government generally to carry out the  purposes
of  the Act and such regulations may also provide for any of
the  matters  mentioned in <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_80">Section 33</a> of the Act.   We	have
earlier	 indicated  what  are  the  purposes  of  this	Act.
Sub-sections  (j), (k), (l) and (m) of the Act which we have
earlier	 set  out  clearly  indicate   that  they  have	  no
application  to the process of selection of a student out of
the  eligible  candidates  for admission  into	the  medical
course.	   Sub-	 sections  (j),	 (k)   and  (l)	 relate	  to
post-admission	 stages	 and  the   period  of	study  after
admission  in Medical Colleges.	 Sub-section (m) of  <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_81">Section
33</a>  relates  to	 a post-degree stage.	Sub-section  (n)  of
<a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_82">Section	 33</a> which has also been quoted earlier is also of no
assistance  as the Act is not concerned with the question of
selection  of  students out of the eligible  candidates	 for
admission  into Medical Colleges.  It appears to us that the
observations  of  this	Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1671760/" id="a_83">Arti  Sapru  v.
State  of  Jammu &amp; Kashmir</a> which we have earlier quoted	 and
which  were  relied  on by Mr.	Phadke, were  made  on	such
consideration,	though	the question was not  very  properly
finally decided in the absence of the Council.
</p>
<p id="p_40">      The  aforesaid  observations are also well  borne	 out
from  the scheme of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_84">Indian Medical Council Act</a> to  which
we  have made a detailed reference earlier.  But even  apart
from  that, once these observations have been approved by  a
Constitution  Bench  of nine learned Judges of	this  Court,
there  is no scope for any further debate on this aspect  in
the present proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_41">      We may now refer to a two Judge Bench decision of this
Court  in  <a href="/doc/1354931/" id="a_85">Dr.	Sadhna Devi &amp; Ors.  vs.	 State</a> o f  U.P.   &amp;
Ors.,  1997(3)	SCC  90.  The court was concerned  with	 the
short-listing  of  eligible  candidates who have  got  basic
qualification for admission to postgraduate medical courses.
Reservation   of  seats	 for  SC   and	ST   candidates	  in
postgraduate  courses was not challenged but providing	zero
percent	 marks for them for passing the entrance examination
for  admission to postgraduate course was questioned  before
the  Bench.  It was held that once minimum qualifying  marks
for  passing  the  entrance  examination  for  admission  to
postgraduate courses was a pre- requisite, in the absence of
prescription  of  any minimum qualifying marks for  reserved
category  of candidates, admitting such students who did not
get  any marks at the entrance test amounted to	 sacrificing
merit  and  could  not be countenanced.	 In para 21  of	 the
Report,	 the following observations are made:  In our view,
the  Government	 having	 laid  down  a	system	for  holding
admission  tests,  is  not  entitled to	 do  away  with	 the
requirement  of	 obtaining the minimum qualifying marks	 for
the  special  category	candidates.   It   is  open  to	 the
Government  to	admit  candidates belonging to	the  special
categories  even  in a case where they obtain  lesser  marks
than  the  general  candidates provided they  have  got	 the
minimum	 qualifying  marks to fill up the reserved quota  of
seats for them.
</p>
<p id="p_42">      A	 cursory  reading  of these  observations  seems  to
indicate   that	 once  the   minimum  qualifying  marks	 are
prescribed   for   otherwise	 eligible   candidates	 for
short-listing  them  for admission to postgraduate  courses,
minimum	 qualifying  marks prescribed for  general  category
candidates and reserved category candidates must be uniform.
But  then  follows para 22 which relies on the	decision  of
this  court in <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_86">State of Madhya Pradesh vs.  Kumari  Nivedita
Jain</a>   (supra)	wherein	 prescription	of  lesser   minimum
qualifying  marks  in the entrance test for SC,ST and  Other
Backward  Class	 candidates  as	  compared  to	the  minimum
qualifying  marks  for	general	  category  candidates	 was
approved.  Even in earlier para 18 it is observed that if in
the  entrance test special category candidates obtain lesser
marks  than general category candidates even then they	will
be  eligible  for  admission within  their  reserved  quota.
These  observations  indicate that for reserved category  of
candidates  there can be separate minimum qualifying  marks.
Thus,  on a conjoint reading of observations in paras 18, 21
and 22 of the Report it has to be held that the ratio of the
decision  in  Sadhna  Devis case (supra) is that  even	for
reserved  category  candidates there should be some  minimum
qualifying  marks  if  not the same as prescribed  as  bench
marks  for general category candidates.	 Thus, there  cannot
be   any  zero	qualifying   marks  for	 reserved   category
candidates   in	  the  entrance	  test	for   admission	  to
postgraduate  courses.	Hence, this judgment cannot be taken
to  have  laid down that there cannot be  lesser  qualifying
marks  for  reserved category candidates as compared to	 the
general	 category candidates who are otherwise eligible	 and
qualified for being considered for admission to postgraduate
medical	 courses.   That takes us to the consideration of  a
three  Judge  Bench decision of this Court  in	<a href="/doc/1526293/" id="a_87">Postgraduate
Institute  of  Medical	Education &amp; Research,  Chandigarh  &amp;
Ors.,  vs.   K.L.   Narasimhan	&amp; Anr</a>., 1997  (6)  SCC	283.
Ramaswamy, J., speaking for the Bench had mainly to consider
two  questions;	  1) whether there can be reservation  under
Articles  15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution in  connection
with  only  one	 post  in  a  discipline;   and	 2)  whether
reservation of seats in postgraduate courses was permissible
as per Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution.  Both the
aforesaid  questions  were  answered in the  affirmative  in
favour	of  the	 schemes  of reservations.  So	far  as	 the
question of reservation of seats when there is only one post
in the discipline is concerned, decision rendered thereon by
the   three  Judge  Bench  is	expressly  overruled  by   a
Constitution  Bench  judgment of this Court in	<a href="/doc/200489/" id="a_88">Postgraduate
Institute  of  Medical Education &amp; Research, Chandigarh	 vs.
Faculty	 Association &amp; Ors</a>., 1998(4) SCC 1.  However, so far
as  the	 second	 question  is concerned,  in  the  aforesaid
judgment  it was held that there can be reservation of seats
in postgraduate courses as per the mandate of Articles 15(4)
and  16(4).  In the present proceedings, there is no dispute
on  this score.	 Hence the said judgment on the second point
is  not	 required  to  be  reconsidered.   However,  certain
observations  are  found  in para 21 of the  report  wherein
Ramaswamy,  J.,	 has  observed	 that  diluting	 of  minimum
qualifying  marks  in  an  entrance   test  for	 entry	into
postgraduate  courses  for reserved category  of  candidates
cannot	be said to be unauthorised or illegal.	It has	been
observed   that:    Equally,   a  student,   admitted	on
reservation,   is  required  to	  pass	the  same   standard
prescribed  for speciality or a superspeciality in a subject
or  medical  science  or  technology.  In  that	 behalf,  no
relaxation  is given nor sought by the candidates  belonging
to  reserved  categories.  What is sought is a	facility  or
opportunity  for admission to the courses, Ph.D., speciality
or  superspeciality  or high technology by relaxation  of  a
lesser	percentage  of marks for initial admission than	 the
general	 candidates.  For instance, if the general candidate
is  required  to get 80% as qualifying marks  for  admission
into  speciality  or  superspeciality,	the  relaxation	 for
admission  to  the reserved candidates is of 10 marks  less,
i.e.,  qualifying marks in his case would be 70%.  A  doctor
or  a  technologist  has to pass the postgraduation  or	 the
graduation  with  the  same  standard	as  had	 by  general
candidate  and	has  also  to possess  the  same  degree  of
standard.   However,  with the facility of  possessing	even
lesser marks the reserved candidate gets admission.
</p>
<p id="p_43">      Now,  so	far as these observations are concerned,  as
the  court  was	 not called upon to  consider  the  question
whether	 prescription  of lesser qualifying marks for  SC,ST
and  other  reserved  category candidates for  admission  to
postgraduate  or  super speciality courses in  medicine	 was
permissible,  they are clearly obiter.	So far as  admission
to  super  speciality courses are concerned, in the  present
reference  we  are  not concerned with	the  said  question,
hence, we need not say anything about the same.	 However, so
far  as	 admission to postgraduate courses is concerned	 the
question  of  providing	 of   lesser  qualifying  marks	 for
reserved  category candidates for admission to these courses
directly  arises  for our consideration.  Hence, the  obiter
observations in the aforesaid case on this aspect do require
consideration for their acceptance or otherwise.  As per the
scheme of Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III of the
Seventh	 Schedule of the Constitution of India, as discussed
earlier	 goes,	it  is	not   possible	to  countenance	 the
submission  of	Shri Salve, learned senior counsel  for	 the
Medical	 Council  of India and other counsel canvassing	 the
same  view  that the question of short-listing	of  eligible
candidates  who	 were  otherwise duly  qualified  for  being
admitted  to postgraduate courses in Medicine is not  within
the  domain  of State authorities especially in view of	 the
fact  that  the Parliament, in exercise of  its	 legislative
powers	under Entry 25 of List III, has still not spoken  on
the  point  nor	 does the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_89">Indian Medical Council  Act</a>,	1956
enacted	 under	Entry  66 of List I  covers  this  question.
Hence,	while  providing for entrance test as an  additional
requirement  for eligible candidates for being	short-listed
in  connection	with  admission to smaller number  of  seats
available  in  postgraduate courses, it cannot be said	that
the  State  authorities in exercise of their  constitutional
right  under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_90">Article 15(4)</a> cannot give additional facilities
to   reserved  category	 of   candidates   vis-a-vis   their
requirement  of	 getting  minimum qualifying marks  at	such
entrance  tests	 so  that seats reserved for  them  may	 not
remain	unfilled and the reserved category of candidates  do
get   adequate	opportunity  to	 fill	them  up   and	 get
postgraduate  education on the seats reserved for them which
in  their  turn would not detract from the  availability  of
remaining  seats for general category candidates.  Thus, the
observations in para 21 of the aforesaid judgment that there
can be lesser qualifying marks for admission to postgraduate
courses	 for reserved category of candidates cannot be found
fault  with.  It is made clear that similar observations for
admission  to super speciality courses and the relaxation of
minimum	 qualifying  marks for candidates appearing  at	 the
entrance  test for such courses are not being approved by us
as  we	are  not  required to consider that  aspect  of	 the
matter,	 as  noted earlier.  As it will be presently  shown,
once  reservation  of  seats in postgraduate  courses  under
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_91">Article 15(4)</a> is accepted then even lesser bench marks being
prescribed for reserved category of candidates in the common
entrance examination which they undertake along with general
category of candidates would in substance make no difference
so  far	 as  the  un-reserved  seats  available	 to  general
category  of  candidates  are concerned.  In a	later  three
Judge  Bench  Judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1822248/" id="a_92">Medical	 Council  of
India  vs.   State of Karnataka &amp; Ors</a>., 1998(6) SCC 131,  it
was  held  that in the light of <a href="/doc/161280593/" id="a_93">Sections 10-A</a>,	<a href="/doc/142206541/" id="a_94">10-B</a>,  <a href="/doc/82555573/" id="a_95">10-C</a>,
<a href="/doc/198734806/" id="a_96">19-A</a>  and <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_97">33(fa)</a>, (fb), (fc), (j), (k) and (l) of the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_98">Indian
Medical	 Council Act</a>, 1956 fixation of admission capacity in
medical	 colleges/institutions is the exclusive function  of
Medical	 Council  of  India  and   increase  in	 number	  of
admissions can only be directed by the Central Govt.  on the
recommendation	of  the	 Medical  Council  of  India.	This
function  of the Medical Council of India was upheld in	 the
light  of Entries 66 List I and 25 of List III thereof.	 Now
it  becomes  at	 once obvious that providing for  number  of
seats  to be filled up by eligible candidates in any medical
course	imparted by medical colleges or medical institutions
will   have   a	  direct   nexus  with	 coordination	and
determination  of standards in medical education, as larger
the  seats  in	medical	 colleges wherein  students  can  be
admitted  to MBBS or even higher courses in medicine, larger
infrastructure would be required by way of beds and eligible
and  efficient	teachers  and all other	 infrastructure	 for
imparting  proper  training to the admitted students.	Once
this  exercise	is clearly within the domain of the  Medical
Council	 of  India in the light of the	aforesaid  statutory
provisions it becomes obvious that Entry 66 of List I of the
Seventh	 Schedule  would  hold the  field  and	consequently
States	will not be empowered under entry 25 of List III  to
legislate on this topic as such an exercise would be subject
to  legislation under Entry 66 of List I which would  wholly
occupy	the field.  However, a moot question remains whether
given the permissible intake capacity for admitting students
in  any medical college as laid down by the Medical  Council
of  India  can the available intake capacity of students  be
regulated at the admission stage when the number of eligible
candidates  aspiring  to  be  admitted is  larger  than	 the
available  intake  capacity?   This   question	will  remain
outside the domain of the Medical Council of India under the
aforesaid Act.	As we have discussed earlier, there being no
parliamentary legislation on this aspect even under entry 25
of  List  III of the Seventh Schedule, the short-listing  of
eligible  candidates  for  being admitted to  the  available
permitted intake capacity in medical colleges will obviously
remain	in  the	 domain	 of   State  legislature  and  State
executive on the combined reading of entry 25 of List III as
well  as <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_99">Article 162</a> of the Constitution of India.  In	view
of  the	 aforesaid discussion, it therefore,  becomes  clear
that once seats in postgraduate medical courses are reserved
for  SC,  ST and OBC candidates as per <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_100">Article 15(4)</a> of	 the
Constitution  the  question as to how admission	 to  limited
number	of  general  seats  and reserved  seats	 are  to  be
regulated will remain in the domain of the State authorities
running	  these	  institutions.	    They   can,	  therefore,
legitimately  resort  to the procedure of  short-listing  of
otherwise  eligible  candidates.    While  undertaking	this
exercise of short-listing, the state authorities have to see
how  best  in a given academic year the reserved  seats	 and
general	 category  seats can be filled in by  available	 and
eligible  candidates.  The question is while undertaking the
task  of  short-listing	 of  available	eligible  candidates
vis-a-vis  limited number of seats that may be available for
being filled in in a given academic year, uniform qualifying
bench  marks  for  passing  the	  entrance  test  should  be
prescribed  for both the general category candidates as well
as reserved category candidates or there can be lesser bench
marks  for  the	 latter	 category of students.	 If  due  to
non-availability  of reserved category candidates who  could
obtain	minimum	 qualifying  marks prescribed  for  all	 the
   examinees whether there can be any legitimate dilution of
minimum	 qualifying  marks  for these reserved	category  of
question.   candidates and if so, to what extent is the moot
In  the	 case of <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_101">M.R.  Balaji &amp; Ors.  vs.  State of  Mysore,
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII</a>
1963  Supp.(1)	SCR 439, a Constitution bench of this  court
was  concerned with the extent of reservation which could be
legally	 permissible under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_102">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution
of India.  Gajendragadkar, J., speaking for the Constitution
bench  held  that  reservation of 68% seats  in	 educational
institutions  was  inconsistent with the concept of  special
provision authorised by <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_103">Article 15(4).</a>	It was then observed
as  under  :   Reservation should and must  be	adopted	 to
advance	 the  prospects of weaker sections of  society,	 but
while  doing  so,  care	 should	 be  taken  not	 to  exclude
admission  to  higher educational centres of  deserving	 and
qualified  candidates  of other	 communities.	Reservations
under Arts.15(4) and 16(4) must be within reasonable limits.
The  interests	of weaker sections of society, which  are  a
first  charge  on  the	States and the Centre,	have  to  be
adjusted  with	the interests of the community as  a  whole.
Speaking  generally and in a broad way, a special  provision
should	be less than 50%.  The actual percentage must depend
upon  the  relevant prevailing circumstances in	 each  case.
The  object of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_104">Art.15(4)</a> is to advance the interests of	 the
society	 as  a whole by looking after the interests  of	 the
weaker	elements in society.  If a provision under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_105">Art.15(4)</a>
ignores	 the  interests of society, that is clearly  outside
the  scope  of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_106">Art.15(4).</a>  It is extremely  unreasonable  to
assume	that  in enacting <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_107">Art.15(4</a>), Parliament intended  to
provide	 that where the advancement of the backward  classes
or  the	 Scheduled  Castes and Tribes  were  concerned,	 the
fundamental  rights of the citizens constituting the rest of
the  society  were to be completely and absolutely  ignored.
Considerations of national interest and the interests of the
community and the society as a whole have already to be kept
in mind.

<p id="p_44">      Thus,  even accepting that when seats are reserved for
SC  and	 ST and Other Backward Classes for admission  to  be
given  to  such reserved category of eligible candidates  in
postgraduate  medical  courses, the concession	or  facility
given  to  them cannot exceed 50% of the facility  otherwise
available  to  members of the general public.	Keeping	 the
aforesaid   ratio  of  the   Constitution  Bench  in   view,
therefore, even proceeding on the assumption that 50% of the
available  seats in postgraduate medical courses in a  given
year  may be reserved for SC,ST and OBCs, further concession
that  may be given to them by State authorities by  diluting
the  minimum  qualifying marks at the entrance test so	that
seats  reserved	 for  them may not remain  unfilled  by	 the
reserved  categories of persons for whom they are meant, the
dilution  of  such  marks cannot exceed 50% of	the  general
standards  of  qualifying  bench  marks laid  down  for	 the
general	 categories of candidates.  Otherwise even the	said
dilution  would	 become	 unreasonable and would	 be  hit  by
Articles  14 and 15(1) of the Constitution of India.  In the
case  of  <a href="/doc/1342109/" id="a_108">Minor P.  Rajendran vs.  State of Madras  &amp;  Ors</a>.,
1968  (2) SCR 786, another Constitution bench of this  court
had  to	 consider  whether   district-wise  distribution  of
reserved  seats in medical courses for granting admission to
reserved  category of candidates was violative of <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_109">Article 15
(1)</a>  read  with	 <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_110">Article 14</a> of the  Constitution  of  India.
Answering the question in the affirmative it was observed by
Wanchoo,  J.,  speaking for the Constitution bench at  pages
792  and  793  of  the Report as under :   The	object	of
selection  can only be to secure the best possible  material
for  admission	to  colleges subject to	 the  provision	 for
socially   and	educationally	backward  classes.   Further
whether	 selection  is from the socially  and  educationally
backward  classes  or from the general pool, the  object  of
selection  must	 be to secure the best possible talent	from
the two sources.  If that is the object, it must necessarily
follow	that  that  object would be defeated  if  seats	 are
allocated  district  by district.  It cannot be and has	 not
been  denied  that the object of selection is to secure	 the
best  possible	talent	from  the two sources  so  that	 the
country may have the best possible doctors.
</p>
<p id="p_45">      Relying  on  these  observations of  the	Constitution
bench  Shri  P.P.   Rao and Shri Chaudhary,  learned  senior
counsel appearing for the State of Madhya Pradesh, submitted
that  when  there is a pool of eligible candidates who	have
all  passed  MBBS  examination and are	duly  qualified	 and
eligible  to  pursue postgraduate medical courses of  study,
and  if in a given institution there are seats reserved	 for
them  then  the	 selection  out	 of  the  reserved  category
candidates  for	 filling up of these reserved posts  can  be
done  in a selective manner and that would permit reasonable
dilution  of  the uniform qualifying marks at  the  entrance
test  as required to be obtained by the examinees concerned.
This  submission  is  amply  borne out	from  the  aforesaid
observations  of  the  Constitution bench decision  of	this
court.	 However, a further question survives as to  whether
in  diluting  the  minimum  qualifying	marks  for  reserved
category  of candidates who are otherwise eligible for being
admitted  to postgraduate courses on the seats reserved	 for
them,  whether	<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_111">Article	 335</a> can get attracted.	  It  is  of
course	true  that  candidates	 appointed  or	admitted  to
postgraduate medical course have to work as registrars, some
posts  of  the registrars are fully paid posts while  others
may  be	 stipendary  residents posts.  However, it  is	not
possible to accept the contention of learned counsel for the
Special	 Leave	Petitioners that admission  to	postgraduate
courses	 would amount to recruitment to any posts.   Concept
of  recruitment	 to  posts is entirely	different  from	 the
concept	 of  admission to the course of study which  in	 its
turn  may  require the students concerned to take  practical
training  by  functioning  as registrars attached  to  wards
where  patients are treated.  Even though such students work
as  registrars	during the course of study  as	postgraduate
students, they essentially remain students and their working
as  registrars would be a part of practical training.	They
would  all  the	 same remain trainee registrars and  not  as
directly   recruited  registrars   through  any	 recruitment
process held by the Public Service Commission for filling up
full-fledged   medical	officers  posts.    They  work	 as
registrars  as	a part of postgraduate educational  training
only  because  they are admitted to the course of  study  as
postgraduate  students in concerned disciplines.  It is easy
to  visualise that calling for applications from open market
by  advertisement  for appointment of  full-fledged  medical
officers to be recruited through the process of selection to
be   undertaken	 by  Public   Service  Commission  or  other
departmental  selection committees will stand entirely on  a
different  footing  as compared to the process of  admitting
eligible  students  to	postgraduate   medical	courses	  of
studies.   Thus,  keeping in view the nature of	 working  as
trainee	 registrars  by	 admitted students  to	postgraduate
medical	 courses  it  cannot  be  said	that  such  admitted
students   are	recruited  to	any  posts  of	 registrars.
Consequently, <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_112">Article 335</a> of the Constitution of India which
has  relevance while considering reservation of posts  under
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_113">Article	 16(4)</a> cannot have any direct impact on	 reservation
of  seats  in  educational institutions as  permitted  under
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_114">Article	 15(4).</a>	  Learned  counsel for the  petitioners	 had
invited	 our  attention to a decision of two Judge bench  of
this  Court in <a href="/doc/64185844/" id="a_115">S.  Vinod Kumar &amp; Anr.  vs.  Union of India &amp;
Ors</a>.,  1996(6)	SCC  580,  wherein it was  held	 that  while
providing  for	reservations  to posts in the  hierarchy  by
invoking  powers under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_116">Article 16(4</a>), making a provision for
lower  qualifying  marks or lesser level of  evaluation	 for
members of reserved category was impermissible on account of
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_117">Article	 335</a>  of the Constitution of India.   The  aforesaid
decision  obviously  cannot  be	 pressed  in  service  while
considering  the  question of giving facilities to  reserved
category  of  candidates  for being admitted  to  the  seats
reserved  for them in educational institutions wherein	they
can  undertake	courses of studies for ultimately  obtaining
postgraduate degrees in medicine.  In the case of <a href="/doc/104556519/" id="a_118">Ajay Kumar
Singh &amp; Ors.  vs.  State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.(supra), this aspect
of  the	 matter	 has been correctly  highlighted  by  Jeevan
Reddy,	J., speaking for the court in para 14 of the Report.
It  has	 been  held therein that :  We	see  absolutely	 no
substance  in  the  third  submission of  Shri	Singh.	 The
argument  taxes	 ones credulity.  We are totally unable	 to
appreciate how can it be said that admission to postgraduate
medical	 course	 is  a promotional post	 just  because	such
candidate  must	 necessarily  pass MBBS	 examination  before
becoming  eligible  for	 admission to  postgraduate  medical
course	or  for	 the  reason  that  some  stipend  -  it  is
immaterial  whether  Rs.1000 or Rs.3000 p.m.  - is  paid  to
postgraduate  students.	 Admission to such course cannot  be
equated	 to  appointment to a post and certainly not  to  an
appointment  by	 promotion.   The  argument  is	 accordingly
rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_46">      (Emphasis supplied)

      It  is  obvious  that only because a  person  who	 has
passed	MBBS examination and is made eligible for  admission
to  postgraduate course is paid stipend during the course of
his studies at postgraduate level, he cannot be said to have
been  appointed to the post of a registrar.  It may be	that
he  has to work as a trainee registrar during the course  of
his study to obtain practical training but that is a part of
the curriculum of studies and not because he is appointed to
the post of the registrar after undergoing selection process
whereunder  a  person  from open market is  recruited  as  a
medical	 officer  and whose recruitment as  medical  officer
would  be  subject  to rules and regulations and  would	 not
terminate only because his training period is over.  In fact
such  a full-fledged medical officer has no training period.
He  has	 if at all probation period.  In case of  a  trainee
registrar  who has to work as such during the course of	 his
studies	 as  a postgraduate student on the other  hand,	 his
work  as registrar would be co-terminus with his passing the
postgraduate  examination  as M.D.  or M.S./M.D.S.   as	 the
case  may be.  He is also not liable to be transferred as  a
full-fledged registrar, duly appointed as such, is liable to
be  transferred	 due  to exigencies of service.	  Thus,	 the
working	 of  such  students during the course  of  study  as
residents  whether on full payment or on stipendary  payment
would  make  no	 difference and they cannot be	said  to  be
holding	 any  civil  post in any hospital as  full-  fledged
medical	  officers.   Consequently,  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_119">Article   335</a>  of	 the
Constitution  of  India	 cannot	 by itself  be	applied	 for
regulating  the	 admission  of	eligible  reserved  category
students  to  postgraduate  medical  courses  in  the  seats
reserved for them under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_120">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution of
India.	 The next question that falls for consideration that
even  assuming that <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_121">Article 335</a> cannot be pressed in service
while  considering the question of admission of eligible and
qualified  candidates for enabling them to pursue courses of
postgraduate medical studies the guidelines laid down by the
Medical	 Council  of India pursuant to the regulations	made
under  <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_122">Section	33</a> of the Indian Medical Council  Act,	even
though	persuasive  in	nature	and not	 mandatory,  can  be
totally	 by-passed  or	ignored	 by  the  State	 authorities
concerned  with short-listing of candidates for admission to
limited	 seats	available in medical institutions  imparting
postgraduate  medical education?  The answer obviously would
be in the negative.  The guidelines laid down by the Medical
Council	 of India though persuasive have to be kept in	view
while  deciding as to whether the concession or facility  to
be  given  to  such reserved category of  candidates  should
remain	within the permissible limits so as not to amount to
arbitrary  and unreasonable grant of concessions wiping	 out
the  concept  of  merit in its entirety.   Consequently,  it
cannot	be  said that even though short-listing of  eligible
candidates  is	permissible to the State authorities,  while
doing  so, the State authorities can completely give a go-by
to  the concept of merit and can go to the extent of totally
dispensing   with  qualifying  marks   for  SC,ST  and	 OBC
candidates  and can short-list them for being considered for
admission  to  reserved	 categories  of seats  for  them  in
postgraduate  studies  by reducing the qualifying  marks  to
even  zero.  That was rightly frowned upon by this court  in
Sadhana	 Devis	case  (supra) as that would not	 amount	 to
short-listing but on the contrary would amount to completely
long  listing  of such reserved category candidates for	 the
vacancies  which  are  reserved for them and on	 which	they
would not be entitled to be admitted if they did not qualify
according  to  even reduced bench marks or qualifying  marks
fixed  for them.  As seen earlier, keeping in view the ratio
of  the	 Constitution bench of this court in M.R.   Balajis
case (supra) it must be held that along with the permissible
reservation  of	 50%  of  seats	 for  reserved	category  of
candidates  in institutions imparting postgraduate  studies,
simultaneously	if further concessions by way of  facilities
are  to be given for such reserved category of candidates so
as  to enable them to effectively occupy the seats  reserved
for  them, such concessions by way of dilution of qualifying
marks to be obtained at the entrance test for the purpose of
short-listing, can also not go beyond the permissible limits
of  50%	 of the qualifying marks uniformly fixed  for  other
candidates  belonging to general category and who appear  at
the  same competitive test along with the reserved  category
of  candidates.	 It is found from the records of these cases
that  qualifying  marks	 at the entrance  test	for  general
category  of  candidates are fixed at 50%.  In fact such  is
the  general  standard of qualifying marks suggested by	 the
Medical	 Council  of  India even at the	 stage	of  entrance
examination  to MBBS course which is at the gross-root level
of  medical  education	after a student	 has  completed	 his
secondary  education.  Thus it would be proper to proceed on
the  basis  that minimum qualifying marks for  clearing	 the
entrance  test by way of short-listing for getting  admitted
to postgraduate medical courses uniformly for all candidates
who  appear at such examination should be 50% but so far  as
reserved  category  of	candidates  are	 concerned  who	 are
otherwise   eligible   for  competing	for  seats  in	 the
postgraduate  medical courses, 50% reduction at the  highest
of  the general bench marks by way of permissible concession
would  enable the State authorities to reduce the qualifying
marks for passing such entrance examination up to 50% of 50%
i.e.   25%.  In other words, if qualifying marks for passing
the  entrance examination for being admitted to postgraduate
medical	 courses  is 50% for a general	category  candidate,
then  such  qualifying	marks by way of	 concession  can  be
reduced	 for reserved category candidates to 25% which would
be  the maximum permissible limit of reduction or  deviation
from  the  general  bench marks.  Meaning  thereby,  that  a
reserved category candidate even if gets 25% of the marks at
such  a common entrance test he can be considered for  being
admitted  to the reserved vacancy for which he is  otherwise
eligible.   But	 below	25%  of	 bench	marks  for  reserved
category   of  candidates,  no	 further  dilution  can	  be
permitted.   In	 other	words, concession  or  facility	 for
reserved category of candidates can remain permissible under
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_123">Article	 15(4)</a> up to only 50% of bench marks prescribed	 for
general	 category  candidates.	The State cannot reduce	 the
qualifying  marks for a reserved category of candidate below
25%  nor  can it go up to zero as tried to be  suggested  by
Shri P.P.Rao, learned senior counsel for the State of Madhya
Pradesh	 as  that  would  not	amount	to  the	 process  of
short-listing  but  would in fact amount to long listing  or
comprehensive	listing	 of  such   reserved   category	  of
candidates  as	seen earlier.  Any such attempt	 to  further
dilute	the  qualifying	 marks or bench marks  for  reserved
category  of  candidates  below 25% of the  general  passing
marks  would be violative of the provisions of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_124">Article 15(4)</a>
as  laid down by the Constitution Bench in M.R.Balajis case
(supra)	 and would also remain unreasonable and would be hit
by  <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_125">Article  14</a> of the Constitution of India.	Within	this
sliding	 scale	of percentages between 25% and	50%  passing
marks  appropriate bench marks for passing the entrance test
examination  can  be  suitably	fixed	for  SC/ST  and	 OBC
candidates  as exigencies of the situation may require.	 But
in  no	case the qualifying marks for any of these  reserved
categories  of	students  can go below 25%  of	the  general
passing	 marks.	  Any reserved category candidate  who	gets
less  than 25% of marks at the entrance examination or	less
than   prescribed  reduced  percentage	of  marks  for	 the
concerned  category  between  50% and 25% of  passing  marks
cannot	be called for counselling and has to be ruled out of
consideration  and in that process if any seats reserved for
reserved categories concerned remains unfilled by candidates
belonging  to  that  category  it must	go  to	the  general
category  and  can  be	filled in by  the  general  category
candidate  who has already obtained 50% or more marks at the
entrance  examination  but  who could  not  be	accommodated
because	 of  lesser percentage of marks obtained by him	 qua
other  general category candidates in the limited number  of
seats	available  to  them  in	  a  given  institution	  in
postgraduate  studies.	 As we will presently show  even  if
minimum	 passing marks in the entrance test for admission to
postgraduate  courses is either reduced to 25% uniformly for
all  the  candidates  or  is reduced and  diluted  only	 for
reserved category of candidates, the net result would remain
substantially  the same.  This aspect can be highlighted  by
taking	an  illustration.  Suppose there are six seats in  a
given  postgraduate medical course.  Then applying the ratio
of  50%	 permissible  reservation  of  seats  for   reserved
category  of candidates like SC/ST and OBCs three seats	 get
reserved,  one each for SC,ST and OBC while three seats will
remain	available to general category of candidates  passing
the common entrance test.  On the basis of this illustration
let  us	 take a hypothetical case of 13 eligible  candidates
who  have  passed  basic  MBBS	 examination  and  are	duly
qualified  to compete for the six seats in a given course of
postgraduate  study.  These 13 candidates undertake the same
entrance  test and all of them as a result of the said	test
obtained  marks as under :  A 75 out of 100, B 70, C(SC) 65,
D  60,	E(SC) 55, F51, G50, H(OBC) 48, I 42, J(ST) 40,	K35,
L30, M25, N (SC) 21.  In the aforesaid illustration C, E and
N  are SC candidates, H is OBC and J is a ST candidate.	 Now
if 50% passing marks are uniformly applied to all of them as
tried	to  be	suggested  by	learned	 counsel   for	 the
petitioners,  the following picture will emerge :  Situation
No.1:  Seat numbers 1,2, and 3 are general seats, 4 reserved
for  SC,  5 reserved for ST and 6 reserved for OBC.  If	 50%
passing	 marks are uniformly applied to seat nos.1,2,3,4,5 &amp;
6  :   Seat no.1 will go to A, 2 to B, 3 to C (SC), 4  to  E
(SC),  seat  nos.5&amp;6 will not get filled in by the  reserved
category candidates as there are no ST or OBC candidates who
have  obtained	50% and more marks.  These two	seats  which
remain	unfilled  will	go  to	D  and	F  general  category
candidates  who	 have obtained more than 50% marks, but	 who
could  not be accommodated in the seats available to general
category  of candidates as the last candidate in the general
category  who got admission though SC, was having 65% marks.
Thus the situation would be the two seats i.e.	seat nos.  5
and  6 which are reserved for ST and OBC and were  otherwise
not available to general category of candidates would not go
to  eligible  and qualified ST and OBC candidates namely,  H
and J even though they had obtained MBBS degrees and had the
basic  qualification  and eligibility for being admitted  to
the  seats  reserved  for them.	 That may  affect  the	real
purpose	  underlying   reservation   under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_126">Article   15(4).</a>
Situation  No.2:  We may now take the alternative  situation
for  consideration  :  If the minimum qualifying  marks	 are
reduced	 to  25%  for all categories of	 candidates  to	 the
rock-bottom  permissible  limit	 including SC/ST  and  other
reserved  category  candidates, then the  following  picture
would emerge :	Seat no.1 will go to A, seat no.2 will go to
B,  seat no.3 will go to C(SC), seat no.4 which is  reserved
for  SC candidate will go to E, seat no.5 which is  reserved
for  ST	 will go to J, seat no.6 which is reserved  for	 OBC
will go to H.  All six seats will be filled up by A,B, C,E,J
&amp;  H.  Thus even if the minimum passing marks are  uniformly
reduced to 25% which is the permissible rock- bottom as seen
earlier	 the  general category candidates will get the	same
seats  which  would have been available to them even if	 the
minimum	 qualifying  marks  for admission  would  have	been
uniformly  kept	 at 50% for all candidates at  the  entrance
test.	But what will happen is, that by reduction of  these
qualifying marks to 25% all the reserved category seats 4 to
6  will	 get filled in by otherwise eligible  and  qualified
reserved category candidates E,J and H and there will remain
no  occasion for making any of such seats available to	left
out  general category candidates like D and F for whom	they
were not meant even otherwise and reservation of seats under
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_127">Article 15(4)</a> would get fully fructified.
</p>
<p id="p_47">      Situation	 no.3:	 Now let us assume that for  general
category  candidates  minimum passing marks at the  entrance
test  are  kept at 50% but for reserved category  candidates
the passing marks are reduced to the permissible rock-bottom
limit  of 25%.	If that happens, the result would remain the
same,  namely,	as found in situation no.2, i.e.  A will  be
admitted  to  seat no.1, B will be admitted to seat no.2,  C
(SC)  will  be admitted to seat no.3, E will be admitted  to
seat  no.4 reserved for SC, J will be admitted to seat	no.5
reserved for ST and H will be admitted to seat no.6 reserved
for  OBC.  Then the net result would be that because of	 the
limited	 deviation  of	minimum qualifying  marks  only	 for
reserved  category  candidates,	 E,  J &amp; H  who	 would	have
otherwise  been admitted to reserved category seats even  if
there  was  universal  and uniform reduction  of  qualifying
marks  at  25%, will get the same benefit without  affecting
the  admission	of general category  candidates.   Situation
No.4:	As minimum qualifying marks for reserved category of
candidates  are	 kept at 25% and are not reduced  below	 the
same, candidate N who is a SC candidate and who has obtained
only  21% passing marks at the entrance test will be totally
ruled out of consideration, but even if the qualifying marks
are  reduced  to below the permissible limit of 25%, N	will
not get any seat as the seat reserved for such candidates is
only  one  being no.  4 in the said course of study  and  is
already occupied by E who is a more meritorious SC candidate
qua  N.	  Situation No.5:  Now let us consider	a  situation
wherein	 E  a  SC  candidate, who is  entitled	to  reserved
category  seat	no.4  and has excluded D who  is  a  general
category  candidate  who  has obtained more marks  than	 him
because	 of such permissible reservation of a seat for	him,
for  any  reason does not join the course of study  and	 his
seat becomes vacant, then in such a situation, the following
picture	 may  emerge in different categories of cases  where
minimum	 passing marks are fixed differently :	i) In case E
is not available and 50% minimum passing marks are fixed for
all  categories	 of candidates then seat no.1 will go to  A,
seat  no.2 will go to B., seat no.3 will go to C, seat	no.4
would  not go to N who is the next eligible SC candidate who
has  qualified	for  being admitted but has  got  less	than
passing	 marks at the entrance test.  That seat will  remain
unoccupied  and will go to the general category candidate D.
Seat  no.5 which is reserved for ST person also cannot go to
J as he has got less than the passing marks.  Seat no.5 will
therefore,  go	to F.  Seat no.6 reserved for OBC also	will
not  go	 to  H as he has got only 48% marks, less  than	 the
minimum passing marks.	His seat will go to general category
candidates  who are in the waiting list and will be  offered
to  G  who  has	 just got the passing marks.   Thus  in	 the
absence	 of availability of E the six seats will go as under
:  A,B,C,D,F &amp; G.  Thus all the reserved category seats will
remain	unfilled by reserved category candidates and will be
added to general category seats.  Result will be reservation
under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_128">Article 15(4)</a> will totally fail.	 ii) Now let us take
another	 category  of situation where minimum passing  marks
are fixed at 25% for all candidates.  In that case even if E
is not available then the first three general category seats
will  go to A,B,C and the 4th seat reserved for SC candidate
will  remain  unfilled	as the next  available	eligible  SC
candidate  is N who has got less than 25% minimum marks.  So
his seat will go to the general category candidate who is in
the waiting list namely, D.  While seat no.4 reserved for ST
candidate  will	 go  to	 J and seat no.6  reserved  for	 OBC
candidate  will go to H.  Therefore, the net result will  be
as under :  1 to 6 seats will go to A,B,C,D,J &amp; H.  iii) The
same  result  would follow for general	category  candidates
even  if the minimum passing marks are fixed at 50% and	 for
the  reserved  category	 candidates the	 minimum  qualifying
marks  are reduced to 25%.  Then the first three seats	will
go  to A,B,C, and seat no.4 not occupied by E a SC candidate
cannot	go to N the next SC candidate who has got less	than
25%  marks.   It  will	be occupied by D  from	the  general
category  candidates.	While  seat no.5 will go to J  a  ST
candidate  who has more than 25% marks and seat no.6 will go
to  H who is a OBC candidate having got 48% marks.  Thus the
six  seats will go to A,B,C,D,J &amp; H.  Thus it is clear	that
where  the  minimum passing marks are uniformly reduced	 for
all  candidates or they are reduced only for backward  class
candidates  but	 to  the same extent, the  result  regarding
occupation of these seats by general category candidates and
reserved  candidates  would  remain the same if E  does	 not
occupy the seat available to him as an SC candidate.  iv) If
for  any  reason the minimum qualifying marks  for  reserved
category candidates are still further reduced to 20% then in
the absence of availability of a SC candidate E, the next SC
candidate  N  having  21%  may get it and  occupy  the	seat
reserved  for  a  SC  candidate.  In such  a  situation	 the
following  picture  will emerge :  1 to 3 will go to  A,B,C;
seat  no.4  reserved for SC candidate will go to N and	seat
no.5  will  go to ST candidate J and seat no.6 reserved	 for
OBC  candidate	will go to H.  Resultantly no seat  will  be
left  for being made available to general category candidate
D and he will get excluded.  But as we have seen earlier, if
concession  or	dilution of minimum qualifying marks at	 the
entrance  test for admission to postgraduate medical courses
is kept within the permissible limit of 50% dilution and can
go down only up to 25% minimum qualifying marks for reserved
category  candidates  then  N  in no case would	 get  in  to
displace  D who is a general category candidate and who	 had
an  opportunity to get in vis-a-vis the seat reserved for SC
candidate as E the eligible SC candidate is not available at
a  given  point of time.  The aforesaid	 illustration  shows
that  as  C  (SC  candidate) has got  the  seat	 in  general
category  on  his  own	merit his occupancy  is	 not  to  be
considered while granting admission to the seat reserved for
SC  candidate  as held by a Constitution bench	decision  of
this Court in <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_129">R.K.  Sabharwal &amp; Ors.  vs.  State of Punjab &amp;
Ors</a>.,  1995(2)	SCC  745.   We may at this  stage  refer  to
decision  of  a	 three	Judge bench of	this  court  in	 <a href="/doc/434106/" id="a_130">Dr.
Pradeep Jain &amp; Ors.  vs.  Union of India &amp; Ors</a>., 1984(3) SCC
654,  wherein  in  the	context of  reservation	 in  medical
education   courses   on  the	basis  of   territorial	  or
institutional  preference,  Bhagwati, J., speaking  for	 the
court  in para 22 of the Report observed as under :  But as
far  as	 admissions to postgraduate courses, such as MS,  MD
and  the like are concerned, it would be eminently desirable
not  to	 provide  for  any reservation	based  on  residence
requirement within the State or on institutional preference.
There  the  excellence	cannot be compromised by  any  other
considerations	because	 that  would be detrimental  to	 the
interest  of  the  nation. It is of course true	 that  the
aforesaid  observations were made not with reference to	 any
reservations   as  per	<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_131">Article	  15(4).</a>    However,   while
considering  the extent of dilution of minimum passing marks
in  the	 entrance  examination	for  admission	of  reserved
category  candidates  to postgraduate medical  courses,	 the
permissible  limit below which the concessions available  to
reserved  category of candidates cannot be permitted to	 go,
would  require serious consideration, otherwise merit  would
be  totally by-passed and jeopardised.	It is also pertinent
to note that in the aforesaid decision the permissible limit
of  reservation by way of institutional preference was	held
to  be	only up to 50% of the total available seats.   While
dealing	 with  the  scope  and ambit  of  reservation  under
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_132">Article	 15(4)</a>	in postgraduate courses, which of course  is
not  in	 challenge before us, we have also to keep in  view,
the  observations  of the nine Judge bench of this Court  in
Indra  Sawhneys case (supra).  In para 146 of the Report at
page  401  Pandian,  J., concurring with the  main  majority
decision rendered by Jeevan Reddy, J., observed that :	The
basic policy of reservation is to off-set the inequality and
remove	the  manifest  imbalance, the victims of  which	 for
bygone	generations  lag far behind and demand	equality  by
special	 preferences  and  their strategies.   Therefore,  a
comprehensive	 methodological	    approach	encompassing
jurisprudential, comparative, historical and anthropological
conditions   is	  necessary.	Such  considerations   raise
controversial issues transcending the routine legal exercise
because certain social groups who are inherently unequal and
who  have fallen victims of societal discrimination  require
compensatory treatment.	 Needless to emphasise that equality
in  fact  or substantive equality involves the necessity  of
beneficial  treatment  in order to attain the  result  which
establishes  an	 equilibrium  between  two  sections  placed
unequally.
</p>
<p id="p_48">      Same  learned  Judge  at pages 402-403 of	 the  Report
considered a passage by Allan P.  Sindler in his book Bakke,
Defunis	 and  Minority	Admissions   (The  Quest  for  Equal
Opportunity)  which  dealt with a running race	between	 two
persons i.e.  one who has his legs shackled and another not.
In  such  a race between unequals it was found necessary  to
remove	the  inequality	 between the two runners  by  giving
compensatory edge to the shackled runner.  The learned Judge
also  noted  the  submission  of  learned  counsel  for	 the
petitioners  who  demonstrably explained that  as  unwatered
seeds  do not germinate, unprotected backward class citizens
will  whither  away.   In  the	earlier	 Constitution  bench
judgment  in  <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_133">M.R.Balaji  vs.	 State	of  Mysore</a>  (supra),
Gajendragadkar,	 J.,  at page 467 of the Report, this  Court
made  the following pertinent observations with reference to
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_134">Article	 15(4)	:</a>   When <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_135">Art.15(4)</a> refers  to  the  special
provision   for	 the  advancement  of  certain	classes	  or
scheduled castes or scheduled tribes, it must not be ignored
that  the  provision  which is authorised to be	 made  is  a
special provision;  it is not a provision which is exclusive
in  character,	so that in looking after the advancement  of
those  classes,	 the  State would be justified	in  ignoring
altogether  the advancement of the rest of the society.	  It
is  because  the interests of the society at large would  be
served	by promoting the advancement of the weaker  elements
in  the society that <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_136">Art.15(4)</a> authorises special  provision
to be made.
</p>
<p id="p_49">      We  may also refer to the contention of learned senior
counsel	 Shri Rajendra Sachar, placing reliance on page	 474
of  the	 Report in M.R.Balajis case (supra) to	the  effect
that  the efficiency of administration is of such paramount
importance that it would be unwise and impermissible to make
any  reservation at the cost of efficiency of administration
and  that  it  was undoubtedly the effect  of  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_137">Article	335.</a>
Therefore,  what  is true in regard to <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_138">Art.15(4)</a> is  equally
true  in regard to <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_139">Art.16(4).</a> These observations,  strongly
relied	upon  by  Shri Sachar for importing  the  impact  of
<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_140">Article	 335</a> on the reservations under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_141">Article 15(4)</a>  cannot
be  treated  to	 be  of any real  assistance  to  him.	 The
aforesaid  observations were made by the Constitution  bench
while considering the reasonableness of reservation of seats
in  educational institutions and for highlighting the  point
that  such reservation of seats should not be more than	 50%
and  reservation  of  68%  of	seats  was  not	 within	 the
permissible  limit of special provision under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_142">Article 15(4).</a>
From  these observations, it cannot necessarily follow	that
admission   to	such  reserved	 seats	can  tantamount	  to
appointments  to  any posts to which <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_143">Article 335</a>  would	 get
directly  attracted.   While   considering  the	 permissible
limits	of  dilution of minimum passing marks  for  reserved
category candidates appearing at the entrance test for being
called	for  counselling  for	admissions  to	postgraduate
medical	 courses,  we have to keep in view the salient	fact
that different universities examining students for obtaining
MBBS  degrees  on  the basis of the same syllabus  may	have
different  yardsticks and standards of assessment of  papers
and,  therefore,  students passing their  MBBS	examinations
from  different universities cannot ipso facto be treated to
be  equally meritorious and consequently the common entrance
test for admission to postgraduate courses cannot be said to
be  totally  uncalled for.  However, because reservation  of
seats  at postgraduate educational level is countenanced, as
a  logical corollary, to make effective the reservations and
with a view to seeing that the reserved category students do
not  get excluded from getting admitted as far as  possible,
provision  for lesser qualifying marks for reserved category
candidates  at the common entrance test cannot be said to be
totally	 illegal.   However,  with  a view  to	seeing	that
crutches  provided to such weaker sections of society do not
cripple	 them for ever, the dilution of passing marks at the
common	entrance  test	at   which  such  reserved  category
candidates  appear  after obtaining their MBBS degrees	from
different  universities cannot be totally arbitrary and must
have  a permissible rock-bottom limit below which it  cannot
go  and	 that  is  why it is reasonable to  hold  that	when
reservation  of	 seats under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_144">Article 15(4)</a>  in	postgraduate
medical	  courses  cannot  exceed  50%	 as  held   by	 the
Constitution  bench  in M.R.  Balajis case (supra) then	 on
the same line of reasoning additional facilities to be given
to  such reserved category candidates for being admitted  to
the  seats  reserved  for them in the  postgraduate  medical
courses	 also should not exceed the permissible limit of 50%
dilution  from the general cut-off marks provided  uniformly
for  general category of candidates competing for  admission
to  such  limited  number of seats  at	postgraduate  level.
While  dealing	with  the question of  dilution	 of  minimum
passing	 marks for reserved category of candidates appearing
at  the entrance tests for admission to postgraduate courses
it  has	 to be kept in view that general  category  students
form  a	 separate  class as compared  to  reserved  category
candidates  for whom seats are reserved under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_145">Article 15(4).</a>
Once  that is kept in view, as a logical corollary, it	must
follow	that to make such reservations effective appropriate
dilution of the minimum cut-off marks for students belonging
to the reserved category would become permissible subject to
the  rider that such dilution should not be so	unreasonable
as  to	go  out	 of the beneficial  protective	umbrella  of
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_146">Article	 15(4)</a>	as seen earlier.  If that happens  it  would
squarely  get  hit by <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_147">Article 15(1)</a> read with <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_148">Article 14</a>  of
the Constitution of India.  However, within such permissible
limits	such  dilution for different reserved categories  of
candidates  who	 may be given benefit of sliding  scales  of
reduced passing marks as required by exigencies of situation
would	remain	legal  and   valid.   In  this	 connection,
observations  in  the  Constitution bench judgment  of	this
court  in  <a href="/doc/195765/" id="a_149">Chitra Ghosh &amp; Anr.	vs.  Union of India  &amp;	Ors</a>.
(supra),  wherein  Grover,  J., spoke for  the	Constitution
bench  as to which we have made a detailed reference earlier
are  required  to be kept in view.  To recapitulate, it	 has
been   held  that  selection  of  eligible  candidates	 for
admission to medical courses can be made by classifying such
candidates  category-wise keeping in view the services	from
which  they  are  drawn.   The	aforesaid  decision  of	 the
Constitution   bench  was  directly   concerned	  with	 the
admissions  in	medical	 colleges.  It	would  squarely	 get
attracted  while  deciding the present controversy.   It  is
obvious	 that if for admission to a medical education course
at  gross-root level of MBBS, different rules for  selecting
candidates  from different sources from which they are to be
drawn  are countenanced, then even at the stage of admission
at  postgraduate level, the ratio of the aforesaid  decision
of  the Constitution bench would squarely get attracted	 and
would  permit  separate	 treatment for students	 drawn	from
different  sources.   It is of course true that in the	said
case,	the  Constitution  bench   was	concerned  with	 the
nominations made by the Central Government on seats reserved
for such nominees.  However, that would not whittle down the
decision  of the Constitution bench to the effect that while
imparting  education  in  theory  and  practice	 in  medical
courses of study, the source from which candidates are drawn
can  be a relevant classificatory criterion and there can be
different  rules  in the matter of selection  of  candidates
drawn from different sources.  It is axiomatic that reserved
category  candidates  competing	 for being selected  to	 the
seats  reserved for them in postgraduate medical courses  as
per the mandate of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_150">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution have to
compete	 inter	se with their own colleagues from  the	same
categories  and not necessarily have to compete with general
category  candidates  who form entirely a  different  class.
Once  such  classification is countenanced, as	a  necessary
concomitant,  separate	provision for reserved	category  of
candidates forming a separate class for which reservation of
seats in postgraduate medical courses is permitted cannot be
faulted	 and hence the dilution of minimum qualifying  marks
for  reserved  category	 of candidates cannot by  itself  be
treated	 to be unauthorised or illegal from any view  point.
Otherwise the very purpose of reserving seats for such class
of  candidates	at postgraduate level of  medical  education
would  be  denuded  on its real content and the	 purpose  of
reservation  would  fail.   The	  seats	 reserved  for	such
category  of  persons would go unfilled and will  swell	 the
admission  of general category of candidates for whom  these
seats  are  not at all meant to be made available, once	 the
scheme	of reservation of seats under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_151">Article 15(4)</a> is	held
applicable.   In the light of the aforesaid discussion,	 the
following  conclusions emerge :	 1) It is permissible to the
	   JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ
State  authorities which are running and/or controlling	 the
medical	 institutions in the States concerned to  short-list
the eligible and qualified MBBS doctors for being considered
for  admission	to  postgraduate medical  courses  in  these
institutions.	For  the purpose of such short-listing	full
play  is  available  to the State  authorities	to  exercise
legislative  or executive power as the field is not occupied
till  date  by	any legislation of the	Parliament  on	this
aspect	in exercise of its legislative powers under Entry 25
of  List III of the Constitution of India and this topic  is
also not covered by any legislation under Entry 66 of List I
of  the Constitution.  2) <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_152">The Indian Medical Council Act</a> and
the  regulations framed thereunder do not cover the question
of short-listing of admission of eligible and duly qualified
MBBS  doctors  who  seek   admission  to  different  medical
institutions   imparting  postgraduate	 education  run	  or
controlled  by the States concerned.  3) The regulations and
guidelines  given  by the Medical Council of India  in	this
connection,  though  persuasive and not having	any  binding
force,	cannot	be totally ignored by the State	 authorities
but  must  be  broadly kept in view  while  undertaking	 the
exercise  of short-listing of eligible candidates for  being
admitted   to  postgraduate  medical   courses.	  4)   While
short-listing candidates having basic qualifications of MBBS
for  being  considered	for admission to limited  number  of
vacancies  in postgraduate courses available at the  medical
institutions  in the Sates, it is permissible for the  State
authorities  to have common entrance tests and to  prescribe
minimum	 qualifying  marks for passing such tests to  enable
the   examinees	 who  pass  such   test	 to  be	 called	 for
counselling.   That  would  be	in  addition  to  the  basic
qualification by way of MBBS degree.  The performance of the
candidate  concerned during the time he or she undertook the
study  at MBBS level for ultimately getting the MBBS  degree
also  would  be	 a  relevant  consideration  for  the  State
authorities   to  be  kept  in	 view.	 5)  It	 is  equally
permissible  for the State authorities while undertaking the
aforesaid  exercise  of	 short-listing to  fix	50%  minimum
qualifying  marks at the entrance test for general  category
of  candidates and to dilute and prescribe lesser percentage
of  passing  marks  for reserved category of  candidates  as
exigencies  of situation may require in a given year but  in
no case the minimum qualifying marks as reduced for reserved
category of candidates can go below 25% of passing marks for
such  reserved	category of candidates.	 In other  words,  a
play  is  available  to the State authorities  to  prescribe
different  minimum passing marks for SC/ST and OBC  eligible
candidates  between 50% and 25% as the prevailing  situation
at  a  given point of time may require.	 In such  categories
for  SC, ST &amp; OBC candidates different diluted passing marks
can  be	 prescribed, but this exercise has to be within	 the
permissible  limits  of	 less than 50% &amp; up to	minimum	 25%
passing	 marks	for  each of such reserved  categories.	  No
eligible  candidate belonging to reserved category who	does
not  obtain minimum percent of passing marks as diluted	 for
such  category of candidates by the State authorities can be
considered  to	be  eligible  for  undertaking	postgraduate
medical courses in a given year for which he has offered his
candidature  and if any seat reserved for such categories of
candidates  remain unfilled due to non-availability of	such
eligible  reserved category candidate to fill up such  seat,
then  the said seat would go to general category  candidates
and  will be available in the order of merit in the light of
marks	obtained  by  such   wait-listed  general   category
candidates  having  obtained  requisite	 passing  marks	 who
otherwise  could not get admitted due to non-availability of
general	 category  seats  earlier.   The  ratio	 of  various
decisions of this court considered herein above will have to
be  implemented in the light of the aforesaid conclusions to
which  we  have reached.  The aforesaid practice has  to  be
followed and should hold the field from year to year so long
as  the	 Parliament  does  not	 pass  any  legislation	 for
regulating  admission to postgraduate medical courses either
by  separate legislation or by appropriately amending <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_153">Indian
Medical	 Council  Act</a> by empowering the Medical	 Council  of
India to prescribe such regulations.  The writ petitions and
the  civil appeal arising out of the special leave  petition
as  well  as  the review petitions would stand	disposed  of
accordingly  in	 the  aforesaid	  terms	 and  the  judgments
rendered  by  the  High Courts will stand modified  and	 the
impugned  orders  passed by the State authorities will	also
stand  set aside accordingly.  However, the present judgment
will  operate  purely prospectively and will not affect	 the
admissions  already granted by the concerned authorities  in
the  postgraduate medical courses prior to the date of	this
judgment.   In other words, the State authorities will	have
to comply with the directions contained in this judgment and
put  their  house in order for regulating the admissions  to
postgraduate  medical  courses starting hereinafter  in	 the
medical institutions concerned.

      Facts:
</p>
<p id="p_55">      The  State  of  Uttar Pradesh has	 prescribed  a	Post
Graduate  Medical Entrance Examination for admission to Post
Graduate  Degree/Diploma  courses in medicine.	This  is  in
conformity  with  the  relevant Regulations of	the  Medical
Council	 of  India.   By G.O.  dated 11.10.1994,  the  State
Government  fixed  a cut-off percentage of 45% marks in	 the
Post  Graduate	Medical	 Entrance  Examination	(PGMEE)	 for
admission  of  the general category candidates to  the	Post
Graduate  Courses  in  Medicine.  The cutoff  percentage  of
marks  for the reserved category candidates viz.   Scheduled
Castes,	  Scheduled   Tribes  etc.    was  fixed   at	35%.
Thereafter,  by	 another G.O.  dated 31.8.1995 the State  of
Uttar  Pradesh completely did away with a cut-off percentage
of  marks in respect of the reserved category candidates  so
that  there  were  no minimum qualifying marks in  the	Post
Graduate  Medical  Entrance Examination prescribed  for	 the
reserved  category candidates who were seeking admission  to
the Post Graduate Courses.
</p>
<p id="p_56">      This  G.O.   of 31.8.1995 was challenged	before	this

reserved  category  of candidates.  If this is	done,  merit
will  be sacrificed altogether.	 This Court struck down G.O.
dated 31.8.1995.
</p>
<p id="p_57">      After  the  said decision, the State of  U.P.   issued
another	 G.O.	dated  2.4.1997	  under	 which	the  cut-off
percentage of marks for the reserved category candidates was
restored  at  35%.   However, the State of  U.P.   moved  an
application  before this Court, being I.A.  No.2 of 1997 Dr.
Sadhna Devi (Supra) in which the State of U.P.	(inter alia)
prayed	that  it should be given the liberty to	 reduce	 the
cut-off percentage from 35% to 20% for the reserved category
candidates  who	 appear	 in  the PGMEE	for  1997.   Without
waiting for a decision, by an Ordinance dated 15.6.1997, the
State  of U.P.	reduced the minimum qualifying marks for the
reserved  category  candidates appearing in the	 PGMEE	1997
from  35%  to  20%.   This Ordinance is	 challenged  in	 the
present Writ Petition (C) No.300 of 1997.  The Ordinance has
now been replaced by the Uttar Pradesh Post Graduate Medical
Education  (Reservation	 for   Scheduled  Castes,  Scheduled
Tribes	 and  <a href="/doc/637725/" id="a_158">Other  Backward	Classes)  Act</a>,	1997.	 The
petitioners  have  now	amended the said  writ	petition  to
challenge this Act.
</p>
<p id="p_58">      For  admissions  effected in 1998, the State  of	U.P.
again  prescribed a cut-off percentage of 20% marks for	 the
reserved category candidates.  Learned counsel for the State
of  U.P.   has	further stated that for the  current  year's
admission,  i.e.  for admission to the P.G.M.E.E.  1999, the
State  has  introduced	a Bill in the  Legislative  Assembly
prescribing the same cut-off percentage of 20% marks for the
reserved category candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_59">      The  lower  percentage of qualifying marks  prescribed
for  the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and backward class
candidates are in conjunction with the following reservation
of seats at the PGMEE:
</p>
<p id="p_60">      Scheduled	 Castes	 :   21%, Scheduled  Tribes  :	 2%,
Backward  Classes :  27% In the State of Madhya Pradesh also
a  common entrance examination is held for admission to	 the
Post Graduate Courses in Medicine.  Under the Madhya Pradesh
Medical and Dental Post Graduate Entrance Examination Rules,
1997,  certain seats were reserved for the Scheduled  Caste,
Scheduled  Tribe, BC and in-service candidates.	 The  Rules,
however,  did not lay down any minimum qualifying marks	 for
admission  to  the  Post  Graduate Courses  either  for	 the
general category or for the reserved category of candidates.
These  Rules  were challenged by a writ petition before	 the
Madhya	Pradesh High Court.  By its judgment which is  under
challenge  in  these  proceedings, the Madhya  Pradesh	High
Court  directed	 the State Government to  stipulate  minimum
qualifying  marks  in  the  PGMEE   for	 all  categories  of
candidates,  including	the general category candidates,  in
view  of  the decision of this Court in Dr.   Sadhna  Devi's
case (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_61">      By  G.O.	 dated 7.6.1997 the State of Madhya  Pradesh
prescribed  the	 following minimum percentage of  qualifying
marks  for  the	 reserved category candidates to  make	them
eligible  for counselling and admission to the Post Graduate
Medical Courses:
</p>
<p id="p_62">      Scheduled	 Castes :  20% Scheduled Tribes :  15% Other
Backward Classes :  40%

      This  Government Order of the State of Madhya  Pradesh
is under challenge before us.
</p>
<p id="p_63">      We  have, therefore, to consider whether for admission
to  the Post Graduate Medical Courses, it is permissible  to
prescribe a lower minimum percentage of qualifying marks for
the  reserved category candidates as compared to the general
category  candidates.  We do not propose to examine  whether
reservations  are permissible at the Post Graduate level  in
medicine.   That  issue	 was not debated before us,  and  we
express	 no opinion on it.  We need to examine only  whether
any  special provision in the form of lower qualifying marks
in the PGMEE can be prescribed for the reserved category.
</p>
<p id="p_64">      The Constitutional Imperative:
</p>
<p id="p_65">      The  constitutional protection of equality before	 the
law under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_159">Article 14</a> of the Constitution is one of the basic
tenets	of  the Constitution.  It is a cardinal value  which
will  govern our policies and actions, particularly policies
for employment and education.  <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_160">Article 15(1)</a> prohibits State
discrimination	on  the ground (among others)  of  religion,
race  or  caste.   <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_161">Article   16(1)</a>  prescribes	equality  of
opportunity  for  all in matters relating to  employment  or
appointment  to	 any office under the State.  <a href="/doc/1011960/" id="a_162">Article  16(2)</a>
prohibits  discrimination  on the ground (among	 others)  of
religion,  race,  caste or descent.  At the same  time,	 the
Constitution permits preferential treatment for historically
disadvantaged  groups  in  the	context	 of  entrenched	 and
clearly	 perceived social inequalities.	 That is why <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_163">Article
16(4)</a> permits reservation of appointments or posts in favour
of any backward class which is not adequately represented in
the  services  under the State.	 Reservation is linked	with
adequate  representation  in the services.   Reservation  is
thus a dynamic and flexible concept.  The departure from the
principle  of  equality of opportunity has to be  constantly
watched.   So  long as the backward group is not  adequately
represented  in	 the services under the State,	reservations
should	be made.  Clearly, reservations have been considered
as  a  transitory measure that will enable the	backward  to
enter  and  be adequately represented in the State  services
against the backdrop of prejudice and social discrimination.
But  finally, as the social backdrop changes ?	and a change
in  the	 social	 backdrop  is	one  of	 the  constitutional
imperatives,  as  the backward are able to  secure  adequate
representation in the services, the reservations will not be
required.   <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_164">Article  335</a>  enters a  further  caveat.   While
considering  the  claims of Scheduled Castes  and  Scheduled
Tribes	for  appointments, the maintenance of efficiency  of
administration shall be kept in sight.
</p>
<p id="p_66">      <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_165">Article  15(4</a>),  which was added by  the	Constitution
First  Amendment of 1951, enables the State to make  special
provisions  for	 the advancement, inter alia,  of  Scheduled
Castes	and Scheduled Tribes, notwithstanding Articles 15(1)
and  29(2).  The wording of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_166">Article 15(4)</a> is similar to that
of  <a href="/doc/1603957/" id="a_167">Article 15(3).</a>  <a href="/doc/1603957/" id="a_168">Article 15(3)</a> was there from  inception.
It  enables  special  provisions being made  for  women	 and
children  notwithstanding  <a href="/doc/1942013/" id="a_169">Article 15(1)</a> which	imposes	 the
mandate	 of non- discrimination on the ground (among others)
of  sex.   This	 was  envisaged as a  method  of  protective
discrimination.	  This	same protective	 discrimination	 was
extended by <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_170">Article 15(4)</a> to (among others) Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes.  As a result of the combined operation
of these Articles, an array of programmes of compensatory or
protective  discrimination have been pursued by the  various
States	and  the  Union Government.  Marc Galanter,  in	 his
book,	 "Competing   Equalities"     has   described	 the
constitutional	scheme of compensatory discrimination  thus:
"These	 compensatory	 discrimination	   policies   entail
systematic departures from norms of equality (such as merit,
evenhandedness,	   and	   indifferences    of	  ascriptive
characteristics).  These departures are justified in several
ways:  First, preferential treatment may be viewed as needed
assurance  of  personal	 fairness, a guarantee	against	 the
persistence  of discrimination in subtle and indirect forms.
Second,	 such policies are justified in terms of  beneficial
results that they will presumably promote:  integration, use
of neglected talent, more equitable distribution, etc.	With
these  two  - the anti-discrimination theme and the  general
welfare	 theme	-  is  entwined	  a  notion  of	  historical
restitution  or	 reparation  to offset	the  systematic	 and
cumulative  deprivations  suffered  by lower castes  in	 the
past.	 These	 multiple  justifications   point   to	 the
complexities  of pursuing such a policy and of assessing its
performance." Since every such policy makes a departure from
the  equality norm, though in a permissible manner, for	 the
benefit of the backward, it has to be designed and worked in
a  manner  conducive  to  the ultimate	building  up  of  an
egalitarian  non-discriminating society.  That is its  final
constitutional	justification.	 Therefore,  programmes	 and
policies  of compensatory discrimination under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_171">Article 15(4)</a>
have  to  be designed and pursued to achieve  this  ultimate
national  interest.   At the same time, the  programmes	 and
policies  cannot be unreasonable or arbitrary, nor can	they
be  executed in a manner which undermines other vital public
interests  or the general good of all.	All public  polices,
therefore,  in	this area have to be tested on the anvil  of
reasonableness	and  ultimate public good.  In the  case  of
<a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_172">Article	 16(4)</a> the Constitution makers explicitly spelt	 out
in  <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_173">Article  335</a>  one  such  public  good  which  cannot  be
sacrificed,  namely, the necessity of maintaining efficiency
in  administration.   <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_174">Article 15(4)</a> also must be  used,	 and
policies   under   it  framed,	in   a	 reasonable   manner
consistently with the ultimate public interests.
</p>
<p id="p_67">      In  the  case  of <a href="/doc/599701/" id="a_175">M.R.  Balaji &amp; Ors.   v.   State  of
Mysore</a>	([1963]	 Suppl.	  1  SCR 439 at	 pages	466-467),  a
Constitution  Bench  of	 this  Court  considered  this	very
question  relating to the extent of special provisions which
it  would be competent for the State to make, under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_176">Article
15(4).</a>	 This  Court  accepted the submission  that  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_177">Article
15(4)</a> must be read in the light of <a href="/doc/352126/" id="a_178">Article 46</a> and that under
it,  the  educational and economic interests of	 the  weaker
sections  of  the  people  can	 be  promoted  properly	 and
liberally,  to establish social and economic equality.	 The
Court  said,  "No  one	can  dispute  the  proposition	that
political  freedom and even fundamental rights can have very
little	meaning or significance for the backward classes and
the  Scheduled	Castes	and   Scheduled	 Tribes	 unless	 the
backwardness  and  inequality  from which  they	 suffer	 are
immediately redressed".
</p>
<p id="p_68">      The  Court,  however, rejected the argument  that	 the
absence	 of  any limitation on the State's power to make  an
adequate  special  provision under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_179">Article  15(4)</a>  indicates
that  if  the  problem of backward classes of  citizens	 and
Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes in any given State is
of  such a magnitude that it requires the reservation of all
seats  in  the higher educational institutions, it would  be
open  to  the State to take that course.  This	Court  said:
"When <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_180">Article 15(4)</a> refers to the special provisions for the
advancement  of	 certain  classes  or  Scheduled  Castes  or
Scheduled  Tribes, it must not be ignored that the provision
which  is authorised to be made is a special provision;	  it
is  not a provision which is exclusive in character so that,
in  looking after the advancement of those classes the State
would be justified in ignoring altogether the advancement of
the rest of the society.  It is because the interests of the
society	  at  large  would  be	 served	 by  promoting	 the
advancement  of	 the  weaker elements in  the  society	that
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_181">Article	 15(4)</a> authorises special provision to be made.	 But
if  a  provision  which	 is in the nature  of  an  exception
completely excludes the rest of the society, that clearly is
outside	 the scope of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_182">Article 15(4).</a>  It would be  extremely
unreasonable  to  assume that in enacting <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_183">Article 15(4)</a>	 the
Parliament intended to provide that where the advancement of
the  Backward Classes or the Scheduled Castes and Tribes was
concerned,   the   fundamental	rights	 of   the   citizens
constituting  the rest of the society were to be  completely
and   absolutely   ignored."  This   Court  struck  down   a
reservation  of 68% made for backward classes for  admission
to  Medical and Engineering Courses in the university.	This
Court  further observed, (at page 407) "A special  provision
contemplated by <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_184">Article 15(4</a>), like reservation of posts and
appointments  contemplated by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_185">Article 16(4</a>), must be  within
reasonable  limits.   The  interest of	weaker	sections  of
society	 which	are  a first charge on the  States  and	 the
Centre	have  to  be  adjusted	with  the  interest  of	 the
community  as  a  whole".  The Court also  said	 that  while
considering  the reasonableness of the extent of reservation
one  could  not lose sight of the fact that  the  admissions
were   to  institutes  of   higher  learning  and   involved
professional  and  technical  colleges.	   "The	 demand	 for
technicians,  scientists, doctors, economists, engineers and
experts	 for the further economic advancement of the country
is  so great that it would cause grave prejudice to national
interests if considerations of merit are completely excluded
by  wholesale reservation of seats in all technical, medical
or engineering colleges or institutions of that kind." (Page
</p><p id="p_69">468)  Therefore, consideration of national interest and	 the
interests  of the community or society as a whole cannot  be
ignored	 in  determining  the reasonableness  of  a  special
provision under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_186">Article 15(4).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_70">      In the case of <a href="/doc/72560/" id="a_187">Dr.  Jagdish Saran &amp; Ors.	v.  Union of
India</a>  ([1980]	2 SCC 768), reservation of 70% of seats	 for
the  local  candidates	in admissions to the  Post  Graduate
Medical	 Courses by the Delhi University was struck down  by
this  Court.  While doing so, Krishna Iyer J.  speaking	 for
the  Court  spelt out the ambits of Articles 14 and 15.	  He
said,  (at  page  778)	"But  it  must	be  remembered	that
exceptions  cannot overrule the rule itself by running	riot
or  by	making reservations as a matter of course  in  every
university  and	 every	course.	 For  instance,	 you  cannot
wholly	exclude meritorious candidates as that will  promote
sub-standard  candidates  and bring about a fall in  medical
competence   injurious	in  the	 long	run  to	  the	very
region..........Nor  can  the  very best  be  rejected	from
admission  because  that  will be a national  loss  and	 the
interests  of  no  region can be higher than  those  of	 the
nation.	  So,  within these limitations without	 going	into
excesses  there	 is  room  for play of	the  State's  policy
choices."  He  further observed, "The first caution is	that
reservation  must  be  kept  in	 check	by  the	 demands  of
competence.   You  cannot extend the shelter of	 reservation
where minimum qualifications are absent.  Similarly, all the
best  talent  cannot  be completely  excluded  by  wholesale
reservation......A    fair    preference,    a	  reasonable
reservation,  a just adjustment of the prior needs and	real
potentials  of the weak with the partial recognition of	 the
presence  of  competitive  merit - such is  the	 dynamic  of
social justice which animates the three egalitarian articles
of the Constitution."
</p>
<p id="p_71">      "Flowing	from the same stream of equalism is  another
limitation.   The  basic  medical needs of a region  or	 the
preferential  push justified for a handicapped group  cannot
prevail	 in  the  same	measure at  the	 highest  scales  of
speciality where the best scale or talent must be handpicked
by  selecting  according  to capability.  At  the  level  of
P.H.D.,	  M.D.	 or  levels  of	 higher	 proficiency   where
international  measure	of talent is made, where losing	 one
great  scientist or technologist in the making is a national
loss, the considerations we have expended upon as important,
lose  their  potency,  where equality measured	by  matching
excellence  has	 more  meaning and cannot  be  diluted	much
without grave risk."
</p>
<p id="p_72">      The  same	 reasoning runs through <a href="/doc/434106/" id="a_188">Dr.  Pradeep Jain  &amp;
Ors.   v.   Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.  ([1984] 3 SCC  654).	  It
dealt  with  reservation of seats for the residents  of	 the
State  or the students of the same university for  admission
to  the	 medical  colleges.  The Court said, (at  page	676)
"Now,  the  concept of equality under the Constitution is  a
dynamic concept.  It takes within its sweep every process of
equalisation  and protective discrimination.  Equality	must
not  remain  mere  ideal indentation but it  must  become  a
living	reality	 for the large masses of  people............
It  is,	 therefore, necessary to take into account de  facto
inequalities  which  exist  in	the   society  and  to	take
affirmative  action  by	 way  of giving	 preference  to	 the
socially   and	 economically	disadvantaged	persons	  or
inflicting  handicaps on those more advantageously placed in
order  to  bring  about	 real  equality."  The	Court  after
considering  institutional  and residential preferences	 for
admission  to  the  M.B.S.S.  course,  said  that  different
considerations	 would	 prevail    in	 considering	such
reservations for admission to the Post Graduate Courses such
as  M.D., M.S.	and the like.  It said, (at page 691) "There
we  cannot  allow excellence to be compromised by any  other
considerations	because	 that  would be detrimental  to	 the
interest  of the nation." Quoting the observation of Justice
Krishna	 Iyer  in Dr.  Jagdish Saran case (supra) the  Court
said,  "This proposition has far greater importance when  we
reach  the  higher  levels of education like  Post  Graduate
Courses.   After  all,	top technological expertise  in	 any
vital  field like medicine is a nation's human asset without
which its advance and development will be stunted.  The role
of  high  grade skill or special talent may be less  at	 the
lesser	levels of education, jobs and disciplines of  social
inconsequence,	 but   more   at   the	higher	 levels	  of
sophisticated  skills and strategic employment.	 To  devalue
merit  at  the	summit is to temporise	with  the  country's
development  in the vital areas of professional	 expertise."
(underlining ours)

      A similar strand of thought runs through <a href="/doc/861069/" id="a_189">Indra Sawhney
&amp;  Ors.	  v.   Union of India &amp; Ors</a>.  ([1992]  Supp.(3)	 SCC
</p><p id="p_73">217),  where a Bench of nine Judges of this Court considered
the  nature,  amplitude	 and  scope  of	 the  constitutional
provisions  relating to reservations in the services of	 the
State.	 Jeevan	 Reddy	J.  speaking for  the  majority	 (in
paragraph  836)	 stated	 that the very idea  of	 reservation
implies selection of a less meritorious person.	 At the same
time, we recognise that this much cost has to be paid if the
constitutional	promise of social justice is to be redeemed.
We  also formally believe that given an opportunity, members
of  these  classes  are	 bound	to  overcome  their  initial
disadvantages  and  would  compete with ?  and may  in	some
cases  excel  ?	 members on open competition.	Having	said
this,  the Court went on to add, (in paragraph 838) "We	 are
of the opinion that there are certain services and positions
where either on account of nature of duties attached to them
or  the level (in the hierarchy) at which they obtain, merit
as  explained herein above alone counts.  In such situations
it  may	 not be advisable to provide for reservations.	 For
example,  technical  posts  in	 research  and	 development
organisations/departments/institutions,	 in specialities and
super-specialities  in medicine, engineering and other	such
courses	 in  physical  science and mathematics,	 in  defence
services  and  in the establishments  connected	 therewith."
(underlining ours)

      A	 similar  view	has been taken in  <a href="/doc/1047764/" id="a_190">Mohan  Bir  Singh
Chawla	v.  Punjab University, Chandigarh &amp; Anr</a>.  ([1997]  2
SCC  171)  where  this Court said that at higher  levels  of
education  it  would  be dangerous to depreciate  merit	 and
excellence.   The higher you go in the ladder of  education,
the lesser should be the reservation.  In Dr.  Sadhna Devi's
case  (supra)  also this Court has expressed a doubt  as  to
whether there can be reservations at the Post Graduate level
in Medicine.
</p>
<p id="p_74">      We  are,	however,  not directly	concerned  with	 the
question  of  reservations  at the Post	 Graduate  level  in
Medicine.   We are concerned with another special  provision
under  <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_191">Article	15(4)</a> made at the stage of admission to	 the
Post  Graduate Medical Courses, namely, providing for lesser
qualifying  marks or no qualifying marks for the members  of
the  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for admission  to
the  Post  Graduate Medical Courses.  Any special  provision
under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_192">Article 15(4)</a> has to balance the importance of having,
at  the	 higher	 levels	 of   education,  students  who	 are
meritorious  and who have secured admission on their  merit,
as  against the social equity of giving compensatory benefit
of  admission  to  the Scheduled Caste and  Scheduled  Tribe
candidates  who	 are in a disadvantaged position.  The	same
reasoning   which   propelled  this   Court   to   underline
reasonableness	of  a  special provision, and  the  national
interest  in  giving at the highest level of education,	 the
few  seats at the top of the educational pyramid only on the
basis  of merit and excellence, applies equally to a special
provision  in  the  form of lower qualifying marks  for	 the
backward at the highest levels of education.
</p>
<p id="p_75">      It  is  of  course,   important  to  provide  adequate
educational  opportunities  for	 all since it  is  education
which ultimately shapes life.  It is the source of that thin
stream	of  reason which alone can nurture a  nation's	full
potential.   Moreover,	in  a	democratic  society,  it  is
extremely  important that the population is literate and  is
able to acquire information that shapes its decisions.
</p>
<p id="p_76">      The  spread of primary education has to be wide enough
to  cover  all	sections of the society whether	 forward  or
backward.   A  large  percentage  of  reservations  for	 the
backward  would	 be  justified	at this	 level.	  These	 are
required  in  individual  as well as national  interest.   A
university level education upto graduation, also enables the
individual  concerned  to secure better employment.   It  is
permissible  and necessary at this level to have  reasonable
reservations  for the backward so that they may also be able
to  avail  of  these opportunities  for	 betterment  through
education,  to which they may not have access if the college
admissions  are	 entirely  by merit as judged by  the  marks
obtained  in  the qualifying examination.  At the  level  of
higher	post-graduate  university education, however,  apart
from  the individual self interest of the candidate, or	 the
national  interest  in promoting equality, a more  important
national  interest  comes  into play.	The  facilities	 for
training  or education at this level, by their very  nature,
are  not  available  in abundance.  It is essential  in	 the
national  interest  that these special facilities  are	made
available  to persons of high calibre possessing the highest
degree	of  merit  so  that   the  nation  can	shape  their
exceptional  talent  that is capable of contributing to	 the
progress of human knowledge, creation and utilisation of new
medical,  technical  or	 other	 techniques,  extending	 the
frontiers  of  knowledge  through research work	 -  in	fact
everything  that gives to a nation excellence and ability to
compete	 internationally  in   professional,  technical	 and
research fields.
</p>
<p id="p_77">      This  Court  has repeatedly said that at the level  of
superspecialisation  there cannot be any reservation because
any  dilution of merit at this level would adversely  affect
the  national goal of having the best possible people at the
highest levels of professional and educational training.  At
the  level of a super speciality, something more than a mere
professional   competence  as  a   doctor  is  required.   A
super-specialist acquires expert knowledge in his speciality
and  is expected to possess exceptional competence and skill
in  his	 chosen	 field, where he may even make	an  original
contribution in the form of new innovative techniques or new
knowledge  to fight diseases.  It is in public interest that
we  promote  these skills.  Such high degrees of  skill	 and
expert	knowledge  in  highly  specialised  areas,  however,
cannot	be  acquired  by anyone or everyone.   For  example,
specialised sophisticated knowledge and skill and ability to
make   right  choices  of   treatment  in  critical  medical
conditions and even ability to innovate and device new lines
of treatment in critical situations, requires high levels of
intelligent understanding of medial knowledge or skill and a
high  ability  to learn from technical literature  and	from
experience.   These  high  abilities are also  required	 for
absorbing  highly  specialised	knowledge   which  is  being
imparted at this level.	 It is for this reason that it would
be detrimental to the national interest to have reservations
at  this stage.	 Opportunities for such training are few and
it is in the national interest that these are made available
to  those  who can profit from them the most viz.  the	best
brains	in  the country, irrespective of the class to  which
they belong.
</p>
<p id="p_78">      At  the next below stage of post-graduate education in
medical	 specialities,	similar considerations also  prevail
though perhaps to a slightly lesser extent than in the super
specialities.	But the element of public interest in having
the  most meritorious students at this level of education is
present	 even at the stage of post-graduate teaching.  Those
who  have  specialised	medical knowledge  in  their  chosen
branch	are  able  to  treat better  and  more	effectively,
patients  who  are  sent to them for  expert  diagnosis	 and
treatment  in  their specialised field.	 For a	student	 who
enrols for such speciality courses, an ability to assimilate
and acquire special knowledge is required.  Not everyone has
this  ability.	Of course intelligence and abilities do	 not
know  any frontiers of caste or class or race or sex.	They
can  be	 found	anywhere, but not in  everyone.	  Therefore,
selection  of the right calibre of students is essential  in
public	interest  at the level of specialised  post-graduate
education.   In	 view  of this supervening  public  interest
which  has  to	be  balanced against the  social  equity  of
providing  some	 opportunities to the backward who  are	 not
able  to qualify on the basis of marks obtained by them	 for
post-graduate learning, it is for an expert body such as the
Medical	 Council  of  India,  to  lay  down  the  extent  of
reservations,  if any, and the lowering of qualifying marks,
if  any,  consistent  with the broader	public	interest  in
having	the most competent people for specialised  training,
and the competing public interest in securing social justice
and  equality.	 The decision may perhaps, depend  upon	 the
expert	body's	assessment of the potential of the  reserved
category candidates at a certain level of minimum qualifying
marks and whether those who secure admission on the basis of
such  marks to post-graduate courses, can be expected to  be
trained	 in  two or three years to come up to the  standards
expected of those with post-graduate qualifications.

<p id="p_79">      The  speciality  and  super   speciality	courses	  in
medicine  also	entail	on-hand experience  of	treating  or
operating  on  patients in the attached teaching  hospitals.
Those  undergoing  these programmes are expected  to  occupy
posts in the teaching hospitals or discharge duties attached
to  such  posts.   The elements of <a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_193">Article  335</a>,  therefore,
colour the selection of candidates for these courses and the
Rules framed for this purpose.
</p>
<p id="p_80">      In  the  premises	 the special  provisions  for  SC/ST
candidates  whether reservations or lower qualifying marks -
at  the speciality level have to be minimal.  There  cannot,
however,  be  any  such special provisions at the  level  of
super specialities.
</p>
<p id="p_81">      Entrance	Examination  for post-graduate	courses	 and
qualifying marks:
</p>
<p id="p_82">      When  a  common  entrance	  examination  is  held	 for
admission  to postgraduate medical courses, it is  important
that   passing	marks  or   minimum  qualifying	 marks	 are
prescribed  for the examination.  It was, however, contended
before	us  by	learned counsel appearing for the  State  of
Madhya	Pradesh	 that  there  is no need  to  prescribe	 any
minimum qualifying marks in the common entrance examination.
Because	 all  the  candidates  who  appear  for	 the  common
entrance  examination have passed the M.B.B.S.	 examination
which  is  an  essential   pre-requisite  for  admission  to
postgraduate  medical  courses.	  The PGMEE  is	 merely	 for
screening the eligible candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_83">      This  argument ignores the reasons underlying the need
for  a common entrance examination for post-graduate medical
courses	 in a State.  There may be several universities in a
State which conduct M.B.B.S.  courses.	The courses of study
may  not  be  uniform.	The quality of teaching may  not  be
uniform.   The	standard  of   assessment  at  the  M.B.B.S.
examination  also  may	not  be	 uniform  in  the  different
universities.	With  the result that in some of the  better
universities  which  apply more strict tests for  evaluating
the   performance   of	students,  a  higher   standard	  of
performance is required for getting the passing marks in the
M.B.B.S.   examination.	  Similarly,  a higher	standard  of
performance may be required for getting higher marks than in
other  universities.   Some  universities   may	 assess	 the
students  liberally with the result that the candidates with
lesser	knowledge may be able to secure passing marks in the
M.B.B.S.   examination;	  while	 it may also be	 easier	 for
candidates  to	secure marks at the higher level.  A  common
entrance   examination,	  therefore,   provides	 a   uniform
criterion  for judging the merit of all candidates who	come
from  different	 universities.	 Obviously, as soon  as	 one
concedes  that there can be differing standards of  teaching
and  evaluation	 in different universities, one cannot	rule
out  the possibility that the candidates who have passed the
M.B.B.S.   examination from a university which is liberal in
evaluating  its	 students,  would   not,  necessarily,	have
passed,	 had  they appeared in an examination where  a	more
strict	evaluation is made.  Similarly, candidates who	have
obtained  very high marks in the M.B.B.S.  examination where
evaluation  is liberal, would have got lesser marks had they
appeared  for the examination of a university where stricter
standards  were	 applied.  Therefore, the purpose of such  a
common	 entrance  examination	is   not  merely  to   grade
candidates  for selection.  The purpose is also to  evaluate
all  candidates by a common yardstick.	One must, therefore,
also  take  into  account the possibility that some  of	 the
candidates  who	 may have passed the  M.B.B.S.	 examination
from  more  "generous" universities, may not qualify at	 the
entrance examination where a better and uniform standard for
judging	 all  the candidates from different universities  is
applied.   In the interest of selecting suitable  candidates
for  specialised education, it is necessary that the  common
entrance examination is of a certain standard and qualifying
marks  are  prescribed for passing that	 examination.	This
alone	will  balance  the   competing	equities  of  having
competent students for specialised education and the need to
provide	 for some room for the backward even at the stage of
specialised  post-graduate education which is one step below
the super specialities.
</p>
<p id="p_84">      The  submission, therefore, that there need not be any
qualifying   marks  prescribed	for   the  common   entrance
examination  has  to  be  rejected.  We	 have,	however,  to
consider   whether  different  qualifying   marks   can	  be
prescribed for the open merit category of candidates and the
reserved category of candidates.  Normally passing marks for
any  examination  have to be uniform for all  categories  of
candidates.   We are, however, informed that at the stage of
admission  to  the  M.B.B.S.  course, that is  to  say,	 the
initial course in medicine, the Medical Council of India has
permitted the reserved category candidates to be admitted if
they  have  obtained the qualifying marks of 35% as  against
the  qualifying	 marks	of  45%	 for  the  general  category
candidates.   It is, therefore, basically for an expert body
like  the  Medical Council of India to determine whether  in
the   common  entrance	examination   viz.    PGMEE,   lower
qualifying marks can be prescribed for the reserved category
of candidates as against the general category of candidates;
and  if so, how much lower.  There cannot, however, be a big
disparity  in the qualifying marks for the reserved category
of  candidates and the general category of candidates at the
post-graduate  level.  This level is only one step below the
apex  level  of	 medical  training and	education  where  no
reservations  are permissible and selections are entirely on
merit.	 At only one step below this level the disparity  in
qualifying  marks,  if the expert body permits it,  must  be
minimal.   It  must be kept at a level where it is  possible
for the reserved category candidates to come up to a certain
level  of excellence when they qualify in the speciality  of
their  choice.	It is in public interest that they have this
level of excellence.
</p>
<p id="p_85">      In the present case, the disparity of qualifying marks
being  20% for the reserved category and 45% for the general
category is too great a disparity to sustain public interest
at   the  level	 of   post-graduate  medical  training	 and
education.  Even for the M.B.B.S.  course, the difference in
the  qualifying marks between the reserved category and	 the
general	 category is smaller, 35% for the reserved  category
and  45%  for  the  general category.  We see  no  logic  or
rationale   for	 the  difference  to   be  larger   at	 the
post-graduate level.
</p>
<p id="p_86">      Standard of Education:
</p>
<p id="p_87">      A	 large	differentiation	 in   the  qualifying  marks
between	 the  two  groups  of students would  make  it	very
difficult to maintain the requisite standard of teaching and
training  at  the  post-graduate level.	 Any  good  teaching
institution  has  to  take into account the calibre  of	 its
students and their existing level of knowledge and skills if
it is to teach effectively any higher courses.	If there are
a  number  of students who have noticeably lower skills	 and
knowledge,  standard  of  education will have to  be  either
lowered	 to reach these students, or these students will not
be  able  to  benefit from or assimilate  higher  levels  of
teaching,  resulting in frustration and failures.  It  would
also  result  in a wastage of opportunities for	 specialised
training  and  knowledge  which are by	their  very  nature,
limited.
</p>
<p id="p_88">      It  is,  therefore, wrong to say that the standard  of
education  is  not affected by admitting students  with	 low
qualifying  marks,  or	that the standard  of  education  is
affected  only	by those factors which come into play  after
the  students are admitted.  Nor will passing a common final
examination  guarantee a good standard of knowledge.   There
is a great deal of difference in the knowledge and skills of
those  passing	with  a high percentage of marks  and  those
passing	 with  a  low  percentage of  marks.   The  reserved
category  of  students who are chosen for higher  levels  of
university  education  must be in a position to benefit	 and
improve	 their skills and knowledge and bring it to a  level
comparable  with the general group, so that when they emerge
with specialised knowledge and qualifications, they are able
to  function efficiently in public interest.  Providing	 for
20%  marks as qualifying marks for the reserved category  of
candidates  and	 45%  marks  for  the  general	category  of
candidates, therefore, is contrary to the mandate of <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_194">Article
15(4).</a>	 It is for the Medical Council of India to prescribe
any  special  qualifying  marks	 for the  admission  of	 the
reserved  category  candidates to the post-graduate  medical
courses.   However,  the difference in the qualifying  marks
should	be  at	least  the  same as  for  admission  to	 the
under-graduate medical courses, if not less.
</p>
<p id="p_89">      Learned  senior counsel Mr.  Bhaskar P.  Gupta for the
intervenors  drew our attention to an interesting study done
by  R.C.  Davidson in relation to the affirmative action and
other  special consideration admissions at the University of
California, Davis, School of Medicine.	The study graded the
students  who  were admitted on a scale (MCAC) with a  range
from  1	 to  15.  On this scale, the students  who  received
special consideration admission had an average score of nine
while  the  students who were admitted on open merit had  an
average	 of  11.  However, when both these groups  graduated
from  medical  school  both the groups had a  high  rate  of
successful  graduation	though	the   general  group  had  a
statistically  significant  higher rate.  The special  group
had  a graduation rate of 94% while the general group had  a
graduation  rate  of  98%.  The study also  found  that	 the
differences  in	 the  abilities	  of  special  consideration
students  were more evident in the first and second years of
the curriculum.	 In the third year also the differences were
visible.   However,  the  two groups had begun to  merge  in
their  achievements;  and ultimately by the time the  groups
qualified  in the final examination, there was a convergence
of  academic  progress	between	 the  special  consideration
admission  students  and the regularly admitted students  as
the  process  of training lengthened.  A similar study	does
not  appear to have been made in our country relating to the
progress  of the reserved category candidates in the  course
of  their studies.  But two things are evident even from the
study  made by Davidson.  The longer the period of training,
the  greater  the chances of convergence of the two  groups.
Secondly,  both the groups had an initial high score -	more
than  halfway up the scale.  Also, the initial difference in
their scores was not very large.  It was nine as compared to
eleven on a scale of fifteen.  Therefore, at a high level of
scoring,  the  narrower	 the  difference,  the	greater	 the
chances	 of  convergence.  This study, therefore,  will	 not
help  the  respondents	in the present case because  of	 the
substantial difference in the qualifying marks for admission
prescribed  for the reserved category candidates as  against
the  general category candidates;  and the very low level of
qualifying  marks prescribed.  Thirdly, at the post-graduate
level  the  course of studies is relatively shorter and	 the
course is designed to give high quality speciality education
to  the	 qualified doctors to enable them to excel in  their
chosen	field  of speciality.  Therefore, unless there is  a
proper	control at the stage of admission, on the  different
categories  of the students who are admitted, and unless the
differences are kept to a minimum, such differences will not
disappear  in the course of time if the course of study is a
specialised course such as a post-graduate course.
</p>
<p id="p_90">      Who  should  decide the qualifying marks and  will  it
affect the standard of education:
</p>
<p id="p_91">      Learned  counsel	for the States of Uttar Pradesh	 and
Madhya	Pradesh contend that it is for the States to  decide
the  qualifying	 marks	which should be prescribed  for	 the
reserved  category candidates at the PGMEE.  It is a  matter
of  state policy.  The Medical Council of India cannot	have
any  say in prescribing the qualifying marks for the  PGMEE.
The  two  States have contended that it is the	State  which
controls   admissions  to  the	 post-graduate	courses	  in
medicine.   It is for the State to decide whether to provide
a  common entrance examination or not.	This examination may
or  may not have any minimum qualifying marks or it may have
different  qualifying  marks  for  different  categories  of
candidates.   It  is,  therefore,  not	open  to  any  other
authority  to interfere with the rules for admission to	 the
post-graduate medical courses in each State.  They have also
contended  that a common entrance examination is merely	 for
the  purpose  of  screening  candidates and  since  all	 the
candidates  have  passed  the	M.B.B.S.   examination	 the
standard  is  not  affected  even if no	 minimum  marks	 are
prescribed for passing the common entrance examination.	 The
latter argument we have already examined and negatived.	 The
other  contention,  however,  relating to the power  of	 the
State  to control admissions to the post-graduate courses in
medicine requires to be examined.
</p>
<p id="p_92">      The  legislative competence of the Parliament and	 the
legislatures of the States to make laws under <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_195">Article 246</a> is
regulated by the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution.  In the
VIIth  Schedule as originally in force, Entry 11 of  List-II
gave  to  the  States  an exclusive power  to  legislate  on
"Education  including universities subject to the provisions
of  Entries  63,  64, 65 and 66 of List-I and  Entry  25  of
List-III."  Entry 11 of List-II was deleted and Entry 25  of
List-III  was amended with effect from 3.1.1976 as a  result
of the Constitution 42nd <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_196">Amendment Act</a> of 1976.	 The present
Entry 25 in the Concurrent List is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_93">      "Entry  25, List III:  Education, including  technical
education,  medical  education and universities, subject  to
the  provisions	 of  entries 63, 64, 65 and 66	of  List  I:
vocational and technical training of labour."
</p>

<p id="p_94">      Entry  25	 is  subject,  inter alia, to  Entry  66  of
List-I.	 Entry 66 of List-I is as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_95">      "Entry 66, List I:  Co-ordination and determination of
standards  in institutions for higher education or  research
and scientific and technical institutions."
</p>

<p id="p_96">      Both the Union as well as the States have the power to
legislate on education including medical education, subject,
inter  alia,  to Entry 66 of List-I which deals with  laying
down  standards	 in  institutions for  higher  education  or
research  and scientific and technical institutions as	also
co-ordination  of  such standards.  A State has,  therefore,
the  right to control education including medical  education
so  long  as  the  field  is   not  occupied  by  any  Union
Legislation.   Secondly, the State cannot, while controlling
education in the State, impinge on standards in institutions
for  higher  education.	 Because this is exclusively  within
the  purview  of  the Union  Government.   Therefore,  while
prescribing  the criteria for admission to the	institutions
for higher education including higher medical education, the
State cannot adversely affect the standards laid down by the
Union  of  India under Entry 66 of List-I.  Secondly,  while
considering the cases on the subject it is also necessary to
remember  that	from 1977 education including,	inter  alia,
medical	 and university education, is now in the  Concurrent
List  so that the Union can legislate on admission  criteria
also.	If  it	does  so,  the State will  not	be  able  to
legislate in this field, except as provided in <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_197">Article 254.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_97">      It  would	 not  be correct to say that the  norms	 for
admission have no connection with the standard of education,
or that the rules for admission are covered only by Entry 25
of List III.  Norms of admission can have a direct impact on
the  standards of education.  Of course, there can be  rules
for  admission	which are consistent with or do	 not  affect
adversely the standards of education prescribed by the Union
in  exercise  of  powers  under Entry  66  of  List-I.	 For
example,  a  State may, for admission to  the  post-graduate
medical	 courses,  lay	down qualifications in	addition  to
those  prescribed  under Entry 66 of List-I.  This would  be
consistent  with promoting higher standards for admission to
the  higher  educational courses.  But any lowering  of	 the
norms  laid  down can, and do have an adverse effect on	 the
standards   of	education  in	the  institutes	 of   higher
education.   Standards	of  education in an  institution  or
college depend on various factors.  Some of these are:
</p>
<p id="p_98">      (1)  The calibre of the teaching staff;  (2) A  proper
syllabus  designed  to achieve a high level of education  in
the given span of time;	 (3) The student-teacher ratio;	 (4)
The  ratio  between  the  students  and	 the  hospital	beds
available  to each student;  (5) The calibre of the students
admitted  to the institution;  (6) Equipment and  laboratory
facilities,  or hospital facilities for training in the case
of  medical  colleges;	(7) Adequate accommodation  for	 the
college	 and the attached hospital;  and (8) The standard of
examinations  held including the manner in which the  papers
are set and examined and the clinical performance is judged.
</p>
<p id="p_99">      While  considering  the standards of education in	 any
college	 or  institution,  the calibre of students  who	 are
admitted  to that institution or college cannot be  ignored.
If  the students are of a high calibre, training  programmes
can be suitably moulded so that they can receive the maximum
benefit	 out of a high level of teaching.  If the calibre of
the  students  is  poor	 or they are unable  to	 follow	 the
instructions  being  imparted,	the   standard	of  teaching
necessarily  has  to be lowered to make them understand	 the
course	which  they  have  undertaken;	and it	may  not  be
possible to reach the levels of education and training which
can  be attained with a bright group.  Education involves  a
continuous   interaction  between  the	 teachers  and	 the
students.  The pace of teaching, the level to which teaching
can  rise  and	the benefit which  the	students  ultimately
receive, depend as much on the calibre of the students as on
the calibre of the teachers and the availability of adequate
infrastructural	  facilities.	 That  is    why   a   lower
student-teacher	 ratio has been considered essential at	 the
levels of higher university education, particularly when the
training  to  be  imparted is highly  professional  training
requiring  individual attention and on-hand training to	 the
pupils who are already doctors and who are expected to treat
patients in the course of doing their post-graduate courses.

<p id="p_100">      The respondents rely upon some observations in some of
the  judgments of this Court in support of their stand	that
it  is	for  the State to lay down the rules and  norms	 for
admission;   and  that these do not have any bearing on	 the
standard of education.	<a href="/doc/1342109/" id="a_198">In P.  Rajendran v.  State of Madras
&amp;  Ors</a>.	  ([1968] 2 SCR 786), a Constitution Bench  of	this
Court  considered the validity under Articles 14 and  15(1),
of district- wise reservations made for seats in the medical
colleges.   In	that  case, the Act in	question  prescribed
eligibility  and qualifications of candidates for  admission
to  the	 medical colleges.  The Court observed, "So  far  as
admission  is concerned, it has to be made by those who	 are
in  control of the colleges - in this case, the	 Government.
Because	 the  medical  colleges	  are  Government   colleges
affiliated  to the university.	In these circumstances,	 the
Government  was	 entitled  to frame rules for  admission  to
medical	 colleges controlled by it, subject to the rules  of
the  university as to eligibility and qualifications.	This
was  what  was	done  in these	cases  and,  therefore,	 the
selection cannot be challenged on the ground that it was not
in  accordance with the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_199">University Act</a> and the rules  framed
thereunder."  This  Court, therefore, upheld the  additional
criteria  framed  by the State for admission which were	 not
inconsistent  with the norms for admission laid down by	 the
<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_200">University  Act</a>.  Since these additional qualifications	 did
not diminish the eligibility norms under the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_201">University Act</a>,
this  Court upheld the additional criteria laid down by	 the
state  as  not	affecting  the standards laid  down  by	 the
<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_202">University Act</a>.	 The question of diluting the standards laid
down, did not arise.
</p>
<p id="p_101">      The  respondents have emphasised the observation	that
admission  has to be made by those who are in control of the
colleges.   But, the question is, on what basis?  Admissions
must  be  made	on  a basis which  is  consistent  with	 the
standards laid down by a statute or regulation framed by the
Central Government in the exercise of its powers under Entry
66,  List I.  At times, in some of the judgments, the  words
"eligibility"	and   "qualification"	  have	 been	used
interchangeably,  and  in some cases a distinction has	been
made  between  the two words ?	"eligibility" connoting	 the
minimum	 criteria for selection that may be laid down by the
<a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_203">University    Act</a>   or	  any	 Central   Statute,    while
"qualifications" connoting the additional norms laid down by
the  colleges  or by the State.	 In every case	the  minimum
standards  as laid down by the Central Statute or under	 it,
have  to  be  complied	with  by  the  State  while   making
admissions.   It may, in addition, lay down other additional
norms  for admission or regulate admissions in the  exercise
of  its	 powers	 under	Entry 25 List III in  a	 manner	 not
inconsistent  with or in a manner which does not dilute	 the
criteria so laid down.

considered  the	 validity  of  a  test	held  by  the  State
Government for admission to medical colleges in the State of
Andhra	Pradesh.  The Andhra University Act, 1926 prescribed
the  minimum qualification of passing HSC, PUC, I.S.C.	etc.
examinations  for entry into a higher course of study.	 <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_208">The
Act</a>,  however, did not make it incumbent upon the Government

the  seats for the MBBS course were limited, the Government,
which  ran  the	 medical  colleges, had a right	 to  make  a
selection  out	of  the large number of candidates  who	 had
passed	the HSC, PUC or other prescribed examinations.	 For
this  purpose  the State Government prescribed	an  entrance
test  of its own and also prescribed a minimum 50% of  marks
at  the	 qualifying examination of HSC, ISC, PUC  etc.	 for
eligibility  to appear at the entrance test.  The Court said
that   merely  because	the   Government  supplemented	 the
eligibility  rules  by a written test in the  subjects	with
which  the  candidates	were  already  familiar,  there	 was
nothing	 unfair	 in the test prescribed.  Nor did  the	test
militate  against the powers of Parliament under Entry 66 of

test  prescribed  by the Government or by a  university	 for
selection  of  students from out of a large number  applying
for admission to a particular course of study.
</p>
<p id="p_104">      Therefore,  this	Court considered the  entrance	test
held  by the State in that case as not violating Entry 66 of
List-I	because	 the  statutory	 provisions  of	 the  Andhra
University  Act were also complied with and the test was not
inconsistent  with those provisions.  Secondly, in that case
the Court viewed the test as not in substitution of the HSC,
PUC,  ISC or other such examination, but in addition to	 it,
for  the  purpose  of proper selection from out of  a  large
number of students who had applied.
</p>
<p id="p_105">      This latter observation is relied upon by the State of
Madhya	Pradesh	 in  support  of  its  contention  that	 the
additional  test  which the State may prescribe is only	 for
better	selection.   Therefore, it is not necessary  to	 lay
down  minimum qualifying marks in the additional test.	Lavu
Narendranath  (supra), however, does not lay down that it is
permissible  not  to  have minimum qualifying marks  in	 the
entrance test prescribed by the State;	nor does it lay down
that  every test prescribed by the State must necessarily be
viewed	as  only  for the screening of candidates.   On	 the
facts  before  it,  the	 Court viewed the  test	 as  only  a
screening  test	 for proper selection from amongst  a  large
number of candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_106">      On  the  facts  before  us, the PGMEE is	not  just  a
screening   test.   Candidates	who   have  qualified	from
different   universities  and  in   courses  which  are	 not
necessarily  identical, have to be assessed on the basis  of
their  relative	 merit	for the purpose of  admission  to  a
post-graduate  course.	 It  is	 for  proper  assessment  of
relative  merit	 of  candidates	 who  have  taken  different
examinations from different universities in the State that a
uniform	  entrance   test  is	prescribed.   Such  a	test
necessarily partakes of the character of an eligibility test
as  also  a  screening test.  In such a	 situation,  minimum
qualifying  marks  are necessary.  The question	 of  minimum
qualifying   marks  is	not  addressed	 at  all   in	Levu
Narendranath (supra) since it did not arise in that case.
</p>
<p id="p_107">      <a href="/doc/168778115/" id="a_209">In  Dr.  Ambesh Kumar v.	Principal, L.L.R.M.  Medical
College,  Meerut and Ors</a>.  ([1986] Supp.  SCC 543), a  State
order  prescribed  55%	as minimum marks  for  admission  to
post-graduate  medical	courses.  The Court  considered	 the
question  whether  the	State can impose  qualifications  in
addition  to those laid down by the Medical Council of India
and  the Regulations framed by the Central Government.	 The
Court  said  that any additional or  further  qualifications
which  the State may lay down would not be contrary to Entry
66  of	List-I	since additional qualifications are  not  in
conflict  with	the Central Regulations but are designed  to
further	 the objective of the Central Regulation which is to
promote	 proper	 standards.  The Court said, (at  page	552)
"The  State  Government	 by   laying  down  the	 eligibility
qualification,	namely,	 the  obtaining of  certain  minimum
marks in the M.B.B.S.  examination by the candidates has not
in  any	 way encroached upon the Regulations made under	 the
<a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_210">Indian	Medical Council Act</a> nor does it infringe the central
power  provided	 in  the Entry 66 of List-I of	the  Seventh
Schedule  to the Constitution.	The order merely provides an
additional   eligibility  qualification."   None  of   these
judgments  lays	 down that any reduction in the	 eligibility
criteria would not impinge on the standards covered by Entry
66  of	List-I.	 All these judgments dealt  with  additional
qualifications	?   qualifications in addition to  what	 was
prescribed by the Central Regulations or Statutes.
</p>
<p id="p_108">      There   are,  however,  two   cases  where  there	 are
observations  to the contrary.	One is the case of the <a href="/doc/842859/" id="a_211">State
of  Madhya  Pradesh &amp; Anr.  v.	Kumari Nivedita Jain &amp;	Ors</a>.
([1981]	 4 SCC 296), a judgment of a Bench of three  judges.
In  this case the Court dealt with admission to the M.B.B.S.
course	in  the	 medical  colleges of the  State  of  Madhya
Pradesh.   The	Rules  framed by the State  provided  for  a
minimum	 of 50% as qualifying marks for the general category
students for admission to the medical colleges of the State.
But  for  the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes	 the
minimum	 qualifying marks were prescribed as 40%.  Later on,
the  minimum  qualifying marks for the Scheduled Castes	 and
the Scheduled Tribes were reduced to 0.	 The Court observed,
(paragraph  17) "That it was not in dispute and it could not
be  disputed that the order in question was in conflict with
the  provisions contained in Regulation 2 of the Regulations
framed	by  the	 Indian Medical Council." But it  held	that
Entry  66  of  List-I would not apply to  the  selection  of
candidates  for	 admission to the medical  colleges  because
standards  would  come in after the students were  admitted.
The Court also held that Regulation 2 of the Regulations for
admission  to  MBBS  courses framed by	the  Indian  Medical
Council,  was only recommendatory.  Hence any relaxation  in
the  rules  of	selection made by the State  Government	 was
permissible.	We  will  examine   the	 character  of	 the
Regulations  framed by the Medical Council of India a little
later.	 But  we cannot agree with the observations made  in
that judgment to the effect that the process of selection of
candidates  for	 admission to a medical college has no	real
impact	on  the standard of medical education;	or that	 the
standard  of medical education really comes into the picture
only  in  the course of studies in the medical	colleges  or
institutions   after   the  selection	and   admission	  of
candidates.   For  reasons which we have explained  earlier,
the  criteria  for  the	 selection  of	candidates  have  an
important  bearing on the standard of education which can be
effectively  imparted  in the medical colleges.	  We  cannot
agree  with  the  proposition that  prescribing	 no  minimum
qualifying  marks for admission for the Scheduled Castes and
the  Scheduled	Tribes	would  not have	 an  impact  on	 the
standard  of education in the medical colleges.	 Of  course,
once  the  minimum standards are laid down by the  authority
having	the power to do so, any further qualifications	laid
down by the State which will lead to the selection of better
students  cannot  be  challenged on the ground	that  it  is
contrary  to  what  has	 been laid  down  by  the  authority
concerned.   But the action of the State is valid because it
does  not  adversely impinge on the standards prescribed  by
the  appropriate  authority.   Although	  this	judgment  is
referred  to  in  the Constitution Bench judgment  of  <a href="/doc/861069/" id="a_212">Indra
Sawhney	 &amp;  Ors.   v.  Union of India &amp;	 Ors</a>.	(supra)	 the
question  of  standards	 being	lowered	  at  the  stage  of
post-graduate  medical	admissions was not before the  court
for consideration.  The court merely said that since <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_213">Article
16</a> was not applicable to the facts in Kumari Nivedita Jain's
case  (supra),	<a href="/doc/1113850/" id="a_214">Article 335</a> was not considered there.	Fort
post-  graduate medical education, where the "students"	 are
required  to discharge duties as doctors in hospitals,	some
of  the considerations underlying Articles 16 and 335  would
be  relevant  as  hereinafter set out.	But that  apart,  it
cannot	be  said  that	the judgment  in  Nivedita  Jain  is
approved  in  all its aspects by <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_215">Indra Sawhney v.  Union  of
India</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_109">      The other case where a contrary view has been taken is
<a href="/doc/104556519/" id="a_216">Ajay  Kumar Singh &amp; Ors.  v.  State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.  ([1994]
4  SCC	401)  decided by a Bench of three Judges.   It	also
held,  following Kumari Nivedita Jain &amp; Ors.(supra) (at page
</p><p id="p_110">417) that "Entry 66 in List-I does not take in the selection
of  candidates	or regulation of admission to institutes  of
higher	education.  Because standards come into the  picture
after  admissions  are	made." For reasons stated  above  we
disagree with these findings.
</p>
<p id="p_111">      In this connection, our attention is also drawn to the
emphasis  placed  in some of the judgments on the fact	that
since all the candidates finally appear and pass in the same
examination, standards are maintained.	Therefore, rules for
admission  do  not have any bearing on standards.   <a href="/doc/104556519/" id="a_217">In	Ajay
Kumar  Singh &amp; Ors.  v.	 State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.	(supra) this
Court,	relying	 on Kumari Nivedita Jain (supra), said	that
everybody  has to take the same post-graduate examination to
qualify	  for  a  post-graduate	  degree.   Therefore,	 the
guarantee  of  quality	lies in everybody passing  the	same
final  examination.   The quality is guaranteed at the	exit
stage.	 Therefore, at the admission stage, even if students
of  lower  merit  are  admitted, this  will  not  cause	 any
detriment  to the standards.  There are similar observations
in  <a href="/doc/1526293/" id="a_218">Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education &amp; Research,
Chandigarh  &amp;  Ors.  v.	 K.L.  Narasimhan &amp;  Anr</a>.   (supra).
This  reasoning cannot be accepted.  The final pass marks in
an  examination	 indicate that the candidate  possesses	 the
minimum	 requisite knowledge for passing the examination.  A
pass  mark  is	not a guarantee of excellence.	There  is  a
great deal of difference between a person who qualifies with
the  minimum  passing marks and a person who qualifies	with
high  marks.   If  excellence  is to be	 promoted  at  post-
graduate levels, the candidates qualifying should be able to
secure	good marks while qualifying.  It may be that if	 the
final  examination standard itself is high, even a candidate
with   pass   marks  would   have  a  reasonable   standard.
Basically,   there  is	no   single  test  for	 determining
standards.   It	 is  the result of a sum total	of  all	 the
inputs	- calibre of students, calibre of teachers, teaching
facilities,  hospital  facilities, standard of	examinations
etc.   that will guarantee proper standards at the stage  of
exit.	We,  therefore,	 disagree  with	 the  reasoning	 and
conclusion  in Ajay Kumar Singh &amp; Ors.	v.  Stage of Bihar &amp;
Ors.   (supra)	and  <a href="/doc/1526293/" id="a_219">Post   Graduate  Institute	 of  Medical
Education   &amp;	Research,  Chandigarh  &amp;  Ors.	  v.	K.L.

medical	 education,  the facilities to be provided  and	 the
standards  to be maintained.  After setting out the  various
courses,   both	  degree   and	  diploma,   available	 for
post-graduate  medical	education, the	Regulations  contain
certain	 general provisions/conditions some of which need to
be noted.  Condition 4 deals with the student-teacher ratio.
It says:
</p>
<p id="p_123">      "The  student-teacher  ratio should be such  that	 the
number	 of   post-graduate  teachers  to  the	 number	  of
post-graduate  students admitted per year, be maintained  at
one to one.
</p>
<p id="p_124">      For the proper training of the post- graduate students
there  should be a limit to the number of students  admitted
per  year.  For this purpose every unit should consist of at
least  three full time post-graduate teachers and can  admit
not more than three students for post- graduate training per
year.	If the number of post-graduate teachers in the	unit
is  more  than	three  then the number of  students  can  be
increased  proportionately.   For this purpose, one  student
should associate with one post- graduate teacher".
</p>

<p id="p_125">      Condition 5 says:
</p>
<p id="p_126">      "The  selection of post-graduates both for degree	 and

merit."
</p>

<p id="p_127">      Condition 6 is as follows:-

<p id="p_129">      Under   the  heading   "facilities  for  post-graduate

</p>

<p id="p_140">      Mr.   Salve, learned counsel appearing for the Medical
Council	 of  India  has, therefore, rightly  submitted	that
under  the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_229">Indian  Medical Council Act</a> of 1956	 the  Indian
Medical	 Council  is  empowered to  prescribe,	inter  alia,
standards  of  post-graduate  medical	education.   In	 the
exercise of its powers under <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_230">Section 20</a> read with <a href="/doc/101411070/" id="a_231">Section 33</a>
the  Indian  Medical  Council has framed  Regulations  which
govern	post-graduate medical education.  These Regulations,
therefore,  are	 binding  and  the  States  cannot,  in	 the
exercise of power under Entry 25 of List-III, make rules and
regulations  which are in conflict with or adversely impinge
upon  the Regulations framed by the Medical Council of India
for  post- graduate medical education.	Since the  standards
laid  down are in the exercise of the power conferred  under
Entry	66  of	List-I,	 the   exercise	 of  that  power  is
exclusively  within the domain of the Union Government.	 The
power of the States under Entry 25 of List-III is subject to
Entry 66 of List-I.
</p>
<p id="p_141">      Secondly,	 it is not the exclusive power of the  State
to frame rules and regulations pertaining to education since
the subject is in the Concurrent List.	Therefore, any power
exercised  by the State in the area of education under Entry
25 of List-III will also be subject to any existing relevant
provisions  made in that connection by the Union  Government
subject, of course, to <a href="/doc/1930681/" id="a_232">Article 254.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_142">      <a href="/doc/104556519/" id="a_233">In  Ajay Kumar Singh &amp; Ors.  v.  State of Bihar &amp; Ors</a>.
(supra),  this	Court  examined	 the powers  of	 the  Indian
Medical	 Council  under	 <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_234">Section 20</a> of	the  Indian  Medical
Council	 Act, 1956 and held that the power of the Council to
prescribe standards of post-graduate medical education under
<a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_235">Section	 20</a>  are only for the guidance of the  universities.
Since  <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_236">Section 20</a> also refers to the power of the Council to
advice	universities  in  the  matter  of  securing  uniform
standards  for	post-graduate medical  education  throughout
India, the Court said that the entire power under <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_237">Section 20</a>
was  purely  advisory.	Therefore, the power of	 the  Indian
Medical	 Council  to  prescribe	 the  minimum  standards  of
medical	 education  at	the post- graduate  level  was	only
advisory  in  nature  and not of a binding  character  (page
</p><p id="p_143">415).
</p>
<p id="p_144">      We  do  not  agree  with this  interpretation  put  on
<a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_238">Section 20</a> of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.  <a href="/doc/32627961/" id="a_239">Section
20(1)</a>  (set out earlier) is in three parts.  The first	part
provides  that	the  Council   may  prescribe  standards  of
post-graduate	medical	 education  for	  the  guidance	  of
universities.	The second part of sub-section(1) says	that
the  Council  may  advise  universities	 in  the  matter  of
securing   uniform  standards	for  post-graduate   medical
education  throughout.	 The last part of sub-	section	 (1)
enables	 the  Central Government to constitute from  amongst
the   members  of  the	 Council,  a  post-graduate  medical
education  committee.	The  first  part  of  sub-section(1)
empowers the Council to prescribe standards of post-graduate
medical	  education  for  the	guidance  of   universities.
Therefore,  the	 universities  have  to	 be  guided  by	 the
standards  prescribed by the Medical Council and must  shape
their  programmes  accordingly.	  The scheme of	 the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_240">Indian
Medical	 Council  Act</a>, 1956 does not give an option  to	 the
universities  to follow or not to follow the standards	laid
down  by  the  Indian  Medical Council.	  For  example,	 the
medical	 qualifications granted by a university or a medical
institution  have to be recognised under the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_241">Indian  Medical
Council	 Act</a>,  1956.   Unless	the  qualifications  are  so
recognised,  the students who qualify will be not be able to
practice.   Before  granting  such recognition, a  power  is
given  to  the Medical Council under <a href="/doc/118212773/" id="a_242">Section 16</a> to  ask	 for
information  as	 to the courses of study  and  examinations.
The  universities  are bound to furnish the  information  so
required   by  the  Council.	The  post-graduate   medical
committee  is  also  under <a href="/doc/157301342/" id="a_243">Section 17</a>, entitled	 to  appoint
medical	 inspectors  to	 inspect  any  medical	institution,
college,  hospital  or	other	institution  where   medical
education  is given or to attend any examination held by any
university  or	medical institution before recommending	 the
medical	 qualification granted by that university or medical
institution.  Under <a href="/doc/2556393/" id="a_244">Section 19</a>, if a report of the Committee
is   unsatisfactory  the  Medical   Council   may   withdraw
recognition  granted  to  a  medical  qualification  of	 any
medical	 institution  or university concerned in the  manner
provided  in <a href="/doc/2556393/" id="a_245">Section 19</a>.  <a href="/doc/198734806/" id="a_246">Section 19A</a> enables the Council to
prescribe  minimum  standards of medical education  required
for  granting  recognised medical qualifications other	than
post-graduate  medical qualifications by the universities or
medical	 institutions, while <a href="/doc/65767870/" id="a_247">Section 20</a> gives a power to the
Council	 to  prescribe	minimum standards  of  post-graduate
medical	 education.   The universities must  necessarily  be
guided	by  the standards prescribed under <a href="/doc/32627961/" id="a_248">Section 20(1)</a>  if

and  has  come	to the conclusion that the  Medical  Council
Regulations  have a statutory force and are mandatory.	 The
Court  was concerned with admissions to the M.B.B.S.  course
and  the  Regulations framed by the Indian  Medical  Council
relating  to  admission to the M.B.B.S.	 course.  The  Court
took  note of the observations in <a href="/doc/1720792/" id="a_255">State of Kerala v.  Kumari
T.P.   Roshana &amp; Anr</a>.  ([1979] 1 SCC 572 at page 580) to the
effect	that under the <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_256">Indian Medical Council Act</a>, 1956, the
Medical	 Council of India has been set up as an expert	body
to control the minimum standards of medical education and to
regulate  their	 observance.   It   has	 implicit  power  to
supervise  the	qualifications or eligibility standards	 for
admission  into	 medical institutions.	There is, under	 the
Act  an overall vigilance by the Medical Council to  prevent
sub-standard  entrance	qualifications for medical  courses.
These  observations  would  apply equally  to  post-graduate
medical	 courses.  We are in respectful agreement with	this
reasoning.
</p>

<p id="p_147">      The   Regulations	 governing   post-graduate   medical
education already referred to earlier, provide for admission
on  the basis of merit.	 The Regulations, however, have	 not
clearly	 spelt	out  whether  there can or  cannot  be,	 any
reservations  for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes  and/or
backward  class	 candidates  at the stage  of  post-graduate
medical	 admissions.   Whether	such   a  reservation  would
impinge on the standards or not would depend upon the manner
in  which such reservation is made, and whether the  minimum
qualifying  marks  for the reserved categories are  properly
fixed or not.  It is for the Medical Council of India to lay
down  proper norms in this area and to prescribe whether the
minimum	 qualifying  marks for the admission of students  in
the  reserved  category	 can  be   less	 than  the   minimum
qualifying  marks  for the general category students at	 the
post-graduate level;  and if so, to what extent.  Even if we
accept	the  contention	 of  the respondents  that  for	 the
reserved  category candidates also, their inter se merit  is
the  criterion	for  selection, although  for  the  reserved
category  of  candidates lower minimum qualifying marks	 are
prescribed,  the  merit which is envisaged under the  <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_257">Indian
Medical	 Council Act</a> or its Regulations is comparative merit
for  all  categories  of  candidates.  For  admission  to  a
post-graduate course in medicine, the merit criterion cannot
be  so	diluted by the State as to affect the  standards  of
post-graduate  medical	education  as prescribed  under	 the
Regulations framed by the Indian Medical Council.  It is for
the Indian Medical Council to consider whether lower minimum
qualifying  marks  can	be prescribed at  the  post-graduate
level for the reserved category candidates.  We have already
opined	that the minimum qualifying marks of 20% as compared
to  45% for the general category candidates appear to be too
low.  This would make it difficult for the reserved category
candidates  to bring their performance on a par with general
category  candidates in the course of post-graduate  studies
and  before  they qualify in the post-graduate	examination.
It  is also necessary in public interest to ensure that	 the
candidates  at the post- graduate level have not just passed
the  examination, but they have profited from their  studies
in  a  manner which makes them capable of making  their	 own
contribution,  that they are capable of diagnosing difficult
medical	 conditions with a certain degree of expertise,	 and
are capable of rendering to the ill, specialised services of
a  certain  acceptable	standard expected  of  doctors	with
specialised training.
</p>
<p id="p_148">      The  States of U.P.  and Madhya Pradesh have contended
that  if the minimum qualifying marks are raised in the case
of  the reserved category candidates, they will not be	able
to  fill  all  the seats which are reserved for	 them.	 The
purpose, however, of higher medical education is not to fill
the seats which are available by lowering standards;  nor is
the  purpose  of reservation at the stage  of  post-graduate
medical education merely to fill the seats with the reserved
category  candidates.	The  purpose   of  reservation,	  if
permissible  at	 this level, is to ensure that the  reserved
category  candidates  having  the   requisite  training	 and
calibre	 to benefit from post-graduate medical education and
rise  to  the  standards  which	  are  expected	 of  persons
possessing  post-  graduate medical qualification,  are	 not
denied	this opportunity by competing with general  category
candidates.  The general category candidates do not have any
social	disabilities which prevent them from giving of their
best.	 The  special  opportunity   which  is	provided  by
reservation  cannot, however, be made available to those who
are  substantially  below  the	levels	prescribed  for	 the
general	 category  candidates.	It will not be possible	 for
such  candidates to fully benefit from the very limited	 and
specialised  post-graduate training opportunities which	 are
designed  to produce high calibre well trained professionals
for the benefit of the public.	<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_258">Article 15(4)</a> and the spirit
of  reason  which  permeates it, do not permit	lowering  of
minimum	 qualifying marks at the post-graduate level to	 20%
for  the  reserved category as against 45% for	the  general
category  candidates.  It will be for the Medical Council of
India  to decide whether such lowering is permissible and if
so  to what extent.  But in the meanwhile at least the norms
which  are prescribed for admission to the M.B.B.S.  courses
ought  not  to be lowered at the post-graduate	level.	 The
lowering  of  minimum qualifying marks for admission to	 the
M.B.B.S.   courses has been permitted by the Indian  Medical
Council	 upto  35% for the reserved category as against	 45%
for  the  general  category.  The marks	 cannot	 be  lowered
further	 for admission to the post-graduate medical courses,
especially  when  at  the super speciality level it  is	 the
unanimous view of all the judgments of this Court that there
should be no reservations.  This would also imply that there
can  be	 no  lowering of minimum qualifying  marks  for	 any
category  of  candidates  at the level of admission  to	 the
super-specialities courses.

view that the higher you go the less should be the extent of

depreciate  merit and excellence at the highest levels.	  <a href="/doc/64185844/" id="a_260">In

there could be any reservation at the post- graduation level

prescribed,  assuming  the reservations can be made.  As  we
have  said earlier, these are matters essentially of  laying
down  appropriate  standards and hence to be decided by	 the
Medical	 Council  of India.  However, the disparity  in	 the

(supra).  To conclude:
</p>
<p id="p_152">      1.    We	have  not   examined  the  question  whether
reservations  are permissible at the post-graduate level  of
medical education;
</p>
<p id="p_153">      2.   A common entrance examination envisaged under the
Regulations  framed  by	 the Medical Council  of  India	 for
post-graduate  medical education requires fixing of  minimum
qualifying marks for passing the examination since it is not
a mere screening test.
</p>
<p id="p_154">      3.   Whether  lower minimum qualifying marks  for	 the
reserved  category  candidates	can  be	 prescribed  at	 the
post-graduate level of medical education is a question which
must  be  decided by the Medical Council of India  since  it
affects	 standards of post-graduate medical education.	Even
if  minimum qualifying marks can be lowered for the reserved
category  candidates,  there  cannot  be  a  wide  disparity
between	 the  minimum  qualifying  marks  for  the  reserved
category candidates and the minimum qualifying marks for the
general	 category candidates at this level.  The  percentage
of  20%	 for the reserved category and 45% for	the  general
category  is  not permissible under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_268">Article 15(4</a>), the	same
being  unreasonable at the post-graduate level and  contrary
to public interest.
</p>
<p id="p_155">      4.   At the level of admission to the super speciality
courses,  no special provisions are permissible, they  being
contrary to national interest.	Merit alone can be the basis
of selection.

<p id="p_156">      In  the  premises,  the impugned	Uttar  Pradesh	Post
Graduate   Medical  Education	(Reservation  for  Scheduled

1997 and G.O.  dated 7.6.1997 of the State of Madhya Pradesh
are  set  aside.  However, students who have  already  taken
admission  and are pursuing courses of post-graduate medical
study  under  the impugned Act/G.O.  will not  be  affected.
Our  judgment  will have prospective application.   Further,
pending	 consideration	of  this  question  by	the  Medical
Council	 of India, the two States may follow the norms	laid
down  by the Medical Council of India for lowering of  marks
for  admission	to  the	  under-graduate  M.B.B.S.   medical
courses,  at  the  post-graduate level also as	a  temporary
measure	 until the norms are laid down.	 This, however, will
not  be	 treated  as our having held that such	lowering  of
marks  will not lead to a lowering of standards at the post-
graduate  level	 of medical education.	Standards cannot  be
lowered	 at this level in public interest.  This is a matter
to  be decided by an expert body such as the Medical Council

has  already  been  considered by us.  While the  object  of
<a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_274">Article	 15(4)</a>	is  to	advance the  equality  principle  by
providing  for	protective discrimination in favour  of	 the
weaker sections so that they may become stronger and be able

also  ignore  the wider interests of society while  devising
such	special	   provisions.	   Undoubtedly,	  protective
discrimination	 in  favour  of	  the  backward,   including
scheduled  castes  and	scheduled tribes is as much  in	 the
interest  of  society as the protected groups.	At the	same
time,  there  may  be  other  national	interests,  such  as
promoting  excellence at the highest level and providing the
best  talent  in  the  country with  the  maximum  available
facilities  to	excel and contribute to society, which	have
also  to be borne in mind.  Special provisions must strike a
reasonable balance between these diverse national interests.

training at the level of specialities and super-specialities
in  medicine  involve  discharging the	duties	attached  to

and  super-specialities.   Even where no specific posts	 are
created	  or  kept  for	 the   doctors	studying   for	 the
super-specialities  or specialities, the work which they are

otherwise  under <a href="/doc/251667/" id="a_283">Article 15(4)</a> the special provisions  which
