     consider and grant interim relief.         By Report dated 31.01.1998 some

     interim relief was granted by Justice Shetty Commission. After due

     with the observations made in paragraphs 24 to 29 in which reference was

     made to the 85th Report of the Standing Committee of Parliament

     recommending that there should be increase in the number of Judges.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     Said Committee had noted the Judges to Population ratio and in tune with

     120th Report of the Law Commission, recommendations were made to

     increase the Judges’ strength to 50 Judges per 10 lakh people in the first

     instance. Recommendations made by Justice Shetty Commission were

     also considered and recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service in the cadre

     of District Judges was also subject-matter of directions. Paragraphs 27 to

     29 are quoted for ready reference:

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">               “27. Another question which falls for consideration is
               the method of recruitment to the posts in the cadre of
               Higher Judicial Service i.e. District Judges and
               Additional District Judges. At the present moment,
               there are two sources for recruitment to the Higher
               Judicial Service, namely, by promotion from amongst
               the members of the Subordinate Judicial Service and
               by direct recruitment. The subordinate judiciary is the
               foundation of the edifice of the judicial system. It is,
               therefore, imperative, like any other foundation, that it
               should become as strong as possible. The weight on
               the judicial system essentially rests on the subordinate
               judiciary.    While     we     have      accepted    the
               recommendation of the Shetty Commission which
               will result in the increase in the pay scales of the

<blockquote id="blockquote_6">               subordinate judiciary, it is at the same time necessary
               that the judicial officers, hard-working as they are,
               become more efficient. It is imperative that they keep
               abreast of knowledge of law and the latest
               pronouncements, and it is for this reason that the
               Shetty Commission has               recommended the
               establishment of a Judicial Academy, which is very
               necessary. At the same time, we are of the opinion
               that there has to be certain minimum standard,
               objectively adjudged, for officers who are to enter the
               Higher Judicial Service as Additional District Judges
               and District Judges. While we agree with the Shetty
               Commission that the recruitment to the Higher
               Judicial Service i.e. the District Judge cadre from
               amongst the advocates should be 25 per cent and the
               process of recruitment is to be by a competitive
               examination, both written and viva voce, we are of the
               opinion that there should be an objective method of
               testing the suitability of the subordinate judicial
               officers for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service.</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">               Furthermore, there should also be an incentive
               amongst the relatively junior and other officers to
               improve and to compete with each other so as to excel
               and get quicker promotion. In this way, we expect that
               the calibre of the members of the Higher Judicial
               Service will further improve. In order to achieve this,
               while the ratio of 75 per cent appointment by
               promotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to the
               Higher Judicial Service is maintained, we are,
               however, of the opinion that there should be two
               methods as far as appointment by promotion is
               concerned: 50 per cent of the total posts in the Higher
               Judicial Service must be filled by promotion on the
               basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority. For this
               purpose, the High Courts should devise and evolve a
               test in order to ascertain and examine the legal
               knowledge of those candidates and to assess their
               continued efficiency with adequate knowledge of
               case-law. The remaining 25 per cent of the posts in
               the service shall be filled by promotion strictly on the
               basis of merit through the limited departmental
               competitive examination for which the qualifying
               service as a Civil Judge (Senior Division) should be

<p id="p_19">               29. Experience has shown that there has been a
               constant discontentment amongst the members of the
               Higher Judicial Service in regard to their seniority in
               service. For over three decades a large number of
               cases have been instituted in order to decide the
               relative seniority from the officers recruited from the
               two different sources, namely, promotees and direct
               recruits. As a result of the decision today, there will,
               in a way, be three ways of recruitment to the Higher
               Judicial Service. The quota for promotion which we
               have prescribed is 50 per cent by following the
               principle “merit-cum-seniority”, 25 per cent strictly
               on merit by limited departmental competitive
               examination and 25 per cent by direct recruitment.
               Experience has also shown that the least amount of
               litigation in the country, where quota system in
               recruitment exists, insofar as seniority is concerned, is
               where a roster system is followed. For example, there

                 recruitment as per the quotas, the seniority is fixed by
                 the roster points and irrespective of the fact as to
                 when a person is recruited. When roster system is
                 followed, there is no question of any dispute arising.

                 by this Court in <a href="/doc/1871744/" id="a_14">R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab5</a>.
                 One of the methods of avoiding any litigation and
                 bringing about certainty in this regard is by specifying
                 quotas in relation to posts and not in relation to the
                 vacancies. This is the basic principle on the basis of
                 which the 40-point roster works. We direct the High
                 Courts to suitably amend and promulgate seniority
                 rules on the basis of the roster principle as approved
                 by this Court in R.K. Sabharwal case as early as
                 possible. We hope that as a result thereof there would
                 be no further dispute in the fixation of seniority. It is
                 obvious that this system can only apply prospectively
                 except where under the relevant rules seniority is to
                 be determined on the basis of quota and rotational
                 system. The existing relative seniority of the members
                 of the Higher Judicial Service has to be protected but
                 the roster has to be evolved for the future. Appropriate
                 rules and methods will be adopted by the High Courts
                 and approved by the States, wherever necessary by
                 31-3-2003.”

                 to speedily determine and fill vacancies of judges at
                 all levels. For this purpose, timely steps are required
                 to be taken for determination of vacancies, issue of
                 advertisement, conducting examinations, interviews,
                 declaration of the final results and issue of orders of
                 appointments. For all these and other steps, if any, it is

                 the system works automatically and there is no delay
                 in filling up of vacancies. The dates for taking these

                 filling of vacancies in some other services or filling of

                 provided for where sufficient number of vacancies do
                 not occur in a given year. The adherence to strict time

                 schedule for the aforesaid purposes so that every year

<p id="p_82">               “33. It may be mentioned that posts can be created
               dehors the cadre of a service, and these are known as
               ex cadre posts. The posts created without a specific
               order under Rule 6(2) are ex cadre posts. Hence in our
               opinion the temporary or permanent vacancies or
               posts created beyond the number of posts in Schedule
               I without a specific order under Rule 6(2) varying
               Schedule I to the Rules are only ex cadre posts, and
               can only be filled in by promotees, and not by direct
               recruitment.
</p>
<p id="p_83">               34. It may be noted that Rule 9(2) uses the words “as
               far as possible”. In our opinion, this means that there
               is no hard-and-fast rule that after every three persons
               appointed by promotion, the fourth person has to be
               appointed by direct recruitment. In our opinion, the
               Division Bench of the High Court has given a wrong
               interpretation of Rule 9(2) of the Rules by observing:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">                   “it does not give a licence to the
                   respondents to refuse to appoint every
                   fourth person by direct recruitment on the
                   ground that it was not possible for any other
                   reason than the maintenance of the limit of
                   one-third of the total strength imposed by
                   sub-rule (1) of Rule 9 on direct
                   recruitment”.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_84">               In our opinion this is a wrong view taken by the
               Division Bench of the High Court as is evident from
               the words “as far as possible” in Rule 9(2). These
               words give a discretion to the authorities, and the
               Court cannot interfere with this discretion, unless it is
               palpably arbitrary.

</p><p id="p_86">               35. In our opinion, the Division Bench of the High
               Court erred in law in holding that for the purpose of
               direct recruitment the temporary or permanent posts
               created outside the cadre without amending Schedule
               I were also to be included while calculating the
               strength of the Service. The Division Bench also erred

               under Rule 6(2) in this connection amending Schedule
               I. In our opinion, there has to be a specific order under
               Rule 6(2) amending Schedule I otherwise it cannot be
               said that the strength of the cadre has been increased.
               Hence, in our opinion, the temporary or permanent
               posts created outside the cadre cannot be taken into

<p id="p_141">     dealing with the issue of regularization of service rendered by the Judicial

<blockquote id="blockquote_79">                     “172. The prayer for regularisation of service and

                 made not only in cases involving the case of the State
                 of Orissa, but even in other States. Absorption in
                 service is not a right. Regularisation also is not a

                 appointed under different rules to different posts.</blockquote>
<p id="p_142">                 Regularisation shall depend upon the facts and

      21.2 In so far as the State of Rajasthan is concerned, it was observed:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_80">                     “177. In the case of State of Rajasthan, it is the
                 judicial officers from the cadre of Civil Judge, Senior
                 Division, who were promoted as FTC Judges. They
                 have continued to hold those posts for a considerable
                 period. According to these petitioners, they were
                 promoted to the Higher Judicial Services as per the
                 Rules and, therefore, keeping in view the order of this
                 Court in Madhumita Das15 as well as the very essence
                 of the FTC Scheme, they should be absorbed as
                 members of the regular cadre of Higher Judicial
                 Services of the State of Rajasthan. The State
                 Government had issued a directive that they should
                 undertake the limited competitive examination for
                 their regular promotion/absorption in the higher cadre.
                 These officers questioned the correctness of this
                 directive on the ground that they were promoted as
                 Additional Sessions Judges (FTC) under the Rules
                 and, therefore, there was no question of any further
                 requirement for them to take any written examination
                 after the long years of service that they have already
                 put in in the Higher Judicial Services.

<p id="p_144">                   178. The Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010
               are in force for appointment to the Higher Judicial
               Services of the State. The judgment of this Court in
               All India Judges’ Assn. (3) case 1 as well as the
               relevant Rules contemplate that a person who is to be
               directly appointed to the Higher Judicial Services has
               to undergo a written examination and appear in an
               interview before he can be appointed to the said
               cadre. As far as appointment by promotion is
               concerned, the promotion can be made by two
               different modes i.e. on the basis of seniority-cum-
               merit or through out-of-turn promotion wherein any
               Civil Judge, Senior Division who has put in five years
               of service is required to take a competitive
               examination and then to the extent of 25% of the
               vacancies available, such Judges would be promoted
               to the Higher Judicial Services.
</p>
<p id="p_145">                   179. It was admitted before us by the learned
               counsel appearing for the petitioners that these
               officers who were promoted as ad hoc FTC Judges
               had not taken any written competitive examination
               before their promotion to this post under the Higher
               Judicial Services. In other words, they were promoted
               on ad hoc basis depending on the availability of
               vacancy in FTCs. Once the Rules required a particular
               procedure to be adopted for promotion to the regular
               posts of the Higher Judicial Services, then the
               competent authority can effect the promotion only by
               that process and none other. In view of the admitted
               fact that these officers have not taken any written
               examination, we see no reason as to how the
               challenge made by these judicial officers to the
               directive issued by the State Government for
               undertaking of written examination may be sustained.
               Thus, the relief prayed for cannot be granted in its
               entirety.”

                    Singh Bhandari on 16.08.2017, inviting
                    objections thereto. This seniority list started
                    from Shri N.S. Dhaddha at serial no.206 and
                    continued upto Shri Mohammad Arif at serial
                    no.519. Recruitment to District Judge cadre is
                    made by three methods – 65% by promotion,
                    10% by Limited Competitive Examination (for
                    short, ‘LCE), both from amongst the Senior
                    Civil Judges and 25% by direct recruitment from
                    the members of the Bar. The officers from all

<p id="p_196">                    We may at the outset make it clear that we do
                    not wish to unsettle the seniority position which
                    has attained finality insofar as final seniority list
                    dated 15.12.2014 is concerned, because no one
                    from any of the three streams of recruitment has
                    ever challenged the same before any forum
                    known to law. However, at the same time, we
                    wish to make it clear at this stage itself that
                    while deciding the objections as to correctness
                    of the provisional seniority list dated
                    16.08.2017, we may not agree and may deviate
                    from the principles on which the conclusions of
                    the earlier seniority committee in its report are
                    founded.”


     30.2   With regard to first question the conclusion arrived at by the

     Committee was as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_99">                    “In view of the position of law discussed above,
                    we are not persuaded to countenance the
                    submission that the promotes against the posts
                    outside the cadre should be taken to have been
                    promoted from the date of their ad hoc
                    promotion either in the fast track courts or any
                    other court, for the purpose of grant of seniority
                    with reference to proviso to Rule 24 even though
                    their regular promotion has actually taken place
                    after the Rules of 1969 were repealed and the
                    Rules of 2010 were promulgated on 19.01.2010.</blockquote>
<p id="p_197">                    We also cannot uphold the argument that any
                    right stood crystalized in favour of such
                    promotes by reason of prescription made in
                    proviso to Rule 24 and such right, by virtue of
                    the savings clause under Rule 57 of the Rules of
                    2010, would remain protected so as to entitle
                    them to claim seniority from the date of initial
                    promotion on ad hoc basis even if their regular
                    promotion has taken place later than the
                    promulgation of the Rules of 2010. We are not
                    examining the correctness of the order granting
Writ Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.

                    ad hoc service towards requisite period of five
                    years, but that cannot justify giving the benefit
                    of seniority on the basis of ad hoc promotion in
                    view of the interpretation of the extant rules we
                    have taken in the light of settled proposition of
                    law. In our considered view, all those who were
                    promoted on ad hoc basis earlier under the Rules
                    of 1969, prior to promulgation of the Rules of
                    2010, can be given seniority only from the date
                    of their substantive appointment, upon regular
                    promotion, which took place after the Rules of
                    2010 came into force with effect from
                    19.01.2010.      There is therefore no legal
                    justification for en-bloc placement of such
                    officers in the provisional seniority list on the
                    basis of revision of cadre strength, when
                    temporary/permanent posts included in the cadre
                    with increase of its strength from 150 to 245 and
                    every time later when the cadre strength was
                    revised from 246 to 255, 256 to 265 and 266 to
                    372 respectively.”

<blockquote id="blockquote_100">                    “In the case at hand, it should be noted that the
                    process of recruitment was initially notified vide
                    advertisement dated 15.04.2010, but the entire
                    selection process both by direct recruitment as
                    well by promotion through LCE was abandoned
                    pursuant to decision of the Full Court, which is

                    Shri Satish Kumar. This proves that either they
                    were not eligible, or even if eligible, they did not
                    apply in response to the earlier notification for
                    recruitment dated 15.04.2010. We are therefore
                    not inclined to uphold the claim of direct recruits
                    that they should be conferred the benefit of
                    seniority from the year 2010. In any event, the
                    direct recruits cannot claim seniority earlier than
                    initiation of fresh process of selection pursuant
                    to notification dated 19.07.2011 during the year
                    2011-12. The result of this would be that these
                    direct recruits would not be entitled to claim
                    seniority over at least those 47 officers, who
                    were promoted on regular basis vide order dated
                    21.04.2010 in the year 2010-11 after the Rules

                    cannot therefore claim seniority above those
                    officers, who were promoted on regular basis
                    soon after promulgation of the Rules of 2010,
                    when they were not even borne on the cadre.”

<p id="p_200">                    and on that basis he gets a higher placement in
                    the seniority, regardless of his selection in the
                    LCE, he should not be put to a disadvantageous
                    position and allowed to retain his position in the
                    seniority based on his regular promotion. In
                    other words, such officer would be entitled to
                    retain seniority, either on the basis of LCE or on
                    the basis of regular promotion, whichever is
                    more beneficial to him.”

     30.5   Finally, while dealing with fourth question, the Committee took

     into account that there was no actual recruitment in the years 2012-13,

     2013-14 and 2014-15 and the recruitment process commenced by the

     Notification dated 26.04.2015 was with regard to vacancies of all four

     years i.e. 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. In the circumstances, it

     was concluded:-
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_102">               “As far as the period subsequent to the roster order
               dated 15.07.2013 is concerned, the determination of
               vacancies was made every year fairly regularly as
               noticed above, but actual recruitment from none of the
               three modes could take place in any one of the years
               2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. Finally again the
               recruitment process commenced by notification dated
               26.04.2015 in the year 2015-16. Since the vacancies
               of all four years, viz., 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 and
               2015-16, were combined, even if some of the officers
               were in between allowed to continue on the post of
               Additional District &amp; Sessions Judge on ad hoc basis,
               they cannot in view of the afore-discussed provisions
               of the Rules claim seniority on that basis. The
               vacancies of all these four years having been
               determined as those of the year 2015-16, all the
               appointments, by direct recruitment, LCE or regular
               promotion, should be deemed to belong to the year

               Perusal of the provisional seniority list shows that all
               56 officers starting from Shri Satish Kumar Vyas
               (S.No.369) upto Shri Jai Prakash Narain Purohit
               (S.No.423), promoted on ad hoc basis vide order
               dated 21.04.2014 as Additional District Judge in the
               DJ cadre under Rule 15 of the Rules of 2010, have
               been wrongly assigned higher seniority. Thereafter, 26
               officers starting from Shri Paras Kumar Jain
               (S.No.4224) upto Shri Jagendra Kumar Agarwal
               (S.No.450), all promoted on ad hoc basis by order
               dated 21.04.2015 also have been wrongly assigned
               higher seniority in the provisional seniority list. The
               next slot of officers starting from Shri Ashok Kumar
               Agarwal (S.No.451) onwards though have been
               promoted on regular basis by order dated 05.02.2016,
               but they have been all placed en-bloc senior to those
               who were selected against direct recruitment quota.
               Surprisingly, the cadre strength was initially increased
               with the enforcement of the Rules of 2010 on
               19.01.2010, but the High Court administration has
               applied the same analogy of revision of cadre strength
               even on three subsequent occasions for placing all the
               officers appointed on ad hoc basis en-bloc in the
               seniority above those directly recruited. Some of the
               officers, who though got regular promotion vide order
               dated 05.02.2016, deviating from the roster point
               indicated in the order of promotion dated 05.02.2016,
               have been placed en-bloc above the officers of direct
               recruitment and LCE quota by wrongly applying the
               proviso to Rule 24 as if this repealed Rule would
               perpetually survive by mere reason of ad hoc
               promotions, for each succeeding year. Grant of benefit
               of seniority to officers promoted on ad hoc basis was
               thus contrary to the provisions contained in Rule 15
               and 47(4).
</p>
<p id="p_203">               Taking all the aforementioned circumstances into
               account, we are inclined to hold that each of the years
               2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 for the purpose of
               operating the roster system should be treated as zero

               42 of the Rules of 2010 workable, which begins with
               the phraseology “As far as possible”, a select list as
               provided in Schedule-V shall be prepared by the High
               Court. Such select list in the cyclic order as per the
               roster point was earlier prepared by order dated
               15.07.2013 and also when the next regular selections
               took place vide order dated 05.02.2016 but this was
               not truly reflected in the seniority list. All the officers
               promoted on regular basis by order dated 05.02.2016
               should be taken to have been substantively appointed
               from that date only. If this view is taken, no prejudice
               would be caused to any class of the officers as none of
               them would compete for promotion/appointment in
               their respective category in previous three years.
               Vacancies of all these three years having been clubbed
               with the vacancies of the year 2015-16 to be
               determined as the vacancies of that year, each one of
               them has had opportunity to compete with his fellow
               officers/candidates for substantive appointment by
               way of promotion/LCE/direct-recruitment, to the DJ
               cadre together.”

               The essence of direction in Clause (A) is that the

               date of his appointment and not according to the date

               officiation in such post cannot be taken into account

               appointment as an ad hoc Additional District Judge is
               not traceable to the 1963 Rules. The simple reason
               leading to this consequence is that there was no
               vacancy available which was to be filled up by
               promotion on that date in the Superior Judicial
               Service (Senior Branch).</blockquote>

               relied upon in the impugned judgment1 as well. It is
               submitted on behalf of the writ petitioner that on
               promotion to the Senior Branch Cadre of Superior
               Judicial Service during his tenure in the Fast Track
               Courts, the writ petitioner is entitled to the counting
               of the service rendered by him in the Fast Track Court
               as a service in Superior Judicial Service (Senior
               Branch). The submission overlooks the first two parts
               of Direction 14, one, no right will be conferred in
               judicial service for claiming any regular promotion on
               the basis of his/her appointment on ad hoc basis under
               the scheme; and two, the service rendered in Fast
               Track Courts will be deemed as service rendered in
               the parent cadre. In our opinion, until the vacancy
               occurred in the cadre of Superior Judicial Service
               (Senior Branch) which was to be filled up by
               promotion, the service rendered by the writ petitioner
               in the Fast Track Court cannot be deemed to be
               service rendered in the Superior Judicial Service
               (Senior Branch). Rather until then, he continued to be
               a member of the parent cadre i.e. Superior Judicial
               Service (Junior Branch). The third part of Direction
               14, in our view, does not deserve to be read in a
               manner that overrides the 1963 Rules.”

<p id="p_245">               Fast Track Courts sanctioned under the 11th Finance
               Scheme are totally different and distinct, compared to
               appointments which are to be made for regular vacant posts
               of District Judges covered under A.P. Higher Judicial
               Service. If a person is not appointed to any post in the
               cadre, such person cannot claim any seniority over the
               persons who are appointed in vacant posts in the cadre. The
               Fast Track Courts which were sanctioned initially for five
               years from the grants of 11th Finance Commission, were
               continued in some States beyond such period with the
               assistance, from States and such Fast Track Courts were
               discontinued in some other States. Merely on the ground
               that they were selected by following the same procedure
               akin to that of regular selections, is no ground to consider
               their claim for grant of seniority from the date of initial
               appointment.         When          their      claim        for
               regularisation/absorption and challenge to notification
               issued in the year 2004 for making selections to the vacant
               regular posts of District Judges is rejected by the High
               Court and confirmed by this Court, we are of the view that
               the appellants have no basis to claim seniority from the date
               of initial appointment. In any event, having applied in
               response to the notification issued by the High Court in the
               year 2013 after availing the benefit of appointment, it is not
               open to the appellants to question the conditions imposed in
               the order which is in conformity with rules. Undisputedly,
               appellant was appointed as ad hoc District Judges to
               preside over the Fast Track Courts only. Initially when she
               was not appointed to a post or category of posts, forming
               part of cadre strength in such category, appellant cannot
               claim any seniority over the persons regularly appointed in
               the category of posts forming part of cadre strength. There
               is yet another ground to reject the claim of the appellant.
               Though the appellant claims seniority over the persons who
               are appointed in regular vacant posts forming part of cadre
               strength but they are not even made parties. On this ground
               also, the claim of the appellants deserves rejection.

               appointments are made and when appointments are made,
               were such appointments to the cadre posts or not etc. When
               the appellants were not appointed to any regular posts in

               the said judgments relied on by the appellants would not

               Rules for Ad Hoc Appointments, 2001 held that such
               appointments in respect of Fast Track Courts are ad hoc in

               aforesaid view of this Court clearly supports the case of the
               respondents. Paragraph 25 of the said case which is
               relevant for the purpose of these cases reads as under : “25.

     promotions as Fast Track Court Judges, while in C. Yamini18 the members

     of the Bar were appointed as Fast Track Court Judges and these decisions

     vacancies by Direct Recruitments and 22 vacancies by Promotion through

     LCE. This was preceded by determination of vacancies through

     Notification dated 31.03.2010. After the process initiated in terms of said

     Notification dated 15.04.2010 was cancelled, a fresh determination of the

     vacancies was undertaken and the Notification dated 31.03.2011 now

     found vacancies for Direct Recruitments, for Promotion through LCE and

     for Regular Promotion at 37, 32 and 24 respectively. Thus, the vacancies

     which became available post the Notification dated 15.04.2010 were also

     taken into account. The Report dated 15.03.2019 shows that some of the

<p id="p_252">     31.03.2011 had not even participated in the earlier process of 2010. In the

     premises, if the submission that the process initiated under the Notification

     dated 31.03.2011 must be held to be in continuation of the earlier selection

     of 2010 is accepted, it would amount to conferring undue advantages upon

     persons who either had not participated in the process of 2010 or who were

     not even eligible in 2010. The Report dated 15.03.2019, therefore,

     correctly appreciated the fact situation on record and concluded that it

     would not be in continuation of the earlier process.

<p id="p_253">     41.    As regards Question No.(C), it must be noted that as on the date

     when 2010 Rules came into effect, the Additional District and Sessions

     Judges manning the Fast Track Courts had rendered service in ad-hoc

     capacity for almost 07 years. The question whether they be granted

     promotion on Regular Basis was subject matter of consideration of the

     High Court. The Report of the Committee of Judges given in 2008 had

     advised that they be granted Regular Promotion and the matter was getting

     deferred at the level of the Full Court. It was at this stage that 2010 Rules

     became effective from 18.01.2010. Even thereafter, the Notification dated

     31.03.2010 had published the vacancy situation only in respect of Direct

     Recruitment and Promotion through LCE. It was obviously so, as the issue

     21.04.2010 a formal Order was passed promoting the 47 Judicial Officers

     on substantive basis to the Cadre of District Judge. The grant of promotion

     to the 47 Judicial Officers and selection process pursuant to the

     Notification dated 15.04.2010 were not part of the same process and were

     completely independent. None of the 47 Judicial Officers had the occasion

     to compete in the LCE that was undertaken in terms of the Notification

     dated 15.04.2010. It is possible to say that the last of the 47 Judicial

     Officers could as well have been the first in the list of successful

     candidates through LCE and thus could possibly have been entitled to

     better placement. In any case, the process initiated pursuant to the

     Notification dated 15.04.2010 was cancelled for administrative reasons and

     the appointments in respect of process pursuant to the Notification dated

     31.03.2011 could be effected only in the year 2013, i.e. more than 03 years

     after the 47 Judicial Officers were granted substantive appointment to the

     Cadre of District Judge. Further, if grant of promotion to the 47 Judicial

     Officers is taken to be the part of the same process, some of the Direct

     Recruits may not even be having eligibility in the year 2010 and yet may

     be placed above some of the 47 Judicial Officers. In the circumstances, the

     to be part of the same selection process where Direct Recruits and

     candidates through LCE were appointed to the Cadre of District Judge on

     15.07.2013.

<p id="p_256">          If the substantive appointment of the 47 Judicial Officers to the Cadre

     of District Judge is separate and distinct from the selection process through

     which appointment were made after three years on 15.07.2017, there

     would be no question or occasion to apply the Cyclic Order. It is not the

     contention of anyone that appointment of the 47 Judicial Officers on the

     relevant date was either beyond the quota meant for Regular Promotion or

     that there was any serious infirmity in the process or that any of the

     candidates was completely ineligible. Since there was a difference of more

     than 03 years between these two modes of selection, the Report dated

     15.03.2019 rightly concluded that the Cyclic Order ought not to get

     attracted.

<p id="p_257">          It is true that the Cyclic Order and the quota for different streams

     ensure equitable treatment for three sources. However, the application of

     the Cyclic Order must depend upon the fact situations. It was precisely for

     this reason that the expression “as far as possible” has been used in the

     appropriate. The expression “as far as possible” was, therefore, relied

     upon by this Court in Para 34 of its decision in Veena Verma12. It would

<p id="p_261">     41.1.   We must at this stage deal with submissions based on the decision

     of this Court in N.R. Parmar19. In that case a Bench of two Judges of this

     Court while considering O.N. dated 20.12.1999 and 02.02.2000 had

     concluded as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_117">                   “31.2. It is not necessary, that the direct recruits
               for vacancies of a particular recruitment year, should
               join within the recruitment year (during which the
               vacancies had arisen) itself. As such, the date of
               joining would not be a relevant factor for determining
               seniority of direct recruits. It would suffice if action
               has been initiated for direct recruit vacancies, within
               the recruitment year in which the vacancies had
               become available. This is so, because delay in
               administrative action, it was felt, could not deprive an
               individual of his due seniority. As such, initiation of
               action for recruitment within the recruitment year
               would be sufficient to assign seniority to the
               appointees concerned in terms of the “rotation of
               quotas” principle, so as to arrange them with other
               appointees (from the alternative source), for vacancies

                   34.1. If the process of recruitment has been
               initiated during the recruitment year (in which the
               vacancies have arisen) itself, even if the examination
               for the said recruitment is held in a subsequent year,
               and the result is declared in a year later (than the one
               in which the examination was held), and the selected
               candidates joined in a further later year (than the one
               in which the result was declared), the selected
               candidates will be entitled to be assigned seniority,
               with reference to the recruitment year (in which the
               requisition of vacancies was made). The logic and
               reasoning for the aforesaid conclusion (expressed in
               the ON dated 2-2-2000) is, if the process of direct
               recruitment is initiated in the recruitment year itself,
               the selected candidate(s) cannot be blamed for the

              Relying on the aforementioned observations, it was submitted that

     the candidates selected through Direct Recruitment and LCE on

     15.07.2013 could not be prejudiced if the High Court on the administrative

     side had segregated the issue of promotion of the 47 Judicial Officers on

     one hand and the selection through Direct Recruitment and LCE on the

     other; and the time lag of three years between the appointments would,

     therefore, be of no consequence.

               promotees and direct recruits was to be read into the

               rotation of seniority points ("rota") between
               promotees and direct recruits. The rotation provided
               for was founded on the concept of rotation of quotas
               between promo-tees and direct recruits. It is therefore

               seniority between the promotees and direct recruits
               was based on the "quota" and "rota" principle. The

               of quotas will still be followed for determining the
               inter-se seniority of direct recruits and promotees, the
               present practice of keeping vacant slots for being
               filled up by direct recruits of later years, thereby
               giving them unintended seniority over promotees who
               were already in position, would be dispensed with.
               This Court noticed office memorandum dated
               07.02.1986 and observed that "when direct recruits or
               promotees      become      available     through   later
               examinations or selections", it clearly mean that the
               situation contemplated is one where, there has been an
               earlier examination or selection, and is then followed
               by a "later" examination or selection.

<p id="p_267">               52. In the above context, this Court laid down
               following in Paragraph 31.2 that "it is not necessary,
               that the direct recruits of a particular recruitment year,
               should join within the recruitment year itself". It was
               held that date of joining would not be a relevant factor
               for determining seniority of direct recruits. In
               paragraph 31.2 and 34.1 following has been laid
               down:

<blockquote id="blockquote_123">                   31.2. It is not necessary, that the direct recruits for

                   recruit vacancies, within the recruitment year in
                   which the vacancies had become available. This
                   is so, because delay in administrative action, it
                   was felt, could not deprive an individual of his
                   due seniority. As such, initiation of action for
                   recruitment within the recruitment year would be

                   the aforesaid conclusion (expressed in the ON

               learned Senior Counsel, Shri Jaideep Gupta refers to
               the MPS Rules, 1965 to argue that the provisions of
               the Rules make it abundantly clear that inter-se
               seniority in the cadre of MPS Grade-III is to be
               determined by the order in which appointments are
               made to the service. The counsel pointedly refers to
               Rules 28 (i) where it is specified that the .......
               seniority in the service shall be determined by the
               order in which appointments are made to the
               service....... He also refers to the later part of Rule
               28(iii), where again it is specified that the "seniority
               of the officer...... shall be counted from the date,
               he/she is appointed to the service............ . The
               provisions in Rule 16(iii) are pressed home by Mr.
               Gupta to argue that only when the person is
               appointed, he shall be deemed to have been appointed
               to the service from the date of encadrement.

<p id="p_278">               21. The judgment in N.R. Parmar (Supra) is read with
               equal emphasis by Mr. Gupta to firstly point out that
               this case does not lay down the correct law in
               determination of seniority. The counsel highlights the
               incongruity in a situation where a person who entered
               service later will claim seniority above those who
               joined service at an earlier point of time. The
               applicability of the ratio in N.R. Parmar (Supra) to the
               litigants in the present case is also questioned by Mr.
               Gupta by pointing out that the provisions of MPS
               Rules, 1965 applicable for the officers in the Manipur
               Police Officers, was not the subject of consideration
               in N.R. Parmar (Supra), and, therefore, the said ratio
               relatable to Income Tax Inspectors, with different
               Service Rules, will not apply to the present case.

<p id="p_281">                the Law is fairly well settled in a series of cases, that a
                person is disentitled to claim seniority from a date he
                was not borne in service. For example, in J.C. Patnaik
                (Supra)30 the Court considered the question whether
                the year in which the vacancy accrues can have any
                bearing for the purpose of determining the seniority
                irrespective of the fact when the person is actually
                recruited. The Court observed that there could be time
                lag between the year when the vacancy accrues and
                the year when the final recruitment is made. Referring
                to the word "recruited" occurring in the Orissa Service
                of Engineers Rules, 1941 the Supreme Court held in
                J.C. Patnaik (Supra) that person cannot be said to
                have been recruited to the service only on the basis of
                initiation of process of recruitment but he is borne in
                the post only when, formal appointment order is
                issued.
</p>
<p id="p_282">                30. The above ratio in J.C. Patnaik (Supra) is
                followed by this Court in several subsequent cases. It
                would however be appropriate to make specific
                reference considering the seniority dispute in
                reference to the Arunachal Pradesh Rules which are
                pari materia to the MPS Rules, 1965, (vide (2007) 15
                SCC 406-<a href="/doc/1498464/" id="a_127">Nani Sha and Ors. v. State of Arunachal
                Pradesh and Ors</a>.). Having regard to the similar
                provisions, the Court approved the view that seniority
                is to be reckoned not from the date when vacancy
                arose but from the date on which the appointment is
                made to the post. The Court particularly held that
                retrospective seniority should not be granted from a
                day when an employee is not even borne in the cadre
                so as to adversely impact those who were validly
                appointed in the meantime.

               Court held that seniority cannot be given for an

               doing so it may adversely affect the employees who

                    The date of entry in a particular service or the
                    date of substantive appointment is the safest
                    criterion for fixing seniority inter se between
                    one officer or the other or between one group of
                    officers and the other recruited from different
                    sources. Any departure therefrom in the
                    statutory rules, executive instructions or
                    otherwise must be consistent with the

               the relevant advertisement issued in 2005 for direct
               recruitment which allowed the aspirants to apply even
               if, their result in the qualification examination is
               awaited. Even more intriguing and significant is the
               relaxation that those proposing to appear in the
               qualifying examination are also allowed to respond to
               the advertisement. If such be the nature of the process
               initiated (in the year 2005) for making direct
               recruitment, we can easily visualize a situation where,
               in the event of granting seniority from the stage of
               commencing the process, a person when eventually
               appointed, would get seniority from a date even
               before obtaining the qualification, for holding the
               post.

               Parmar (Supra), it appears to us that the referred OMs
               (dated 07.02.1986 and 03.07.1986) were not properly
               construed in the judgment. Contrary to the eventual
               finding, the said two OMs had made it clear that
               seniority of the direct recruits be declared only from
               the date of appointment and not from the date of
               initiation of recruitment process. But surprisingly, the
               judgment while referring to the illustration given in
               the OM in fact overlooks the effect of the said
               illustration. According to us, the illustration extracted
               in the N.R. Parmar (Supra) itself, makes it clear that
               the vacancies which were intended for direct
               recruitment in a particular year (1986) which were
               filled in the next year (1987) could be taken into
               consideration only in the subsequent year's seniority
               list but not in the seniority list of 1986. In fact, this
               was indicated in the two OMs dated 07.02.1986 and
               03.07.1986 and that is why the Government issued the
               subsequent OM on 03.03.2008 by way of clarification
               of the two earlier OMs.

<p id="p_289">               39. At this stage, we must also emphasize that the

               that the selected candidate cannot be blamed for
               administrative delay and the gap between initiation of

<p id="p_290">               process and appointment. Such observation is
               fallacious in as much as none can be identified as
               being a selected candidate on the date when the
               process of recruitment had commenced. On that day, a
               body of persons aspiring to be appointed to the
               vacancy intended for direct recruits was not in
               existence. The persons who might respond to an
               advertisement cannot have any service-related rights,
               not to talk of right to have their seniority counted
               from the date of the advertisement. In other words,
               only on completion of the process, the Applicant
               morphs into a selected candidate and, therefore,
               unnecessary observation was made in N.R. Parmar
               (Supra) to the effect that the selected candidate cannot
               be blamed for the administrative delay. In the same
               context, we may usefully refer to the ratio in
               <a href="/doc/982107/" id="a_134">Shankarsan Dash v. Union of India</a> (1991) 3 SCC 47,

<p id="p_291">               40. The Judgment in N.R. Parmar (Supra) relating to

               opinion, automatically apply to the Manipur State
               Police Officers, governed by the MPS Rules, 1965.
               We also feel that N.R. Parmar (Supra) had incorrectly
               distinguished      the      long-standing      seniority
               determination principles propounded in, inter-alia,

               Pratap Singh and Ors. v. Reevan Singh and Ors.

               with like enunciation on the law for determination of
               seniority makes it abundantly clear that under Service
               Jurisprudence, seniority cannot be claimed from a
               date when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the
               cadre. In our considered opinion, the law on the issue
               is correctly declared in J.C. Patnaik (Supra) and
               consequently we disapprove the norms on assessment
               of inter-se seniority, suggested in N.R. Parmar
               (Supra). Accordingly, the decision in N.R. Parmar is
               overruled. However, it is made clear that this decision

               his judgment on two propositions but the Division
               Bench was of the view that result would be the same
               merely on the basis of one of the two propositions
               and, therefore, it was unnecessary to pronounce upon
               the other proposition. Such an approach cannot
               therefore be described as a conflict (as has been
               suggested), between the two judgments. Both
               Benches were absolutely consistent in their
               conclusion that promotees would have to be given
               seniority over direct recruits. It cannot therefore be
               argued that by some convoluted reasoning, it is
               possible to come to the conclusion that the orders
               passed by the two Courts would result in
               diametrically opposite situation namely, that direct
               recruits would have to be given seniority over
               promotees.”


     41.3   The facts noted in paragraph 5 of the decision in Meghachandra

     filled through LCE. It was stated in paragraph 27 that there should be an

     year such last person may as well be at the top of the list of promotees

     grant of promotion on substantive basis may depend upon various issues

     including suitability of the concerned candidate and availability of posts.
</p>
<p id="p_312">     The record also shows that after grant of promotion on substantive basis

     to the 47 Judicial Officers, there were no vacancies for Regular Promotion

     which is why the selection process undertaken in the year 2010 did not

     earmark any vacancies for Regular Promotions and it was only in the year

     2011, when adequate vacancies for said category became available, that

     participated in the process initiated pursuant to said Notification dated

     31.03.2011. Some of them also appeared in LCE and availed of the

     opportunity to stake their claim. Their regular promotions to the Cadre of

     District Judge must, therefore, be taken only as a result of selection

     process initiated in terms of the Notification dated 31.03.2011 which

     culminated in the Order dated 15.07.2013. In the circumstances, their

     substantive appointment to said cadre has to be reckoned from 15.07.2013

     and not with any anterior effect.

<p id="p_319">            The petitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.899 of 2019 and other

     connected matters came to be appointed on ad-hoc basis to man the Fast

     Track Courts after 2010 Rules came into effect. Even if their services

     were continued after abolition of Fast Track Courts, that by itself would

     not confer any right on them. They came to be substantively promoted to

     the Cadre of District Judge only vide Order dated 05.02.2016. For the

     reasons stated hereinabove, their entitlement on substantive basis has to be

     reckoned only from 05.02.2016 and not from any earlier date.           Writ

     Petition (Civil) No.899 of 2019 and other connected matters are,

     therefore, dismissed. Thus, while answering Question (E), we conclude

     that the Report dated 15.03.2019 does not call for any modification,
