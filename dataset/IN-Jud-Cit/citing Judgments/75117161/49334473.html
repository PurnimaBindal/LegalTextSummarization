</p><p id="p_4"> 3.     It is the case of the plaintiff that it is one of the leading

 manufacturer of the specialized vaccines and bio-therapeutics in

 India with significant presence both in India and abroad. It has a

 history of creating innovative vaccines. The manufacturing

 facilities of the plaintiff are approved by the regulatory agencies

 in India and abroad and are also approved by the World Health

 Organization.   The plaintiff has honestly coined the trade mark

 'TCV' and 'Typbar-TCV' in the year 2012 in relation to a

 revolutionary vaccine product for Typhoid treatment, then under

 development by the plaintiff. Both of the said trade marks are

 registered in India under <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_1">Trade Marks Act</a>, 1999 ('<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_2">Trade Marks

 Act</a>', in short) and have been in continuous and uninterrupted use

 since May, 2012. The details of the registration of the trade

 marks are as under:

</p><p id="p_6">4.           The plaintiff's trade mark 'TCV' is registered in Saudi

Arabia and Jordan and is expected for registration in Nigeria.

Similarly, the plaintiff's trade mark 'Typbar-TCV has been

registered in Saudi Arabia and Jordan and has been accepted for

registration in Vietnam and Nigeria. The vaccine of the plaintiff has

been widely sold throughout in India since 2013-2014 and is

recognized as a premier product for treatment of Typhoid. As per

the plaintiff, the revenue in 2017-2018 alone was INR 108.82

Crores.     The plaintiff is actively and diligently monitoring any

misuse of its aforesaid trade marks. To quote an example, it is

averred that the plaintiff on coming to know of the filing of trade

mark application bearing no. 2091888 for 'SCION TCV' by a third

party, immediately initiated an opposition proceedings before the

Trade Mark Registry on July 20, 2018.

<p id="p_7">5.           It is the case of the plaintiff, based on the information

received, the defendant No.1 is a corporate entity with offices pan-
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                                Page 3 of 62</span>
 India including Delhi, and appears to be in the business of hosting

and operating an interactive website www.medplusmart.com, where

pharmaceutical products are actively offered for sale across India

including the products bearing the infringing trade marks. The

plaintiff is not aware of the exact composition of the defendant No.1

which will become known only after discovery in the present

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_8">6.        It is averred that in the second week of October, 2018, the

plaintiff learnt through market sources including its distributors that

defendant No.2 had actively commenced promoting a competing

vaccine product for Typhoid infection which was similar if not

identical in composition to the plaintiff's conjugated vaccine

product. Plaintiff immediately undertook market surveillance and

proceeded to cause searches to be made through the internet as well,

to determine the authenticity of such information and to determine if

any violation of its intellectual property rights was involved.

During such enquiry, a website was located which claimed to offer a

Typhoid vaccine named 'ZYVAC-TCV' purportedly manufactured

by defendant No.2. The product was marked as 'Out of Stock'. On

further enquiry, plaintiff was informed that the product of defendant

No.2 was likely to be available within a few weeks all across India
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 4 of 62</span>
 including New Delhi.        It also located promotional material

distributed by defendant No.2 in India in relation to this vaccine

product. Such promotional material used the registered trade mark

'TCV' of the plaintiff in a manner that is bound to cause confusion

amongst the target audience, viz., healthcare professional who are

accustomed to identifying the vaccine of the plaintiff as 'TCV'. It

is stated that the likelihood of defendant No.2's product being

passed off as 'TCV' of the plaintiff is very high since the trade

mark 'TCV' occupies a prominent location and position in such

promotional literature of defendant No.2. In addition, defendant

No.2 also uses the same reference 'ZYVAC-TCV' on its website

under the page titled 'Products'. It is averred that further searches

on the website of the Trade Mark Registry shows that the defendant

No.2 has apparently not filed any trade mark application for either

'ZYVAC-TCV' or even for 'ZYVAC' per se. It is stated that

defendant No.2 is slavishly copying not only the registered trade

mark 'TCV' of the plaintiff, but has also dishonestly adopted the

'ZYVAC' part of its product name from third party trade marks,

including of Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme and Alan Pharmaceuticals.

Hence, it is contended that the launch of a Typhoid vaccine by

defendant No.2 under the name 'ZYVAC-TCV' is a flagrant
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 5 of 62</span>
 infringement of the plaintiff's registered Trade Mark no. 2291745

for 'TCV' inasmuch as this trade mark forms an inextricable part of

the name adopted by defendant No.2. Defendant No.1 is also guilty

of infringement of said trade mark 'TCV' inasmuch as it provides a

channel for trade in products bearing the infringing the trade mark,

and within the jurisdiction of this court.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7.         It is the stand of the plaintiff that the use so far in

publicizing, and intended launch of a competing product with

identical and / or deceptively similar trade mark 'ZYVAC-TCV', is

confusing and being in relation to identical product category , it is

inherently a misrepresentation to the consuming public that the

defendant No.2's product has an association with the plaintiff and /

or that such use of a trade mark is authorized by the plaintiff, neither

of which are true or correct. It is also stated that the mala fides and

dishonesty of defendants are amply clear from the fact that the

promotional material for 'ZYVAC-TCV' says 'for children of all

ages', whereas it is actually the plaintiff's vaccine, which was the

first typhoid vaccine in India which was approved for administration

to infants and children below two years. According to the plaintiff,

given the worldwide reputation, registrations, substantial continuous

uninterrupted use, laudatory recognition of the plaintiff, the trade
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                             Page 6 of 62</span>
 marks 'TCV' and 'Typbar-TCV' qualifies as well-known trade

marks, which are associated with the plaintiff and therefore deserves

protection and the use of an identical and deceptively similar mark

by the defendants and in respect of identical product category, viz.

Typhoid vaccine takes unfair advantage and is detrimental to or

likely to dilute the distinctive character and repute of the plaintiff's

trade marks. That apart, the presence of the counterfeit products of

the defendant No.2 being deceptively similar to the plaintiff's

product, is prejudicial to the health of the typhoid patients who are

typically from economically disadvantaged sections of the society.

</p><p id="p_10">8.        Reply to the application has been filed by the defendant

No.2 wherein it is stated that defendant No.2 is not infringing the

plaintiff's trade mark for the reason that the defendant No.2's mark

'ZYVAC-TCV', when considered as a whole is entirely different

from the plaintiff's mark and the essential and prominent feature of

the defendant No.2's mark is 'ZYVAC'- which is a combination of

the words 'Zydus' and 'Vaccine'. Further, the Trade Mark 'TCV'

of the plaintiff is generic and descriptive of a category of vaccine

called 'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine' and cannot acquire any

distinctiveness through use and is therefore not entitled to protection

in law. That apart, the plaintiff cannot claim to be the first adopter
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                             Page 7 of 62</span>
 of the mark TCV and has concealed the fact that prior to the alleged

adoption of its mark in the year 2012, another entity had filed an

application for the registration of the mark TCV on June 24, 2009

claiming use since May 6, 2009. The said application was in fact

cited in the examination report of the plaintiff's application for the

mark 'TCV'. Hence, the plaintiff is clearly not the creator nor prior

user of the mark as alleged. It is stated that the trade mark 'TCV'

per se is not used by the plaintiff and no evidence has been adduced

to show use of the said mark. Even the abbreviation 'TCV' is not

being used in a trade mark sense by defendant No.2 in the mark

'ZYVAC-TCV'.          The defendant's mark 'ZYVAC-TCV' is a

coined, original and arbitrary trade mark and third parties are also

using the mark 'TCV' in a descriptive sense as the defendant No.2,

and the same is permissible in law.    It is stated that the defendant

No.2 is not passing off its product as that of the plaintiff and the

same is clear as (i) a comparison of the product packaging of the

defendant No.2's product with that of the plaintiff shows that there

is no similarity between the same; (2) no case of passing off is

established by the plaintiff as no evidence is forthcoming to prove

the goodwill of the marks of the plaintiff as the plaintiff has not

even been using the mark 'TCV' per se.          The reply seeks the

</p><p id="p_12">9.         Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for

the plaintiff apart from reiterating the stand taken in the application

submitted that Typhoid, caused by Salmonella Typhi (bacterium), is

a major endemic disease in Asia, Africa and Middle East, resulting

in 1,28,000 - 1,61,000 deaths annually. The disease burden is

probably the highest in India, with 494 deaths for every one lakh

persons per year. The earlier types of vaccines available were (1)

Parenteral Killed Whole Cell Vaccine (2).                      Oral-live attenuated

Vaccine; and (3) Typhoid-Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Vaccine.

According to him, due to the fact that earlier generation vaccines

were not producing immunization in children, a need was felt for a

new vaccine which can be given to young children as well. In the

year 2008, the plaintiff invented a bacterial vaccine and methods to

manufacture thereof the new generation of Typhoid Vaccine, being

'Typhoid Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate

Vaccine', for which the plaintiff acquired following patents:</p><pre id="pre_3">

plaintiff has been referred to in the industry as Typhoid Vi Capsular

Polysaccharide Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine' / Typhoid Vi

Conjugate Vaccine I.P. / ViP's - TT'etc., therefore proving that the

term 'TCV' was a creation of the plaintiff. The aforesaid fact is

clearly reflected from defendant No.2's packaging which prescribes

the vaccine differently as 'Typhoid Vi conjugate Vaccine I.P.' on

top of their mark whereas the plaintiff's brochure refers the vaccine

as 'Typhoid - Tetanus Toxoid Conjugated Vaccine'.                    Ever since

May 17, 2013, plaintiff has been granted license for commercial

manufacture of 'Typhoid Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Tetanus

Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine' in India.             The defendant No.2 was

nowhere in the picture until April, 2018 by which time the public

had associated the vaccine as belonging and owned by the plaintiff.

</p><p id="p_14">11.       It was further submitted that on February 29, 2012, the

plaintiff had applied for the registration of the two trade marks

'TYPBAR-TCV' (TM Application No. 2291743) and 'TCV' (TM

Application No. 2291745), separately, both in Class-5, covering

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                                  Page 10 of 62</span>

following the due procedure contemplated under <a href="/doc/698400/" id="a_3">Sections 20</a>, <a href="/doc/941683/" id="a_4">72</a>, <a href="/doc/1721053/" id="a_5">73</a>

of the Trade Marks Act, which envisages inviting opposition for

registration through public advertisement. No opposition was filed

under <a href="/doc/1187731/" id="a_6">Section 23</a> of the Trade Marks Act. Thereafter, trade marks

were granted to the plaintiff on September 15, 2016 and March 20,

2018 respectively and the same are valid and subsisting. Both trade

marks 'TCV' and 'TYPBAR-TCV' are unique and distinct. The

plaintiff has coined the term 'TCV'. Plaintiff is the first and prior

user of the mark 'TCV' since 2013 when it started its commercial

run for the said vaccine. The term 'TCV' has acquired

distinctiveness as a result of continuous use made by it and is now

solely and exclusively associated with the plaintiff.            In order to

prove distinctiveness, he has relied on the two parameters laid down

by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1630167/" id="a_7">Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. SIFFYNET

Solutions Pvt. Ltd</a>., (2004) 6 SCC 145, which are the volume of

sales and extent of advertisement. In this context, he had drawn the

attention of the Court to the sale figures of the plaintiff, as compared

to that of defendant No.2, in the following manner: -

 premier body on the health matters, has pre-qualified the plaintiff's

vaccine as the only vaccine for typhoid to be utilized for the UN

program, convincingly establishes that the plaintiff's trade mark has

achieved distinctiveness. He stated the defendants have relied on

the cases of <a href="/doc/1396867/" id="a_8">Cluett Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. v. Arrow Apparals</a>, 1998

(18) PTC 156 (<a href="/doc/1945028/" id="a_9">Bom) and Veerumal Praveen Kumar v. Needle

Industries (India) Ltd. and Ors</a>., 2001 (21) PTC 889 (Del.) to

submit that the distinctiveness will be lost by non-user. According

to Mr. Chandra, such an argument cannot be sustained in the eye of

law, for the simple reason that 'TCV' has been continuously used

by the plaintiff and also as 'TYPBAR-TCV' which itself is a

registered trade mark.    The registration of the trade marks is a

prima facie evidence of their validity under <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_10">Section 31</a> of the Trade

Marks Act, and any infringement thereof is actionable.        In this

regard, he has relied on the judgment of the full Bench of the

Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/19267666/" id="a_11">Lupin v. Johnson and Johnson</a>, 2014 SCC

Online Bom. 4596. He argued, even if it is assumed that the

aforesaid trade mark is registered in breach of <a href="/doc/520333/" id="a_12">Section 9(1)</a> of the

Trade Marks Act, still the trade mark cannot be declared as invalid,

as the plaintiff's trade mark has attained distinctiveness as mandated

under <a href="/doc/1021595/" id="a_13">Section 32</a> of the Trade Marks Act. He submitted that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 13 of 62</span>
 product packaging of the parties herein are as under:




</p><p id="p_17">                 DEFENDANT PACKAGING (IMAGE NO.1)




                   PLAINTIFF'S PACKAGING (IMAGE NO.2)



</p><p id="p_18">14.       He stated that the plaintiff's packaging has 'TCV'

surrounded by a protective semi-circular shield.              Similarly,

defendant no.2 has deceptively copied the shield around the term

'TCV' in their packaging.       Therefore, he submitted that the

aforesaid attempt of the defendant No.2, is to deceive and confuse

the consumers and thereby cause loss to the plaintiff herein by

riding upon the goodwill and reputation of the plaintiff. A similar

type of vaccine developed by Bio-Med is being sold in India under

the name 'PEDA Typh'. The defendant No.2 has made a reference
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 14 of 62</span>
 to the aforesaid typhoid vaccine 'PEDA Typh', to show that same is

a type of 'TCV' available in the market and therefore the 'TCV' is

not exclusive to the plaintiff. However, on a reference to, Vol. IV.

Pg. 12 of the defendant No.2's documents, it is evident that the

same is in fact a 'Typhoid Vi Conjugate Vaccine' and not 'TCV'

per se. He further submitted defendant No.2 has not produced any

evidence to prove that 'TCV' was a generic term. The articles and

material supplied by the defendant No.2 are all relatively recent,

post 2015, whereas plaintiff's product was already in the market

since 2013. There is not a single article / document / material, as

submitted by the defendant No.2, to point that 'TCV' was utilized

in a generic sense before 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_19">15.        He submitted that a probable reason why the plaintiff's

mark 'TCV' is being contended as a 'generic term' by the

defendant No.2 is because of the lack of a convenient substitute to

the term of 'Typhoid Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Tetanus Toxoid

Conjugate Vaccine'. The plaintiff's product, being the first of its

kind in the market, has acquired distinctiveness with respect to the

aforesaid trade mark 'TCV'. In support of his contention, he relied

on <a href="/doc/99787318/" id="a_14">Sunil Mittal v. Darzi</a> on Call, (2017) 242 DLT 62, Para 15

thereof.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_16"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                          Page 15 of 62</span><p id="p_20">
</p><p id="p_21"> 16.        He argued that the defendant No.2 has not applied for the

registration of its mark 'ZYVAC TCV'. This shows the malafide

intent of defendant No.2 in copying the 'TCV', without having a

registration on the same. Added to the above in an utter disrespect

to plaintiff's trade mark, the defendant No.2's brochure utilized the
         'TM'
symbol          after 'ZYVC-TCV'. This clearly portrays the malafide

intention of the defendant No.2 to ride on the goodwill of the

plaintiff herein.
</p>
<p id="p_22">17.        It was his submission that the defendant No.2, while

relying on the case of <a href="/doc/75117161/" id="a_15">Nestle India Ltd. v. Mood Hospitality Private

Limited</a>, 2010 (42) PTC 514 (Del.) has contended that 'TCV' is

only used as a suffix to ''ZYVAC', therefore, there is no similarity,

between the plaintiff's trade mark and the defendant's. However,

the facts of that case are easily distinguishable, having regard to the

fact that usage of the term 'YO!' therein was not as a trade mark,

rather was just used to 'call the attention'. In this case, the unique

and distinctive word coined by the Plaintiff i.e., 'TCV' is utilized

by the defendant No.2 to only cause confusion in the minds of the

buyers, accordingly, the presumption under <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_16">Section 29</a> (3) of the

<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_17">Trade Marks Act</a> shall operate in favour of the plaintiff. Moreover,

there are umpteen examples wherein by merely adding prefix to a
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 16 of 62</span>
 distinctive mark, the infringer i.e the defendant No.2 in this case,

cannot defeat the legitimate rights of the other party. He has relied

on the judgment in <a href="/doc/110309499/" id="a_18">Kamani Oil Industries Pvt. Ltd. v.

Bhuwaneshwar Refineries Pvt. Ltd</a>., 2014 (4) ABR 103. The use

of 'TCV' in the impugned mark of the defendant No.2 i.e.,

'ZYVAC-TCV' is an infringement of the registered trade mark of

the plaintiff and is already causing confusion in the minds of the

public. He further stated that in any case <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_19">Section 29</a> (3) of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_20">Trade

Marks Act</a>, contemplates that the Court shall presume the confusion

on the part of the public with regard to the identity of the goods and

services, if a registered trade mark is copied so as to be identical or

similar to the goods of the registered trade mark user. In the instant

case, 'TCV' is a registered trade mark of the plaintiff. The use of

'TCV' by the defendant No.2 does violence to <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_21">Section 29</a> (3) of the

<a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_22">Trade Marks Act</a> and therefore the Court ought to grant the

injunction, in view of the mandate of <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_23">Section 29</a> (3) of the Act.

</p><p id="p_23">18.       He submitted that defendant No.2 has contended that the

term 'TCV' is a generic term and using it along with 'ZYVAC' as a

prefix, makes it distinct from that of the plaintiff's trade marks. The

aforesaid contention cannot be sustained in the eye of law as 'TCV'

itself is registered trade mark of the plaintiff and has been associated
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                             Page 17 of 62</span>
 with the plaintiff's product. The very use of the 'TCV' by the

defendant No.2 is done to cash on the goodwill and reputation of the

plaintiff's product.   The sweat and labor of the plaintiff in

developing a product and creating the scheme of the product in the

mind of the public, is sought to be exploited by the defendant No.2.

Further the objections, raised, at the time of grant of the trade

marks, have been considered by the Registry before the grant to the

plaintiff and therefore, cannot be looked into at this stage of the

proceedings wherein the plaintiff has established a prima-facie case

in its favour.   Further, it is well established principle that the

plaintiff is not expected to sue all small-time infringers who may not

be affecting plaintiff's business. He relied on the judgment of the

Division Bench of this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/48216667/" id="a_24">Pankaj Goel v. Dabur

India Ltd</a>., 2008 (38) PTC 49 (Del).
</p>
<p id="p_24">19.       He argued that defendant No.2 has failed to satisfy that

the registration of the plaintiff's trade mark is ex-facie illegal,

fraudulent or shocks the conscience of the Court. Defendant No.2

has failed to discharge the very high threshold placed on it. He

placed reliance on the case of Lupin (Supra). He submitted that the

case of the <a href="/doc/39264970/" id="a_25">Marico Ltd. v. Agro Tech Foods Ltd</a>., 2010 (44) PTC

736 (Del.) was one wherein the usage of the term 'LOW ABSORB'
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 18 of 62</span>
 being a common descriptive word indicating the nature of edible oil

could not be upheld by the Court as it was ex facie illegal and

shocked the conscious of the Court. However, in this case at hand,

the very high threshold set by the case of Lupin (Supra) for the

defendant No.2 is not discharged.
</p>
<p id="p_25">20.       According to Mr. Chandra, the defendant No.2 has raised

a contention in the present suit challenging the validity of the

plaintiff's trade mark, without first approaching the appropriate

authority i.e., Registrar or IPAB as the case may be, for setting aside

the same, as envisaged under various provisions of the <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_26">Trade Marks

Act</a> (<a href="/doc/806033/" id="a_27">Section 57</a> and <a href="/doc/1331119/" id="a_28">124</a>). In this regard, he has placed reliance on

para 41 of <a href="/doc/38601623/" id="a_29">Patel Field Marshal Agencies v. P.M. Diesels Limited

and Others</a>, (2018) 2 SCC 112.
</p>
<p id="p_26">21.       It is also contended that, the defendant No.2, in breach of

the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in the Patel Field

Marshal Agencies (Supra) inasmuch as, it has neither sought the

permission of this Court nor has this Court given a prima facie

finding on the invalidity, for it to approach the concerned Registrar

or the IPAB as the case may be, during pendency of the Suit.

</p><p id="p_27">22.       Finally, Mr. Chandra submitted that the plaintiff is a

Company which believes in innovation and is not merely producing
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 19 of 62</span>
 generic drugs in India. If the injunction in this matter is not granted,

then the investment made by plaintiff in Research and Development

would be in jeopardy. Every day of delay is causing irreparable loss

/ harm to the plaintiff herein.     According to him, the plaintiff

satisfies the required ingredients, of a prima facie case, balance of

convenience and has a good case on merits, for seeking an interim

injunction against the defendants herein. Matters pertaining to

infringement of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are special

cases. Mere compensation can never be treated as an efficacious

remedy in IPR infringement matters and an injunction is therefore

necessary to prevent the defendants from invading or threatening to

invade the plaintiff's right to, or enjoyment of the property.

</p><p id="p_28">23.       On the other hand, it was the submission of Mr. Anil

Sapra, learned Sr. Counsel appearing for the defendant No.2 that the

product in question in the present suit is a type of vaccine for

Typhoid, being one of the three vaccines available for the disease,

viz.   Typhoid    Conjugate Vaccine (TCV), Unconjugated Vi

Polysaccharide (ViPS) and Live attenuated Ty21a Vaccine. The

marks in question in the present matter are 'TYPBAR-TCV' and

'TCV' of the plaintiff and the mark 'ZYVAC-TCV' of the

defendant No.2.     The vaccine 'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine', is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                             Page 20 of 62</span>
 commonly known world over, especially as part of medical journals

and in the medical community as 'TCV'. Therefore, as per the

'Spectrum of Distinctiveness of Marks' propounded by McCarthy,

the mark 'TCV' being a generic abbreviation of the product, as also

being descriptive of the goods it relates to, is incapable of trade

mark protection. So it, follows that generic marks i.e. marks that

indicate a type / kind / variety of the goods being sold thereunder

are incapable of acquiring distinctiveness even through years of use

and have no trade mark significance.
</p>
<p id="p_29">24.       He also stated that the mark 'TCV' is descriptive of the

product in question, and therefore, cannot be granted exclusive

protection under the law in the absence of acquired distinctiveness.

He further submitted, 'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine' is the name of

the vaccine, which is commonly abbreviated as 'TCV' for ease of

reference, such that all 'TCV' vaccines are generically and

colloquially referred to as 'TCV'. He also stated that published

scientific articles clearly refer to 'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccines' as

'TCV'. In this regard, he has relied on page 86 and Page 91@92,

Volume    III,   plaintiff's   documents;   Pages   48@49,    64-66,

69@74,75,78,81, Volume IV Defendant no.2's Documents.

Therefore, as per the 'Spectrum of Distinctiveness', the mark
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 21 of 62</span>
 'TCV' is generic, and incapable of being distinctive - as such, no

party can claim exclusivity over the same. Further, a highly generic

mark is incapable of trade mark protection (Ref:- Cadila

Healthcare Limited v Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing

Federation Limited &amp; Ors, 2009 (41) PTC 336 (Del)) and any

registration granted in respect of a generic mark will also not grant

sanctity to the mark. The grant of a trade mark registration is only

prima facie evidence of its validity and the presumption of prima

facie validity of registration is a rebuttable presumption. In such

cases, the Court has the power to go behind the registration,

specially at the interim stage. Thus, an abbreviation cannot be used

as a trade mark if it is a generic term and has clear generic

connotations. In such cases, the defendant No.2 would have, as

good a right to a descriptive title as the plaintiff. Further, the mark

TCV is descriptive of the product in question, as it merely describes

one of the three types of typhoid vaccines available. A descriptive

mark can only be afforded protection in case it has acquired

distinctiveness on facts.

        application for the mark 'TCV' was first filed by one
        Sanjeev Thakkar, in relation to medicinal preparations
        in the year 2009 claiming user since May 2009 i.e.
        well before the plaintiff sought to claim rights in the

<blockquote id="blockquote_3">        b. No evidence has been adduced by the plaintiff that

        in fact 'TYPBAR-TCV'. Even on its own website,
        the plaintiff has used the marks 'TYPBAR' and
        'TYPBAR-TCV'. Non-use of the mark 'TCV' has
        been cleverly concealed in order to mislead the Court.
        It is settled law that a mark that is not used in

      only of six years since 2012 onwards as mentioned in
      para 3 of the plaint, that too of the mark 'TYPBAR -

<p id="p_31"> 26.       Mr. Sapra submitted that defendant no.2's mark

'ZYVAC-TCV' when considered as a whole, is entirely different

from the plaintiff's mark 'TYPBAR-TCV' and the essential and

prominent feature of the defendant No.2's mark is 'ZYVAC'. It is

settled law that while comparing trade marks, the competing marks

should be considered as a whole (Ref:- Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt

Sharma v Navaratna Pharmaceutical Labs, AIR 1965 SC 980)

and not broken into fragments and parts; competing marks should

not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in

them, since the whole of a mark is greater than the sum of its parts

(Ref:- Marico (supra). The test, therefore, is if one mark bears

such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would likely to

mislead a person usually dealing with one to mistake it for the

other. (Ref:- <a href="/doc/880032/" id="a_30">Parle Products Ltd. v. J.P and Co</a>., 1972 (3) SCR

289; Para 9,).
</p>
<p id="p_32">27.       It was submitted by Mr. Sapra that by applying the

abovementioned test, the marks 'ZYVAC-TCV' and 'TYPBAR-

TCV' bear no resemblance or similarity and therefore eliminate any

likelihood of confusion or deception. The essential feature of the

defendant No.2's mark is 'ZYVAC' and not 'TCV', as it is evident

from a mere glance at defendant No.2's product packaging. The
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 25 of 62</span>
 mark 'ZYVAC' is a coined mark and is a unique combination of

the words ZYDUS and VACCINE, and as such, has no meaning,

thus qualifying as an arbitrary and fanciful mark. Without

prejudice, while a mark is to be considered in its entirety, yet, it is

permissible to accord more importance to a dominant element in

composite marks. It is not a violation of the anti-dissection rule to

view the dominant component parts in order to decipher the

probable consumer reaction. (Ref:- <a href="/doc/42490190/" id="a_31">South India Beverages Pvt.

Ltd. v. General Mills Marketing Inc</a>., (2015 (61) PTC231 (Del)).

Any reference to the mark 'ZYVAC' relates solely to defendant

No. 2, owing to the enormous reputation and goodwill associated

with the mark 'ZYDUS'. Members of the trade and consumers at

large associate the mark 'ZYVAC' exclusively with 'ZYDUS' and

the Zydus Group in view of the reputation of the defendant No.2's

group companies and the various medicines provided under marks

containing 'ZY'. The very adoption of the arbitrary mark 'ZYVAC'

shows the defendant No.2's bona fide intention, and clarifies that it

only seeks to convey to consumers that the product in question is a

'TCV' vaccine manufactured by the Zydus Group.

</p><p id="p_33">28.       He further submitted, in pharmaceutical products, trade

marks are usually adopted using one of the following three features
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 26 of 62</span>
 of the product, or their combination: (i) A part of the name of the

drug or the INN name (eg: NAXDOM for Domperidone and

Naproxen Tablets, CETRIZINE for levocetrizine tablets), (ii) a part

of the name of the manufacturer of the drug and/or (eg: LEVOCIP

for Levocetrezine sold by Cipla Limited) (iii) a completely fanciful

name that had no relation to the above (eg: COMBIFLAM for

Ibuprofen and paracetamol tablets) (Ref:- Cadila Healthcare

Limited v Aureate Healthcare Pvt Ltd., 2012 (51) PTC 585(Del),

Para 27). In such cases, the importance of the prefix of the word

should be given due weightage and important, in case where the

suffix is common. Where the suffix is common, regard must be had

to the earlier portion of the word which distinguishes one from the

other. Where the suffix is common, the earlier portion of the word

is the natural, necessary and in fact, the actual mark of distinction

(Ref: Cadila Healthcare Limited v Dabur India Limited, (1997) 17

PTC 417). Such being the settled position of law, it is clear that

there can be no confusion whatsoever when the marks 'TYPBAR-

TCV' is compared to the mark 'ZYVAC-TCV'.
</p>
<p id="p_34">29.       Mr. Sapra submitted that the defendant No.2's use of the

mark 'TCV' is not in the trade mark sense as envisaged in <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_32">Section

29</a> of the Trade Marks Act, and is thus within the ambit of the law
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 27 of 62</span>
 under <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_33">Sections 35</a> and <a href="/doc/90290/" id="a_34">30(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act. An action for

infringement under <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_35">Section 29(1)</a> of the Trade Marks Act, could

only be brought where the defendant uses a mark 'as a trade mark'

i.e. in a manner 'indicative of trade origin' (Ref:- Nestle v Mood

Hospitality, (2010 (42) PTC 14(Del), para 12). If a mark is not

being used in a 'trade mark sense' but merely in a descriptive

sense, it is covered in the exceptions under <a href="/doc/90290/" id="a_36">Section 30(2)</a> and

<a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_37">Section 35</a> of the Trade Marks Act. If a defence of use of a

descriptive mark as an indication of kind, quality or characteristic

of goods (under <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_38">Section 35</a>) is to succeed, the term used is required

to be generic and that the use of the term be bona fide. It has been

held that if a sufficiently distinctive term is used along with the

descriptive term, the same would qualify as bona fide use. Thus,

the presence of the word 'ZYVAC' along with the descriptive

abbreviation 'TCV' in defendant No. 2's, makes the mark

'ZYVAC-TCV' sufficiently distinctive and clearly indicates the

bona fide intention of the defendant No. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_35">30.       He submitted that the packaging and overall getup of the

competing marks is different and thus no action of infringement or

passing off lies against the defendants.      A bare perusal of the

packaging of the products, reveal the pronounced differences in the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 28 of 62</span>
 packaging of the products. The differences combined with the fact

that the prefix in both the marks are entirely different, he submitted

that no action of infringement or passing off lies against defendant

No 2.
</p>
<p id="p_36">31.         It was the submission of Mr. Sapra that the plaintiff's

contention that it is the first manufacturer of the 'Typhoid

Conjugate Vaccine' and is entitled to the exclusive use of the mark

'TCV', is highly misconceived. The plaintiff has claimed in the

pleadings that it is the first entity to sell a 'TCV' vaccine. In this

regard, even if the same is assumed to be true, it does not entitle the

plaintiff    to   debar   future   manufacturers    by    adapting   a

generic/descriptive term as a mark. Such a situation would impinge

on the legitimate use of the mark in future by any other

manufacturer.
</p>
<p id="p_37">32.         Mr. Sapra submitted that the arguments advanced on

behalf of the plaintiff are devoid of merit and the plaintiff has

sought to argue beyond its pleadings. It is a well settled position of

law that the parties cannot argue beyond their pleadings. He stated

that during the course of arguments, it was contended on behalf of

the plaintiff that the only players in the market using the term

'TCV' are the plaintiff and the defendant No.2. However, it is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 29 of 62</span>
 relevant to note that there are two other players in the market that

manufacture the said vaccine, apart from the parties in the present

suit. In view of the same, it cannot be contended that the defendant

No. 2 is the only party that chose to use the mark 'TCV' in order to

ride on the alleged goodwill of the plaintiff's product. He submitted

that for such an argument to sustain, there should be considerable

number of parties in the same trade, and only defendant No.2

choosing the same mark as that of the plaintiff. However, as the

facts of the present case show, 'TCV' is presently at a nascent stage

of development for commercial sale, and thus there are very few

players in the market, rendering the argument of the plaintiff

baseless.
</p>
<p id="p_38">33.         It was the submission of Mr. Sapra, that it was contended

on behalf of the plaintiff that the mark 'TCV' has acquired

distinctiveness through years of use, however, no such pleading has

been made in the plaint, thus, the argument should be rejected

outrightly. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, he highlighted that a

generic mark can never acquire distinctiveness, as has been

propounded by McCarthy and reiterated in the Cadila Healthcare

Limited v Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation

Limited &amp; Ors, 2009 (41) PTC 336 (Del).          Further, it has been
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 30 of 62</span>
 stated by the plaintiff during the course of hearing that the plaintiff

has registered patents for the vaccine in various jurisdictions and

has also applied for a patent in India. He submitted that the

aforesaid    argument    should    be    rejected    as    (a)   patent

registration/pending application for patent registration is entirely

irrelevant for the present trade mark infringement dispute and (b)

the aforesaid argument was not averred by the plaintiff in the

pleadings. He reiterated that a party cannot go beyond its pleadings.

He submitted that the plaintiff has, during the course of the hearing,

taken the argument that alleged 'protective semi-circular shield'

over the mark of the plaintiff has been copied by the defendant No.

</p><p id="p_39">2. In this regard, he stated the symbol present in the mark of the

plaintiff, can by no stretch of imagination, be called a 'shield'. In

any event, the symbol is entirely different from the defendant

No.2's mark. Further, as is the case in most of the arguments taken

by the plaintiff at the stage of hearing, the aforesaid, has not been

pleaded in the plaint. According to him such submissions point

towards the desperate attempts of improving the case, which

evidently is devoid of merit.
</p>
<p id="p_40">34.         It was his submission that the plaintiff has sought to

distinguish the case of Marico (supra) by saying that the marks
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 31 of 62</span>
 therein (LOW ABSORB and LOSORB) were evidently generic and

thus would not apply to the facts of the present case. However, the

reliance was placed on the said judgment to substantiate the

following propositions of law:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      a. That companies/persons who are first of the block in the
      market to use a said mark which is descriptive in nature should
      be discouraged from claiming exclusivity on the same;
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_9">      b. Further, it was categorically held in the judgment that if a
      defendant uses his own word mark as a trade mark prominently
      in addition to the descriptive word mark which the plaintiff
      claims to be his trade mark, nothing further is required to show
      the bona fides of the defendant against whom infringement of a
      registered trade mark is alleged.</blockquote><p id="p_41">


</p><p id="p_42">      According to Mr. Sapra, both the aforesaid principles remain

unrebutted by the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_43">35.         According to Mr. Sapra, Mr. Chandra during the course

of arguments stated that the cases of Cluett Peabody (supra),

Veerumal (supra) have no application in the present case since the

mark 'TCV' is being used as part of 'TYPBAR-TCV'. According

to him, the aforesaid contention of the plaintiff points directly

towards the mala fide of the plaintiff, since it fails to answer the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 32 of 62</span>
 pertinent question which is: why has the plaintiff registered both the

marks 'TYPBAR TCV' and 'TCV' when in fact it had no intention

of using the mark 'TCV' per se. He stated that the plaintiff has

failed to justify or answer the aforesaid question all throughout the

pleadings and oral arguments, clearly evidencing that the

registration over the mark 'TCV' is devoid of merit. According to

him, it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff during the course of

the hearing that the fact that the defendant No.2's mark is

'ZYVAC-TCV' is immaterial since the whole mark cannot be

copied with the addition of another word with it. Taking the

example of the mark 'TATA', it was stated that "xyz TATA" would

still be an infringement. According to Mr. Sapra, the aforesaid

argument is entirely misplaced, while comparing two competing

marks, the 'essential features' of the marks are to be seen. Reliance

is placed on the Supreme Court judgment in Ramdev Food

products v. Arvindbhai Ramabhai Patel, (2006) 8 SCC 726.

Owing to the generic nature of the mark 'TCV', it is an inescapable

conclusion that the essential and dominant feature of the Plaintiffs

mark is 'TYPBAR' and not 'TCV'. Furthermore, the essential

feature of the mark of the defendant No 2 is 'ZYVAC', since the

defendant No. 2 manufactures and sells numerous medicines under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                            Page 33 of 62</span>
 the 'ZY' prefix, indicating its origin from defendant No. 2 and none

else. Thus, the analogy drawn with TATA trade mark is erroneous,

since TATA is the essential and dominant feature in the mark of the

proprietor, which, if used by any other party along with other words

would indeed constitute infringement, whereas 'TCV' standalone is

a generic mark and is standalone not being used by the plaintiff,

disentitling it from being the essential feature of the plaintiffs mark.

</p><p id="p_44">36.       He submitted the reliance placed by Mr. Chandra on the

judgment of Lupin (supra) is misplaced since though a high burden

of proof lies on the defendant to prove a prima facie case that a

registration is invalid, such burden has been discharged by

defendant No. 2 in the present case since the mark 'TCV' has not

been used at all. Thus, the registration is patently illegal, obtained

even when the plaintiff had no intention to ever using the mark

standalone. Further, the plaintiff's argument regarding seeking

permission of the Court before filing a rectification is also

misplaced since the judgement of the Supreme Court in Patel Field

Marshal (supra), clarifies the position by categorically holding that

no permission of the court is required before initiating a

rectification proceeding.

</p><p id="p_49">38.       Having heard the learned counsel for the parties,

the issue which needs to be adjudicated in this application is

whether the plaintiff is entitled to an interim order seeking a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 37 of 62</span>
 restraint against the defendants from using the mark

'ZYVAC-TCV'.           It was contended by Mr. Chandra that

earlier three types of vaccines were available; for treating

typhoid (i) Parenteral Killed Whole Cell Vaccine; (ii) Oral-

live attenuated Vaccine; and (iii) Typhoid-Vi Capsular

Polysaccharide Vaccine. As these vaccines were not

producing immunization in children, a need was felt for a

new vaccine, which can be given to young children. It is the

case of the plaintiff that in the year 2008, it had invented a

new generation of Typhoid vaccine, being 'Typhoid Vi

Capsular     Polysaccharide     Tetanus   Toxoid    Conjugate

Vaccine' which is also referred in the industry as 'Typhoid Vi

Conjugate Vaccine IP / ViP's-TT', and accordingly coined

the abbreviation / acronym of the said vaccine as 'TCV' by

applying for the registration of two marks 'TYPBAR-TCV /

TCV' in the year 2012, which were granted in the year 2016

and 2018 respectively. It started manufacturing in May 2013

and is a prior user.
</p>
<p id="p_50">39.        Mr. Chandra had stated that the revenue of the

plaintiff from the selling of the vaccine alone was INR

108.82 Crores in the year 2017-18.        His case is that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                           Page 38 of 62</span>
 launch of 'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine' by defendant No.2 in

the year 2018 under the name of 'ZYVAC-TCV' is apparent

violation of the plaintiff's trade mark 'TCV' / 'TYPBAR-

TCV', inasmuch as 'TCV' forms part of the mark 'ZYVAC-

TCV'.
</p>
<p id="p_51">40.       The case as argued by Mr. Sapra is that, the mark

'TCV' of the plaintiff is generic abbreviation of the product

as also being descriptive of the goods it relates to, that is

'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine' and cannot acquire any

distinctiveness through use and is therefore not entitled to

protection of law. It was also contended that the mark

'ZYVAC' is a composite mark in which 'ZY' are the first

two alphabets of 'ZYDUS' and 'VAC' are the three alphabets

of the word vaccine.
</p>
<p id="p_52">41.       So, from the above, it is noted that the plaintiff

has registered marks 'TCV' and 'TYPBAR-TCV', whereas

the mark of the defendant No.2 is 'ZYVAC-TCV' for the

same vaccine.
</p>
<p id="p_53">42.       So, first of all, it is necessary to look into the plea

of       Mr. Sapra, that the mark 'TCV' being a generic

abbreviation / acronym of 'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine' and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                             Page 39 of 62</span>
 being descriptive of the goods i.e. vaccine, the marks are

incapable of trade mark protection.
</p>
<p id="p_54">43.         The defendant No.2 has placed on record

literature of WHO, wherein the descriptive word, 'Typhoid

Conjugate Vaccine' has been described as one of the three

types of vaccines, other two being unconjugated 'Vi

Polysaccharide (ViPS)' and 'Live attenuated Ty21a'

available for treating Typhoid. The Division Bench of this

Court in Marico Limited (supra) has held that the

abbreviation of descriptive words cannot and should not be

given protection as a trade mark. The Division Bench also

in para 6 of the said judgment has referred to the fact that if

a person is first of the blocks in using descriptive words as a

trade mark or its abbreviation that will not entitle such

person to exclusively use the descriptive word mark or its

abbreviation as a trade mark, and for this purpose reference

has been made to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_39">Section 9</a>, <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_40">30</a> and <a href="/doc/1344839/" id="a_41">35</a> of

the Trade Marks Act. In fact, it was further held that even if

the descriptive word mark or its abbreviation is registered

even then such registration can be got cancelled.          The

relevant paragraph 6 of the judgment is reproduced as

         signify     the   plaintiff    as    its     manufacturer.
         Therefore, in order to so find, that use of a
         descriptive term or a term that is publici juris,
         amounts to infringement, the plaintiff must
         establish that use of the term has become
         synonymous with its mark, or that the reputation
         of the mark is of such nature that the public is
         likely to get confused and would attribute the
         defendants' goods to the plaintiff's. The more
         descriptive the term employed or alleged to be
         infringing, higher the standard of evidence
         required to establish that term has in fact
         acquired      secondary       meaning       and     thereby,

              therefore, be taken as a whole word. Each of the

              common vowel 'o'. The combined effect is to
              produce an alliteration. The affidavits of the
              appellant indicate that the last three letters "VIT"
              is a well known common abbreviation used in the

              on the Register of about 57 trade marks which

              the terminal syllable "VIT" in the two marks is both
              descriptive and common to the trade. If greater

              two words, it is difficult to hold that one will be

<blockquote id="blockquote_34">       "6. There are two things which impress us. Firstly, the
       appellant is not manufacturing any one product such as
       the boosters, which has been mainly taken into
       consideration by the High Court. He is producing various
       electrical and electronic apparatus in many of which
       micro-chip technology is used. Even the boosters which
       he manufactures and sells are of two types, viz.,
       transistorized boosters and Integrated Circuit boosters
       whereas the respondent-plaintiff manufacturers aerial
       boosters only of the first type. Thus micro-chip
       technology being the base of many of the products, the
       word 'micro' has much relevance in describing the
       products. Further, the word 'micro' being descriptive of
       the micro technology used for production of many
       electronic goods which daily come to the market, no one
       can claim monopoly over the use of the said word.
       Anyone producing any product with the use of micro chip
       technology would be justified in using the said word as a
       prefix to his trade name. What is further, those who are
       familiar with the use of electronic goods know fully well
       and are not only likely to be misguided or confused
       merely by, the prefix 'micro' in the trade name. Once,
       therefore, it is held that the word 'micro' is a common or
       general name descriptive of the products which are sold
       or of the technology by which the products are
       manufactured, and the users of such products are,
       therefore, not likely to be misguided or confused by the
       said word, the only question which has to be prima facie
       decided at this stage is whether the words 'tel' and 'nix' in
       the trade names of the appellant and the respondent are
       deceptive for the buyers and users and are likely to
       misguide or confuse them in purchasing one for the other.

<blockquote id="blockquote_36">       7. On the aspect of passing off, in my opinion, the
       plaintiff has no real prospect to succeed in the suit.
       This is firstly because the main trademark of the

       trademark      of   VAC-PAC      whereas     the    main
       trademark of the defendant is totally different being
       GMM/arc with the use of VAC-PAC. There is no
       identity or deceptive similarity qua the aforesaid two
       main trademarks of the parties and the different
       trademarks are such to distinguish the goods of the
       plaintiff from that of the defendant, and hence no
       case is made out of passing off."

 with 'TCV' being generic abbreviation / acronym of

'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine' which is not a coined word

and being common to trade as such, needs to be excluded

for comparison with 'ZYVAC' of the defendant. On such

exclusion what remains is 'TYPBAR' of plaintiff and

'ZYVAC' of defendant No.2.          These are the essential

features of the marks of the parties and not 'TCV'. From

the comparison of these two marks, there is no deceptive

similarity between the two and as such there is no

reasonable probability for confusion between the words

either visually or phonetically.    That apart, the reliance

placed by Mr. Sapra on Cadila Healthcare Limited v Dabur

India Limited, (1997) 17 PTC 417, wherein it is held that

where suffix is common, the earlier portion of the word is

natural, necessary and in fact, the actual mark of distinction

is justified.

<p id="p_71">56.         Further, I note in the written statement filed by

defendant No.2, it is stated in para 13 of sub-para (iv) that

the 'TCV', per se is not being used by the plaintiff and no

evidence has been adduced to show use of the said words as

a trade mark. This stand of the defendant No.2 though

that the plaintiff is actually selling the vaccine under the

mark 'TCV'.

Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. (supra), which was followed in

Veerumal Praveen Kumar (supra), on which the reliance

has been placed by Mr. Sapra, that if the mark is not used in

commerce, it affords no rights. The relevant para in Cluett

Peabody &amp; Co. Inc. (supra) reads as under:

<p id="p_73">       "37. XXX        XXX          XXX

       to sue for infringement of registered trade mark
       irrespective of the fact whether it is used or not
       used. Registration confers on the proprietor a
       monopoly right over the use of the mark. But,
       proprietary rights in a trade mark acquired by use
       are superior to rights obtained by registration
       under the Act. This is the main defence put up on
       behalf of the defendants in this Notice of Motion.
       Therefore, prior user of the marks should be
       protected against monopoly rights conferred by the
       Act. (Pages 5 &amp; 6 of Narayanan). A trade mark has
       no meaning even if it is registered unless it is used
       in relation to goods. Otherwise, its non-use may

       the use dies. Where there are no goods offered for
       sale, there is no use of trade mark."

Kumar (supra) reads as under:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">       29.      We are in agreement with the view of the
       learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court
       that if there is non user for a long period of time
       then by mere registration of the mark continuing
       the respondents would not be entitled to any
       injunction. This view is further reinforced by the
       judgment in Imperial Group's case (supra) wherein
       it was held that where there is no trading to give
       rise to a goodwill there is no interest to be
       protected by a trademark and such a trademark
       cannot exist in vacuum."

<p id="p_76">59.       That apart, it is also noted that the plaintiff's

packaging of the vaccine is dark blue in colour whereas the

defendant No.2's is light blue. The words 'TCV' in the

plaintiff's packaging are written in orange whereas in the

defendant No.2's packaging, they are in green colour.

Further what is significant is, on the packaging of both the

parties the words 'Typhoid Vi Capsular Polysaccharide

 Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine' (in the case of

plaintiff) and 'Typhoid Tetanus Toxoid Conjugated

Vaccine' (in the case of defendant No.2) are written. The

same clearly highlight / signifies the nature of the product,

to be vaccine, that too of similar type. So, a consumer can

easily make out what 'TCV' stands for.

<p id="p_77">60.       Even the plea of Mr. Chandra that the words

'TCV' on the defendant's packaging has a protective semi-

circular shield similar to the one on the plaintiff's

packaging is also not appealing. The positioning of the

shield on 'TCV' in both the cases is different and has no

resemblance. The plea of Mr. Chandra that the plaintiff is

the first manufacturer of the 'Typhoid Conjugate Vaccine'

and as such is entitled to exclusive use of the trade mark

'TCV' is also not appealing.

          less a descriptive expression as found in the
          English language for claiming the same to be
          an exclusive trademark and which descriptive
          word mark bears an indication to the product's
          kind, quality, use or characteristic etc. This is
          our view is in accordance with the spirit of

<p id="p_79">62.        That apart, I have already held that 'TCV'

being an abbreviation, is not capable of being registered

as a trade mark and also that the mark 'ZYVAC-TCV' is

not deceptively similar to the mark 'TYPBAR-TCV'. So,

it is inconsequential if the plaintiff is using 'TYPBAR-

TCV' earlier to the defendants as one of the plea of Mr.

Sapra was that the plaintiff is not the first one to adopt the

words, 'TCV', inasmuch as the application for mark

'TCV' was first filed by one Sanjeev Thakkar, in relation

to medicinal preparations in the year 2009. This aspect

has not been denied by the plaintiff in its replication. The

relevant part of the same reads as under:

       Written Statement are denied in toto as false and
       incorrect, and reliance is placed on the
       documents and evidence placed on record with
       the plaint. It is denied that the TCV per se
       registration was obtained by Plaintiff without
       any bona fide intent of use, and on the contrary
       such trade mark has been extensively used by the
       Plaintiff and is recognized as belonging to the
       Plaintiff in the field of typhoid vaccines. It is
       denied that the registration for TCV is liable to
       be removed from the Register under Section 9 or
       any other ground. It is reiterated that the non-
       raising of Section 9 as an objection is clear
       proof that as of 2012 when the trade mark
       application was filed, Plaintiff was the first
       coiner and adopter of the expression in respect
       of typhoid vaccines. It is denied that there has
       been no use of TCV® as a trade mark by the
       Plaintiff, and on the contrary, the documents
       filed with plaint show that such mark is
       inextricably and indelibly associated in the
       minds of the public with the Plaintiff alone. It is
       further submitted that the submission regarding
       distinction between "prescription drugs" and

          "over the counter' drugs has no merit or basis, in
         as much as it does not address the inherent
         confusion in the minds of the weaker sections of
         the patient population who may be sold the
         Defendant's product as "TCV" belonging to the
         Plaintiff."
</blockquote><p id="p_81">63.        In the absence of denial, it must be held that

Sanjeev Thakkar has coined the mark 'TCV' in 2009.

That apart, during his submissions it was stated by Mr.

Chandra that the plaintiff is not expected to sue all small

time infringers who may not be affecting plaintiff's

business by referring to the judgment of this Court in the

case of Pankaj Goel (supra) is concerned, the same

shall not help the case of the plaintiff as it is held by this

Court in FDC Ltd. (supra) that the existence of third

party / parties clearly depicts that medicinal products by

different entities, with similar words 'TCV' can co-exist

in the market without causing deception or confusion. It

follows, there cannot be any claim for infringement or

passing off.

<p id="p_82">64.        That apart I also note, that the defendant No.2

has applied for registration of the mark "ZYVAC" only


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60"> CS(COMM) 1248/2018                               Page 59 of 62</span>
 and not 'TCV', which also demonstrate that the

defendant No.2, do not intend to use the words "TCV"

in a trade mark sense.
</p>
<p id="p_83">65.       In so far as the judgments referred to by Mr.

Chandra are concerned, he referred to Satyam Infoway

Ltd. (Supra), to contend that it is not necessary to

establish long user, to establish reputation, it would

depend upon the volume of sales and extent of

advertisement.    I may state here in view of my

conclusion above, this judgment, has no applicability.

</p><p id="p_84">66.       Further he has relied upon the Judgment of

the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of

Lupin (supra) to contend that there is a strong

presumption in law as to the validity of registration of

the mark. There is no dispute on the proposition it lays

down. But in the facts of this case, as I have held, the

registration of the words 'TCV' is prima facie invalid,

the judgment has no applicability.
</p>
<p id="p_85">67.       In so far as his reliance on the Judgment in the

case of Kumani Oil Industries Pvt. Ltd. (supra) to

contend that mere prefixing to a mark, the infringer

 cannot defeat the legitimate rights of the plaintiff is

concerned, I have already held, that the words 'TCV'

are not capable of being used as a trade mark and the

prefix "ZYVAC" is clearly different from the mark

'TYPBAR'. The Judgment is clearly distinguishable.

</p><p id="p_86">68.       Similarly, Patel Field Marshal Agencies

(Supra) shall also have no applicability.        Rather the

word 'TCV' being incapable of registration, this Court

has prima-facie held the registration is invalid. An issue

has to be framed as to the invalidity of the mark 'TCV'

to enable defendant No.2 to approach the statutory

authority to decide the same.
</p>
<p id="p_87">69.       In so far as the Judgment in the case of Sunil

Mittal and Anr. (supra) is concerned, the said Judgment

is clearly distinguishable on facts inasmuch as this Court

negated the argument that mark "Darzi" is generic /

descriptive and by holding that the mark being used by

the plaintiff for the last 20 years, granted injunction in

favour of the plaintiff against the defendant.

</p><p id="p_88">70.       In view of my above discussion, this Court is

of the view that the plaintiff has not made out any case

 for grant of interim relief, in the manner prayed for, in

its favour. The application is accordingly dismissed. It

is made clear that the aforeasaid is a tentative view.
