FINAL ORDER NO.    60601/2017

Per : Devender Singh

</pre><p id="p_5">	This appeal is filed by the Revenue against the Order-in- Appeal No. Chandigarh-Committee-Review-15-2009 dtd 12/08/2009 passed by the Commr. of Central Excise, Ludhiana.
</p><p id="p_6">2.1	Brief facts of the case are that the respondents are engaged in the manufacture of Centreless Grinding Machines, Planning Machines, Round Bar Straightening Machines and Duplex Grinding Machines etc falling under chapter 84 of the Central Excise Tariff and are availing SSI Exemption on the said goods. They were not registered with the Central Excise Department.
</p><p id="p_7">2.2	On the basis of intelligence, investigations revealed that the respondents were using brand name RIAT on the said machines manufactured by them. 
</p><p id="p_8">2.3	In his statement, Shri Manjeet Singh, Partner of the respondents admitted that they were aware that RIAT is the Trade Mark of M/s RMT and that they (M/s RMT) appear to be the inventor of the said brand name RIAT.  A statement of Shri Davinder Singh, Partner of M/s RMT was also recorded wherein he stated that they were the original owners of the brand name RIAT.  M/s RMT was a partner firm of four brothers namely Sh. Kesar Singh, Sh. Ajit Singh, Sh. Tegbahadur Singh and Sh. Navrattan Singh.  Of these, Sh. Ajit Singh and Sh. Tegbahadur Singh retired from the partnership of M/s RMT and formed their own firm separately under the name of M/s RIAT Grinders.  They were allowed to manufacture the above said four machines under the brand name RIAT as per the Deed of Dissolution of Partnership dated 1.9.1978.
</p><p id="p_9">2.4	Revenues claim is that the goods of the respondents bearing the brand name RIAT connect to M/s RMT, who are the owners of the said brand to leverage its goodwill and simultaneously avail the benefit of SSI Exemption. The matter was adjudicated by the Commissioner who in the adjudication order dropped the proceedings under the said show cause notice.  Aggrieved from the same, the Revenue is before this Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_10">3.	Ld. AR appearing on behalf of the Revenue invites our attention to Clause 10 of Deed of Dissolution dated 1.9.1978, which reads as below:
</p><p id="p_11">goodwill of the partnership firm including the business name, business premises, trade mark, all registration numbers and all other benefits and privileges attached to the firm, its business and name shall be the exclusive property of continuing partners of the second part (i.e. M/s RMT) and the party of the first part shall not have any right, claim or lien over any of them.
On that basis, Ld. AR contends that the ownership of the said brand on continuing basis rested with M/s RMT and the respondents were allowed the limited use.  He also contends that even after getting the brand name registered in their name, the original ownership rested with M/s RMT. It was also argued that the use of the same brand name by M/s RMT and the respondents for different goods cannot be justified as the products fall under same class 7 under Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_1">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958.  He also relied on the following judgments:

</p><p id="p_32">4.	Ld. Advocate for the respondents reiterated the findings in the order of the Commissioner and argued that Clause 10 was subject to Clause 8 of Deed of Dissolution dated 1.9.1978.
</p><p id="p_33">5.	Heard both the sides and perused the records.
</p><p id="p_34">6.1	We find that the crucial issue to be decided in this case is whether for the purpose of Notification No. 8/2003-CE dated 1.3.2003, the respondents were owners of the brand, which they were using on the machines manufactured by them.  
</p><p id="p_35">6.2	Revenues first ground is based on Clause 10 of the deed of dissolution. We find that the following analysis of the Commissioner on Clause 10 of the deed of dissolution is proper and correct:
</p><p id="p_36">3.19 	I also observe that clause 10 of the deed of dissolution has been wrongly interpreted to mean that the right, amongst others, to trade mark shall be exclusive property of the continuing partners. A careful reading of the deed reveals that applicability of clause 10 is subject to provisions of clause 8, 9(a)(b).  Under the latter clause, the Noticee has acquired right to use brand name RIAT in respect of machines under reference and it is further laid down that the continuing partners shall not manufacture or deal in any of machines under reference under the trade mark RIAT.  Rather, the use of words subject to before clause 10, implies that the clause 10 will come into operation after meeting out the conditions of clause 8, 9(a) (b).  Clause 10 is to be read in conjunction with clause 8, 9(a) (b). If it is to be read in isolation, as appears to have been done by the investigation agency, then the purpose and aim of executing deed of dissolution and incorporation of clause 8, 9(a) (b) into said deed would be in-fructuous.

6.3	While deed of dissolution gave the right to use the RIAT trade mark to respondents, the other partners also committed that they would have no objection to registration of the above trade mark by retiring partners and shall give no objection certificate for the same.  Subsequent to that, the respondents had taken registration for RIAT brand under the Trade and <a href="/doc/1005493/" id="a_4">Merchandise Marks Act</a>, 1958 for Centreless Grinding Machines, Planning Machines, Surface Grinding Machines vide Registration No. 457653 on 30.11.1999 and for Round Bar Straightening Machines on 15.10.2001.  Thus they became owners of the brand from 30.11.1999 / 15.10.2001 respectively. Commissioner has therefore rightly concluded that the brand name was the trade mark registered in the name of the respondents prior to the period of demand under the show cause notice which is from 2003-04 (26.8.2003-03/2004) to 2007-08.
</p><p id="p_37">6.4	In this background, the respondents had become owners of the brand for the aforesaid four machines unlike the case of <a href="/doc/93872288/" id="a_5">Prince Valves Industry vs. CCE, Chandigarh</a> (supra) relied by the Revenue where the Honble Supreme Court has held as under:
</p><p id="p_38">10. The Tribunal has held that the brand name SANT continues to be registered in the name of M/s Sant Brass Metal Works and, therefore, the appellant will not be entitled to the exemption under Notification No. 1/93-CE.  This is so because the appellant has only the limited right to use the brand name under the registered trade mark. The ownership of the trade mark had not been transferred to the appellant.

6.5	We also find that in the case of CCE Ahmedabad vs. Vikshara Trading &amp; Investment P. Ltd.  2003 (157) ELT 4 (S.C) wherein the Revenue appeal was rejected and the Honble Apex Court upheld the Tribunals finding wherein it was held that the trade name need not necessarily be in respect of all goods unless registration has been so required and it has been further held that its permissible in law to have same brand name for having different class of goods owned by different persons and held that the Notification No. 223/87-CE was applicable.
</p><p id="p_39">6.6	We also agree with the following findings of the Commissioner on joint ownership by two partnership firms:
</p><p id="p_40">3.13		In case of CCE Vs. Sivanesan &amp; Co.  2005 (190) ELT 236 (CESTAT), brand name was jointly owned by two partnership firms comprising of same partners except that one firm had additional partner.  It was held that SSI exemption is available. The same view was taken in case of CCE vs. Kesavardhini Products  2006 (198) ELT 146 (CESTAT).
</p><p id="p_41">3.14		In case of <a href="/doc/1334972/" id="a_6">CCE vs. Mamma Products</a>  2004 (172) ELT 192 (CESTAT), it was held that brand name can be held jointly by two co-owners.  In that case, both units will be entitled for SSI concession.
</p><p id="p_42">3.15		From the judgments stated above, it becomes amply clear that brand name can be owned by more than one person i.e. joint ownership is permissible.

</p><p id="p_43">7.	In view of the above, we find no infirmity in the order of Commissioner and the same is sustained.
</p><p id="p_44">8.	The appeal filed by the Revenue is dismissed.
