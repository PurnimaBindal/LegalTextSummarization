 mandatory injunction and rendition of accounts for the alleged

infringement of copyright of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">2.      The suit was initially filed against M/s.Zee Telefilms Ltd. During

the pendency of the suit the plaintiff filed an application being IA

No.4822/2005 to implead Ms.Deepa Sahi, Mr.Ketan Mehta and M/s.

Maya      Movies      Pvt.Ltd      also    as   defendants   on   account   of    their

The said application was allowed by order dated 18th July, 2005 and the

said persons were impleaded as defendant Nos.2, 3 &amp; 4 to the suit of

the plaintiff. The plaintiff/applicant has contended that he is a pioneer

in the world of entertainment and the plaintiff Corporation was founded

</p><p id="p_6"> 3.      According to the plaintiff he has the copyright in his well known

television serial titled „24‟ which is a thriller with the main theme of

narration of story in real time. The plaintiff contended the term „24‟

relates to 24 hours in a day and the story is told in `real time‟ about

how a terrorist attempt is thwarted within 24 hours. The plaintiff

disclosed that each episode of „24‟ features an hour in the life of counter

terrorism agent Jack Bauer. According to him the theme of setting a

television serial in this format is unique to the plaintiff.



</p><p id="p_7">4.      The plaintiff contended that the principal star of the serial is

Mr.Keifer Sutherland who has been nominated three times for Emmy

Awards for his work in „24‟ who plays the role of a protagonist Jack

Bauer, a secret service agent working for the U.S. Government on VIP

Security and his main task is to save the political leaders from

international terrorist attacks.
</p>
<p id="p_8">

</p><p id="p_9">5.      The plaintiff has given the description of Season One of the said

serial in which the protagonist Jack Bauer‟s main task was to protect a

U.S.Senator (David Palmer) running for the position of the U.S.President

from an assassination attempt by a gang of international terrorists. In

Season two the serial deals with the trauma of his wife‟s murder and

the effect it had on his relationship with his daughter. He was called by

President David Palmer to stop a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear

bomb in Los Angles. Season three was set three years later where Jack


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                    Page 3 of 85</span>
 spent several months deep under cover and returned to Counter

Terrorist Unit (CTU) as Director of Field Operations. According to the

plaintiff the complete episode guide with the entire story line is available

on the plaintiff‟s website.
</p>
<p id="p_10">

</p><p id="p_11">6.      The plaintiff disclosed that his television serial „24‟ had been

extensively discussed in articles in Indian publications and it is

described as unique, as it takes place in `real time‟. A number of books

have been written on the plaintiff‟s serial according to plaintiff.



</p><p id="p_12">7.      The plaintiff/applicant further contended that the representatives

of the plaintiff had met with Mr. Subhash Chandra in 2005, who is the

Principal Officer of defendant No.1 and the possibility of licensing the

rights of serial „24‟ in order to create a local version in India was

discussed. However, the plaintiff categorically communicated to Mr.

Subhash Chandra that plaintiff would not license the rights of „24‟ to

the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14">8.      The grievance of the plaintiff is that he was shocked to learn that

the defendant has processed and launched a television serial titled

"Time Bomb". On perusal of power point presentation prepared by the

defendants containing a summary of the proposed television serial, it

became apparent to the plaintiff that the serial              `Time Bomb‟

characterization, story line and the script would have numerous


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                         Page 4 of 85</span>
 similarities to the plaintiff‟s television serial „24‟. The averment of the

plaintiff is that the similarities between the defendants serial "Time

Bomb" and plaintiff‟s serial „24‟ amount to copyright infringement.

According to the plaintiff `Time Bomb' is an international political

thriller of global terror with its epi-centre in South Asia in which Varun

is a special agent of an exclusive, secret, multi-disciplinary intelligence

agency created under the PMO to deal with terrorism and related

matters known to the very few. The plaintiff further disclosed that from

the script, it has transpired that in serial `Time Bomb‟ a young and

dynamic Prime Minister of India Sh.Anirudh Prakash was woken up on

account of imminent crisis, as there was reason to believe that there

was an assassination attempt on the Prime Minister. The plaintiff has

given the other details of the serial `Time Bomb'.
</p>
<p id="p_15">

</p><p id="p_16">9.      In the circumstances, the allegation of the plaintiff is that the

defendants have copied the story line of the plaintiff. The USP of the

defendants‟ serial is described as "This story of 1 day told in real time

over 24 hours, 1 hour episodes in a crisp breathtaking manner ending

on 11th September 2005" which is exactly how the plaintiff‟s serial is set

up.
</p>
<p id="p_17">

</p><p id="p_18">10.     The plaintiff contended that in order to resolve the matter with

defendant a communication dated 6th May, 2005 was sent to defendant

no.1 through the attorney of the plaintiff not to produce any television


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                    Page 5 of 85</span>
 serial which in any way violates the copyright of the plaintiff. The

defendant no.1 was also asked to disclose the complete story line and

script of their proposed television serial and to make appropriate

amendments to the satisfaction of the plaintiff in a manner that the

serial does not violate the copyright of the plaintiff.



</p><p id="p_19">11.     The plaintiff alleged that no response was received from the

defendants therefore, a reminder dated 27th May, 2005 was also sent.

Thereafter, the attorney of the plaintiff received a letter dated 3rd June,

2005 stating that the defendants are in the process of preparing reply to

plaintiff‟s letter dated 6th May, 2005 which shall be sent soon.

Thereafter on 10th June, 2005 the attorney of the plaintiff received

another reply dated 6th June, 2005 denying the allegation of the plaintiff

of violation of his copyright and contended that the characterization,

story line and script of the serial of the defendants was entirely different

from the script of the serial of the plaintiff and consequently the

allegations of the plaintiff were rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_20">

</p><p id="p_21">12.     The plaintiff‟s allegation is that the defendant used time in

answering their allegations with the aim to expedite the launch of their

television serial "Time Bomb". The plaintiff crystallized the similarities

in its serial „24‟ and the defendant‟s serial "Time Bomb" as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                 a)      The unique and unusual feature of the plaintiff‟s
                         serial is that it is about a story told in real time
                         narrating events over a period of 24 hours. The serial


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                        Page 6 of 85</span>
                          is divided into 24 episodes of one hour each. This is
                         the Unique Selling Point (USP) of the Plaintiff‟s
                         television serial. There is no other serial which has
                         such a format or story line. The Defendant‟s proposed
                         serial is exactly the same format and interestingly the
                         format is described in the Defendant‟s power point as
                         the USP of the Defendant‟s serial as well.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">                 b)      The Plot of the Plaintiff‟s serial relates to international
                         terrorism, as does the Defendant‟s television serial.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_3">                 c)      The protagonist in the Plaintiff‟s serial is a special
                         secret service agent Jack Baur, as is the protagonist
                         in the Defendant‟s serial, Varun.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">                 d)      The protagonist in the Plaintiff‟s serial is deployed by
                         the Counter-Terrorist Unit (CTU), the protagonist in
                         the Defendant‟s serial is deployed by the Agency to
                         Counter Terrorism (ACT).
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                 e)      The backdrop of the Plaintiff‟s serial is the protection
                         of the U.S. President from international terrorist
                         attack, whereas the Defendant‟s serial is about
                         saving the Indian Prime Minister from international
                         terrorist attack.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">                 f)      Both serials have a plot of nuclear attack combined
                         with a threat on the head of government, with the
                         protagonist attempting to stall both.

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                 g)      The proposed terrorist attack in each of the Plaintiff‟s
                         serials has international repercussions, which is
                         exactly the case in the Defendant‟s serial.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">                 h)      In both the serials the terrorists groups are Islamic
                         terrorists."

<p id="p_22">13.     According        to   the plaintiff,    the   similarities   as   enumerated

hereinabove, unequivocally reflected violation of copyright by the

defendants of the plaintiff‟s serial „24‟. According to the plaintiff the

defendants have not only kept the hour format but has also taken the

main plot, theme, characters etc. The defendants according to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                               Page 7 of 85</span>
 plaintiff, refused to subject their script for scrutiny to the plaintiff giving

rise to the suspicion that the script of `Time Bomb' violated the

copyright of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_23">

</p><p id="p_24">14.     In the circumstances, the plaintiff contended that plaintiff is

likely to suffer irreparable injury and harm as the plaintiff has the

exclusive right to telecast or license the making of a television serial in

accordance with the script and story line and the copyright which vests

with the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_25">

</p><p id="p_26">15.     The plaintiff further alleged that this is not the first time when the

defendants have attempted to infringe the rights of the plaintiff. The

plaintiff disclosed that it had filed legal proceedings against defendant

No.1 on account of defendant no.1 adopting the plaintiff‟s well known

channel name FX. The plaintiff alleged that in the said suit defendant

No.1 had given an assurance that it will change its channel's name from

FX to ZEE MX and the said suit being suit No.208/04 is pending before

the Court.
</p>
<p id="p_27">

</p><p id="p_28">16.     The plaintiff alleged that the attempt of the defendants is malafide

and they want to derive as much coverage and benefit from the

plaintiff‟s already existing and popular television serial „24‟. In the

circumstances the plaintiff sought an interim restraint against the

defendants from telecasting or broadcasting their serial `Time Bomb‟


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                        Page 8 of 85</span>
 and a direction that the defendant should hand over all the infringing

copies and all other incriminating material to the plaintiff.



</p><p id="p_29">17.     The plaintiff has alleged violation of its copyright inter-alia on the

grounds that its serial has been broadcast since 2001 and the

defendants had ample opportunity to view the plaintiff‟s serial and had

full access to it. The story line of the plaintiff‟s serial is available in the

text form on the plaintiff‟s website and the defendants had shown its

interest in obtaining license. However, when it was declined the

defendants have copied it. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendants

have acted dishonestly as they have not disclosed as to who is the

producer of the said serial. In order to buttress his allegation that the

defendants have copied his serial and they violated his copyright,

plaintiff contended that the defendants have copied the format and

structure, screenplay, story-line, character sketches, interplay of

characters and sequence of events.

</p><p id="p_40">24.     The defendants have contested the claim of the plaintiff.

Defendant No.1 filed a written statement dated 11th August, 2005 along

with a short reply dated 18th June, 2005 to the applications of the

plaintiff. Defendant No.1 averred that the plaintiff by its notice dated 6th

May, 2005 had sought for disclosure/sharing of the complete storyline

and script of the television serial `Time Bomb‟. The telecast of the serial

Time Bomb commenced on 20th June, 2005 and had to continue for 24

episodes. The defendant No.1 asserted that he had clearly informed the

plaintiff by his reply dated 6th June, 2005 to the notice of the plaintiff

dated 6th May, 2005 that the storyline of the script of the serial of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                      Page 13 of 85</span>
 defendants could not be disclosed to the plaintiff who is a business rival

and the defendant No.1 could not prejudice the telecast of his own

programme. The defendant No.1 asserted that it had informed the

plaintiff that the characterization, storyline and script of the defendants‟

serial is completely different from that of the plaintiff‟s serial „24‟. It was

emphasized that the serial „Time Bomb‟ is a continuation of earlier

serial of defendants titled „Pradhan Mantri‟. It was also aired earlier on

Zee. Mr.Ketan Mehta had produced the said television serial for the

defendants titled as "Pradhan Mantri" in which there was an

assassination attempt on the Prime Minister. According to the

defendant No.1 the serial „Time Bomb‟ is in continuation of earlier serial

„Pradhan Mantri‟ which is apparent from the fact that the lead actors

who had featured in „Pradhan Mantri‟ are the same.
</p>
<p id="p_41">

</p><p id="p_42">25.     According to the defendant No.1 the serial „Pradhan Mantri‟ was a

story of a young leader, MP who went to become the Prime Minister of

India and turned out to be an ideal Prime Minister. That serial had

ended with an attempt to assassinate him. The present serial „Time

Bomb‟ picks up the thread from the end of that serial and the same

Prime Minister, Mr.Anirudh Prakash three years later is still the Prime

Minster and there is an attempt on his life. The defendant No.1 detailed

the various roles played by various actors in the two serials „Pradhan

Mantri‟ and „Time Bomb‟. The defendant No.1 in the circumstances

emphasized that the story and screen play of the serials have been


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                        Page 14 of 85</span>
 developed entirely by the defendants‟ producers and directors through

extensive research and it has been written by Mr.Uttam Gada who is a

well known screen play writer and play writer. In the written statement

dated 11th August, 2005 the defendant No.1 also contended that they

are filing in a sealed cover having a concept note of serial „Time Bomb‟

along with a CD of the episode.
</p>
<p id="p_43">

</p><p id="p_44">26.     According to the defendant No.1 the serial „Time Bomb‟ which

follows the earlier serial „Pradhan Mantri‟ is an international thriller

based on the theme of global terrorism. The epicentre of said global

terror is in South Asia and it relates to terrorists who move from

Pakistan to India. There is an intelligence report that there exists an

apprehension of assassination attempt on the Prime Minister of India.

The question is whether the secret service agent would be able to save

the Prime Minster? Investigation also revealed that there would be

simultaneous attacks in various important cities of the world and it

revolves around the 11th September attacks.
</p>
<p id="p_45">

</p><p id="p_46">27.     The defendant No.1 categorically contended that the various

element existing in the serial „Time Bomb‟ namely an assassination

attempt, terrorism threat from weapons of mass destruction, political

turmoil etc are all elements which are existing in the earlier serial. The

primary secret service in the serial is known as RAW which is the real




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                   Page 15 of 85</span>
 name of such an agency and other agencies which are referred to are

IB, CBI and CID which are actual names of existing agencies.



</p><p id="p_47">28.     Refuting the allegation of the plaintiff that „24‟ is the unique serial

confined to a single day, the defendant No.1 contended that a large

number of films and serials have depicted the incident of a single day

which include "Iss Raat Ki Subah Nahi"; "Ek Din Achanak"; "Jagte

Raho", "Holi" and "Mirch Masala". According to the averment of

defendant No.1 storyline has a real time story which is not new to this

serial. The defendant No.1 further disclosed that earlier films namely

"Nick of Time" and another serial "In the nick of Time" have this kind of

narration structure which is claimed to be exclusive by the plaintiff.



</p><p id="p_48">29.     The defendant No.1 further asserted that a show is presented by

Zee T.V titled "Tamanna House" which is also the story of one day told

over 48 half hour episodes in real time. It also has multiple windows

being used in serial which have simultaneous events. According to the

defendant No.1 this has been made possible through use of advanced

technology in editing and a large number of feature films used this kind

of technology and technique. The defendant No.1 in the circumstances

emphasized that there is no copyright in the format of any T.V

programme or serial.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                        Page 16 of 85</span>
</p><p id="p_50"> 30.     The defendant No.1 thus contended that its serial „Time Bomb‟ is

an independently created work and it is not based on plaintiff‟s

programme in any manner whatsoever and there is no commonality

either in the story or in the content or character.
</p>
<p id="p_51">

</p><p id="p_52">31.     Any story which consists of an assassination links with terrorism

will have a large number of elements which would be common in

various other similar stories and the plaintiff cannot claim a copyright

on the same. The defendant No.1 further alleged that the format of

serial by itself is not entitled to any copyright protection whatsoever.

The defendant No.1 also stated that the preparation for this serial

commenced way back in November, 2004 when the programme

department of Zee engaged Mr.Ketan Mehta who is one of the most

reputed directors in India who had prepared the concept note in 2004

itself and an agreement dated 23rd November, 2004 was entered

between the defendant No.1 and Maya Movies Pvt Ltd. which is a

company of Mr.Ketan Mehta. Thus the concept of serial „Time Bomb‟

was decided way back in November, 2004 itself. The defendant No.1

also disclosed that the entire cost of production and the programme

including the payment to the Director, marketing, advertising etc of the

serial „Time Bomb‟ till the date of filing of the written statement was

approximately 10.5 crores.

</p><p id="p_54"> 32.     The defendant No.1 further disclosed that the serial „Time Bomb‟

had to be telecast every Monday over 20 episodes with duration of

approximately 45 minutes. The serial had been successfully promoted

by the defendants on its various channels and on the Zee network

platform and the shooting of the serial had taken place in Washington,

London, Tel-Aviv (Israel), Mumbai and Delhi and is based on the date

11th September, 2005 and is revealed over 24 hours depicting in 24

episodes. In the circumstances, the defendant No.1 contended that

there is no infringement of copyright, if any of the plaintiff and he is not

entitled for any interim order. The defendant No.1 contended that there

is no copyright in an idea, concept or the form of any T.V programme.



</p><p id="p_55">33.     Regarding the alleged similarities it is contended that every story

based on assassination and terrorism are bound to contain various

elements which can be compared and the similarities can be found.

However, that itself will not be sufficient to infer that there are

similarities. The serials based on assassination and terrorism are

bound to contain elements like international terrorism, secrets service

agents, assassination of Head of States and counter terrorists units.

According to the defendant No.1 there are numerous films with such

plots including Roza, 13th September, The Hero, Maachis, Mission

Kashmir, Kachche Dhagge, Qayamat etc. which had been produced

which have the similar elements as has been alleged by the plaintiff on




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                     Page 18 of 85</span>
 the basis of which the plaintiff is allegedly claiming copyright in the

serial „24‟.
</p>
<p id="p_56">

</p><p id="p_57">34.     The defendant No.1 further asserted that mere idea of „24‟ one

hour episodes cannot be copyrightable and cannot be protected under

the law of copyright, as the mere idea is not copyrightable. The

defendant No.1 contended that general ideas are in public domain and

cannot become a monopoly of any particular entity. The mere idea of an

assassination attempt on the head of state by a terrorist group

combined with modern technological inputs as also the presentation of

the same in a 24 episodes format, is per se is not entitled to copyright.

The defendant No.1 contended that such claim would be prejudicial to

"creativity, expression" and this would be contrary to public policy and

is neither permissible nor sustainable in law. In the circumstances it is

also asserted that there is no similarity between the plaintiff‟s serial „24‟

and the defendant‟s serial „Pradhan Mantri‟ and „Time Bomb‟ nor in the

portrayal or in the combination of incidents, pattern of activity etc.



</p><p id="p_58">35.     The defendant No.1 refuted the allegation that the Chairman of

defendant No.1 Mr. Subhash Chandra had tried to obtain the license

from the plaintiff which was declined. The defendant No.1 rather

contended that there had not been any occasion for the defendant No.1

to request for such a license. It was disclosed that in fact three

representatives of the plaintiff‟s distribution company had visited the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                      Page 19 of 85</span>
 office of the Chairman of defendant no.1 in Mumbai. The representative

of the plaintiff who visited defendant No.1‟s office in Mumbai were

Mr.Brendan Zauner, Director of Television Sales, Mr.Richard Samuesl,

Sr.V.P &amp; M.D, Asia Pacific and Mr.Mark Kaner, President. The meeting

was fixed as the plaintiffs representatives wanted to sell their content

and software for defendant‟s English Channel Zee Café and Zee Studio.

According to the defendant No.1 the meeting took place on 1st March,

2005, however, the preparation of the agreement for serial „Time Bomb‟

had taken place in November, 2004 and a large amount of money had

already spent by Zee from 1st March, 2005. The defendant No.1

categorically asserted that by that time entire concept note was

conceived, the storyline was ready, the script was ready and the serial

was under production and substantial shooting had taken place and

thus there was no question of the Chairman of the defendant No.1

Company         requesting        for   a       license   from   the   plaintiff.     In    the

circumstances reliance by the plaintiff on the alleged meeting is

completely misleading and is an attempt to twist the facts. The

defendant No.1 also filed the scanned copies of the visiting cards of the

three representatives who had come to meet the Chairman of the

defendant on 1st March, 2005. In order to allege malafides on the part of

the plaintiff, the defendant No.1 contended that with a view to mislead,

the plaintiff is deliberately not giving the exact date and has rather

mentioned that such a meeting had taken place in "early 2005".

</p><p id="p_59"> 36.     Regarding the earlier litigation with Channel FX, the defendant

No.1 contended that it has no connection with the present case. Even in

the said case no injunction was granted in favour of the plaintiff. The

defendant No.1 had rather filed the reply and had unilaterally changed

the channels name to Zee MX. Though an objection was taken by the

plaintiff that FX and MX are similar, however, without granting any

further relief to the plaintiff the suit was disposed of.



</p><p id="p_60">37.     The defendant No.1 further asserted that the marketing of the

serial had commenced, a number of months in advance and no

objection was raised from any quarter. According to the defendant No.1

the plaintiff noted the story of the serial which is evident from the

website zee-tv.com which is the basic story of the serial. The plaintiff

did not take action earlier and the present suit has been filed with a

view to prejudice the successful telecast of the serial. In order to

demonstrate the malafides on the part of the plaintiff the defendant

No.1 relied on the documents which are as under:-

scheduled for Monday at 10 PM on 20th June, 2005 and filing of the suit

on 16th June, 2005 was a malafide attempt.         The    defendant     No.1

applicant also contended that the suit is bad for non joinder of parties

and the suit has not been filed by a duly authorized person. In the

circumstances, it is contended that for the foregoing reasons there is no

prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant

differences between the serial of the plaintiff „24‟ and the defendant

No.1‟s serial. According to the said defendant the defendants serial

„Time Bomb‟ is based on its own earlier serial and is shot/produced in

or around various locations of the world which is not the case in the

serial of the plaintiff „24‟. The other major difference relied on by the

defendant No.1 is that the defendant‟s serial „Time Bomb‟ is based on

11th September, 2005 attack which is not the case in the serial of the

plaintiff „24‟. These differences change the entire script, characterization

and the screen play of the plaintiff‟s serial.

2001. The said serial „Pradhan Mantri‟ had a re-run on Zee T.V in

November-December, 2004 as „Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb‟. According

</p><p id="p_72">45.     The defendant Nos.2 to 4 reaffirmed that in October, 2004 the

concept note of serial „Time Bomb 9/11‟ was prepared and an

agreement was entered into between M/s. Maya Movies Pvt Ltd and Zee

Telefilms Ltd on 23rd November, 2004 for production of serial „Time

Bomb‟ continuing with the actors and characters of the earlier serial

„Pradhan Mantri‟. In the circumstances, it was re-asserted that the

serial „Time Bomb‟ is the continuation of earlier serial „Pradhan Mantri‟.

According to the defendant Nos.2 to 4 the suit of the plaintiff is a

speculative and baseless and there is no commonality between the two

serials „24‟ and „Time Bomb 9/11". They are based on different facts

and circumstances and they are completely dissimilar. The plots in the

two serials have no connection with each other. The script is different

and the story line is different. According to defendant Nos.2 to 4 the

number of dissimilarities between the two serials would be unending.

the serial „Time Bomb‟ which had already been telecast and the serial

„24‟ were screened in the Court. On the basis of the screening of the

serial „Time Bomb‟ and the serial „24‟, it was noticed that besides having

some elements similar, the general impression of this Court is that the

serial „Time Bomb‟ is not the copy of the serial „24‟.



</p><p id="p_130">57.     Before analyzing the various allegations made by the plaintiff and

the defendant, it will be appropriate to consider a number of judgments

cited by the counsel for the plaintiff as well as counsel for the

defendants in support of their respective contentions.



</p><p id="p_131">58.     The plaintiff has relied on Fleet Street Reports (1993) 497, Johan

Richardson Computers Limited Vs. Flanders and Another to contend

that that Court should first decide whether the plaintiff‟s program as a

whole was entitled to copyright, and then decide whether any similarity

attributable to copying which was to be found in the defendant‟s

program amounted to a copy of a substantial part of the plaintiff‟s

program. Consideration of the substantiality of any copying is not to be

restricted to the text only. Nor should consideration be limited to the

"structure and organisation" of the program since this imports an

 unacceptable degree of uncertainty because it is unclear at what level of

observation of the "structure and organisation" is to be discerned.



</p><p id="p_132">59.     In considering the question of substantiality, the similarities

between the program should be considered individually and then it

should be considered whether the entirety of what had been copied

represented a substantial part of the plaintiff‟s program.    Whether a

part was substantial is to be decided by its quality rather than by its

quantity. It was necessary to take in account such considerations as

originality and the distinction between the idea and expression in

assessing the quality, and hence the substantiality, of any part which is

said to have been copied. It is also relevant in assessing substantiality

to filter out elements dictated by efficiency, elements dictated by

external factors and elements taken from the public domain. The Court

held that Mr. Flanders had intimate knowledge of BBC programme at

all levels of abstraction and it is possible that he has unconsciously,

unintentionally or in some other way which he did not consider to be

objectionable, made use of that knowledge in a way that amounts to

copying in the context of breach of copyright. It was those possibilities

that were evaluated in appraising the particular similarities between the

BBC program and that of Mr.Flanders.

 gist of the tort of passing off and it is not necessary for a plaintiff to

establish that the defendant consciously intended to deceive the public,

if that is the probable result of his conduct. Nevertheless, the question

why the defendant chose to adopt a particular name or getup is always

highly relevant. It is a question which calls for an answer.     In the said

case, reliance was placed on Munday Vs. Carey, 22 RPC 273 where it

was held that "where you see dishonesty, then even though the

similarity were less than it is here, you all, I think, to pay great

attention to the items of similarity and less to the items of

dissimilarity."

                 from the nature of the similarities themselves. It
                 is good practice for the plaintiff to particularise at

                 similarity between his work and the defendant's
                 work.      The existence of a striking general
                 similarity   coupled      with   evidence    of    the
                 opportunity to copy will establish a prima facie
                 case of copying which the defendant then has to
                 answer.     The evidential burden shifts to the
                 defendant who then may seek to adduce evidence
                 of some alternative explanation of the similarities
                 between the two work, for example, evidence of
                 independent creation or common source. The
                 Court has declined to order interrogatories
                 seeking evidence of the detailed history of the
                 defendant's development of their copyright work
                 on the grounds that they were "fishing" for
                 information which would be the subject of
                 evidence at the trial. The task of the judge is then
                 to consider the evidence as a whole and decide
                 whether there has been copying or not.              An

infringement is whether the work is recognisable by an ordinary

opportunity to the defendants to copy the same. To further advance the

plea of availability of plaintiff‟s material, it was contended that first

defendant had met the representatives of the plaintiff‟s and had showed

interest in obtaining a license from the plaintiff for the same serial but

when no licence was granted, the serial has been copied. Plaintiff relied

on the affidavit of Mr. Brendan Zauner dated 8th August, 2005.             the

allegation of the plaintiff is that with a view to divert the issue regarding

this meeting, first defendant who claimed to be producer of the serial

has taken a dramatically opposite stand calling second defendant the

producer which reflects the dishonesty with which the defendants have

acted.

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">                       It is stretching the original use of the word "format" a

Los Angeles County) referred to by the Plaintiff, the alleged infringing

game, "By the Numbers" was a variation on the old parlour game called

„Ghost‟. The purpose was to make a word of three or more letters in

which two-man teams participate. A game board was involved, which

has thirty permanently numbered squares. Before each game, the

twenty-six letters of the alphabet were assigned, each to one of the

thirty squares, leaving four dummy squares. The contestants were

permitted to view the arrangement with a view to memorizing the same.

Then, the letters were withdrawn from sight. The beginning member of

the team then called out one of the numbers; the letter was then

momentarily exposed and recorded; his teammate thereafter, called out

another number, the letter corresponding to which thus became the

second letter towards a prospective word. This selection continued till

an impossible combination has been reached or one of the members of

the team „declares‟ a word rather than seeking to add thereto.

game as one in which there is number-letter equivalence, which is

manifested in terms of an electrical board in which this is shown and

exhibited to the audience and that this had been copied by the

defendants in their game show. The Court observed:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_29">                "     In a case such as this, it is the clothing of the idea

                manner and form in which the basic concept of
                cryptography is fashioned into a game show for television.
                Except for the basic cryptographic principle itself, the only
                minor similarity between the two concepts is the use of the
                game board. Even there, the similarity is not one which
                exists as a practical and tangible, as distinguished from
                verbal, matter. Under such circumstance the issue is one of

<p id="p_158">76.     Another precedent relied on by the plaintiff is Zee News v. Navjot

Sandhu &amp; Ors. SLP (Crl.)No. 5464/2002. In this case the respondents

were prosecuted for their alleged involvement in the 13th December,

2001 Parliament Attack. Their trial was over and the trial court had

notified that the judgment would be delivered on 11th December, 2002.

On 5th December, 2002 the petitioner advertised that it would be

broadcasting a reconstruction of the parliament attack from 13th

December, 2002 to 16th December, 2002. The court subsequently

changed the date of delivery of judgment from 11th December to 16th

 December, 2002. Thereafter, the respondents filed a criminal writ

petition before the Delhi High Court contending that the broadcast of

the telefilm may cause prejudice to their case and therefore the

broadcast may be stayed till the delivery of the judgment. The High

Court without issuing notice to Zee News passed the following order:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">                 - "In the meantime in case the film „December 13
                Parliament Attack‟ is to be telecast the same shall be done
                only with the prior permission of the trial court. Any order
                which the trial court passes in the meanwhile with regard
                to the telecast of the film shall be passed only after hearing
                the accused."

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">        On appeal the Supreme Court held :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_32">                "We find that there was neither any prima facie case nor
                balance of convenience in favour of the respondents for
                passing the interim order nor an irreparable injury was
                likely to be caused to the respondents if the interim order
                had not been passed. It may be noted that the Sessions
                Court on 25th November, 2002 notified that the judgment
                would be delivered on 11th December, 2002. The petitioner
                on 5th December, 2002 advertised that it would broadcast
                the telefilm from 13th December, 2002. The afore-said dates
                show that the telecast of the film was not for the purpose,
                in any way, to influence the mind of the judge. Further, we
                find that the judges by their judicial training and the kind
                of office they hold are not expected to be influenced by any
                broadcast of such film. For the above said reasons we stay

defendants, the plaintiff was the writer and the producer of the play

„Hum Hindustani‟. The play was written by him in Hindi in 1953 and

was enacted by him for the first time on February 6, 7, 8 and 9, 1953 in

New Delhi. The play proved to be very popular and received great

approbation from the press and the public as a result of which the play

was re-staged in February and September, 1954 and also in 1955 and

1956 at Calcutta. In November, 1954 the plaintiff received a letter from

the second defendant in that case wherein the defendants informed the

plaintiff that he was supplied with a synopsis of the play by one Mr.

Balwant Gargi, a common friend of the plaintiff and the defendant. The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                          Page 51 of 85</span>
 defendant had requested the plaintiff to supply a copy of the play so

that the defendant may consider the desirability of making a film on it.

Some time about January, 1955 the second and the third defendants

came to Delhi, met the plaintiff in his office where the plaintiff read out

and explained the entire play to the defendants and also discussed the

possibility of filming it. The second defendant did not make any clear

commitment but promised the plaintiff that he would inform him about

his reaction after reaching Bombay. Thereafter, the plaintiff heard

nothing from the defendant. Sometime in May, 1955 the second

defendant announced the production of a motion picture entitled "New

Delhi". One Mr. Thapa who was one of the artists in the play produced

by the plaintiff happened to be in Bombay at the time when the picture

'New Delhi' was being produced by the defendant and informed the

plaintiff that the picture being produced by the defendant was really

based on the plaintiff's play 'Hum Hindustani'. The picture was released

in Delhi in September, 1956 and the plaintiff read some comments in

the papers which gave the impression that the picture was very much

like the play 'Hum Hindustani' written by the plaintiff. The plaintiff

himself saw the picture on the 9th September, 1956 and he found that

the film was entirely based upon the said play and was, therefore,

convinced that the defendant after having heard the play narrated to

him by the plaintiff, dishonestly imitated the same in his film and thus

committed an act of piracy so as to result in violation of the copy-right

of the plaintiff. The plaintiff accordingly filed the suit for damages, for


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                    Page 52 of 85</span>
 decree for accounts of the profits made by the defendants and a decree

for permanent injunction against the defendants restraining them from

exhibiting the film 'New Delhi' The Court had observed that the position

appears to be that an idea, principle, theme, or subject matter or

historical or legendary facts being common property cannot be the

subject matter of copyright of a particular person. It is always open to

any person to choose an idea as a subject matter and develop it in his

own manner and give expression to the idea by treating it differently

from others. Where two writers write on the same subject similarities

are bound to occur because the central idea of both are the same but

the similarities or coincidences by themselves cannot lead to an

irresistible inference of plagiarism or piracy. Thus, the fundamental fact

which has to be determined where a charge of violation of the copyright

is made by the plaintiff against the defendant is to determine whether

or not the defendant not only adopted the idea of the copyrighted work

but has also adopted the manner, arrangement, situation to situation,

scene to scene with minor changes or super additions or embellishment

here and there. Indeed, if on a perusal of the copyrighted work, the

defendant's work appears to be a transparent rephrasing or a copy of a

substantial and material part of the original, the charge of plagiarism

must stand proved. Care however must be taken to see whether the

defendant has merely disguised piracy or has actually reproduced the

original in a different form, different tone, different tenor so as to infuse

a new life into the idea of the copyrighted work adapted by him. In the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                      Page 53 of 85</span>
 latter case there is no violation of the copyright. Thus, on a careful

consideration and elucidation of the various authorities and the case

law on the subject discussed above, the following propositions emerge :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">                 1. There can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter,
                 themes, plots or historical or legendary facts and violation
                 of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form,
                 manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the
                 author of the copyright work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">                 2. Where the same idea is being developed in a different
                 manner, it is manifest that the source being common,
                 similarities are bound to occur. In such a case the courts
                 should determine whether or not the similarities are on
                 fundamental or substantial aspects of the mode of
                 expression adopted in the copyrighted work. If the
                 defendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the
                 copyrighted work with some variations here and there it
                 would amount to violation of the copyright. In other words,
                 in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial
                 and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that
                 the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">                 3. One of the surest and the safest test to determine
                 whether or not there has been a violation of copyright is to
                 see if the reader, spectator or the viewer after having read
                 or seen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an
                 unmistakable impression that the subsequent work
                 appears to be a copy of the original.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_40">                 4. Where the theme is the same but is presented and
                 treated differently so that the subsequent work becomes a
                 completely new work, no question of violation of copyright
                 arises.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_41">                 5. Where however apart from the similarities appearing in
                 the two works there are also material and broad
                 dissimilarities which negative the intention to copy the
                 original and the coincidences appearing in the two works
                 are clearly incidental no infringement of the copyright
                 comes into existence.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_42">                 6. As a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it
                 must be proved by clear and cogent evidence after applying


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                       Page 54 of 85</span>
                  the various tests laid down by the case law discussed
                 above.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">                 7. Where however the question is of the violation of the
                 copyright of stage play by a film producer or a Director the
                 task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy.
                 It is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much
                 broader prospective, a wider field and a bigger background
                 where the defendants can by introducing a variety of
                 incidents give a colour and complexion different from the
                 manner in which the copyrighted work has expressed the
                 idea. Even so, if the viewer after seeing the film gets a
                 totality of impression that the film is by and large a copy of
                 the original play, violation of the copyright may be said to
                 be proved."

<p id="p_160">79.     The Court had further held,


                "On a close and careful comparison of the play and the
                picture, but for the central idea (provincialism which is not
                protected by copyright), from scene to scene, situation to
                situation, in climax to anti-climax, pathos, bathos in
                texture and treatment and purport and presentation, the
                picture is materially different from the play. As already
                indicated above, applying the various tests outlined above
                we are unable to hold that the defendants have committed
                an act of piracy in violating the copyright of the play."

</p><p id="p_161">80.     Another Judge, JASWANT SINGH, J. In this case had rather held,


                "On a careful comparison of the script of the plaintiff's
                copyrighted play with the aforesaid film, although one does
                not fail to discern a few resemblances and similarities
                between the play and the film, the said resemblances are
                not material or substantial and the degree of similarities is
                not such as to lead one to think that the film taken as a
                whole constitutes an unfair appropriation of the plaintiff's
                copyrighted work. In fact, a large majority of material
                incidents, episodes and situations portrayed by defendants
                1 and 2 in their aforesaid film are substantially different
                from the plaintiff's protected work and the two social evils

                and eradicated by defendants 1 and 2 by means of their

                such I am in complete agreement with the conclusions


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                        Page 55 of 85</span>
                 arrived at by my learned brother Murtaza Fazal Ali that
                there has been no breach on the part of the defendants of
                the plaintiff's copyright and concur with the judgment
                proposed to be delivered by him."
</p>
<p id="p_162">81.     However, judge PATHAK, J. had held,


                "An infringement of copyright can arise even though the
                essential features of a play correspond to a part only of the
                plot of a film. Such a situation can arise where changes are
                effected while planning the film so that certain immaterial
                features in the film differ from what is seen in the stage
                play."
</p>
<p id="p_163">82.     It appeared from a comparison of the script of the stage play

"Hum Hindustani" and the script of the film "New Delhi" that the

authors of the film script had been influenced to a degree by the salient

features of the plot set forth in the play script. There can be little doubt

from the evidence that the authors of the film script were aware of the

scheme of the play. But on the other hand, the story portrayed by the

film travels beyond the plot delineated in the play. Nonetheless, the

question can arise whether there is an infringement of copyright even

though the essential features of the play can be said to correspond to a

part only of the plot of the film. This can arise even where changes are

effected while planning the film so that certain immaterial features in

the film differ from what is seen in the stage play. The relative position

in which the principal actors stand may be exchanged or extended and

embellishments may be introduced in the attempt to show that the plot

in the film is entirely original and bears no resemblance whatever to the

stage play. If the treatment of the theme in the stage play has been



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                      Page 56 of 85</span>
 made the basic of one of the themes in the film story and the essential

structure of that treatment is clearly and distinctly identifiable in the

film story, it is not necessary, for the Court to examine all the several

themes embraced within the plot of the film in order to decide whether

infringement has been established. In the attempt to show that he is

not guilty of infringement of copyright, it is always possible for a person

intending to take advantage of the intellectual effort and labour of

another to so develop his own product that it covers a wider field than

the area included within the scope of the earlier product, and in the

common area covered by the two productions to introduce changes in

order to disguise the attempt at plagiarism. The trial Court as well as

the High Court had concurred with the finding that such similarities as

exist between the stage play "Hum Hindustani" and the film "New Delhi"

do not make out a case of infringement. The dissimilarities, in their

opinion, are so material that it is not possible to say that the appellant's

copyright has been infringed. This Supreme Court had held that it was

extremely reluctant to interfere with concurrent findings of fact reached

by the Courts below and for that reason, the judgment under appeal

was allowed to stand. It was further held that in another, and perhaps a

more clearer case, it may be necessary for this Court to interfere and

remove the impression which may have gained ground that the

copyright belonging to an author can be readily infringed by making

immaterial changes, introducing insubstantial differences and enlarging

thrown around the work now produced.

the grant of an injunction alone will subserve the interests of justice or

whether substituted safeguards could be thought of in order to preserve

the rights, if any, of the respondents.‟ The Court had held and observed:

<blockquote id="blockquote_45">                "      Injunction being an equitable remedy, which is
                granted by a court in exercise of its judicial discretion has
                to be considered from various facets which arise from a
                particular set of circumstances in each case. There may be
                cases in which the grant of an injunction temporary or
                permanent will only meet the ends of justice and an
                alternative safeguard for the preservation of the rights of
                the challenging party cannot at all be thought of. There may
                be also cases where the remedy of injunction has to be
                made flexible and adjustable to the situations arising in
                each case. A rigid invocation without contemplating
                elasticity in the application of the rule as to the grant of

is to be kept without being released, then it would neither benefit the

plaintiffs     not    the     defendant.        But   in   our   view   certain   nearer

approximations in order to render justice has to be thought of, instead

of creating a stalemate which is not beneficial to the parties. It is not

conducive to keep the status quo until the disposal of the suit. The

plaintiff is interested only in establishing his rights and getting

sufficient compensation in terms of money, if his copyright is

established in accordance with law. It was held that:

                States, it would be highly iniquitous to stem the progress of
                such a commercial activity unless the Court is satisfied that
                there is no other way of granting justice to the parties
                excepting by a preventive injunction. The rights of third
                parties are also involved. The third parties are distributors
                and exhibitors who have come into the picture. The first
                plaintiff's claim is that his literary work has been pirated.
                This relief could be compensated for sufficiently in money.
                In cases where an equitable relief would be sufficiently
                compensated for monetarily, then the Courts refrain from
                being wooden and granting injunctions alone instead of
                contemplating the nearest approximation which it can
                make. The mere fact that a prima facie case exists for the

`Independence Day‟ produced by the defendants is the infringement of

the copyright of the film script „Extra Terrestrial Mission. In this film the

plaintiff was the author of the film script E.T.M and acquired registered

copyright in the year 1986. It was alleged that the defendants‟ movie

I.D. was a plagiarized version of E.T.M. The plaintiffs pointed out

various similarities between the script of E.T.M and the movie I.D. The

storey line was that Phil Talon a U.S. Army Captain saves Diana, a

Vietnam citizen from a sexual assault during the Vietnam War. Love

blossoms and they get married. They are now working together for the

rehabilitation of Vietnamese war affected children at U.S. Aliens

descend on earth on a rescue good will mission and informs Phil Talon

about an impending nuclear blast conspired by a Christian priest at the

site of a mosque at Jerusalem and requests him to negotiate with the

President of U.S. for preventive action. The President takes an egoistic

stand, refuses alien interference in the affairs of earth and directs war

against the aliens. First round of war the nuclear arsenal is

substantially exhausted and the aliens appear invincible. The aliens

successfully prevent the nuclear holocaust and resists the U.S. attacks.

 The President of U.S. confers with U.S.S.R., France etc. and launches a

second round of attacks with too is thwarted by the aliens. Desperate,

the President calls for a truce. The aliens having established their

triumph, voluntarily returns. Whereas the storyline of I.D was that

Aliens attack the earth bombarding buildings including the White house

and nuclear installations killing several people. Space ships of 15 miles

diameter descend on several important cities. A huge mother space ship

stationed in the space at quite a distance control the smaller space

ships. The U.S. Air Force attacks in vain exhausting substantial nuclear

arsenal. A scientist accidentally hits on the idea of implanting a virus in

the mother ship thereby making all the space ships vulnerable. The

scientist and an expert war pilot takes the journey to the mother ship in

an old captured spaceship and successfully implants the virus. The

president gets directly involved in the war, as a pilot to attack the

spaceships. The virus is activated and the spaceships become

vulnerable to attacks and starts crumbling. In this case it was held:

literary and dramatic works would apply only when there is marginal

peripheral alterations and rearrangements. The amendment does not

bring out any drastic change in the existing law, therefore the test of

dissimilarities propounded by Supreme Court in R.G.Anand's case still

holds the field. In that view it was held that the story and the film script

in I.D. is totally distinct and different from E.T.M. The so called unique

features of E.T.M. like President's involvement in war, the picturization

of effects of war, the presentation of concept of spaceship, energy shield

could at the best be called an idea, but not a precise defined expression

to confer copyright. It was held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">                "      There is no comparative basis between E.T.M. and
                I.D. Except the fact in both the plots the President is
                involved in the war, but the manner of involvement and the
                nature of the President's role conceived in E.T.M. is totally
                different from I.D. The spaceship, energy shield, people
                welcoming aliens are again ideas. The treatment and
                presentation of the concept in the film I.D. is totally
                different from the script E.T.M. The picturisation of blasting
                of nuclear missiles, disruption of communications, traffic
                jams are nothing but "scene a faire" commonly found in
                scientific fictions. Indeed in the several English earlier
                movies which have been marked and presented visually for
                the Court's benefit disclose that the confrontation of aliens

<p id="p_171">88.     In another judgment relied on by the defendant, <a href="/doc/647657/" id="a_6">Barbara Taylor

Bradford v. Sahara Media Entertainment Ltd</a>.2004 (28) PTC 474

(Cal)(DB), the plaintiff was the authoress of the book „A Woman of

Substance‟. She sought an interim injunction against the defendant

from infringing her copyright in the book by broadcasting the serial

„Karishma- The Miracle of Destiny‟. At the time of filling the suit the

defendants had already completed and made ready for telecasting 80

episodes of the serial. About 100 crores had already been invested and

11 crores taken as advance from advertising agents. One episode had

been telecast before the Single Judge had issued the injunctive order.

The only material on which the plaintiffs had based their claim for

infringement was the interview taken by a freelance journalist named

Ms. Pammi Somal of Respondent No. 2, Akashdeep Sabir who was the

creative Director and producer of the serial, wherein he had mentioned

that the serial was based on the book „A Woman of Substance‟. The

Court had observed that the law protects originally of expression but

not originality of the central idea, not merely because of the balancing

of two conflicting policies. Those policies are that the law must protect

originality of artistic work, thereby allowing artists to reap the fruits of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                       Page 64 of 85</span>
 their labour and stopping unscrupulous pirates from enjoying those

fruits. The second policy is that the protection must not become an over

protection, thus, curbing down future artistic activity. If mere plots and

character were to be protected by copyright, on original artist could not

write anything "original" at all, on a similar plot or on similar

characters. The rationale behind the basic copyright law is that you can

borrow the idea of another author, but not the expression. The theme

can be borrowed. The originality in the theme is not protected. There is

no protection given by the law to the first writer who is not really the

first writer at all. The plot being common, perhaps too common, and

being the possible field for operation of future and different literary

works and plays, should not be blocked of by the law of copyright. If

plots and ordinary prototype characters were to be protected by the

copyright law, then soon would come a time in the literary world, when

no author would be able to write anything at all without infringing

copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_172">

</p><p id="p_173">89.     In these circumstances, the issue which arises is that since no

literary work is ever exactly copied, except for naked piracies by

unauthorized printing, should not a particular author be free to devise

his own story, characters and plots, just as he pleases provided he does

not actually copy an earlier work, exactly or almost exactly? It was held

that the law cannot become this lax. It would pave the way to

plagiarism and the labors of the authors would be freely picked up by


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                   Page 65 of 85</span>
 unscrupulous persons. They would utilize the fruits or originality, not

the authors themselves. Therefore, even if the plot is copied, the person

who copies it, be it consciously or unconsciously, must also weave into

the plot sufficient creations of his own imagination and literary skill, to

make the work his own and not a copy of the work which might have

inspired him in the first place.

<p id="p_174">

</p><p id="p_175">90.     The defendants have also relied on Norowzian v. Arks Ltd., Fleet

Street Reports [2000] 363 (In the Court of Appeal). In the said decision

in 1992 the claimant directed a short film called „Joy‟, consisting of a

man dancing to music. The striking feature of the visual impact of the

film was the apparent sudden changes of position of the man which

could never have been performed as successive in reality. This effect

was produced by the use of an editing technique known as „jump

cutting‟.     He     claimed      that     the   Guinness   advertisement     entitled

‟Anticipation‟ infringed his copyright in „Joy‟. In „Anticipation‟ the

defendants had used a similar jump cutting technique to that used by

the plaintiff in „Joy‟ with the similar result that the dancing man

appears to indulge in a series of jerky movements that could not be

achieved by a dancer in reality. It was held by the Court that it is

impossible to say that `Anticipation‟ is or includes a copy of a

substantial part of Joy. It was observed, "the highest it can be put in

favor of the claimant is that there is a striking similarity between the

filming and editing styles and techniques used by the respective


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                               Page 66 of 85</span>
 directors of the two films. But no copyright subsists in mere style or

technique. Mr. Prescott QC, for Arks Ltd, instanced the technique of

Pointillism, which was originated by the neo-impressionists Seurat and

Signac. That was a telling example. If, on seeing La Baignade, Asnieres

at the Salon des Artistes Independents in 1884, another artist had used

precisely the same technique in painting a scene in Provence, Seurat

would have been unable, by the canons of English copyright law, to

maintain an action against him. Other examples of original artistic

styles or techniques whose imitation in the production of an entirely

different subject matter would not found such an action might be the

'sprung rhythm' of Gerard Manley Hopkins' verse or the thematic build-

up of Sibelius's second symphony. So here, the subject matter of the

two films being, as the judge said, very different one from the other, the

similarities of style and technique are insufficient to give the claimant a

cause of action against the defendants."

observed that it is true that the fact that a plaintiff's idea 'embodies

elements long in use does not of itself negate originality or novelty. In

Baut v. Pethick Const. Co., 262 F. Supp. 350, 361 (M.D. Pa. 1966)], it

was observed that in order to be protectable, adaptations of ideas must

show genuine novelty and invention, and not a merely clever or useful

adaptation of existing knowledge. The judicious use of existing means

or the mixture of known ingredients in somewhat different proportions,

 all the variations on a basic theme, partake more of the nature of

elaboration and renovation than of innovation. Similarly in Educational

Sales Programs, Inc. v. Dreyfus Corp., supra, 317 N.Y.S.2d at 844,

applying the principle enunciated in the above said case the Court

observed-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_50">                "      In his proposal for "Father's Day," plaintiff took
                already existing ingredients from the basic theme of the

                which was expressly rejected by NBC in November of 1980,
                were to be considered novel, it would mean that defendants
                would be barred from televising a family situation comedy
                starring Bill Cosby, if the family is an intact family unit."

<p id="p_178">92.     In Green v. Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand 1989 RPC

469 (Court of Appeal NZ) the appellant was the author, producer and

compere of a television talent quest produced and broadcast in the

United Kingdom under the name „Opportunity Knocks‟ from the early

1960‟s until 1978. Over the years he had developed a distinctive style

built round the name of the production and his personality and each

broadcast followed a standard form in which contestants were

introduced by sponsors who spoke briefly about them, and there were

also features such as a "clapometer" for visual measurement of

audience reaction and distinctive phrases said to be exclusively

associated with the show, such as "For 'So and So' Opportunity Knocks"

and "Make your mind up time", to give the audience the opportunity to

make their decision. The appellants broadcasted a talent show with the

same title „Opportunity Knocks‟ in New Zealand from 1975 to 1979. The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                      Page 68 of 85</span>
 said talent show was alleged to have the same format as that of the

appellant‟s talent quest. In 1979 the appellant brought an action

against the respondent, the Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand,

claiming that by its production and transmission in New Zealand of a

similar television talent quest under the same name in 1978 it passed

off its program as his, or as an adaptation authorized and approved by

him.     The     appellant       also    claimed      that   the   Corporation      by    its

transmission had infringed his copyright in the title "Opportunity

Knocks" and to scripts and the dramatic format of his program. In these

circumstances, the Court had observed:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_51">                "In order to succeed in his action the plaintiff had to make
                out that his television program was distinctive, that its
                reputation in New Zealand among television viewers had
                generated a goodwill here and that the Corporation in
                transmitting its program falsely represented that it was Mr.
                Green's program or at least that he had approved of it."</blockquote><p id="p_179">


</p><p id="p_180">        The judges were of the opinion that the plaintiff has not been able

to establish the existence of goodwill in New Zealand for his show

sufficient to support an action of passing off. The two issues before the

Court were whether the plaintiff had copyright in (1) script (2) format of

„Opportunity Knocks‟. The court was of the opinion that the plaintiff‟s

script included the title, the various catchphrases (which as time went

by became a standard and expected part of the entertainment),

recorded the names of the competitors or entrants together with the

nature of their act, the names of the sponsors and the general order of

appearances         and      happenings,        and    specifically   referred     to    the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                                    Page 69 of 85</span>
 "clapometer". The script must also have indicated the sequence of

events, musical interludes and the like. They did not include the details

of interviews for they were ad lib, nor, obviously, details of the

particular performance of each competitor. The Court had held that the

scripts could not constitute a dramatic work as they were nothing more

than a general scheme for a proposed entertainment and they could not

themselves be acted or performed, which according to the court was the

essence of such a work. As to the issue whether the scripts were

entitled to copyright as a literary work it was observed -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_52">                "The question remains whether the script or scripts is, or
                are, literary works. Mr. Green's written work was, to an
                extent which in the absence of the actual scripts is not
                entirely clear, the expression of an idea for the production
                of a talent quest. Copyright does not protect a general idea
                or concept. The abstraction implicit in a general idea or
                concept may however be delineated by or attended with
                detail or pattern or incidents sufficiently substantial to
                attract copyright in the whole. If the work is sufficiently
                removed from mere idea so as to obtain copyright the
                question of whether it is infringed will depend upon the
                nature and quality of what has been taken. If the general
                idea which underlies or forms the basis of the work has
                alone been taken there will be no infringement. If more than
                that it will be a question of fact and degree whether there is
                an infringement."

of the rights of the plaintiff and their violations are contested and

uncertain. The rights of the plaintiff are still to be established after the

trial for evidence in support of the pleas of the parties. Considering the

facts that the serials of both the parties have already been telecast, this

Court will have to go by the principles of „balance of convenience‟ which

will be as to who will be more inconvenienced in case as prayed for by

the plaintiff is granted or not granted and also as to who will suffer

irreparable loss. The principles enunciated by the Apex Court in the

case of <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_8">Wander Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. Antox India (P) Ltd</a>. can be a guideline

principle to resolve this controversy and to throw light about these

aspects of the matter. In the case of Wander Ltd. &amp; Anr. (supra), it was

held by the Supreme Court as under:-

telecast his serial and determine where balance of convenience lies and

preserve the status quo in respect of the rights of the parties which will

appear on a prima facie case. The task is slightly more difficult at this

stage as parties have not yet started with their evidence and the telecast

of both the serials of plaintiff and defendant is over without any further

new development.
</blockquote>


<p id="p_181">95.     The plea of the plaintiff to establish prima facie case is that the

defendants have substantially copied the serial of the plaintiff ` 24‟. In

considering the question of substantiality, the similarity between the

programs can also to be considered individually in certain situations

and then to consider whether the entirety of what had been copied

represented a substantial part of the plaintiff‟s program. Even regarding

the substantial copy by the defendants, what is to be decided is by its

quality of copy rather by its quantity. This has not been disputed by

both the parties that under the <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_9">Copyright Act</a> protection for an original

work does not extend to any "idea, procedure, process, system, method

of operation, concept, principle, or discovery" regardless of the form in

which it is described, explained, illustrated or embodied in such work. A

statutory protection does not extend to the intellectual conceptions


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                        Page 72 of 85</span>
 apart from the thing produced. The protections of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_10">Copyright Act</a> are not

intended to either enlarge or to contract the scope for Copyright

production and the basic dichotomy between the idea and its

expression remain unchanged. The rules of the Copyright provide that

ideas, plans, method, systems, or device, as distinguished from the

particular manner in which they are expressed or described in a right,

are not copyrightable.
</p>
<p id="p_182">

</p><p id="p_183">96.     Although, there is no copyright protection for an idea, concept,

principles or discovery, there may be a valid copyright in an original

form of expression of an idea, concept or discovery. It is equally true

that a mere outline or theme is not copyrightable since it is only an

idea, nor is there any protected property right in the "theme" of a work,

or in locale or setting of a story. But a distinctive treatment of a plot or

theme is copyrightable as a literary work or as a dramatic work.



</p><p id="p_184">97.     Similarity in the presentation techniques will not constitute

violation of copyright in the facts and circumstances and on the basis of

the various decisions cited by the parties and considered in short this

Court is unable to infer that there can be copyright in the manner and

format of presentation. The precedents relied on by the <a href="/doc/603848/" id="a_11">Zee Films Ltd. v.

Sun Dial Communication Pvt. Ltd &amp; Ors</a>. (supra) by the plaintiff are

apparel distinguishable. The precedents express News Paper VLC v.

Liver Pool Delhi Post and Eco PLC &amp; Ors. is also distinguishable.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                     Page 73 of 85</span>
</p><p id="p_185"> 98.     Some of the facts which are prima facie apparent are that there

have been an agreement in relation to serial Pradhan Mantri between G.

Telefilms and Maya Entertainment on 20th February, 2001 and the

telecast had commenced on 6th April, 2001. This is also the plea of the

plaintiff that the first season of serial "24" commenced later on 6th

November, 2001. The Story of Pradhan Mantri had all the elements of a

Head of State, Nuclear attack by a terrorist group etc. The said serials

also have the presentation technique of windows, time, clock etc. The

agreement between the Zee Telefilms and Maya Movie for the serial

`Time Bomb‟ was executed prima facie on 23rd November, 2004 as per

the pleadings and documents of the defendant, unless refuted and

proved by the plaintiff otherwise. The serial `Pradhan Mantri‟ also had a

rerun as "Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb" in November, 2004 and the

shooting of the allegedly offending serial "Time Bomb" commenced in

December, 2004, unless established otherwise after the evidence by the

plaintiff or if the defendants are not able to prove their pleas and

contentions.
</p>
<p id="p_186">

</p><p id="p_187">99.     In the circumstances, the plea of the plaintiff that on the basis of

the alleged meeting between the Chairman and some representative of

the plaintiff on 1st March, 2005 in which according to the plaintiff, the

defendants had demanded the license for the said serial which was

however, rejected by the plaintiff will not be of much consequences, as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                     Page 74 of 85</span>
 the serial Pradhan Mantri had started much earlier than the telecast of

the serial "24" first season. Even the shooting of the allegedly offending

serial "Time Bomb" had commenced before the alleged meeting on 1st

March, 2005. The plea of the defendants that tenor of the meeting was

entirely different then what has been alleged by the plaintiff, appears

prima facie to be correct. In the facts and circumstances, as alleged by

both the parties, it cannot be inferred even prima facie that whatsoever

has been alleged by the plaintiff in respect of alleged meeting between

the representative of the plaintiff and the chairman of defendant No.1

on 1st March, 2005 can be accepted. It may be that the plaintiff is able

to establish his plea after evidence, however, on the basis of the

allegation and counter allegation made by the plaintiff and the

defendant, the same cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_188">

</p><p id="p_189">100. The plea of the defendants is also that the serial "Time Bomb"

accepts thread from the earlier serial Pradhan Mantri and narrate the

story "three years later". If there is substantial similarity between the

serial `Pradhan Mantri‟ and the serial „Time Bomb‟ then the plea of the

defendant that in fact the serial `Time Bomb‟ accepts the thread from

the serial Pradhan Mantri and narrate the story in continuation cannot

be repelled. The plaintiff has emphasized in comparing the format of

plaintiff‟s serial "24" and defendant‟s serial "Time Bomb", however, from

the perusal of the pleadings, it is apparent that the alleged similarity

between the serial Pradhan Mantri and Time Bomb has not even been


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                   Page 75 of 85</span>
 alleged appropriately by the plaintiff. If it is to be held that the serial

`Time Bomb‟ is in continuation after few years of the serial `Pradhan

Mantri‟ then prima facie the plea of the plaintiff that `Time Bomb‟ is the

copy of the serial "24" cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_190">

</p><p id="p_191">101. The another significant factor which repels against the plea of the

convenience about the meeting of the representative of plaintiff and the

chairman of defendant No.1 on 1st March, 2005 is that before the

alleged meeting, the agreement for production between defendant No.1

and other defendants had already been executed, unless proved

otherwise by the plaintiff by evidence. Therefore, it has to be inferred

that by the time alleged meeting on 1st March, 2005 had taken place

between the plaintiff and the defendants, the serial `Time Bomb‟ was

under the advance stage of preparation in terms of concept, note script,

and story line and substantial shooting had already taken place. If that

be so it cannot be accepted that chairman of defendant No.1 had asked

for the license for production of serial on the line of the serial "24" from

the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_192">

</p><p id="p_193">102. The plaintiff has also claimed copyright in presentation technique

and the story line and characters. There appears to be a little dichotomy

between the pleadings of the plaintiff and the submission made on

behalf of the plaintiff during the protracted arguments. In the plaint,

the plaintiff has claimed the copyright in the "Cinematograph Film" and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                     Page 76 of 85</span>
 "Underlying Literary work" whereas later on the emphasis had been

made on the format being a protectable feature. If the plaintiff has been

claiming the copyright in the literary work of the serial, then naturally

format was not a part of the script and therefore there could not be a

violation of literary work on account of alleged violation of format of the

plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_194">

</p><p id="p_195">103. The        plaintiff     has      claimed     copyright     in   the     presentation

techniques/format especially in use of digital clock, use of split screens

and     adoption       of   concept       of    "Real   Time".   These      allegations    of

presentation technique as alleged by the plaintiff, in view of a number of

instances and documents produced by the defendants cannot be

termed to be unique to the serial of the plaintiff. All these presentation

techniques/format do appear in many films and programs.



</p><p id="p_196">104. Countdown normally with a clock appears to be have been used

in "Nick of Time"; "High Noon"; and "Dr. Strange Love" and a number of

war films etc. The split screen technique also cannot be contended to be

unique of the serial of the plaintiff. The defendants have given various

instances of films and serials where these techniques have been used.

Similarly, `Real Time‟ format is alleged to have been used in various

films and serials and the technique is alleged to date back to 1949 and

was used in the film "the Set Up" and others. In the circumstances, it

will be difficult to infer that the plaintiff can claim originality in these


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_78">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                                    Page 77 of 85</span>
 presentation techniques. These presentation techniques are apparently

enabled by the use of Modern Technology          e.g., split screen copy

achieved by the advance camera by stretching; digital clock can be

inserted by use of advance camera and "Real Time" is also a format and

on the basis of these the plaintiff, prima facie, cannot claim any

uniqueness in its serial `24‟ on the basis of it. Reliance for this can be

placed on <a href="/doc/399114/" id="a_12">NRI Film Production Associates (P) Ltd. v. Twentieth Century

Fox Film Corporation &amp; Anr</a>. (supra), Green v. Broadcasting Corporation

of New Zealand (supra) and Norowzian v. Arks Ltd. &amp; Ors. (supra)

discussed hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_197">

</p><p id="p_198">105. By protracted argument and a number of decisions cited by the

plaintiff, the attempt has been made regarding copyright on the basis of

manner of presentation in which the time clock is an integral part of the

story; character move in the break; sound of clock and 24 hours split

into one hour with no flash back. Apparently on the basis of the law

discussed hereinabove there cannot be a copyright in the original

format of presentation as all these presentation techniques which have

been used in various films in the past, plaintiff cannot claim anything

unique, noble and new in the same.
</p>
<p id="p_199">

</p><p id="p_200">106. Though both the parties have referred to a very large number of

precedents at the interim stage when the parties have not led evidence

and alleged similarities and dissimilarities and other factors have not


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                   Page 78 of 85</span>
 been established. Whether on the basis of these large number of

decision the pleas can be decided in this case at this stage? It must be

remembered          that decision is only an authority for what it actually

decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every

observation found therein nor what logically follows from the various

observations made in it. The ratio of any decision must be understood

in the background of the facts of that case. It has been said long time

ago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not

what logically follows from it. It is well settled that a little difference in

facts or additional facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential

value of a decision. A decision is only an authority for what it actually

decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every

observation found therein nor what logically follows from the various

observations made in it. The ratio of any decision must be understood

in the background of the facts of that case. It is well settled that a little

difference in facts or additional facts may make a lot of difference in the

precedential value of a decision. The plaintiff has also tried to

distinguish Norowzian (supra), NRI Film Production Associates (P) Ltd.

(supra), Barbra Tailor Brad Ford (supra), Green v. Broadcasting

Corporation        of   New      Zealand        (supra),   Marey   v.   N.B.C.    (supra),

<a href="/doc/1734007/" id="a_13">R.G.Anand v. Deluxe Films</a> (supra) and Borden v. Andrew. On the basis

of the descriptions and the prepositions crystallized by the plaintiff, this

Court is even unable to accept the pleas of the plaintiff that the cases




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                                    Page 79 of 85</span>
 relied on by the defendants do not support the pleas and contentions of

the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_201">

</p><p id="p_202">107. Viewing of some of the plaintiff‟s and defendants‟ episodes of

serial also reveal that concept utilized by the of defendants‟ allegedly

offending serial, are not the same as that of plaintiff. Terrorism is very

common thing and plaintiff cannot contend that it is unique to his

serial. Similarity the presentation techniques cannot be the basis to

contend that there has been a copyright violation, as there cannot be

any copyright in the manner and the format of presentation. In the

circumstances, even the theme of the plaintiff‟s serial also cannot be

termed to be noble. The plaintiffs have alleged similarity between the

story line of the plaintiff‟s serial "24" and defendants serial "Time Bomb"

whereas the defendants have highlighted the differences between the

story line of the plaintiff‟s serial and their serial. Considering the

qualitative differences between the serial of the plaintiff and serial of the

defendants, prima facie the inferences which can be drawn is that the

story line of the plaintiff‟s serial is substantially different from the story

line of the defendant‟s serial "Time Bomb".
</p>
<p id="p_203">

</p><p id="p_204">108. As already held the plaintiff cannot claim a copyright on the basis

of the presentation techniques which are enabled by the use of modern

technology e.g. splitting the screen which is possible by advance camera

and editing technique, inserting clock to show time which is very easy


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                       Page 80 of 85</span>
 in modern cameras and the use of "Real Time" format a story told are

24 hours. How does one distinguish between a copy of an idea or a plot,

which is permitted, and the copy of an expression of the author, which

is protected and which is his or her own? Where does idea end and

expression begin? These are the questions which are the most difficult

to answer or even to explain at the interim stage. These are situations

for legal assessment after parties lead exhaustive evidence. Just as

there is no mathematical formula for finding out when it is just and

convenient to appoint a receiver, similarly, although at a more refined

level of intellectual operation, there is no final and exact way of

determining what is a copy, or what is a copy of the expression, or what

is a copy of the idea, or what is a copy of the idea only. It was observed

that in copyright cases especially, the judgments should be read as a

whole. It is possible to find apparently contradictory statements within

the very same copyright judgment. The subject is such that exact

dealing is not easily possible.
</p>
<p id="p_205">


</p><p id="p_206">109. The plaintiff also prima facie cannot claim the copyright on the

basis of the general story line even taking the entirety of the defendants‟

serial `Pradhan Mantri‟, `Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb‟ &amp; `Time Bomb‟. It

is apparent to an ordinary person that the serials of the defendants are

different from the serial of the plaintiff "24". Similarities which have

been pointed out by the plaintiff appear to be superficial and such type



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                    Page 81 of 85</span>
 of similarity can be inferred in many different serials. Terrorism, attacks

on country heads has already been subject matter in various movies

and serials and the plaintiff cannot claim exclusivity in respect of the

same. From the defendants‟ serial "Time Bomb", it is apparent that it

revolves around the India and Pakistan. There is definite co-relation

between the serial "Pradhan Mantri" which was recast as "Pradhan

Mantri Time Bomb" and thereafter "Time Bomb". Characters between

these three serials are quite common and the story continues after

three years later.
</p>
<p id="p_207">

</p><p id="p_208">110. The allegation by the plaintiff that "Pradhan Mantri" and

"Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb" are two different serials altogether prima

facie is not acceptable. If the serials "Pradhan Mantri" &amp; "Pradhan

Mantri Time Bomb" and `Time Bomg‟ are different serials altogether

then a fortiori the serial "24" of the plaintiff cannot be contended to be

similar to that of "Time Bomb". The plaintiff has emphasized that the

Digital Time Clock was introduced for the first time in November-

December in the rerun of the serial "Pradhan Mantri" in the name of

"Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb" and not in `Pradhan Mantri‟. However,

even it is accepted it still negates the contentions of the plaintiff that

the use of the digital time clock is unique to the serial of the plaintiff

„24" as it was used in `Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb‟.
</p>
<p id="p_209">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                    Page 82 of 85</span>
</p><p id="p_210"> 111. The plaintiff has also emphasized the alleged difference between

"Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb" in order to contend that same has not

been continued afterwards in                    "Time Bomb" 9/11. According to the

plaintiff the concept and story developers are different. However, that

will not make the serials completely different. If in the sequel "Time

Bomb" 9/11 the assassination of the Pradhan Mantri is not explained,

this itself will not lead to the inferences that "Time Bomb" 9/11 is not

the sequel of the "Pradhan Mantri Time Bomb".
</p>
<p id="p_211">

</p><p id="p_212">112. The plaintiff in its note on additional arguments on the VCDs filed

by the defendant on 20th September, 2008, has tried to emphasize that

"Time Bomb" 9/11 is not an independent creation on the ground that

defendant No.1 in his written statement has claimed that Mr.Ketan

Mehta is a script writer as the name of Mr.Uttam Gada does not appear

in the acknowledgement of "Time Bomb" 9/11 and no credits have been

given to script writer of "Time Bomb" and credit have been given only to

coordinator Mr.Saleem Puna Wala and the credits have been given to

hair stylist, dress man, spot boys and even to office boys and suppliers

and not to script writer. The suit is still at the preliminary state and the

parties have not lead evidence. Merely on the basis of the affidavit filed

by the parties, the inferences which have been drawn conclusively by

the plaintiff cannot be drawn and consequently, the inferences drawn

by the plaintiff that "Time Bomb" 9/11 is not an independent creation

cannot be accepted in the facts and circumstances, nor in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                             Page 83 of 85</span>
 circumstances it can be held that the defendants‟ serial "Time Bomb" is,

prima facie, a copy of the plaintiff‟s serial „24".



</p><p id="p_213">113. The alleged similarity given by the plaintiff in the format of his

serial "24‟ and defendants‟ "Time Bomb", conspicuously ignores various

dissimilarity which are apparent on watching the two serials and

consequently, on the basis of the just 14 frames of the two serials, it is

difficult for this Court to draw inferences that serial "Time Bomb‟ is a

copy of the serial "24".
</p>
<p id="p_214">

</p><p id="p_215">114. The plaintiff has tried to emphasize about the litigation regarding

the change of name sought by the plaintiff where some of the

defendants had agreed to the change of name to Zee Max. However, this

fact in itself does not reflect in any manner that serial "Time Bomb‟ is a

copy of the plaintiff‟s serial "24". If one takes similarity and dissimilarity

and considers them after juxtaposing them, the inferences which have

been drawn by the plaintiff cannot be drawn even prima facie and this

Court is unable to conclude prima facie that defendants‟ serial "Time

Bomb" is a copy of plaintiff‟s serial "24" or is similar to that. The list of

differences rather clearly shows that story line is different and the

treatment and expression are also different.
</p>
<p id="p_216">

</p><p id="p_217">115. In the circumstances, the plaintiff has failed to make out prima

facie case at the stage. Since the serial has already been telecast,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">I.A Nos. 4776, 4777/2005 in C.S (OS) 868/2005                       Page 84 of 85</span>
 restraining the defendants from telecasting the serial further will cause

more inconvenience to the defendants, it is more so because the serial

of the defendant "Time Bomb" has already been telecast as also the

serial of the plaintiff. Despite the serial already having been telecast, the

plaintiff has not modified his prayers in any manner despite the

passage of considerable time. In these circumstances, it is apparent

that defendant shall suffer irreparable loss if the plaintiff is granted

injunction as has been sought by him. It may also lead to multiplicity of

proceedings and in the circumstances, it will not be appropriate even to

direct the defendant to submit the script of his serial to the plaintiff at

this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_218">

</p><p id="p_219">116. Consequently in the facts and circumstances and for the forgoing

reasons, the applications of the plaintiff are dismissed. It is, however,

clarified that anything stated hereinbefore is not the final expression of

the opinion by the Court on the pleas and contentions raised on behalf

of the parties. Parties are also left to bear their own costs.
