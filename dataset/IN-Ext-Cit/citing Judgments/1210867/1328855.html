</p>
<p id="p_28">        (I).  Whether communal clash between  the  muslims  on  one  side  and

There is no dispute regarding these facts.  P.W.14 has  also  stated  that  P.
W.12  has  sustained  injury  in that incident though P.W.12 has not spoken to
that effect.  The learned counsel for the appellants  has  also  not  disputed
this aspect.    From  the  narration of events, we are of the opinion that the
motive for occurrence is proved.
</p>
<p id="p_33">Point No.II:
</p><p id="p_34">        10.  It is true that the deceased Anwar,  resident  of  Moors  Garden,
Coonoor, on  14.4.1995  at about 9.45 a.m.  sustained injuries in the hands of

sustained by him in the incident.  There is no dispute regarding this  aspect.

the narration of events, we have no hesitation to hold that the deceased Anwar
died due to homicide.

The prosecution relied on the eye witnesses namely Tmt.  Maimoon  Bagum  P.W.2   
wife  of  the deceased Anwar and Azaruddin P.W.3 brother's son of the deceased
Khadhar Sha, Khadhar  Sha,(P.W.1)  shop  boy  of  the  deceased  coupled  with
postmortem  report, Serological report, blood stained cloths and blood stained
weapon of offence to substantiate the guilty act of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_37">        12.  The point for consideration is whether the alleged eye  witnesses
can be  relied  on in this case.  All the three eye witnesses have stated that
they have seen the accused assaulting  the  deceased  Anwar  causing  bleeding
injuries  and  that the injured was taken to hospital wherein, he was declared
dead.  The blood stained cloth of the deceased namely lunghi, White  Polyester
full  shirt  were  marked  as  M.0.8 and M.O.7 and the same were subjected for
Serological test.  The blood stained cloth of the deceased contains "A"  group
origin.   The  blood  stained  cloth  of the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman and
Balan contains "A" group origin.  Moreso,  the  blood  stained  cloth  of  the
accused  Varadharajan  contains human blood but the grouping test could not be
done.  Similarly, weapon of  offence  used  by  the  said  accused  were  also
subjected for  Serological  test.    Weapon  of  offence  used  by the accused
Varadharajan contains  human  blood.    P.W.18  spoke  in  detail  about   the
Serological test.    According  to the prosecution, blood stained cloth of the
accused and also material objects used for  the  commission  of  offence  were
seized only  in  pursuance  of  their  confession statement.  It is evident on
record that the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman has assaulted the deceased Anwar    
with M.O.1, on his chest causing severe damage to the heart.    Similarly  the
accused Balan and Varadharajan assaulted the deceased Anwar with M.O.6 , M.O.4   
and M.O.5  respectively  causing severe bleeding injuries.  Ex.P.19 postmortem
report contains  these  particulars.     Postmortem   doctor   namely   P.W.17
corroborates this  part of evidence.  So much so, on 18.11.1995 at about 11.00
p.m., the accused Balan and Varadharajan were arrested at Barliar and recorded
their statement in the presence of P.W.9 Gani and witness Sulaiman by  P.W.22. 
They  were  apprehended  by  P.W.22, while they were riding in the Motor cycle
bearing Registration No.TN.37 F 2855 which is marked as M.O.20.  Key bunch and  
RC book of the said vehicle were also seized along with motorcycle.  They were
marked as M.O.21 and M.O.22.  They have also  given  confession  statement  in
presence of P.W.9 Gani and witness Sulaiman.  Exs.P.7 and 8 are the admissible 
portion  of  the  confession  statement of the accused Balan and Varadharajan.
Thereafter, the accused Balan and Varadharajan took P.W.21 to the house of the
accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman and identified  him.    He  was  apprehended  by  
P.W.22 and  recorded  his statement.  Ex.P.11 is the admissible portion of the
confession statement of the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman.   
</p>
<p id="p_38">        13.  Thereafter, the  accused  have  taken  P.W.22  along  with  other
witness to stone quarry near Brindhavan School Road, and Ooty Road Junction at 
Coonoor  identified  the  places  and  took out their respective blood stained
cloths and weapon of offence and handed over the same  to  P.W.22  who  inturn
seized  the  same  in  the  presence  of P.W.9 Gani and witness Sulaiman under
Mahazar P.12, P.13 and P.14. 
</p>
<p id="p_39">        14.  Moreover, On  the  requisition  given  by  P.W.22,  P.W.19  after
following  all  formalities, conducted identification parade in respect of the
accused namely  (1)Rajesh  @  Anantharaman  (2)  Balan  and  Varadharajan  for
identification  by  the  eye  witnesses  namely  (1) Maimoon Begam wife of the
deceased (P.W.2), (2)  Azaruddin,  brother's  son  of  the  deceased  (P.W.3),
(3)Khadhar  Sha, shop boy of the deceased (P.W.1) and (4) Sundar, neighbour of
the deceased (P.W.5).  Except P.W.5 Sundar, other  witnesses  have  identified
the  accused  and stated that they are responsible for assaulting the deceased
Anwar at the relevant point of time, date and place in the manner  as  alleged
by the  prosecution.    Report  of  Identification  parade  has been marked as
Ex.P.26.  From the narration of events, it is apparent that the  accused  have
assaulted the deceased Anwar resulting, to his death.
</p>
<p id="p_40">        15.   The  learned  counsel for the appellants by referring to various
discrepancies and contradiction in the deposition of prosecution witnesses and
contended that the alleged eye witness could not have been present at the time
of occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_41">        16.  Now, we have to find out  whether  there  is  any  truth  in  the
contention of  the learned counsel for the appellants.  It is to be noted that
though the accused are strangers to the eye witnesses,  they  have  identified
the  accused  at  the  time  of  identification  parade  except  P.W.5 Sundar.
Moreover,  the  vehicle  used  for  the  commission  of  offence  were  infact
identified by the witnesses since , they have noted the vehicle Number.
</p>
<p id="p_42">        17.   In  fact,  the witness Azaruddin, P.W.3 (Juvenile witness at the
time of occurrence  age 9) has taken note of the number of the motor cycle on
the sand wherein, he was playing at the time of  occurrence.    This  part  of
evidence has  been  elicited  at  the time of cross examination of P.W.3.  His
evidence reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_43">"..  ..  ..  nkhl;lhh; irf;fpspd; ek;giu ehd; kzypy; vGjp itj;njd;/ ..  ..  ..
"
</p>
<p id="p_44">Moreover, the accused namely Balan and  Varadharajan  were  apprehended  while  
they were riding motor cycle bearing No.  TN.37 F 2855, which was used for the
commission of offence.  The vehicle No.  TN37 F 2855 has been clearly referred
in the  complaint  Ex.P.1.    The  presence  of  witness Azaruddin and playing
infront of the shop of the deceased Anwar at the time of occurrence  has  been
referred in Ex.P1.  which reads as follows.
</p>
<p id="p_45">(Vernacular portion deleted)

The evidence of P.W.3 at the time of cross examination  is  more  relevant  to
corroborate the prosecution case which reads as follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_46">(Vernacular portion deleted)

From the above discussion, it is proved beyond doubt that P.W.3 Azaruddin  was
very much present at the time of occurrence.
</p>
<p id="p_47">        18.The  specific  submission of the learned counsel for the appellants
that since the accused are strangers to the witnesses and that the  assailants
physical  features  have  not been described properly in the First Information
Report, how could it be possible for P.W.22 Inspector of Police  to  apprehend
the assailants  concerned  in  this  case.  It is to be noted that the vehicle
used for the commission of offence has been described in detail in t he  First
Information Report.  Moreover, the accused Balan and Varadharajan while riding
the  said  vehicle were apprehended by P.W.22 on identification of the vehicle
in presence of P.W.9 Gani and witness Sulaiman. 
</p>
<p id="p_48">        19.  Moreso, the accused Balan and Varadharajan took P.W.22  Inspector
to  the  house  of  the  accused  Rajesh @ Anantharaman and identified him and
thereafter the said accused was also apprehended by P.W.22.   From  the  above
discussion,  we are of the view that the submission of the learned counsel for
the appellants has to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_49">        20.  It is worthy to mention that the witnesses namely Maimoon Begum ,
Azaruddin and  Khadhar  Sha  have  identified  the  accused  at  the  time  of
identification parade.    Whereas,  the  learned  counsel for the appellants /
accused submitted that these witnesses were taken to the  police  station  and
identified  the  accused  Rajesh @ Anantharaman, Balan and Varadharajan and in 
consequent  of  that  they  have  identified  the  accused  at  the  time   of
identification  parade  and as such the report of identification parade has to
be rejected.  Such submission of the learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  /
accused  has  no  force,  in  view of the fact that the accused at the time of
remand have not stated anything about the presence of witnesses in the  police
station to note down their physical feature, to facilitate to identify them at
the time  of  identification  parade.   The accused were remanded on 19.4.1995
till 03 .5.1996 by coonoor magistrate and the same reads as follows:
</p>



<p id="p_50">        "Accused produced at 1.00 p.m.  No complaints.  Remanded up to  3.5.19
96"
</p><p id="p_51">        21.   Moreso,  the  suggestive  case of the accused that the witnesses
were taken to police  station  wherein,  they  have  taken  note  of  physical
features of the accused was infact denied by them.
</p>
<p id="p_52">        22.  The learned counsel for the appellants further contended that the
blood  group  of  the accused was not identified and as such it is not safe to
rely on the serological report to tag  the  accused  with  the  commission  of
offence and  render  finding  against  them.  In this case, the witnesses have
identified the assailants.  Moreso, the vehicle used  for  the  commission  of
offence was  also  identified  by the witnesses.  Apart from that, the accused
Balan and Varadharajan were apprehended by P.W.22 in  the  presence  of  P.W.9  
Gani  and witness Sulaiman while they were riding on M.O.20 which was used for
the commission of offence.  Apart from that, the weapon of  offence  used  for
the commission  of  offence  contains  human blood.  Moreso, the blood stained
cloth of the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman and the accused Balan also  contain  
blood of "A" origin.  Because of the overwhelming evidence against the accused
for  having participated in the commission of offence, we are of the view that
the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants cannot be accepted.
</p>
<p id="p_53">        23.  It is worthy to note that P.W.9, being the eye witness for arrest
of the accused and seizure of weapon of offence along with their blood stained
cloth has spoken in detail in support of  the  prosecution  theory.    Nothing
worthy elicited at the time of cross examination to discredit this witness.
</p>
<p id="p_54">        24.   It  is  also  elicited at the time of cross examination of P.W.9
Gani that except himself and tea shop owner Sulaiman, no one  present  at  the
time of  arrest of the accused namely Balan and Varadharajan.  The evidence of
P.W.9 at the time of cross examination reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_55">(Vernacular portion deleted)
P.W.22 further supports the evidence of P.W.9 regarding this aspect.  It reads
as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_56">(Vernacular portion deleted)

</p><p id="p_57">        25.   In  such  circumstances, no one can attribute any motive against
the P.W.22 for taking P.W.9 as eye witness for the arrest of the  accused  and
seizure of M.Os.  The lower court has also accepted the prosecution theory and
rightly convicted the accused for the offence referred in the judgment.
</p><p id="p_58">        26.   Moreso,  the defence theory is that the accused were apprehended
on 14.4.1995 at about 10.30 p.m.  by the Deputy Superintendent of  Police  and
that they were identified by the witnesses at the police station to facilitate
the  witnesses  to  identify  them at the time of identification parade and as
such, the report of the identification parade has no legal value.  It is to be
noted that the alleged offence took place at  about  9.30  p.m  on  14.4.1995.
Complaint  was  lodged  at about 10.45 pm and investigating officer commen ced
investigating at 00.01 hours on 15.4.1995.    In  such  circumstances,  it  is
highly doubtful whether the appellants/ accused were really apprehended by the
police on 1  4.4.1995  at  about  10.30  p.m.   itself as alleged by them.  It
cannot be believed and therefore, the defence theory has  to  be  rejected  in
this context.
</p>
<p id="p_59">        27.   The defence counsel further submitted that soon after the arrest
of the accused i.e.  on 14.4.1995 itself, they have sent the telegram  to  the
concerned  persons for illegal detention, which fact is also evident about the
news published in the paper on the next day  about  the  apprehension  of  the
accused  in  this  case, and as such, the arrest of the accused and seizure of
M.Os on 18.4.1995 as alleged by the prosecution shall not  be  accepted.    In
fact  P.W.2  denied  the  suggestive  case of the accused at the time of cross
examination.  If the contention of the learned  counsel  for  the  accused  is
true,  the  accused  ought to have filed the copy of the telegram and also the
copy of the paper publication to disprove the prosecution theory.    According
to  them,  they  are  in  possession  of documentary evidence, namely, copy of
telegram and copy of paper publication.  But they  have  miserably  failed  to
produce the  same  to  prove  the  contention  of  the  prosecution.  From the
narration of events, we are of the opinion that  there  is  no  truth  in  the
defence  theory  and  accordingly,  the  contention  of the defence counsel is
rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_60">        28.  At the time of examination  under  <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_9">Section  313</a>  Cr.P.C.,  it  is
stated  that  the  witnesses have taken note of their identity at the sub jail
also even before the identification parade.  But such a case  of  the  accused
was  not suggested, to any of the prosecution witness and as such, the case of
the accused has to be rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_61">        29.  The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted  that  on
14.4.1995 itself the vehicle concerned were seized at the time of apprehension
of the accused and as such, the seizure of the vehicle on 1 8.4.1995 by P.W.22
is contrary  to  the  fact.  It is to be noted that P.W.22 has taken necessary
steps by addressing a letter to the  concerned  authorities  for  tracing  the
vehicle used for the commission of offence.  Such fact was not controverted at
the time of cross examination.  The Evidence of P.W.22 reads as follows:
" ..  ..    ..   md;th; bfhiy tHf;F ele;jt[lnd bfhiy rk;ge;jg;gl;l thfd vz;fis
midj;J fhty; epiya';fSf;Fk; bjhpag;gLj;jptpl;nlhk;/ ..  ..  ..  "
If the contention of the learned counsel is really true then P.W.22 would  not
have  ventured  to address the letter to the concerned authorities for tracing
out of the vehicle concerned in the commission of offence.   The  evidence  of
P.W.22  at  the  time  of  cross  examination  would  justify that the vehicle
concerned in this case was seized only on 1 8.4.1995 and not on  14.4.1995  as
alleged by  the  learned  counsel  for the appellants.  The evidence of P.W.22
regarding this aspect reads as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_62">(Vernacular portion deleted)

From the narration  of  events,  we  have  no  hesitation  to  hold  that  the
contention  of  the  learned  counsel for the appellants that the accused were
apprehended on 14.4.1995 itself has no merits and accordingly,  it  cannot  be
sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_63">        30.  The learned counsel for the appellants/accused submitted that the
deceased ought to have sustained injuries at the time of communal clash, which
took  place on 14.4.1995 between Muslims on one side and Vishwa Hindu Parishat  
on the other side and that the accused were apprehended in  mistaken  identity
and as such the prosecution theory has to be rejected.
</p><p id="p_64">31.   It is to be noted that the communal clash between the Muslims and Hindus
took place on 14.4.1995 at Coonoor.  Prosecution examined P.W.6  Anbazhagan  ,  
P.W.10  to  P.W.14  and P.W.22 to prove the earlier incident of communal clash
between Hindus and Muslims in the public place at Coonoor.
</p>
<p id="p_65">        32.  The case on hand happened at about 9.30 p.m at the  shop  of  the
deceased Anwar.    It is not the suggestive case of the accused/ appellants to
any one of the  eye  witnesses  that  the  deceased  and  other  injured  have
sustained  injuries  during  the time of communal clash between the Hindus and
Muslims which took place on 14.4.1995 at Coonoor.  The alleged communal  clash  
not happened  in  the  shop  of  the  deceased.   Both incidents took place at
different point of time, at different places.  The first occurrence took place
in the public place.  The persons sustained injury in the communal clash which
took place on the same day at Coonoor, have given complaint to  the  concerned
police station.   and FIR was also registered against the assailant.  The case
on hand is happened much later at 9.30 p.m.  in the shop of  the  deceased  on
the very same day.
</p><p id="p_66">        33.  So, we are unable to accept the contention of the learned counsel
for  the  appellants  /  accused that the deceased and other injured sustained
injuries only at the time of communal clash between Hindus and Muslims.
</p>
<p id="p_67">        34.  It is borne out by record that the  appellants  namely  Rajesh  @
Anantharaman,  Balan  and  Varadharajan  were  in  possession of deadly weapon 
namely Aruval and Iron rod causing injuries on the deceased.    In  fact,  the
weapon  of  offence used by Balan and Varadharajan were kept in the motorcycle
of the first accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman.  So much so, the accused Balan and  
Varadharajan took the said weapon of offence from the  vehicle  of  the  first
accused and  entered  in  to  the house of the deceased and attacked him.  The
manner of attack by the accused at the shop  of  the  deceased  exposes  their
pre-planned attack.   In this context also, we are of the view that the act of
the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman, Balan  and  Varadharajan  amply  prove  the  
motive aspect submitted by the prosecution.
</p>
<p id="p_68">        35.   The learned counsel for the appellants/accused further submitted
that since the alleged eye witnesses have taken note of the physical  features
of  the  accused  Rajesh  @ Anantharaman, Balan and Varadharajan at the police 
station before taking part in the identification parade conducted by P.W.14  ,
Magistrate, the  identification report looses its credibility.  He also relied
on certain passages contained in the  following  rulings  in  support  of  his
contention.
</p>
<p id="p_69"><a href="/doc/401470/" id="a_10">HASIB v.  The State of Bihar</a> (  AIR 1972 SUPREME COURT 283 )    
        "..  ..   ..    The  purpose  of  test  identification  is to test the
statement of the witness made in  the  Court,  which  constitutes  substantive
evidence,  it  being  the safe rule that the sworn testimony of the witness in
Court as to the identity of the accused required corroboration in the form  of
an earlier  identification  proceeding.    Where  there is no such substantive
evidence at all as to the identity of the accused the  earlier  identification
parade cannot be of any assistance to the prosecution.  ..  ..  .."
<a href="/doc/1642920/" id="a_11">PHOOL CHAND v.  STATE OF RAJASTHAN</a> (AIR 1977 SUPREME COURT 315)               
        "..  ..    ..Held  that the evidence of the witness was neither wholly
unacceptable nor wholly impeccable.  There were certain features in this  case
which  should put the Court on its guard not to rely on his bare word, without
some assurance from independent sources.  As there was no independent evidence   
on the record to confirm the oral testimony of the witness in  regard  to  the
identity and connection of the appellants with the murder, the Court would, as
a  matter  of  abundant  caution,  refrain  from accepting the uncorroborated,
infirm testimony of the witness, and accord  the  appellants  the  benefit  of
doubt and acquit him.  ..  ..  .."
</p><p id="p_70">        36.  In this case, the accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman was identified by
the other  accused resulting to his arrest by P.W.22 Inspector of Police.  The
vehicle used for the commission of offence with registration  number  referred
in  the  complaint  itself  leads to the apprehension of the accused Balan and
Varadharajan by P.W.22 Inspector of Police.  Moreover, the juvenile  witnesses
Azaruddin  (P.W.3)  has  seen  the assailant coming to the scene of occurrence
with the vehicle concerned in this case and had make a note of the  number  of
the vehicle over  the  sand  in which he was playing.  P.W.  2, Maimaoon Begum
and P.W.3, Azaruddin are none other than the wife and  brother's  son  of  the
deceased.   P.W.1  Khadhar  Sha  is  none  other  than  the  shopkeeper of the
deceased.  They were very much present at the time of occurrence.  Apart  from
that,  weapon of offence used in the commission of offence were recovered only
in pursuance of the statement made by the appellants/ accused.  So we  are  of
the  view  that  the  decision  relied  on  by  the  learned  counsel  for the
appellants/accused in support of this contention  is  not  applicable  to  the
facts on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_71">        37.   The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  /  accused  further
contended that it is not safe to rely on the  testimony  of  juvenile  witness
namely  Azaruddin  (P.W.3), as his statement is inconsistent to the other part
of the evidence of the prosecution.  He also relied on certain passages in the
following rulings in support of this contention.
</p><p id="p_72">1.<a href="/doc/225119/" id="a_12">PANCHHI v.  STATE OF U.P</a>.1998 (7) SCC 177

        "..  ..  ..  4O.  From the evidence available  on  recordk  it  is  no
doubt true  that the preliminary questions were not put to this witness P.  W.
</p><p id="p_74">2.  But it is pertinent to note that on the date of examination  his  age  was
shown as  16  years.  The credibility of this witness cannot be discredited on
the ground on non putting preliminary questions to test  whether  the  witness
was capable  of  giving rational answers or not?  In the considered opinion of
this Court, this will not alter the situation in any  way  especially  in  the
light of the age of this witness.  It is needless to say that it is not a case
of  a  child  witness  of  a  tender  age but a grown up boy having sufficient
understanding.  The hostility towards the prosecution version shown  by  P.W.1
definitely  may  have  to be viewed in the light of the background of the case
also.
</p><p id="p_75">        38.  It is to be noted that the juvenile witness was examined as P.W.3
in this case.  His presence has been referred in EX.P1.  The fact  that  P.W.3
was playing  at  the time of occurrence has been referred in Ex.P.1.  Further,
the presence of P.W.3, at the time of occurrence was also spoken to by  P.W.1.
More  so,  P.W.3  having  seen  the  arrival  of  motorcycles,  at the seen of
occurrence, immediately, he made a note of the vehicle Number over the sand on
which he was playing.  The credibility of this witness was not shaken  at  the
time of  cross  examination.  The narration of events by P.W.3 is corroborated
by the other witnesses.  In such circumstances, we are of the  view  that  the
contention of the learned counsel for the appellants cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_76">        39.  The learned counsel for the appellants/ accused further contended
that  the  blood  group of the accused was not tested to bring home the guilty
act of the accused and as such serological report filed in this case cannot be
relied on .  The learned counsel for the appellants / accused  further  relied
on  the  certain  passages  in  the  following  rulings  in  support  of  this
contention.

crime  because there is no evidence that the underwear belonged to the accused
and further the possibility of the underwear bein stained with  the  blood  of
the  person  to  whom it belonged, or the accused if he was wearing it has not
been ruled out.  ..  ..  .."
</p><p id="p_79">        40.  It is to be noted that the accused were  identified  by  the  eye
witnesses.   The  material  objects  used  for  the commission of offence were
recovered, in pursuance of the confession statement of the accused  by  P.W.22
Inspector of  Police.    Moreover,  blood  stained  cloth  of the appellants /
accused Rajesh @ Anantharaman, Balan and Varadharajan  were  also  seized  and   
marked in  this  case.    So  much  so the accused Balan and Varadharajan were
apprehended by P.W.22 while riding M.O.  20, in pursuance of the  identity  of
the vehicle  referred  in  Ex.P.1.    Rajesh @ Anantharaman was apprehended by
P.W.22 Inspector on the information furnished by the accused /appellants Balan
and Varadharajan.       <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_16">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act relates  to  the
information  received  from the accused facilitating the investigating officer
discovering some fact concerned in the commission of offence.   That  means  a
fact  discovered  in  an information supplied by the accused in his disclosure
statement is a relevant fact and  that  is  only  admissible  in  evidence  if
something new is discovered or recovered from the accused which was not within
the  knowledge  of the police before recording the disclosure statement of the
accused. 
</p><p id="p_80">        41.  The above proposition is laid  down  in  the  decision  in  <a href="/doc/44098773/" id="a_17">KAMAL
KISHORE v.   STATE  (DELHI ADMINISTRATION</a>) (1997) 2 CRIMES 169 (Del).  In this     
case, the identity of  the  accused  Rajesh  @  Anantharaman  was  within  the
knowledge  of  other accused and on information supplied by the accused namely
Balan and Varadharajan lead to the identification and arrest  of  the  accused
Rajesh @  Anantharaman.  This part of evidence is admissible as per <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_18">Section 27</a>
of the Indian Evidence Act.  There cannot be any contra  view  regarding  this
aspect.  Information furnished by the said accused for the apprehension of the
accused  Rajesh  @  Anantharaman  is admissible under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_19">Section 27</a> of the Indian
Evidence Act.
</p>
<p id="p_81">        42.  In such circumstances, we are of the view that the submission  of
the  learned  counsel  for  the appellants / accused coupled with the decision
cited by him are not applicable to the facts on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_82">        43.  The learned counsel for the appellants/accused further relied  on
the principles enunciated in the decision <a href="/doc/1296255/" id="a_20">VIRSA SINGH v.  STATE OF PUNJAB</a> (AIR   
1958  SC 465) and submitted that the prosecution failed to prove the intention
of the accused to murder of the deceased Anwar at the relevant point of  time.
The  fact  that  all  the accused came together at the relevant point of time,
date and place with the possession of deadly weapon  namely  Aruval  and  Iron
rod, entering the shop of the deceased after identification assaulting him and
thereafter  assaulting  the  shop  boy P.W.1 who came there to prevent further
assault, would prove that the accused have assaulted the deceased only with  a
view to  murder  him.    The  principles  laid  down  in the said ruling which
squarely meet the requirement to bring home the guilty act of the accused.
</p>
<p id="p_83">        44.  The learned counsel for the accused further submitted that motive
and  recovery  of  the  blood  stained  cloths  of  the  accused  were  wholly
insufficient to sustain the charge of murder.  He also relied on the following
ruling in support of this contention.
</p>

<p id="p_84"><a href="/doc/1866055/" id="a_21">NARSINBHAI v.  CHHATRASINH</a> (AIR 1977 SC 1753)       
        "..  ..   ..  2.We are prepared to assume in favour of the prosecution
that the evidence in regard to the incident of the 23rd near the pond and  the
evidence  in  regard  to the incident which took place near the Ota of the Pir
shows that the respondents had some motive for committing the crime.   We  may 
also  accept that blood-stained shirt and dhoti were seized from the person of
respondent 1 and dharias were seized from the houses of respondents 1  and  3.
But  these circumstances are in our opinion wholly insufficient for sustaining
the charge of murder of which the respondents are accused.  ..  ..  ..  "
</p>
<p id="p_85">        45.  The said case is based on the circumstantial evidence only.   But
the case on hand is totally different.  Eye witnesses examined to identify the
assailant.  Apart from the material objects used for the commission of offence
were  also  seized  in  pursuance  of the confession statement of the accused.
Moreso, the vehicle used for the commission of offence  were  also  seized  in
this case.    In  fact  the  vehicle  used  for  the commission of offence was
mentioned in the F.I.R.  itself.  In this context, we are of the view that the
said ruling is not applicable to the facts on hand.
</p>
<p id="p_86">        46.   The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  /  accused  further
contended  that  there  is  conflict  between  the  oral testimony and medical
evidence with regard to the dimension and shape of the injuries found  on  the
victim,  while  comparing  the  size  of the weapon used for the commission of
offence, it is not safe to convict the accused/appellants.  He also relied  on
the following decisions in support of this contention.
</p>
<p id="p_87"><a href="/doc/1529839/" id="a_22">THAMAN KUMAR v.  STATE OF UNIION TERRITORY OF CHANDIGARH</a> (2003 (7) SBR 175)               
        "...   The conflict between oral testimony and medical evidence can be
of varied dimensions and shapes.  There may be a case  where  there  is  total
absence of  injuries  which are normally caused by a particular weapon.  There
is another category where though the injuries found on the victim are  of  the
type  which  are possible by the weapon of assault, but the size and dimension
of the injuries do not exactly tally  with  the  size  and  dimension  of  the
weapon.   The third category can be where the injuries found on the victim are
such which are normally caused by the weapon of assault but they are not found
on that portion of the body where they are deposed to have been caused by  the
eyewitnesses.   The  same  kind  of  inference  cannot  be  drawn in the three
categories of apparent conflict in oral and medical evidence enumerated above.
In the first category it may legitimately be inferred that the  oral  evidence
regarding  assault  having been made from a particular weapon is not truthful.
However, in the second and third category no such inference can straightway be
drawn.  The manner and method of assault, the  position  of  the  victim,  the
resistance  offered  by him, the opportunity available to the witnesses to see
the occurrence like their distance, presence of light and many  other  similar
factors will have to be taken into consideration in judging the reliability of
ocular testimony.  .."
</p>
<p id="p_88">        47.   The  deceased  Anwar sustained 21 injuries and the same has been
clearly mentioned in the postmortem  report.    P.W.17  being  the  postmortem
doctor has  given  evidence  in  support  of  his report Ex.P.19.  He has also
explained in details about the measurements of the  injuries.    He  has  also
identified  the weapon of offence and stated that the injuries would have been
caused by them.  He further opined that the deceased would appear to have died
of Haemorrhage, shock and injury to vital  organ    Heart.    Nothing  worthy
elicited at the time of cross examination to discredit the evidence of P.W.17.
Moreover,  the  eye  witness  have  also  stated that the assailants have used
deadly weapons and caused injures.  So we are of the view that the  contention
of the learned counsel for the appellants/accused cannot be sustained.
</p>
<p id="p_89">        48.   It  is to be noted that the motive aspect has been proved beyond
any reasonable doubt in this case.  The conduct of the accused in  identifying
the  house  of  the deceased, reaching the scene of occurrence by vehicles and
assaulting the deceased with deadly weapons would also prove their pre-planned
act on the deceased.  In fact, the trial Court has not rendered  any  specific
findings,  for acquitting the accused Balan and Varadharajan under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_23">Section 302</a>
IPC after diluting the offence into one under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_24">Section 324</a> IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_90">        49.  The plain reading of the finding  rendered  at  para  44  in  the
Judgment  would  reveal  that  the  trial  Court  has  not  applied  its  mind
independently while coming to  the  conclusion  that  the  accused  Balan  and
Varadharajan  have  really  committed the offence punishable under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_25">Section 324</a>
only.  Further principle of transfer malice has also not taken note of by  the
trial court.  There is overwhelming evidence to show that all the accused came
to the  scene  of occurrence with a plan to murder the deceased Anwar.  So, we
are of the view that,  after  accepting  the  prosecution  case  totally,  the
finding  of  the  lower court in convicting the accused Balan and Varadharajan
under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_26">Section 324</a> IPC alone is based on the extraneous circumstances only. 
</p>
<p id="p_91">                50.  While summing up the case, we are  anguish  to  find  out
that though the trial Court have accepted the case of the prosecution in toto,
diluted  the  offence  of  <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_27">Section 302</a> IPC and convicted the accused Balan and
Varadharajan under <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_28">Section 324</a> IPC only, without the support  of  the  medical
evidence  inspite  of  knowing the fact of causing injury by the deadly weapon
M.Os 4,5 and 6, on the basis of the submission of the learned counsel for  the
appellants  that  the  fact as such would attract punishment under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_29">section 324</a>
only, resulting to miscarriage of justice, detrimental to public  interest  as
the  case  on  hand  is  one  arose  out  of communal clash between Hindus and
Muslims.  Since there is no appeal against such finding, we  do  not  want  to
probe further after a lapse of 10 years and leave the matter as it is.
</p>
<p id="p_92">                51.   In  view of the detailed discussion , we are of the view
that the finding of the lower Court in convicting and sentencing  the  accused
under  <a href="/doc/724142/" id="a_30">Section  324</a> IPC referred in judgment does not require any interference
and the  same  is  hereby  confirmed.    The  District  and  Sessions   Judge,
Udhagamandalam,  is  directed to secure the accused / appellants and send them 
to prison to undergo the remaining period of sentence.
