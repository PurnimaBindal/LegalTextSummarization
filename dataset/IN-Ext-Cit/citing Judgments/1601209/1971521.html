After the accused had left the place, he arranged a Maruti Van and kept his nephews in the vehicle and took his sister-in-law and other family members in that car and proceeded towards Kanpur. Around 6.30 p.m. when they reached near Pipauri village he found that the dead body of his brother Dashrath Singh was lying on the road. Bharat Singh and Balbeer Singh were crying near the dead body and they told him that on two motor cycles Budhraj Singh, Jai Bahadur Singh, Chhotey Singh alias Malkhan Singh and Manoj Singh had reached there and Budhraj Singh and Jai Bahadur Singh were armed with country made pistols and they fired at Dashrath Singh. Chhotey Singh alias Malkhan Singh and Manojh Singh had killed him by assaulting with a knife and a chapar. He had brought his injured nephews to the Regency hospital where the doctor had declared Awdhesh Singh alias Puttan Singh dead. He had lodged the report at the police station which is Ext. Ka-1. The assault on his nephews was taken place on account of the dispute of election of Pradhan and also because of purchase of a house. The election of Pradhan was contested between Suman Devi and his sister-in-law Shanti Devi in which Smt. Shanti Devi was elected. He further deposed that about one and a quarter month back his brother Dashrath Singh had purchased a house from Ram Sewak Saxena. Jai Bahadur Singh had entered into an agreement of sale with Shyam Lal Saxena, brother of Ram Sewak about two days prior to the registration of sale deed. His brother Dashrath Singh was working in the Head Post Office and he used to return to his village daily via Pipauri Village, On the date of the occurrence he was returning from his duty via Pipauri Village.

<p id="p_67">22. P.W.3 Balbir Singh deposed that occurrence had taken place about one year back at about 6.30 p.m. he alongwith Bharat Singh of his village were returning to their village Kaitha on foot via Pipauri village and when they reached near trisection after crossing Pipauri Dashrath Singh was returning on his cycle alter his duty from Head Post Office. As Dashrath Singh proceeded ahead of him, two motor cycles came from the side of village Kaitha. One motor cycle was driven by Budhraj Singh and Jai Bahadur was sitting. The other motor cycle was driven by Chhotey alias Malkhan Singh and Manoj Singh was sitting on the motor cycle. Budhraj Singh collided his motor cycle with the cycle of Dashrath Singh who fell and both had parked their motor cycles and thereafter they started assaulting with their weapons. They had raised alarm. The assailants had started firing in the air and threatened them that in case they will give evidence against them they will also face the same consequence and they went towards Madhav Grove. Dashrath Singh died on account of his injuries. After some time one Maruti Car came from the side of Kaitha village and stopped near them. Chhutkan Singh, Shanti Devi. Suresh Singh, Deepu Singh, Sukhveer Singh, Raju Singh, Rakesh Singh and Puttan Singh alias Awdhesh Singh were lying in injured condition in the car. He told Chhutkan Singh that a short while ago Budhraj Singh, Jai Bahadur Singh, Chhotey alias Malkhan Singh and Manoj Singh committed murder of Dashrath Singh and went towards Madhav Grove. He had also inquired Chhuktakan Singh and Shanti Devi as to how the other persons had received injuries and they had told him that Budhraj Singh, Jai Bahadur Singh, Chhotey alias Malkhan Singh and Manoj Singh had attacked Rakesh Singh and Puttan Singh when they were playing cards in front of the shop of Chhunnu Gupta. Chhutkan Singh had also seen Dashrath Singh was dead. Thereafter, Chhutkan Singh took Awdhesh Singh to the Hospital.
</p> 

<p id="p_68">23. P.W. 4 Shanti Devi deposed that Dashrath Singh was her husband, Awdhesh Singh alias Puttan was her son and injured Rakesh Singh was also her son. She further deposed that her house in village Kaitha is adjacent to the house of Budhraj Singh and a night before the occurrence she, her son Rakesh Singh saw that a petromax was burning in the court yard of Budhraj Singh between 9-10 p.m. Budhraj Singh, Jai Bahadur Singh, Chhotey alias Malkhan Singh, Manoj Singh, Babu Singh Sengar, Shamsher Singh, Chandra Bahadur, Pappu Singh alias Harnam Singh, Bablu Singh, younger brother of Puttan Singh, Smt.

The court do not take cognizance on the basis of F.I.R. He further deposed that court takes cognizance on charge sheet. On 16.8.2003 he had received F.I.R. alongwith the charge sheet. In the cross examination he had deposed that in the register the F.I.R. of case crime No. 176 of 2003 under  <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_75">Sections 302</a>, <a href="/doc/455468/" id="a_76">307</a> I.P.C., P.S. Sachendi Kanpur is entered on 5.7.2003.
</p> 

<p id="p_83">38. The counsel for the appellants had challenged the findings of the trial court on various grounds and it was also contended that the prosecution failed  to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the Sessions Judge had acquitted Manoj Singh on the basis of same evidence.
</p> 

<p id="p_84">39. The first submission of learned Counsel for the appellants is that the first information report lodged by P.W. 2 Chhutkan Singh was registered at P.S. Sachendi District Kanpur on 4.7.2003 at 10 p.m. and this report cannot be treated as a first information report because P.W. 12 S.I. Deshpal Singh had deposed that on 4.7.2003 an information was received through R.T. Set which was entered in G.D. No. 49 at 7.30 P.M. The message was that near village Pipauri one person was shot dead, He alongwith the police force reached at village Pipauri and found that a dead body was lying outside the Pipauri village. It was submitted that information was received at the police station and the police had arrived at the place of occurrence, therefore, subsequent report which was lodged by the informant Chhutakan Singh at P.S. Sachendi at 10.00 P.M. was hit by <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_77">Section 162</a> Cr.P.C. and cannot be considered as a first information report. This submission of the learned Counsel for the appellants that R.T. message was the first information report has got no substance. This message simply informed the police that one person died due to gun shot without disclosing the names of the assailants and the deceased also. It become, therefore, obvious that no information regarding the commission of a cognizable offence with all its details was available to the police station. In the case of <a href="/doc/68050/" id="a_78">Uppari Venkataswami v. Public Prosecutor, High</a> Court of Andhra Pradesh , the Apex Court had not treated the information regarding occurrence through very high frequency set and observed that:
</p><p id="p_85"> Therefore, if an offence is not registered in the absence of full details and only this informed that an incident in which bombs were thrown on a Jeep Car and which had killed two persons and injured the complainant and others who had come to the police station, it cannot be said that full details of the occurrence of a cognizable offence were conveyed to the police station officer who should have recorded the first information report.
</p> 

<p id="p_86">40. In the case of Ram Singh Bawajee Jadeja v. State of Gujrat , the Apex Court did not treat the telephonic message about the murder as first information report and observed that:
</p><p id="p_87"> If the telephonic message is cryptic in nature and officer Incharge, proceeds to the place of occurrence on the basis of that information to find out the details of t he nature of the offence itself, then it cannot be said that Information, which had been received by him on telephone shall be deemed to be first information report. The object and purpose of giving such telephonic message is not to lodge the first information report but to request the officer Incharge of the Police Station to reach the place of occurrence. 
</p> 

<p id="p_88">41. It was further observed that:
</p><p id="p_89"> If the information given on telephone is not cryptic and on the basis of that information, the Officer Incharge, is prima-facie satisfied about the commission of a cognizable offence and he proceeds from the police station after recording such information, to investigate such offence then any statement made by any person in respect of the said offence including about the participant shall be deemed to be a statement made by a person to the police officer "in the course of investigation", covered by <a href="/doc/108500659/" id="a_79">Section 162</a> of the Code. 
</p> 

<p id="p_90">42. It was also observed that
 Any telephonic information about the commission of a cognizable offence irrespective of the nature and details of such information cannot be treated as first information report. 
</p> 

<p id="p_91">43. In the case of <a href="/doc/102974331/" id="a_80">Tapindar Singh v. State of Punjab</a> reported in (1970) 2 Supreme Court Cases 113 the Apex Court had observed that:
</p>  

<p id="p_92">Anonymous telephonic message at the police station that firing had taken place at a Taxi Stand does not by itself clothe it with character of first information report, merely because the said information was first in point of time and the said information had been recorded in the daily diary of the police station, by the police officer responding to the telephonic call. 
</p> 

<p id="p_93">Similarly in the case of Soma Bhai v. State of Gujrat  the Apex did not consider the telephonic information about the murder of two persons as first information report and observed that:
</p><p id="p_94"> The message given to the Surat Police Station was too cryptic to constitute a first information report within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_81">Section 154</a> of the Code and was meant to be only for the purpose of getting farther instructions. Furthermore, the facts narrated to the PSI Patel which were reduced into writing a few minutes later undoubtedly constituted the first information report in point of time made to the police in which necessary facts were given. In these circumstances, therefore, we are clearly of the opinion that the telephonic message to the police station at Surat cannot constitute the FIR and the High Court was in error in treating the FIR lodged in the present case as inadmissible in evidence. 
</p> 

<p id="p_95">44. In the case of <a href="/doc/1328822/" id="a_82">Dhananjay Chatterjee v. State of West Bengal</a>  the Apex Court had observed that 
 We are unable to agree with the opinion of the High Court, The cryptic telephonic message received at the police station from Nagardas PW 4 had only made the police agency to rush to the place of occurrence and record the statement of Yashmoti PW 3 and thereafter commence the investigation as was admitted by the investigating officer in his testimony which testimony was not challenged during the cross-examination of the investigating officer. The High Court failed to notice that the vague and indefinite information given on the telephone which made the investigating agency only to rush to the scene of occurrence could not be treated as a first information report under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_83">Section 154</a> of the CrPC. 
</p> 

<p id="p_96">45. In the case of <a href="/doc/1529839/" id="a_84">Thaman Kumar v. State of Chandigarh</a> , the Apex Court did not consider entry in the D.D.R. as first information report where the name of the assailants were not mentioned and only the fact that three persons were assaulting a person were recorded. It was observed that "this was not a first information report of the incident but merely an entry made regarding the departure of the police personnels to the place of occurrence and, therefore, non mention of the names of the assailant in this case entry can not have any bearing.
</p> 

<p id="p_97">46. In view of the above settled legal position, in the instant case, the R.T. message which was received by P.W. 12 Deshpal Singh cannot be treated as a first information report.
</p> 

<p id="p_98">47. The next submission of learned Counsel for the appellants is that the F.I.R. should have been rejected because the Sessions Judge had disbelieved the presence of informant P.W. 2 Chutkan Singh. The Sessions Judge doubted the presence of the informant on the ground that he did not receive any injury and he was not resident of village Kaitha. If he was present at the place of occurrence then he should have also sustained some injuries and none of the assailants had tried to assault him. The other ground for not believing his presence was that according to his own statement he had lifted the injured and kept them in the Maruti Van and in this process he did not posses bloodstains on his clothes. If he was present and he had lifted the injured persons who had suffered injuries on their body, he should have also received some bloodstains on his clothes also. One more circumstance pointed out by the counsel for the appellants about the presence of the informant at the time of occurrence that in the Regency Hospital where injured were brought for medical treatment, his name was not mentioned in the medical examination report as a person who had brought the injured to the Hospital.
</p> 

<p id="p_99">48. We have considered this submission of the counsel for the appellants and also perused the evidence on record.
</p> 

<p id="p_100">49. In the matter of appreciation of evidence the powers of the appellate court are wide as that of the trial court. It has full power to review the whole evidence. It is entitled to go into the entire evidence and all relevant circumstances to arrive at its own conclusion about the guilt or innocence of the accused. It is the duty of an appellate court to look into the evidence in the case and arrive at an independent conclusion as to whether the said evidence can be relied upon or not. The credibility of a witness has to be adjudged by the appellate court in drawing inference from proof and admitted facts. The ground for disbelieving the presence of Chhutkan Singh in our opinion cannot be sustained. The Sessions Judge did not carefully scrutinize the evidence of P.W. 2. His testimony fully corroborates his version mentioned in the report and his testimony finds further corroboration from the evidence of other witnesses. According to the prosecution case the assailants arrived at the place of occurrence where the informant alongwith the deceased and injured were playing cards, they firstly assaulted Awdhesh Singh alias Puttan Singh and other persons ran to save their lives. P.W. 2 had clearly stated that out of fear he ran to save his life and the accused persons had also threatened them and out of fear he could not save his nephews. In such a situation if he had not received any injury and on that account his presence cannot be disbelieved. He had also stated that at the time of assault he was standing about 50 steps from the place where the accused were assaulting the deceased and it was also not necessary that every one of the witnesses should have been injured.
</p> 

<p id="p_101">50. We have carefully examined the testimony of P.W. 2. His testimony inspires full confidence and finds corroboration from the testimony of other witnesses and the investigation. It is also not necessary that while lifting the injured he should have also received some bloodstains. P.W. 2 had stated that immediately after the occurrence when the accused had left the place of occurrence he had arranged a Maruti Van for the treatment of the injured. This must have taken some time for him to arrange a vehicle and by that time blood might have stopped oozing.
</p> 

<p id="p_102">51. In the cross examination he was asked "Puttan Singh, Rakesh ke kapde khoon se lathpath ho gaye they. Rakesh Singh Va Puttan Singh ko Maruti Van me rakhne par va Maruti Van se utarkar Asptal me bharti karne me mere kapdo par khoon nahi laga." No other question was asked as to how the injured were kept in the Maruti Van or admitted in the Hospital. The injured were also wearing clothes. This is not sufficient to reject the testimony of a witness only on the ground that his clothes did not receive any bloodstains. The counsel for the appellant further contended that he did not try to rescue his nephews. If he was present at the time of alleged occurrence his natural conduct should have been to save his nephews. We do not find any force in this submission because the conduct of a witness cannot be predicted in a situation like this where the assailants were armed with deadly weapons and their targets were his nephews. The witnesses also deposed that the accused were threatening them and challenging that in case any one will come to rescue he would also face the same consequences and the shopkeepers had closed their shutters and terror was created. In such a situation no one can be expected to come closer the assailants who were armed with deadly weapons. In the case of <a href="/doc/1380018/" id="a_85">Hardev Singh v. Harbeg Singh</a> , the apex court had observed that "Coming to the next ground of acquittal, viz., non-intervention of the relatives of the deceased including the eyewitnesses during the assault on the victims to protect them, in our opinion is wholly unsustainable. Since the respondents (accused) were armed with deadly weapons as against this the victims and his relatives were totally unarmed and in such a situation it was absurd to expect any intervention and if they were to do so it would have led to some more casualties.
</p> 

<p id="p_103">52. The Sessions Judge while rejecting the testimony of P.W.2 Chhutkan Singh had considered the decision of Apex Court reported in 2000(2) J.I.C. 401 (Supreme Court) <a href="/doc/347163/" id="a_86">Malempati Pattahhi Narendra v. Ghattamaneni Maruti Prasad</a> wherein it was observed that:
</p><p id="p_104"> It is difficult to believe that if PW 1 was present, a young man of thirty-three like him could not have done even a bit to go to the rescue of his father and if he had done so, he would have sustained injuries, at least some minor injuries. But the fact is that PW 1 did not sustain even a scratch on his person. Yet another aspect is that if PW waited to rush to his dying father till the assailants stopped attacking him even then it is difficult for us to conceive that at least the clothes of PW 1 could not have been smeared with some blood, if not copious blood. But nobody has noticed even a drop of blood on his clothes.
</p> 

<p id="p_105">53. We have carefully examined the decision relied by the Sessions Judge but the facts of that case are totally different. In that case the assailants were not armed with fire arm and main reason for not believing the testimony of the witness was that one accused against whom role of assault was assigned was in the jail at the time of occurrence and his three sons were also implicated along with him and the Apex Court had also observed that "In this context, it must also be borne in mind that A-1, A-2 and A-3 are the children of A-4, If the father could have been falsely implicated in the murder of the deceased, why not the children also be arrayed from the same angle? Hence, the possibility of false implication of A-1, A-2 and A-3 cannot be lightly glossed over.
</p> 

<p id="p_106">54. The last submission of the counsel for the appellants regarding the presence of the informant is that in the Hospital the name of the informant is not mentioned as a person who had brought the injured. We do not find any force in this submission also. This is too much to disbelieve the presence of an eyewitness only because his name is not mentioned in the medical examination report. In the cross examination he had stated that it was wrong to say that Suresh Singh had admitted the deceased Awdhesh Singh and Rakesh Singh injured in the Hospital. He further stated that he got admitted the injured and not Suresh Singh but no question was asked as to why his name was not mentioned in the medical examination report.
</p> 

<p id="p_107">55. In the case of <a href="/doc/92302/" id="a_87">Sukhchain Singh v. State of Haryana</a>  the Apex Court had observed as under:
</p><p id="p_108"> As in the medico-legal report Ext. PE. name of PW 1 was found not mentioned, the High Court presumed that he had not accompanied the injured. Such an assumption is not referable to any legal or factual presumption. It was further observed that "It is neither the requirement of law nor usually expected that names of all the relatives of the injured should be mentioned in the medico-legal report prepared by the doctor in his discretion.
</p> 

<p id="p_109">56. The Sessions Judge had wrongly rejected the testimony of P.W. 2 Chhutkan Singh. In our opinion, his testimony is unimpeachable, credible and inspires full confidence. He had described the prosecution case in a very truthful manner and finds corroboration from other evidence on the record.
</p> 

<p id="p_110">57. The counsel for the appellants had challenged the testimony of Rakesh Kumar P.W. 1 on the ground that after the occurrence he became unconscious and he gained consciousness in the Regency Hospital and by that time first information report was already registered and he had no option but to corroborate the version of the F.I.R. We do not find any force in this submission. It is important to note that Rakesh Singh had received serious injuries. He was admitted in the Regency Hospital where he was medically examined at 7,25 P.M. His presence at the time of occurrence cannot be doubted. He had fully corroborated the version of the first information report. It cannot be believed that he will falsely rope innocent person and spare the actual culprits. It is also relevant to know that the prosecution had no motive to falsely rope the accused because two motives are suggested for this incident. The first motive as alleged by the prosecution was election of Pradhan in which mother of the injured Smt. Sita Devi was elected and Suman Devi wife of Jai Bahadur Singh, appellant, was defeated. Another motive for the crime was with regard to purchase of a house. The house was purchased by Dashrath Singh from Ram Sewak Saxena and two days prior to the execution of the sale-deed Jai Bahadur Singh had got an agreement to sale from Shyam Lal, brother of Ram Sewak Saxena. On both counts appellants were aggrieved. Therefore, it cannot be believed that injured and prosecution witnesses will falsely rope the appellants instead of actual culprits, The Sessions Judge had rightly relied upon his testimony. We are also of the view that his testimony is unimpeachable and does not suffer from any infirmity whatsoever.
</p> 

<p id="p_111">58. The counsel for the appellants had also challenged the place of first incident. It was submitted that Dashrath Singh was murdered outside village Abadi. Similarly Awadhesh Singh might have been killed outside the Abadi and the prosecution had wrongly shown the place of occurrence in front of the shop of Chhunnu Gupta in order to create the presence of witnesses. This submission has also no substance because the place of occurrence is in front of the shop of Chhunnu Gupta is proved by the recoveries of blood stained playing cards, blood stained cement and one empty cartridge from the place of occurrence. Report of the chemical analyst shows that blood was found on all the recovered articles.
</p> 

<p id="p_112">59. We have carefully examined the evidence on record. The testimony of P.W. 1 Rakesh Singh. P.W. 2 Chhutkan Singh and P.W. 4 Shanti Devi fully proves the alleged lime and place of the occurrence. P.W. 1 Rakesh Singh and P.W. 2 Chhutakan Singh have explained their presence on the spot. Both the witnesses deposed that on 4.7.2003 at 5.45 P.M. they were playing cards in front of the shop of Chhunnu Gupta alongwith Awadhesh Singh @ Puttan Singh and Chhunnu Gupta. The manner of assault, weapons in the hands of the assailants are described by these witnesses in a very truthful manner. Their version finds full corroboration from the post mortem examination. The prosecution did not challenge the time of occurrence in this case because injured P.W. 1 Rakesh Singh had sustained serious injuries in this occurrence and his medical examination took place in the Regency Hospital at 7.25 P.M. The occurrence took place in the month of July when there was sufficient light and there could not be any doubt about the identity of the assailants. Their testimony further finds corroboration from the testimony of P.W. 4 Shanti Devi who had heard at 5.45 P.M. the sound of firing from the side of shop of Chhunnu Gupta when she was in the village. She had also seen the assailants going on motorcycles towards village Pipauri challenging that they have finished Puttan. Thus, in our opinion, prosecution has successfully proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence on record further shows that when injured were taken for medical treatment by P.W. 2 Chhutakan Singh in a Maruti Car and when they reached near village Pipauri, they found the dead body of Dashrath Singh. The testimony of P.W. 3 Balbir Singh shows that the murder of Dashrath Singh took place at about 6.30 P.M. meaning thereby that Dashrath Singh was killed after the incident of firing in front of the shop of Chhunnu Gupta in which Rakesh Singh and Awadhesh had sustained injuries. The accused were known to him. He had also described the weapons in the hands of the accused and manner of assault. He was subjected to extensive cross examination but nothing could be elicited to discredit his testimony. The Sessions Judge has rightly relied upon his testimony and we also concur with the same.
</p> 

<p id="p_113">60. The Government Appeal No. 4605 of 2005 is filed by the State against the acquittal of Manoj Singh and Revision No. 435 of 2005 is filed by the informant against his acquittal. Since the government appeal is already admitted, the revision has become infructuos. The Sessions Judge had acquitted Manoj Singh on the ground that he had no motive to participate in the occurrence and the recovery of knife from his possession is very doubtful. The recovery memo does not contain his signature and there is nothing to show at what time he was taken out from the police lock up for the recoveries. Another ground for his acquittal is that according to the prosecution case he was alleged to be armed with Chapar but knife is said to have been recovered on his pointing out. We have carefully considered the grounds for acquittal. The law relating to interference by the appellate court against the judgment and order of acquittal is well settled in a catena of decision. In the case of <a href="/doc/1601209/" id="a_88">Main Pal v. State of Haryana</a> , the Apex Court held that:
</p><p id="p_114"> There is no embargo on the appellate court reviewing the evidence upon which an order of acquittal is based. As a matter of fact, in an appeal against acquittal, the High Court as the court of first appeal is obligated to go into greater detail of the evidence to see whether any miscarriage has resulted from the order of acquittal, though it has to act with great circumspection and utmost care before ordering the reversal of an acquittal. Generally, the order of acquittal shall not be interfered with because the presumption of innocence of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs through the web of administration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is cast upon the appellate court to reappreciate the evidence where the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether any of the accused really committed any offence or not. (<a href="/doc/1462333/" id="a_89">See Bhagwan Singh v. State of M.P</a>.) The principle to be followed by the appellate court considering the appeal against the judgment of acquittal is to interfere only when there are compelling and substantial reasons for doing so. If the impugned judgment is clearly unreasonable and relevant and convincing materials have been unjustifiably eliminated in the process, it is a compelling reason for interference.
</p> 

<p id="p_115">61. In the light of the law laid down by the Apex Court and the reasoning given by the Session Judge for acquittal of Manoj Singh, we are of the opinion that the acquittal of Manoj Singh is not sustainable. The evidence on the record with regard to actual occurrence is proved beyond reasonable doubt by the over whelming evidence on the record. His participation, right from the first information report, is consistent. The Sessions Judge had held that Manoj Singh had no motive to participate in the occurrence because he was not connected with the election dispute as well as sale of the house with Ram Sewak. On the other hand Manoj Singh had Theka of Tahbazari and P.W. 1 Rakesh Singh and his brother used to take the Theka but for the last about 5- 6 years he did not take Theka. In our opinion, this was not sufficient for P.W.1 Rakesh Singh to falsely rope Manoj Singh in an incident in which he had himself sustained serious injuries. It is also important to mention that after the occurrence he became unconscious and he regained consciousness in Regency Hospital and by that time F.I.R. had already been registered and the name of Manoj Singh with specific role and weapon was mentioned therein. The Sessions Judge also did not consider that it was not disputed that all the witnesses had deposed that Manoj Singh was a friend and accompanied other accused in participating in the incident.
</p> 

<p id="p_116">62. <a href="/doc/1529839/" id="a_90">In the Case of Thaman Kumar v. State of Union Territory of Chandigarh</a> :
</p><p id="p_117"> There is no such principle or rule of law that where the prosecution fails to prove the motive for commission of the crime, it must necessarily result in acquittal of the accused. Where the ocular evidence is found to be trustworthy and reliable and finds corroboration from the medical evidence, a finding of guilt can safely be recorded even if the motive for the commission of the crime has not been proved.
</p> 

<p id="p_118">63. The Sessions Judge held that the deceased and injured were assaulted by country made pistol, knife and Chapar. Dr. G.S. Dhanik, P.W. 8 had stated that the ante mortem injuries are possible by country made pistol, knife and Chapar. The medical evidence leave noroom for doubt as to the factum of the occurrence and the prosecution case with regard to its time, and the weapons used in the assault also receives corroboration from it. The place of occurrence is also fixed up by the recoveries the eye witness account regarding participation of Manoj Singh is consistent that he reached at the place of occurrence alongwith other accused carrying Chapar in his hand and inflicted injuries. He was also seen by Smt. Shanti, P.W. 4 going towards village Pipauri and P.W. 3 Balbir Singh had also deposed about the participation of the appellant Manoj Singh alongwith other accused persons and committing the murder of Dashrath Singh in village Pipauri His role was of assaulting with a Chapar. The Chapar was also recovered alongwith a knife on the pointing out of accused Chhotey Singh @ Malkhan Singh wrapped in a polythin. The serologist report shows blood was found on the Chapar also. It is also important to mention that recovery from Manoj Singh is made after the recovery of Chapar and knife. The Sessions Judge had doubted the recovery of knife from the possession of Manoj Singh on the ground that it was not clear when Manoj Singh was taken out from the police lock-up for the recovery of weapon and the recovery memo did not bear his signature and this is also not clear that according to prosecution case Manoj Singh had used Chapar in the crime but a knife is said to have been recovered on his pointing out. We do not find these grounds sufficient to doubt participation of Manoj Singh in the crime. The prosecution cannot give any evidence as to how knife was recovered on the pointing out of Manoj Singh when he was alleged to have used Chapar during the occurrence. This is simply a hypothetical question. In our opinion, on account of this otherwise credible evidence on record about the participation of Manoj Singh cannot be rejected. The Session Judge did not mention any inconsistency in the testimony of the witnesses. The ocular evidence of the eye witnesses about the participation of Manoj Singh was corroborated in material particulars by the medical evidence. If there was any mistake committed by the investigating officer in the preparation of the recovery memo the eye witness account can not be disbelieved. The Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1290534/" id="a_91">Ram Bali v. State of U.P</a>.  has held
 In the case of a defective investigation the court has to he circumspect in evaluating the evidence. But it would not be right in acquitting an accused person solely on account of the defect; to do so would tantamount to playing into the hands of the investigating officer if the investigation is designedly defective.
</p> 

<p id="p_119">64. <a href="/doc/1494018/" id="a_92">In Karnel Singh v. State of M.P</a>.  it was held that
 in cases of defective investigation the court has to be circumspect in evaluating the evidence hut it would not he right in acquitting an accused person solely on account of the defect and to do so would tantamount to playing into the hands of the investigating officer if the investigation is designedly defective.
</p> 

<p id="p_120">65. It is true that an order of acquittal should not be lightly interfered with. But we find that the trial court highlighted minor irrelevant factors to discard credible cogent and trustworthy evidence. The acquittal of Manoj Singh is unreasonable and the Sessions Judge had wrongly ignored the testimony of the eyewitnesses, which fully proves the participation of Manoj Singh beyond reasonable doubt.
</p> 

<p id="p_121">66. For the foregoing reasons the order of acquittal of Manoj Singh cannot be sustained in law as it is based on faulty and erroneous appreciation of evidence resulting in miscarriage of justice. Therefore the Govt. Appeal against the acquittal of Manoj Singh so far it relates to <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_93">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/968081/" id="a_94">34</a>, <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_95">307</a>/<a href="/doc/968081/" id="a_96">34</a>, <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_97">25</a> Arms Act is allowed and against acquittal under  <a href="/doc/1897847/" id="a_98">Section 120B</a> I.P.C. is dismissed.
</p> 

<p id="p_122">67. Lastly, the question that arises for serious consideration is whether imposition of death penalty to Budhraj Singh, Jai Bahadur Singh, Chhote Singh @ Malkhan Singh in the facts and circumstances of the case is justified?
</p> 

<p id="p_123">68. Under the old code of criminal Procedure ample discretion was given to the courts to pass death sentence as a general proposition and the alternative sentence of life term could be awarded in exceptional circumstances, that too after advancing special reasons for making this departure from the general rule. The new Code of 1973 has entirely reversed the rule. A sentence for imprisonment for life is now the rule and capital sentence is an exception. It has also been made obligatory on the courts to record special reasons if ultimately death sentence is to be awarded. A Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1201493/" id="a_99">Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab</a>  while upholding the constitutional validity of the death sentence voiced that as a legal principle death sentence is still awardable but only in rarest of rare cases when the alternative option of lesser sentence is unquestionably foreclosed.
</p> 

<p id="p_124">69. The Sessions Judge has awarded sentence of death to the appellants on the ground that two persons are done to death and serious injuries were caused to Rakesh and the crime was preplanned. The Apex Court in the case of <a href="/doc/553823/" id="a_100">Ram Pal v. State of U.P</a>. 2003 (47) A.C.C. 567 for the reasons mentioned in paragraph 8 and 9 of the judgment reduced the sentence from death to life imprisonment despite the fact that 21 persons were murdered in an incident.
</p> 

<p id="p_125">70. Compassion in sentencing is also a key factor. It allows the scars to heal. Longevity of incarceration may make them see reason. Passage of time may make them ponder over the crime they had committed. This might arouse in them a feeling of remorse and repentance.
</p> 

<p id="p_126">71. Considering the over all circumstances of the case, this case does not fall within the category of rarest of rare case and it cannot be said that imprisonment for lesser sentence of life term stood altogether foreclosed and we are of the view that a sentence of imprisonment for life to the appellants would meet the ends of justice.
</p> 

<p id="p_127">72. We therefore, reduce the sentence of death of the appellants Budhraj Singh, Jai Bahadur Singh, Chhote Singh alias Malkhan Singh to imprisonment for life.
</p> 

<p id="p_128">73. For the reasons stated above, the above appeals are decided as under:
</p>  

<p id="p_129">Crl. Appeal No. 2731 of 2005 (Budhraj Singh. Jai Bahadur Singh and Chhote Singh alias Malkhan Singh) is partly allowed. The conviction of the appellants is affirmed but the death sentence is converted to life imprisonment. The appellants are in jail. They shall be kept there to serve out the sentences awarded by the trial court and modified by this Court.
</p> 

<p id="p_130">Government Appeal No, 4605 of 2005 <a href="/doc/40063/" id="a_101">State of U.P. v. Manoj Singh</a>  is allowed. The order of Sessions Judge dated 17.5.2005 acquitting the respondent is set aside. He is convicted under  <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_102">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/968081/" id="a_103">34</a> and sentenced to life imprisonment, under  <a href="/doc/1934415/" id="a_104">Section 307</a>/<a href="/doc/968081/" id="a_105">34</a> and sentenced to R.I. for 5 years and a fine of Rs. 5000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo simple imprisonment for three months and under  <a href="/doc/73862/" id="a_106">Section 25</a> Arms Act and sentenced to one year simple imprisonment. All the sentences shall run concurrently. C.M.M. Kanpur Nagar is directed to take the appellant Manoj Singh into custody forthwith and send him to jail for serving out the sentences awarded by this Court.
</p> 

<p id="p_131">Since the appeal has been filed against the order dated 17.5.2005 passed by the District and Sessions Judge, Court No. 12, Kanpur Nagar against the acquittal of Manoj Singh, Criminal Revision No. 435 (D) of 2005 has become infructuous and the same is accordingly dismissed as having become infructuous.
</p> 

<p id="p_132">Reference No. 6 of 2005 for confirmation of death sentence of appellants Budhraj, Jai Bahadur Singh, Chhote Singh alias Malkhan Singh is rejected.
</p>
