                                             JUDGMENT
</pre>

<p id="p_1">S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
</p>

<p id="p_2">1.      This judgment will dispose of common questions of law, which arise in various
proceedings preferred under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_1">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India, as well as
transferred cases under <a href="/doc/333273/" id="a_2">Article 139A;</a> those causes were transferred to the file of this
court, from various High Courts1, as they involved interpretation of common
questions of law, in relation to provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,
2016 (hereafter “the Code”).
</p><p id="p_3">I       The Petitions and Common Grievances
</p><p id="p_4">2.      The common question which arises in all these cases concerns the vires and
validity of a notification dated 15.11.2019 issued by the Central Government 2
(hereafter called “the impugned notification”). Other reliefs too have been claimed
concerning the validity of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Application to
Adjudicating Authority for Insolvency Resolution Process for Personal Guarantors to
Corporate Debtors) Rules, 2019 issued on 15.11.2019. Likewise, the validity of
regulations challenged by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India on
20.11.2019 are also the subject matter of challenge. However, during the course of
submissions, learned counsel for the parties stated that the challenge would be
confined to the impugned notification.
</p><p id="p_5">3.      All writ petitioners before the High Courts, arrayed as respondents in the
transferred cases before this Court, as well as the petitioners under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_3">Article 32</a> claim to
be aggrieved by the impugned notification. At some stage or the other, these
petitioners (compendiously termed as “the writ petitioners”) had furnished personal
guarantees to banks and financial institutions which led to release of advances to
various companies which they (the petitioners) were associated with as directors,
promoters or in some instances, as chairman or managing directors. In many cases,

1 Madhya Pradesh, Telengana, Delhi, etc.
2S.O. 4126 (E) issued by the Ministry of Corporation Affairs, Central Government
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                           3</span>

the personal guarantees furnished by the writ petitioners were invoked, and
proceedings are pending against companies which they are or were associated with,
and the advances for which they furnished bank guarantees. In several cases,
recovery proceedings and later insolvency proceedings were initiated. The insolvency
proceedings are at different stages and the resolution plans are at the stage of
finalization. In a few cases, the resolution plans have not yet been approved by the
adjudicating authority and in some cases, the approvals granted are subject to attack
before the appellate tribunal.
</p><p id="p_6">4.    All the writ petitioners challenged the impugned notification as having been
issued in excess of the authority conferred upon the Union of India (through the
Ministry of Corporate Affairs) which has been arrayed in all these proceedings as
parties. The petitioners contend that the power conferred upon the Union under
<a href="/doc/546686/" id="a_4">Section 1(3)</a> of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereafter referred to as
“the Code”) could not have been resorted to in the manner as to extend the provisions
of the Code only as far as they relate to personal guarantors of corporate debtors. The
impugned notification brought into force <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_5">Section 2(e)</a>, <a href="/doc/14889/" id="a_6">Section 78</a> (except with regard
to fresh start process), <a href="/doc/1418644/" id="a_7">Sections 79</a>, <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_8">94-187</a> (both inclusive); <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_9">Section 239(2)(g)</a>, (h) &amp;
</p><p id="p_7">(i); <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_10">Section 239(2)(m)</a> to (zc); <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_11">Section 239</a> (2)(zn) to (zs) and <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_12">Section 249</a>.
</p><p id="p_8">5.    After publication of the impugned notification, many petitioners were served
with demand notices proposing to initiate insolvency proceedings under the Code.
These demand notices were based on various counts, including that recovery
proceedings were initiated after invocation of the guarantees. This led to initiation of
insolvency resolution process under Part-III of the Code against some of the
petitioners. The main argument advanced in all these proceedings on behalf of the
writ petitioners is that the impugned notification is an exercise of excessive
delegation. It is contended that the Central Government has no authority – legislative
or statutory – to impose conditions on the enforcement of the Code. It is further
contended as a corollary, that the enforcement of <a href="/doc/14889/" id="a_13">Sections 78</a>, <a href="/doc/1418644/" id="a_14">79</a>, <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_15">94-187</a> etc. in terms
of the impugned notification of the Code only in relation to personal guarantors is
ultra vires the powers granted to the Central Government.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                            4</span>

<p id="p_9">6.    It is argued that in terms of the proviso to Section 1(3) of the Code, Parliament
delegated the power to enforce different provisions of the Code at different points in
time to the Central Government. Section1(3) reads as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">          &quot;It shall come into force on such date as the Central Government
          may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint:
          Provided that different dates may be appointed for different
          provisions of this Code and any reference in any such provision to
          the commencement of this Code shall be construed a reference the
          commencement of that provision.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">7.    The petitioners argue that the power delegated under <a href="/doc/546686/" id="a_16">Section 1(3)</a> is only as
regards the point(s) in time when different provisions of the Code can be brought into
effect and that it does not permit the Central Government to notify parts of provisions
of the Code, or to limit the application of the provisions to certain categories of
persons. The impugned notification, however, notified various provisions of the Code
only in so far as they relate to personal guarantors to corporate debtors. It is
therefore, ultra vires the proviso to Section 1(3) of the Code.
</p><p id="p_11">8.    It is argued that the provisions of the Code brought into effect by the impugned
notification are not in severable, as they do not specifically or separately deal with or
govern insolvency proceedings against personal guarantors to corporate debtors. The
provisions only deal with individuals and partnership firms. It is urged that from a
plain reading of the provisions, it is not possible to carve out a limited application of
the provisions only in relation to personal guarantors to corporate debtors. The
Central Government’s move to enforce <a href="/doc/14889/" id="a_17">Sections 78</a>, <a href="/doc/1418644/" id="a_18">79</a>, <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_19">94</a> to <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_20">187</a>, etc. only in
relation to personal guarantors to corporate debtors is an exercise of legislative power
wholly impermissible in law and amounts to an unconstitutional usurpation of
legislative power by the executive. The petitioners argue that the impugned
notification, to the extent it brings into force <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_21">Section 2</a> (e) of the Code with effect
from 01.12.2019 is hit by non-application of mind. It is argued that Section 2(e) of
the Code, as amended by Act 8 of 2018, came into force with retrospective effect
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">                                            5</span>

from23.11.2017. This is duly noted by this court in the case of <a href="/doc/163084985/" id="a_22">State Bank of India v.
V. Ramakrishnan3</a>, which observed that:
</p><p id="p_12">            &quot;Though the original <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_23">Section 2(e)</a> did not come into force at all, the
            substituted <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_24">Section 2(e)</a> has come into force w.e.f. 23.11.2017.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_13">It is urged that this court should, therefore, set aside the impugned notification.
</p><p id="p_14">9.     The petitioners also attack the impugned notification on the ground that it
suffers from non-application of mind, because the Central Government failed to bring
into effect Section 243 of the Code, which would have repealed the <a href="/doc/1622833/" id="a_25">Presidency
Towns Insolvency Act</a>, 1909 (“PTI Act” hereafter) and the <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_26">Provincial Insolvency Act</a>,
1920 (“PIA” hereafter). Prior to issuance of the impugned notification, insolvency
proceedings against an individual could be initiated only in terms of the said two
Acts. After enactment of the Code, insolvency proceedings against personal
guarantors to corporate debtors would lie before the Adjudicating Authority, in terms
of Section 60 of the Code, although they would be governed by the said two
Acts. With the enforcement of the impugned provisions, rules and regulations,
insolvency proceedings can now be initiated against personal guarantors to corporate
debtors under Part III of the Code, and also under the PTI Act and the PIA. Since
Section 243 of the Code has not been brought into force, the petitioners contend that
the impugned notification has the illogical effect of creating two self-contradictory
legal regimes for in solvency proceedings against personal guarantors to corporate
debtors.
</p><p id="p_15">10.    It is urged that the impugned notification is ultra vires the provisions of the
Code in so far as it notifies provisions of Part III of the Code only in respect of
personal guarantors to corporate debtors. Part III of the Code governs &quot;Insolvency
Resolution and Bankruptcy for Individuals and Partnership Firms&quot;. Also, Section
2(g) of the Code defines an individual to mean &quot;individuals, other than persons
referred to in clause (e)&quot;. <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_27">Section 2</a> (e) relates to personal guarantors to corporate
debtors. A joint reading of <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_28">Section 2(e)</a> with <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_29">Section 2(g)</a> and Part III of the Code
shows that personal guarantors to corporate debtors are not covered by Part II, which

3(2018) 17 SCC 394
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                                             6</span>

only deals with individuals and partnership firms, and personal guarantors to
corporate debtors stand specifically excluded from the definition of individuals. The
petitioners also rely on Section 95 of the Code 4, which permits a creditor to invoke
insolvency resolution process against an individual only in relation to a partnership
debt.
</p><p id="p_16">11.      Part III of the Code does not contain any provision permitting initiation of the
insolvency resolution process (hereafter “IRP”) against personal guarantors to corpo-
rate debtors. The impugned notification which provides to the contrary, is ultra vires.
It is further contended that provisions of the Code brought into effect by the
impugned notification [Clause (e) of <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_30">Section 2</a>, <a href="/doc/14889/" id="a_31">Section 78</a> (except with regard to
fresh start process), <a href="/doc/1418644/" id="a_32">Section 79</a>, <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_33">Section 94</a> to <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_34">187</a> (both inclusive), Clause (g) to
Clause (l) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_35">Section 239</a>, Clause (m) to (zc) of sub-section (2) of
<a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_36">Section 239</a>, Clause (zn) to Clause (zs) of Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_37">Section 239</a> and <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_38">Section
249</a>] when enforced only in respect of personal guarantors to corporate debtors, are
manifestly arbitrary; they are also discriminatory because:

<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       (i)     There is no intelligible differentia or rational basis on which personal
               guarantors to corporate debtors have been singled out for being covered
               by the impugned provisions, particularly when the provisions of the
               Code do not separately apply to one sub-category of individuals, i.e.,
               personal guarantors to corporate debtors. Rather, Part III of the Code
               does not apply to personal guarantors to corporate debtors at all.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       (ii)    the provisions of Part III of the Code, which are partly brought into
               effect by the impugned notification, provide a single procedure for the
               insolvency resolution process of a personal guarantor, irrespective of
               whether the creditor is a financial creditor or an operational creditor.
               Treating financial creditors and operational creditors on an equal footing
               in Part III of the Code is in contrast to Part II of the Code, which
               provides different sets of procedures for different classes of creditors.
</blockquote><p id="p_31">12.     The petitioners rely on Swiss Ribbons (P.) <a href="/doc/1902038/" id="a_39">Ltd. v. Union of India5</a>, where this
court upheld the difference in procedure for operational creditors and financial
creditors on the basis that there are fundamental differences in the nature of loan
agreements with financial creditors, from contracts with operational creditors for sup-
plying goods and services. Financial creditors generally lend finance on a term loan
or for working capital that enables the corporate debtor to either set up and/or operate
its business. On the other hand, contracts with operational creditors are relatable to
supply of goods and services in the operation of business. Financial contracts gener-
ally involve large sums of money.
</p><p id="p_32">13.     The petitioners argue that the act of clubbing financial creditors and
operational creditors in relation to the procedure for insolvency resolution of personal
guarantors to corporate debtors amounts to treating unequals equally and amounts to
collapsing the classification that is carefully created by Parliament in Part II of the
Code. They also argue that the application of Sections 96 and 101 of the Code by the
impugned notification results in the illogical consequence of staying insolvency pro-
ceedings against the corporate debtor, when insolvency proceedings are initiated

5(2019) 4 SCC 17.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                            8</span>

<p id="p_33">against the personal guarantor. It is pointed out that a combined reading of Sections
99 and100 of the Code shows that the resolution professional, while recommending
the approval/rejection of the application, and the Adjudicating Authority while ac-
cepting it, do not have to consider whether the underlying debt owed by the corporate
debtor to the creditor stands discharged or extinguished.
</p><p id="p_34">14.   It is argued that the liability of a guarantor is co-extensive with that of the
principal debtor (<a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_40">Section 128</a> of Indian Contract Act, 1872). Further, it is settled law
that upon conclusion of insolvency proceedings against a principal debtor, the same
amounts to extinction of all claims against the principal debtor, except to the extent
admitted in the insolvency resolution process itself. This is clear from Section 31 of
the Code, which makes the resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority
binding on the corporate debtor, its creditors and guarantors. The petitioners also
contend that the impugned notification allows creditors to unjustly enrich themselves
by claiming in the insolvency process of the guarantor without accounting for the
amount realized by them in the corporate insolvency resolution process of the
corporate debtor under Part II of the Code. It is therefore, untenable.
</p><p id="p_35">15.   It is argued that the impugned notification has resulted in clothing authorities,
the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and Resolution Professionals (RPs) with powers
beyond the enacted statute. They have defined the term &quot;guarantor&quot; as a debtor who
is a personal guarantor to a corporate debtor and in respect of whom guarantee has
been invoked by the creditor and remains unpaid in full or part. The parent statute
does not define &quot;guarantor&quot;. It is pointed out that though Section 239(1) of the Code
empowers the Insolvency Board to make rules to carry out the provisions of the
Code, those rules cannot define a term that is not defined in the Code, as it is likely to
result in class legislation for one category of guarantors, i.e., personal guarantors to
corporate debtors. The impugned notification is therefore ultra vires the Code.

</p><p id="p_37">16.   Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners,
urged that Section 1(3) of the Code authorizes or empowers the Central Government
only to bring provisions of the Code into force on such date by a notification in the

Official Gazette. The proviso to this Section categorically provides that different
dates may be appointed for bringing different provisions into force. <a href="/doc/546686/" id="a_41">Section 1(3)</a> is an
instance of &#x27;conditional legislation&#x27;, where the legislature has enacted the law, and the
only function assigned to the executive is to bring the law into operation at such time
as it may decide. Such legislation is termed as conditional, because the legislature has
itself made the law in all its completeness as regards &quot;place, person, laws, powers&quot;,
leaving nothing for an outside authority to legislate on. Therefore, no element of leg-
islation was left open to the government, and the only function assigned to it being to
bring the law into operation at such time as it might decide. The central government
has however, by the impugned notification exceeded the power conferred upon it, and
has in effect modified the provisions of Part III of the Code, which it was not autho-
rized to do by Parliament. Assuming that such powers were present under Section
1(3) of the Code, it would amount to an unconstitutional delegation of power. It is ar-
gued that this court has repeatedly held that in conditional legislation, the law is al-
ready complete in all respects, and as such the outside agency i.e., the government,
while exercising power under such a provision, cannot legislate or in any manner add
or alter the effect of the law already laid down. Reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_42">Delhi Laws Act</a>,
1912, In re v. Part &#x27;C&#x27; States (Laws) Act, 1950 6, <a href="/doc/1660034/" id="a_43">State of Tamil Nadu v. K. Sa</a>-

impugned notification translates into going beyond the power to notify a date when
the Code or its provisions should come into force.
</p><p id="p_38">17.     It is argued that Part III of the Code does not create any distinction between an
individual and a personal guarantor to a corporate debtor. Part III provides for &quot;Insol-
vency Resolution and Bankruptcy for Individuals and Partnership Firms&quot;, and there-
after refers to these two categories of persons simply as debtors. The impugned notifi-
cation in substance modifies the text of the actual sections of Part III, despite the ab-
sence of any element of legislation/legislative authority having been conferred upon
the Central Government. The words &quot;only in so far as they relate to personal guaran-

<p id="p_42">tors to corporate debtors” forming a part of the impugned notification are attempted
to be added like a rider to each of the sections mentioned in the impugned notifica-
tion, clearly rendering such an exercise completely outside the scope and powers con-
ferred under Section 1(3) of the Code.
</p><p id="p_43">18.     It was argued further by Mr. Salve, that the impugned notification is ex facie in
violation of the principles of delegation, inasmuch as the Central Government has ef-
fected a classification of individuals- and sought to ensure that insolvency issues of
one category of individuals, i.e. personal guarantors to corporate debtors, are consid-
ered along with insolvency proceedings of corporate debtors. The distinction between
Part II and Part III, the forum and the remedies available to creditors of individuals is
no longer available to this category, i.e. personal guarantors, whose insolvency issues
are to be now considered along with insolvency process of corporate debtors. It is ar-
gued that the power of classification is legislative and that the impugned notification
is an instance of the executive acting beyond its jurisdiction. Mr. Salve relied upon
observations made by the Privy Council in R v Burah9 that laws cannot be said to em-
power general legislative authority, on the executive, or to exercise power not
granted to it under the parent Act.
</p><p id="p_44">19.     It was argued that the Central Government mistakenly assumed that inclusion
of personal guarantors in the definition provisions by amending <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_45">Section 2</a> and insert-
ing <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_46">section 2(e)</a> automatically results in amendment of section 1(3) of the Code. Sec-
tion 2 provides that the Code applies to the entities enumerated in the various sub-
sections. The amendment of 2018 added that the Code would apply to personal guar-
antors to corporate debtors. Consequently, when provisions of the Code are brought
into force, they would apply to personal guarantors to corporate debtors. The applica-
tion of a provision depends upon its plain language, and not upon the enumeration of
entities to whom the Code applies. The provisions which have been now brought into
force by virtue of the impugned notification do not limit themselves to personal guar-
antors to corporate debtors, but apply generally to individuals and other entities.
However, to the extent that it limits their application to personal guarantors alone,

<p id="p_45">through the impugned notification, it is illegal and beyond the powers conferred by
Parliament. It was urged that conditional legislation should not be confused with
delegation, which is a broader concept allowing the executive to frame rules and flesh
out gaps within the broad legislative policy. That exercise is legislative. However,
conditional legislation only permits the executive government the power to designate
the time when the law is to be brought into force, or place or places where it operates,
but not which parts of an enactment can apply to which class of persons, without any
substantive legislative provision or guidance. The impugned notification has the ef-
fect of amending the statutory scheme in the manner it applies them to personal guar-
antors and is therefore, ultra vires the Code.
</p><p id="p_46">20.      Mr. P.S. Narasimha, learned senior counsel, who argued next, contended fur-
ther that in several judgments, this court has ruled that conditional legislation is one
where a legislative exercise is complete in itself, and the only power and/or function
to be delegated to the authority (in this case the Central Government), is to apply the
law to a specific area or to determine the time and manner of carrying into effect such
law. He cited the decision in <a href="/doc/117343175/" id="a_47">State of Bombay v. Narothamdas Jethabhai</a> 10 in which
this court observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_4">             “……The section does not empower the Provincial Government to
             enact a law as regards the pecuniary jurisdiction of the new court
             and it can in no sense be held to be legislation conferring
             legislative power on the Provincial Government&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">Mr. Narasimha also cited <a href="/doc/1519712/" id="a_48">Sardar Inder Singh v. State of Rajasthan</a> 11and <a href="/doc/591481/" id="a_49">Hamdard
Dawakhana v. Union of India12</a> and urged that when legislation is complete, and the
executive is left to apply the law to an area or determine the time and manner of car-
rying it out, that is the only permissible task. However, the executive cannot perform
its task outside the power granted to it, choosing the subjects to which the law is to
apply.

<p id="p_50">21.     Mr. Narasimha referred to the previous notifications, bringing into force
provisions of the Code on different dates. He submitted that none of them brought
into force some provisions for a limited sub-category, or a class of individuals or
entities. He referred to one notification dated 30.11.2016 that brought into force
certain provisions of Part II of the Code, within which <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_51">section 2(a)</a> to <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_52">2(d)</a> were also
notified. However, it was submitted that irrespective of the notification, Part II was
brought into force and it applied to every entity contemplated to be in its coverage.
Under the notification of 30.11.2016, the inclusion of the four sub categories
described in <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_53">section 2(a)</a> to <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_54">2(d)</a> became irrelevant, and Part II of the Code applied
uniformly to all categories of persons intended to be covered by it by virtue of the
definition of a corporate person under <a href="/doc/1844570/" id="a_55">Section 3(7)</a> of the Act. The impugned
notification however applies to only a sub-category, namely, personal guarantors to
corporate debtors, among a homogeneous class of individuals; therefore, it is an
unprecedented exercise of conditional legislation power, clearly ultra vires the parent
enactment.
</p><p id="p_51">22.     It was urged that even if it were assumed that the Central Government had the
power to issue the impugned notification and bring Part III in force only with respect
to personal guarantors to corporate debtors, it is ultra vires the objects and purpose of
the Code. Reliance was placed on the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Insol-
vency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in this regard.13
</p><p id="p_52">23.     Learned counsel emphasized that this court has repeatedly clarified that the ob-
ject of the Code is to ensure a company’s revival and continuation by protecting from
its management and, as far as feasible, to save it from liquidation, thereby maximiz-
ing its value. The Code is a beneficial legislation which puts the corporate debtor
back on its feet, not being a mere recovery legislation for creditors. Observations in

purpose.
</p><p id="p_54">24.     It was submitted that Parliament undoubtedly amended the Code in 2018,
defining “personal guarantor” as a species of individuals to whom the law applied.
However, the manner of its application continued to be the same, i.e. to all
individuals. Therefore, the resort to conditional legislation power under <a href="/doc/546686/" id="a_60">Section 1(3)</a>
to bring into force certain provisions selectively, in respect of some individuals, i.e.
personal guarantors and not all individuals, is ultra vires, and contrary to the power
conferred on Parliament. Illustratively, it is pointed out that the application of the law
itself is limited- for instance in the case of <a href="/doc/14889/" id="a_61">Section 78</a> which applies to fresh start of
insolvency proceedings- the Code is limited then, in its application to one sub
category of individuals (all of whom are covered by the chapter, which is opened by
<a href="/doc/14889/" id="a_62">Section 78</a>) i.e., personal guarantors. This selective application is naked classification
exercised by the government conferred with conditional legislative powers.
</p><p id="p_55">25.     It was next argued that Part III of the Code relating to individuals and
partnership firms are outlined in various sections of the Act. Of these chapters, I, III
to VII, all of which have been notified are operative components of the Code,
relatable to individuals and partnership firms. They can certainly be brought into
force independently, whenever the executive is of the opinion that it is appropriate to
do so. However, <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_63">Section 2</a> cannot be used for this purpose, certainly not for
bifurcating individuals and partnership firms into subcategories and then to apply Part
II provisions exclusively to personal guarantors. It is argued that Section 2 of the
Code is not an operative component, but more merely a descriptive component.
Counsel argued that the nature of <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_64">Section 2</a> is similar to an amendable descriptive
component. Elaborating, it was submitted that an amendable descriptive component
of an enactment is one that describes the whole or some part of the Act, and was
subject to amendment when the Bill was introduced in Parliament in 2017. <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_65">Section 2</a>,
in other words, is descriptive and merely declares the subjects to which the code

<p id="p_56">would apply. It certainly cannot clothe the executive with power to apply the code
selectively at its discretion to different subjects.
</p><p id="p_57">26.    Mr. Sudipto Sarkar, learned senior counsel, adopted the arguments of Mr.
Salve. He also relied on the decision of the Federal Court in Jatindra Nath Gupta v.
Province of Bihar16, especially the following passage:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">            “The proviso contains the power to extend the Act for a period of
            one year with modifications, if any. It is one power and not two
            severable powers. The fact that no modifications were made in the
            Act when the power was exercised cannot help in determining the
            true nature of the power. The power to extend the operation of the
            Act beyond the period mentioned in the Act prima facie is a
            legislative power. It is for the Legislature to state how long a
            particular legislation will be in operation. That cannot be left to the
            discretion of some other body. The power to modify an Act of a
            Legislature, without any limitation on the extent of the power of
            modification, is undoubtedly a legislative power. It is not a power
            confined to apply the Act subject to any restriction, limitation or
            proviso (which is the same as an exception) only.”

</blockquote><p id="p_58">27.    The other counsel, viz. Mr. Rohit Sharma, Ms. Pruthi Gupta, Mr. Rishi Raj
Sharma, and Mr. Manish Paliwal too, argued for other petitioners. Pointing to the
distinction between provisions in Part II of the Code and those in Part III, it is argued
that the procedure for initiation of insolvency resolution against personal guarantors
to corporate debtors is the same as in relation to other individuals. The only
difference is that the forum to decide this would be the National Company Law
Tribunal (NCLT). In all other respects, in terms of Part III, the recovery process for
debt realization is identical for personal guarantors to corporate debtors, as in the case
of individuals. By separating the process in an artificial manner, and subjecting the
insolvency process of personal guarantors who are also individuals, to adjudication
by the NCLT, and furthermore, virtually directing that the two proceedings, i.e. in
relation to the corporate debtor on the one hand, and the personal guarantor, on the
other hand, to be clubbed, is, in effect, a legislative exercise, unsupported by any
express provision of the Code. It is also submitted that the object of the Code is to

</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                           15</span>

<p id="p_59">ensure a revival of corporate debtors. On the other hand, if an application against a
personal guarantor is admitted, a moratorium under Section 101 of the Code
automatically applies. This results in stay of all pending proceedings or legal claims
in respect of all debts. Since the debt of the personal guarantor is the same as the debt
of the corporate debtor, all pending proceedings, including the corporate insolvency
resolution plan initiated against a corporate debtor would be stayed on admission of
an application for initiation of the resolution plan against a personal guarantor. This
would in fact, amount to treating unequals as equals by a sheer legislative fiat. In
other words, argued counsel, the moratorium which would operate in respect of
pending resolution plans of corporate debtors, upon the initiation of an application
against personal guarantors puts them on the same level, which the statute itself does
not permit.
</p><p id="p_60">28.    It is submitted that by virtue of <a href="/doc/1769901/" id="a_66">Section 140</a> of the Indian Contract Act, a
guarantor upon payment or performance of all that he is liable for, is invested with all
rights which the creditor had enjoyed against the principal debtor. This provision
enables the guarantor to exercise all rights, which the creditor had against the
principal debtor, which would include the right to file a resolution plan against the
corporate debtor after conclusion of the latter’s resolution process. However, by
virtue of Section 29A of the Code, promoters of corporate debtors who in most cases
are personal guarantors, are barred from filing a resolution plan in the corporate
resolution process of the corporate debtor. This places them at a distinct disadvantage
as compared with individuals who are not personal guarantors. In this regard, the
inability of such personal guarantors to recover amounts from the corporate debtor in
the insolvency process, as well as at a later stage, if necessary, to initiate insolvency
process, has been affected by virtue of the impugned notification. It was submitted
that this court, in <a href="/doc/7427609/" id="a_67">Committee of Creditors of Essar Steel India Ltd. v. Satish Kumar
Gupta17</a> , ruled that
            &quot;<a href="/doc/731012/" id="a_68">Section 31</a> (1) of the Code makes it clear that once a resolution

           run the business of the corporate debtor. This the successful
           resolution applicant does on a fresh slate &quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_63">Counsel therefore argued that an approved resolution plan in respect of a corporate
debtor amounts to extinction of all outstanding claims against that debtor;
consequently, the liability of the guarantor, which is co-extensive with that of the
corporate debtor, would also be extinguished.
</p><p id="p_64">29.    It was further argued that the resolution plans, duly approved by the Committee
of Creditors would propose to extinguish and discharge the liability of the principal
borrower to the financial creditor. Therefore, the petitioners’ liability as guarantors
under the personal guarantee would stand completely discharged. Reliance is placed
on the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in <a href="/doc/199376373/" id="a_69">Kundanlal Dabriwala v.
Haryana Financial Corporation18</a> , which ruled that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_6">           &quot;on a fair reading of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_70">Contract Act</a>, I am
           inclined to hold that as the liability of the surety is co-extensive
           with that of the principal debtor, if the latter&#x27;s liability is scaled
           down in an amended decree, or otherwise extinguished in whole or
           in part by statute, the liability of the surety also is pro tanto reduced
           or extinguished.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_65">30.    Reliance was also placed on the judgment of the National Company Law
Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in <a href="/doc/126695598/" id="a_71">Dr. Vishnu Kumar Agarwal v. Piramal Enterprises

<p id="p_66">III    Arguments of the Union and other Respondents
</p><p id="p_67">31.    Arguing for the Union of India, the Attorney General Mr. K.K. Venugopal
submitted that the Code was amended in 2018. It substituted the pre-amended
definition in <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_72">Section 2(e)</a> by introducing three different classes of debtors, which

<p id="p_69">were personal guarantors to corporate debtors [<a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_73">Section 2(e)</a>], partnership firms and
proprietorship firms [<a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_74">Section 2</a> (f)] and individuals [<a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_75">Section 2(g)</a>]. The purpose of
splitting the provision and defining three separate categories of debtors was to cover
three separate sets of entities. Parliament wanted to deal with personal guarantors
[under <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_76">Section 2(e)</a>], differently from partnership firms and proprietorship firms
[under <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_77">section 2(f)</a>,] and individuals other than persons referred to in <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_78">Section 2</a> (e)
[under <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_79">Section 2(g)</a>]. The intention was to clearly distinguish personal guarantors to
corporate debtors from other individuals. This was because Section 60 of the Code
which deals with the adjudicating authority for corporate debtors too was partially
amended in 2018. The amendment to <a href="/doc/1677156/" id="a_80">Section 60(2)</a> added that it applied to
insolvency proceedings or liquidation/bankruptcy of a corporate guarantor or
personal guarantor as the case may be, to a corporate debtor. The result of the
amendment is that when a corporate debtor faces insolvency proceedings, insolvency
of its corporate guarantor too can be triggered. Likewise, a personal guarantor to a
corporate debtor, facing insolvency, can be subjected to insolvency proceedings. All
this is to be resolved and decided by the NCLT. In other words, the amendment by
<a href="/doc/1677156/" id="a_81">Section 60(2)</a> too achieved a unified adjudication through the same forum for
resolution of issues and disputes concerning corporate resolution processes, as well as
bankruptcy and insolvency processes in relation to personal guarantors to corporate
debtors.
</p><p id="p_70">32.   It was argued that Parliament felt compelled to separate personal guarantors
from other individuals such as partnership firms, proprietorships and individuals. It
was felt that if this separation, achieved through the amendment of 2018 were not
realized, the insolvency resolution process of corporate debtors would have to be
dealt with separately and independently of its promoters, managing directors, and
directors who had furnished their personal guarantees to secure debts of corporate
debtors. If insolvency resolution proceedings against corporate debtors were
continued without this amendment, and without the unification, (of the adjudicatory
body) on the default of the corporate debtor to a debt owed to a financial creditor, the
entire machinery of the Code relating to the corporate debtor would work itself out, to
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">                                           18</span>

the exclusion of personal guarantors. This presented a peculiar problem, in that the
resolution applicant, wishing to bid for takeover of the corporate debtor and operate it
as a running concern would be faced with a huge liability, and the personal guarantor
in most cases would be one of the individuals primarily responsible for the
insolvency of the company, but would be out of the resolution process and have to be
separately proceeded with. What therefore, has been effectuated by creating an
independent provision, by separating personal guarantors of corporate debtors and by
the same amendment, placing the personal guarantor&#x27;s debt before one tribunal/forum
namely the NCLT, is that such a forum would apply the procedure in Part III, in
regard to personal guarantors for providing repayment of the entire debt for which the
guarantee is furnished in the first place. If that debt is not repaid in the Part III, the
personal guarantor would not stand discharged, but on the other hand, would himself
be forced into bankruptcy proceedings.
</p><p id="p_71">33.   It was submitted that though the procedure to be adopted by the NCLT and
rules of insolvency (in relation to personal guarantors, under Part III of the Code)
might be different from that relating to corporate debtors, unifying both processes
under one forum enables the adjudicating body to have a clear vision of the extent of
debt of the corporate debtor, its available assets and resources, as also the assets and
resources of the personal guarantor. This would not have been viable, had the
insolvency resolution process of the personal guarantor continued under Part III,
before another body. The amendment, and the impugned notification would ensure a
more optimal resolution process, as resolution applicants wishing to take over the
management of corporate debtors, would ultimately find the process of taking over
more attractive; besides, there will be more competition in regard to the bids
proposed, and the total debt servicing of the corporate debtor might be lowered if the
personal guarantor’s assets are also taken into account to mitigate the corporate
debtor’s liabilities. The personal guarantor in such cases, who provides assets which
have been charged against the amount advanced to his company would most probably
not permit himself to be driven to bankruptcy, and would therefore, be more likely to
arrange for payment of monies due from him to obtain a discharge by payment of the

amount outstanding to the bank or other financial creditor. In some cases, the creditor
bank may be even prepared to take a haircut or forego the interest amounts so as to
enable an equitable settlement of the corporate debt, as well as that of the personal
guarantor. This would result in maximizing the value of assets and promoting
entrepreneurship, which is one of the main purposes of the Code.

been defined in Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (10th edition at page 1420) as, &quot;a clause in a
statute, contract or other legal instrument&quot;/ He also relied upon the judgment in
<a href="/doc/608411/" id="a_82">Chettian Veettil Amman v. Taluk Land Board20</a> to the effect that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">            &quot;A provision is therefore a distinct rule or principle of law in a
            statute which governs the situation covered by it. So an incomplete
            idea, even though stated in the form of a section of a statute, cannot
            be said to be a provision for, by its incompleteness, it cannot really
            be said to provide a whole rule or principle for observance by those
            concerned. A provision of law cannot therefore be said to exist if it
            is incomplete, for then it provides nothing.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_73">He therefore urged that <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_83">Section 2(e)</a> being complete and distinct is a provision within
the meaning of <a href="/doc/546686/" id="a_84">Section 1(3)</a>, and the Central government acted intra vires to bring it
into force, as well as certain provisions in Part III of the code.
</p><p id="p_74">35.    It was argued that the executive has the power to bring into force any one
provision of a statute at different times for different purposes, and that the
government can exercise this power to commence a provision for one purpose on one
day and for the remaining purposes on a later date. He relied upon the following
extract from Bennion on Statutory Interpretation: A Code (6th Edition, at page 257):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            “Where power is given to bring an Act into force by order, it is
            usual to provide flexibility by enabling different provisions to be

<p id="p_76">36.    The learned Attorney General relied upon two Constitution bench decisions of
this Court, which throw light on the power exercised by the Central Government
under provisions, which permit notification of provisions bringing into force
legislation in phases. The judgments cited were <a href="/doc/508361/" id="a_85">Basant Kumar Sarkar v. Eagle
Rolling Mills Ltd</a>.21and Bishwambhar Singh v. State of Orissa22. He emphasized that
often, when new legislation is introduced, the impact it might have on the subject
matter needs to be studied and it would be to the benefit of all that a stage by stage or
region by region implementation is adopted. Furthermore the discretion exercised by
the executive government is not unfettered.
</p><p id="p_77">37.    The Attorney General urged that what follows from the above decisions is that
Section 1(3) of the IBC has to be interpreted to give flexibility to the Central
Government to implement provisions of the Code to meet the objectives of the
enactment. He highlighted that the Central Government has in fact been enforcing the
provisions of the Code in a phased manner and brought to the Court’s notice that the
provisions were notified on 10 different dates. It was submitted that the Code brought
about a radical change in the existing laws applicable to debtor companies in that a
single default by the corporate debtor above a threshold limit prescribed in the Code
triggers an insolvency resolution process enabling a creditor to demand repayment.
Heavy emphasis is placed by the Code on attempting resolution of the corporate
debtor to maximize the value of the company and ensure that it continues as the going
concern in the interests of the economy. It was keeping in mind these objectives that
the impugned notification was issued appointing 1st of December 2019 as the date on
which certain provisions of the IBC were to come into force, only so far as they relate
to personal guarantors to corporate debtors. The submission that the impugned
notification creates a classification was refuted. He stated that it only brought into
force sections in Part III of the Code and Section 2(e) of the Code, from 1st
December 2019. From that date, proceedings could be filed against personal
guarantors to corporate debtors under the Code. The proceedings would be initiated

corporate debtors.
</p><p id="p_80">38.     The Attorney General submitted that the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_86">Amendment Act</a> brought about a
classification after detailed deliberations and in the light of the report of the Working

Corporate debtors, and Individuals having business. In this report of 2017, the
working group recognized the dynamics and the interwoven connection between the
corporate debtor and guarantor, who has extended his personal guarantee.
</p><p id="p_81">39.     The Attorney General also relied upon the report of the Bankruptcy Law
Reforms Committee (“BLRC”) tasked with introducing a comprehensive framework
for insolvency in bankruptcy. That committee recognized that personal guarantors
were a category of entities to whom individual insolvency proceedings applied, and
acknowledged the link between them and corporate debtors and found that under a
common Code, there could be synchronous resolution. In this regard, paras 3.4.3 and

6.1 of the report of the committee, dated November 2015, were relied upon.                                          He
pointed out that the synchronous resolution envisaged by the BLRC is found in the
IBC in <a href="/doc/1121193/" id="a_87">Section 5(22)</a>and <a href="/doc/1977498/" id="a_88">Section 60</a> (which fall in Part II of the Code), and Section

      23 The said extracts are as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                “3.4.3Designof the proposed Code: A unified Code -
                The Committee recommends that there be a single Code to resolve insolvency for all companies,
             limited liability partnerships, partnership firms and individuals.
                In order to ensure legal clarity, the Committee recommends that provisions in all existing law that
             deals with insolvency of registered entities be removed and replaced by this Code.
                This has two distinct advantages in improving the insolvency and bankruptcy framework in India. The
             first is that all the provisions in one Code will allow for higher legal clarity when there arises any
             question of insolvency or bankruptcy. The second is that a common insolvency and bankruptcy
             framework for individual and enterprise will enable more coherent policies when the two interact. For
             example, it is common practice that Indian bank stake a personal guarantee from the firm&#x27;s promoter
             when they enter into a loan with the firm. At present, there are a separate set of provisions that guide
             recovery on the loan to the firm and on the personal guarantee to the promoter. Under a common Code,
             the resolution can be synchronous, less costly and help more efficient recovery.”

guarantor&quot; to mean &quot;an individual who is the surety in a contract of guarantee to a
corporate debtor&quot;. Secondly, by reason of <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_89">Section 60(1)</a>, the Adjudicating Authority,
in relation to insolvency resolution and liquidation for corporate persons (including
corporate debtors and their personal guarantors), shall be the NCLT. <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_90">Section 60(2)</a>
mandates that where a corporate insolvency resolution process or liquidation

(which, by reason of <a href="/doc/1060416/" id="a_96">Section 238</a>, overrides all other laws), was the objective of the
amendment of 2018 and the impugned notification. The learned Attorney General
also pointed out to <a href="/doc/1295756/" id="a_97">Section 30</a>, which enacts that an Adjudicatory authority approved
resolution plan binds all stakeholders. However, at the same time, in the event a
resolution plan permits creditors to continue proceedings against the personal
guarantor, then such personal guarantors would continue to be liable to discharge the
debts owed to the creditor by the corporate debtor, which would be limited of course
to the extent of debt that did not get repaid under the resolution plan. The Attorney
General also relied on <a href="/doc/37755267/" id="a_98">Embassy Property Developments (P) Ltd. v. State</a> of

<p id="p_83">40.   Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India, supported the submissions of the
Attorney General. He too stressed that different provisions were brought into force
on different dates. He highlighted that Section 1(3) of the Code confers wide powers
enabling the Central Government to operationalize the Code in a subject-wise and
(not necessarily in a contiguous manner) – particular sections, provisions or parts. He
urged that the petitioner’s interpretation of the statute is unduly narrow and would
result in disrupting the Code. It was argued that Section 2 of the Code is not a
definition clause – but rather acts as a lever to provide a mechanism for a phased and
limited interpretation of the Code. He underlined, therefore, that <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_99">Section 2</a> represents
Parliamentary classification as regards classes of debtors who fall under the Code.
The Solicitor General pointed out that before the 2018 amendment, <a href="/doc/1798733/" id="a_100">Section 2(e)</a> was
generic and that the amendment classified three distinct types of entities. The
personal guarantors to corporate debtors are no doubt individuals like others, but are
in fact at the centre of insolvency of a corporate debtor. He submitted that a
predominant reason for the insolvency of corporate debtors invariably is the role
played by its directors, etc., who are personal guarantors and are or were, mostly at
the helm of affairs of the corporate debtor itself.
</p><p id="p_84">41.   The Solicitor General submitted that Part-II of the Code applied to all
categories of corporate entities who are debtors. By virtue of <a href="/doc/1844570/" id="a_101">Section 3(8)</a>, the
corporate debtor is a corporate or juristic entity that owes a debt to any person.
Likewise, the corporate guarantor under <a href="/doc/1844570/" id="a_102">Section 3(7)</a> is a corporate person who has
stood guarantee to a corporate debtor. Before the impugned notification, proceedings
in Part-II were confined to corporate debtors and only another class, i.e. corporate
guarantors. Personal guarantors and corporate guarantors formed part of the same
class inasmuch as they were guarantors since they had furnished guarantees to
corporate debtors to secure their loans. Yet, personal guarantors being individuals
were not included in Part-III, for functional and operational purposes. The Solicitor
General submitted that Part-II outlines the mechanism involved in regard to
insolvency resolution functionally and operationally designed for corporate bodies.
This takes into its sweep a resolution professional, committee of creditors as third
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                           24</span>

parties taking over the debtor and taking crucial decisions for insolvency resolution.
This statutory mechanism could not be applied to individuals as there is no question
of “take over” of individuals. Individuals, who stand guarantee to corporate debtors
and whose liability is co-terminus with such corporate debtors were therefore, outside
the field of the Code. This resulted in an anomaly inasmuch as one set of guarantors
to corporate debtors, i.e. individuals or personal guarantors were outside the purview
of the Code whereas other set of guarantors, i.e. corporate guarantors were subjected
to the provisions of the Code and could also be proceeded against in Part-II. As a
result, a conscious decision was taken to enforce Part-III and operationalize the
mechanism suitably for a class of individuals, i.e. personal guarantors. This decision
was implemented through the impugned notification.
</p><p id="p_85">42.    Apart from reiterating the submission of the Attorney General with regard to
the flexibility in respect of notifying parts of the Code on different dates, having
regard to the difference in subject matter and those governed by it, the learned
Solicitor General also relied upon the decision reported as <a href="/doc/1161164/" id="a_103">J. Mitra and Co. Pvt. Ltd.
v. Assistant Controller of Patents25</a>. He relied upon the report of the Working Group
of Individual Insolvency (Regarding Strategy and Approach for Implementation of
the Provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016) to deal with insolvency
of guarantors to corporate debtors and individuals having business, which had
highlighted that in the absence of notification of provisions of the Code dealing with
insolvency and bankruptcy of personal guarantors to corporate debtors and creditors
are unable to effectuate the provisions of the Code and access remedies available
under the Code. He submitted that this court has repeatedly held in several decisions
that there is no compulsion that all provisions of law or an Act of Parliament or any
other legislation should be brought into force at the same time. The legislature in its
wisdom may clothe the executive with discretion to bring into force different parts of
a statute on different dates, or in respect of different subject matters, or in different
areas. Reliance was placed upon <a href="/doc/463236/" id="a_104">Lalit Narayan Mishra Institute of Economic

<p id="p_87">&amp;Ors27. It was submitted that the Central Government, therefore, acted within its
rights to confine the enforcement of the provisions of the Code to a class of
individuals, i.e., to personal guarantors, without altering the identity and structure of
the Code. It was submitted that this is permissible as it is within the larger power of
enforcement of the statute, which encompasses the discretion to enforce the law in
respect of a definite category, provided that such an act of enforcement would not
alter the character of the Code. It was therefore, submitted that the enforcement of
parts through the impugned notification – only in respect of personal guarantors in no
way alters the identity or character of the Code.
</p><p id="p_88">43.     The Solicitor General further submitted that the liability of a guarantor is co-
extensive, joint and several with that of the principal borrower unless the contrary is
provided by the contract. A discharge which a principal borrower may secure by
operation of law (for instance on account of winding up or the process under
the Code) does not however absolve the surety from its liability.          <a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_106">Section 128</a> of the
Indian Contract Act, 1872 (&quot;<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_107">Contract Act</a>&quot;) provides that the liability of a principal
debtor and a surety is co-extensive, unless provided to the contrary in the contract.
The word “co-extensive” is an objective for the word &#x27;extent&#x27; and it can relate only to
the quantum of the principal debt. The Solicitor General relied on certain decisions in
this regard.28 It is stated that the creditor also has the liberty to proceed against the
principal borrower and all sureties simultaneously; in this regard, he cited <a href="/doc/743049/" id="a_108">Bank of
Bihar Ltd. v. Dr. Damodar Prasad &amp; Anr</a> 29. It is submitted that no court or co-surety
can limit such a right. For this proposition, reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/174160081/" id="a_109">State Bank of
India v. Index</a> port Registered30and <a href="/doc/1320013/" id="a_110">Industrial Investment Bank of India v. Biswanath
Jhunjhunwala31</a>. Counsel also submitted that a surety cannot alter or defer such a
right of the creditor. Hence, until the debt is paid off to the creditor in entirety, the
guarantor is not absolved of its joint and several liability to make payment of the
amounts outstanding in favour of the creditor.

<p id="p_93">44.     The Solicitor General submitted that neither the guarantor&#x27;s obligations are
absolved nor discharged in terms of <a href="/doc/129666/" id="a_112">Sections 133</a> to <a href="/doc/1176477/" id="a_113">136</a> of the Indian Contract Act,
1872, on account of release/discharge/composition or variance of contract which a
principal borrower may secure by way of operation of law for instance as under the
Code. The rights of a creditor against a guarantor continue even in the event of
bankruptcy or liquidation, stressed the Solicitor General, and relied on <a href="/doc/211773/" id="a_114">Maharashtra
State Electricity Board Bombay v. Official Liquidator, High</a> Court, Ernakulum &amp;
Anr.32, where this court considered the interplay of <a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_115">Sections 128</a> and <a href="/doc/1029885/" id="a_116">134</a> of the
Contract Act in the facts of the case. In that case, a company whose advances were
secured by a guarantee went into liquidation. The court held that the fact the principal
debtor went into liquidation had no effect on the liability of the guarantor, because the
discharge secured of the principal borrower was by &quot;operation of law&quot; and
involuntary in nature. This was followed in <a href="/doc/849832/" id="a_117">Punjab National Bank v. State of UP</a> 33.
This court held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_12">             &quot;In our opinion, the principle of the aforesaid decision of this court
             is equally applicable in the present case. The right of the appellant
             to recover money from respondents Nos. 1,2 and 3 who stood
             guarantors arises out of the terms of the deeds of guarantee which
             are not in any way superseded or brought to a naught merely
             because the appellant may not be able to recover money from the
             principal-borrower. It may here be added that even as a result of
             the Nationalization Act the liability of the principal-borrower does
             not come to an end. It is only the mode of recovery which is
             referred to in the said Act.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_94">45.     To a similar end, the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in <a href="/doc/125580101/" id="a_118">Gouri Shankar
Jain v. Punjab National Bank &amp; Anr</a>. 34 were relied on. It was held that none of the
obligations of the surety under <a href="/doc/129666/" id="a_119">Section 133</a> to <a href="/doc/1207353/" id="a_120">139</a>, <a href="/doc/1858345/" id="a_121">141</a> and <a href="/doc/1541051/" id="a_122">145</a> of the Contract Act
are discharged on account of admission of a <a href="/doc/74115/" id="a_123">Section 7</a> application. As such, a
discharge is on account of a statute and involuntary in nature. It was also argued that
similarly, in terms of Section 31 of the Code, a resolution plan approved by the
Adjudicating Authority is binding on all stakeholders including the guarantors, and

<p id="p_97">hence, the release/discharge/ composition or variance of contract with the principal
borrower in terms of a resolution plan, is &quot;statutorily&quot; presumed to be consented by
the guarantors in question. Therefore, by way of approval of a resolution plan, any
release/discharge secured by the principal borrower or entering into a composition
with the principal borrower (reference to <a href="/doc/1565764/" id="a_124">Section 135</a> of the Contract Act) cannot
discharge the guarantor in any manner what so ever. The judgment of this court in
<a href="/doc/163084985/" id="a_125">State Bank of India v. V. Ramakrishnan &amp;Ors</a>.35 too was relied on, where the court
recognized that a guarantor cannot seek a discharge of its liability on account of
approval of a resolution plan, and the terms of such a plan can provide for the
continuation of the debt of the guarantors. It was submitted that the continuation of a
financial creditor&#x27;s claim against a guarantor would not lead to double recovery of a
claim as the financial creditor would be able to recover only the balance debt which
remains outstanding and unrecovered from the principal borrower. There are enough
safeguards against double recovery as provided under (a) the settled principle of
contract law that simultaneous remedy against the co-obligors does not permit the
creditor to recover more than the total debt owed to it, and (b) the provisions of the
Code itself. The Solicitor General relied on the acknowledged practice, known as, the
principle of &quot;double dip&quot; or the notion of dual nature of recovery by a creditor for the
same debt from two entities - be it principal borrower and guarantor or co-guarantors
or co-debtors. When a primary obligor and a guarantor are liable on account of a
single claim, the creditor can assert a claim for the full amount owed against each
debtor until the creditor is paid in full (that is it can double dip). This means that in
case a portion of debt is recovered from one of the entities, either principal borrower
or guarantor, the other would be liable for the unsatisfied amount of the claim, the
principal borrower being joint and several with the surety. This principle is opposed
to the principle prohibiting &quot;double proof&quot; in which the same debt is pursued against
the same estate twice, leading to double payment. This right of double dip of a
creditor was spoken of, in recent judgment PAFCO 2916 INC. C/o Pegasus Aviation
Finance Company vs. Kingfisher Airlines Limited36, where the decree holders

<p id="p_99">initiated simultaneous execution proceedings against both the principal debtor and the
guarantor on the basis of the same decree, and the Executing Court suo moto raised
the issue of maintainability to hold that both the execution petitions are not
simultaneously maintainable. The High Court of Karnataka disagreed and held that
the decree holders cannot be directed to amend their claims in each of the execution
petitions to only half the decretal amount. Reliance was also placed on the judgment
of the UK Supreme Court in In Re Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander Ltd. (in
administration)37.
</p><p id="p_100">46.     Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel, appearing for the State Bank of
India, urged that the substance of the petitioners’ argument is that <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_126">Section 1(3)</a> does
not empower the Central Government to enforce the provisions of Part III of the
Code selectively to personal guarantors of Corporate Debtors only. The petitioners
highlight that Part III applies to individuals and partnership firms in a composite
manner, and the impugned notification dated 15.11.2019 splits up that unity by
enforcing the provisions of Part III only upon personal guarantors of corporate
debtors. It is urged that the submission that <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_127">Section 1(3)</a> does not confer the power of
modification on the Central Government is presented by characterizing <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_128">Section 1(3)</a>
as conditional legislation. He submits that <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_129">Section 1(3)</a> has two distinct dimensions.
Parliament firstly conferred on the Central Government not only the power to
determine the date on which the Code will come into force, but also empowers it to
appoint different dates for different provisions of the Code. It was intended that all
the provisions of the Code may not be enforced at once. Given the width of impact
and with an eye on the objectives set out in the statement of objects and reasons and
preamble, a staggered enforcement was anticipated.
</p><p id="p_101">47.     Mr. Dwivedi stated that nothing much depends on the characterization of
<a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_130">Section 1(3)</a> as conditional or delegated legislation. Even conditional legislation
involves a delegation of legislative power to the authority concerned. Under <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_131">Section
1(3)</a>, the Central Government is only a delegate of the Parliament. In some cases,

<p id="p_102">such provisions or provisions of broadly similar nature have been described by this
court as conditional legislation, but equally in some cases such a power has been
described as delegated legislation by different judges. Reliance was placed on <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_132">Delhi
Laws Act</a>, 1912, In re v. Part &#x27;C&#x27; States (Laws) Act, 1950 (supra) and <a href="/doc/1949465/" id="a_133">Lachmi Narain
v. Union of India38</a>.
</p><p id="p_103">48.     It was urged that provisions of diverse nature have been characterized as
conditional legislation by this court. The cases relied upon by the Petitioners related
to a challenge to the validity of legislative provisions on the ground of excessive
delegation of legislative power. In In re Delhi Laws, the Central Government was
expressly empowered to enforce certain laws with “modifications and restrictions”.
The power of modification was held to be limited to such modifications as did not
affect the identity or structure or the essential purpose of the law. This was a
departure from the judgment of the Federal Court in Jatindra Nath39. However, in the
case of Lachmi Narain, the notification issued by the Government was challenged,
and this court held that the real question was whether the delegate acts within the
general scope of the affirmative words which give the power, and without violating
any express conditions or restrictions by which that power is limited. While Jatindra
Nath involved extension of the life of a temporary Act, in the Delhi Laws case, the
power under consideration was to extend the laws of Part C States to Part A States.
Later, in <a href="/doc/147362898/" id="a_134">Raghubar Swarup v. State of U.P</a> 40 , the State Government was conferred
power by Section 2 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1951, to
extend the Act to other areas in the State. It involved selection of geographical area
for applying the law. Similarly, in Tulsipur Sugar Company41, the power was
conferred to extend the U.P. Town Areas Act, 1914, to a notified area. Learned senior
counsel argued that in Sardar Inder Singh (supra), the power conferred on the
executive to extend the life of a temporary Act, even when no outer limit is
prescribed, was upheld. <a href="/doc/3429/" id="a_135">In Bangalore Woollen, Cotton and Silk Mills v. Bangalore</a>

<p id="p_105">Corporation42, the power conferred on the Municipal Corporation to levy octroi on
&quot;other articles not specified in the Schedule&quot; was upheld saying that it was more in
the nature of conditional legislation. Reliance was also place on <a href="/doc/1651733/" id="a_137">ITC Bhadrachalam
v. Mandal Revenue Officer43</a> , where the power to exempt any class of non-
agricultural land and was upheld saying:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_13">            &quot;the power to bring an Act into force as well as the power to grant
            exemption are both treated, without a doubt, as belonging to the
            category of conditional legislation&quot;.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_106">Learned counsel therefore urged that the line of demarcation between conditional and
delegated legislation at times gets blurred.
</p><p id="p_107">49.     While judging the validity of the legislations, this Court has examined the
sufficiency of the guidance afforded by the legislative policy indicated in the relevant
statute.      For     this,   reliance   was     placed     on     Edward      Mills     v.
</p><p id="p_108">State of Ajmer44.All these establish that diverse provisions apart from those which
empower the executive to enforce the Act or provisions of the Act have been
characterized as conditional legislation and their validity and scope has been
determined in the light of the text, context and purpose of the Act.
</p><p id="p_109">50.     Learned counsel stated that a schematic, structural and purposive construction
of Section 1(3) of the Code needs to be adopted to determine the scope of the power
conferred on the Central Government by Section 1(3) of the Code. The Petitioners
apply the rule of literal construction and seek to construe <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_138">Section 1(3)</a> in isolation,
without reference to the context, scheme or purpose of the Code. It is submitted that
the ambit of <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_139">Section 1(3)</a> should not be determined by merely applying the doctrine
of literal construction. All provisions of the Code, including the enforcement
provision should be construed in the context of the entire enactment and the approach
should be schematic, structural and purposive. Furthermore, <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_140">Section 1(3)</a> should not
be construed in isolation. It is well settled that a statute has to be read as a whole. The
scope of the power under Section 1(3) of the Code cannot be expounded without

<p id="p_112">taking note of the scheme of the Code and the other related provisions. Counsel relied
on the following observations of this court in <a href="/doc/603736/" id="a_141">State of West Bengal v. Union of India45</a>
             “In considering the true meaning of words or expression used by
             the legislature the court must have regard to the aim, object and
             scope of the statute to be read in its entirety. The court must
             ascertain the intention of the legislature by directing its attention
             not merely to the clauses to be construed but to the entire Statute; it
             must compare the clause with the other parts of the law, and the
             setting in which the clause to be interpreted occurs.&quot;
</p>
<p id="p_113">51.     Legislative intent, it is urged, cannot be gathered by a bare mechanical
interpretation of words or mere literal reading. The words are to be read and
understood in the context of the scheme of the Act and the purpose or object with
which the power is conferred. As Iyer, J. observed in Chairman Board of Mining
Examination v. Ramji46 “to be literal in meaning is to see the skin and miss the soul.
The judicial key to construction is the composite perception of the deha and the dehi
of the provision&quot;. This has been followed in <a href="/doc/1013766/" id="a_142">Directorate of Enforcement v. Dipak
Mahajan47</a>. Recently too, this court has moved on to accept purposive interpretation
of the statute as the correct approach to ascertain legislative intent. If the given words
can reasonably bear a construction which effectuates the purpose or object then that
construction is to be preferred. In this regard, the decision in Arcelor Mittal v. Satish
Kumar Gupta48 and Swiss Ribbons (supra) were relied on.
</p><p id="p_114">52.     Mr. Dwivedi stated that the impugned notification does not modify any
provisions of the Code. By enforcing certain provisions of the Code by its seven
clauses&quot; only in so far as they relate to personal guarantors to corporate debtors&quot;,
the notification does not modify any legislative provision. It merely carries out the
Parliamentary intention as expressed by the scheme, structure and purpose of the
Code. <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_143">Section 1(3)</a>, <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_144">Section 2</a>, <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_145">Section 3(23)</a>, <a href="/doc/931937/" id="a_146">Section 5(5)(a)</a> and (22), <a href="/doc/17258662/" id="a_147">Section 14(3)</a>,

that the scheme and structure of the Code involves a parliamentary hybridization and

<p id="p_118">legislative fusion of the provisions of Part III, in so far as personal guarantors of
corporate debtors are concerned. The object of this hybridization is to empower the
NCLT to deal with the insolvency resolution and bankruptcy process of the corporate
debtor along with the corporate guarantor and personal guarantor of the corporate
debtor. Parliament is conscious of the fact that personal guarantors to corporate
debtors are generally promoters or close relatives of corporate debtors, and in many
cases, the corporate&#x27;s indebtedness was due to acts misfeasance and siphoning of
funds done by personal guarantors. Apart from this, personal guarantors to corporate
debtors have a contractually agreed debt alignment with such debtors. They are
coextensively as well as jointly and severally responsible for the same debt. As
Parliament created a legislative hybridization, Part III of the Code had to be enforced
by the Central Government under <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_151">Section 1(3)</a> with Parliamentary categorization
through <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_152">Section 2</a>. The unifying of the forum for insolvency resolution/bankruptcy of
the corporate debtor along with its personal guarantor is a Parliamentary dispensation
and determination. Therefore, <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_153">Section 1(3)</a> empowers the Central Government to
appoint different dates for different provisions.
</p><p id="p_119">53.     Learned senior counsel highlighted <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_154">Section 60(1)</a>, (2), (3) and (4) and urged
that Parliament had merged the provisions of Part III with the process undertaken
against the corporate debtors under Part II. The process of Part II and the provisions
of Part III were legislatively fused for the purpose of proceedings against personal
guarantors along with the corporate debtors. He argued that <a href="/doc/941332/" id="a_155">Section 179</a>, the
corresponding provision in Part III, begins by deploying the phrase &quot;subject to the
provisions of <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_156">Section 60</a>&quot;. <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_157">Section 60(4)</a> incorporates the provisions of Part III, in
relation to proceedings before the NCLT against personal guarantors. Counsel cited
<a href="/doc/791627/" id="a_158">Western Coalfield Ltd. v. Special Area Development Authority</a> 49; <a href="/doc/99479267/" id="a_159">Baleshwar Dayal v.

other individuals and partnership firms do not figure in this Parliamentary
hybridization/fusion. <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_161">Sections 2(e)</a> and <a href="/doc/1562930/" id="a_162">2(g)</a> when read together, would indicate that

<p id="p_122">personal guarantors are also individuals. Act 8 of 2018 has brought about a
trifurcation of the categories which were comprehended in <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_163">Section 2(e)</a> as it stood
before the amendment. <a href="/doc/941332/" id="a_164">Section 179</a> also indicates that personal guarantors are
individuals and Part III is applicable to them. In fact, it is by operation of the
provisions in Chapter III of Part III that personal guarantors get the benefit of interim
moratorium [<a href="/doc/184981067/" id="a_165">Section 96</a>] and moratorium [<a href="/doc/132563140/" id="a_166">Section 101</a>]. Personal guarantors do not
get moratorium under <a href="/doc/1728676/" id="a_167">Section 14</a>. In this regard, reliance is placed on V.
Ramakrishnan (supra). It is contended that the hybridization achieved by the
impugned notification does not create any anomaly or problem in enforcement.
</p><p id="p_123">54.   It was lastly contended that <a href="/doc/191936427/" id="a_168">Section 78</a> is declaratory and states that Part III
applies to individuals and partnership firms. It is made applicable to the various
categories of individuals and partnership firms. Both <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_169">Sections 2</a> and <a href="/doc/191936427/" id="a_170">78</a> carry the
margin caption of &quot;application&quot;. <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_171">Section 2</a> commences with &quot;the provisions of this
Code shall apply&quot; to the six categories and <a href="/doc/191936427/" id="a_172">Section 78</a> also declares that “Part III
shall apply&quot; to the mentioned categories. <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_173">Section 2</a> embraces the whole Code
including <a href="/doc/191936427/" id="a_174">Section 78</a> and other provisions enforced by the impugned notification,
which clearly appoints the date of enforcement for <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_175">Section 2(e)</a> and other provisions,
and Chapter III of Part III. There is no vivisection or dissection involved in the
impugned notification.
</p><p id="p_124">55.   Mr. K.V. Vishwanathan, learned senior counsel appearing for some
respondents, argued that an overall reading of the provisions of the Code would show
that personal guarantors to corporate debtors are a distinct class of individuals (by
virtue of <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_176">Section 2</a> (e) and <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_177">Section 60</a>); the classification is not achieved through the
impugned notification, but by the amending Act of 2018, by Parliament. It is
emphasized that the amendment ensured that the same forum (NCLT) deals with
insolvency processes of corporate debtors, and also deals with similar issues relating
to personal guarantors. The statute permits Part III application by NCLT in relation to
personal guarantors. All that the impugned notification did was to operationalize
these existing provisions of the Code. Learned senior counsel cited Brij Sundar
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                          34</span>

Kapoor v. First Additional Judge52to refute the petitioners’ argument that the power
under <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_178">Section 1(3)</a> power is a one-time power. He also relied on <a href="/doc/1415534/" id="a_179">Section 14</a> of the
General Clauses Act, 1897, which states that any power conferred by any Act or
Regulation can be exercised from time to time.53

legislature acts within its rights in enacting a law and leaving it to the executive to
apply it to different geographical areas at different times, depending upon various
considerations. He also relied on <a href="/doc/696855/" id="a_181">Khargram Panchayat Samiti v. State of West
Bengal55</a> and argued that the power to bring into force different provisions, or
different parts of a statute, on different dates, having regard to the subject matter, is
part of the incidental power conferred by Parliament under <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_182">Section 1</a> (3) of the Code.
</p><p id="p_126">57.     Mr. Ritin Rai, learned senior counsel appearing for some respondents, urged
that there is an inter connectedness between corporate debtors and personal
guarantors, which was recognized by the 2018 amendment, evidenced by its
Statement of Objects and Reasons. He stated that the power under Section 1(3) of the
Code has been properly exercised. Mr. Rai submitted that like the impugned
notification, another notification was issued on 01-05-2018 56bringing into effect
provisions of the Code in relation to a distinct class, i.e., financial service providers 57.
This was achieved by bringing into force Sections 227 to 229 of the Code. It was
submitted that the discretion conferred on the executive, to experiment, and bring into
force a legislation in phases, is part of the general pattern of legislative practice and it
recognizes that it is not always wise or possible to enforce provisions of a new law,
together, at all places, in respect of all that it seeks to cover.

<p id="p_133">58.     On 28th May, 2016, the Code was published in the official gazette after its
passage in Parliament. It has been hailed as a major economic measure, aimed at
aligning insolvency laws with international standards. Parliament’s previous attempts
to ensure recovery of public debt, (through the Recovery of Debts due to Banks or
Financial Institutions Act, 1993, hereafter “RDBFI Act”) securitization (by the
Securitization and Reconstruction and <a href="/doc/198257891/" id="a_186">Enforcement of Security Interests Act</a>, 2002
hereafter “SARFESI”) deal with certain facets of corporate insolvency. These did not
result in the desired consequences. The aim of the Code is to a) promote
entrepreneurship and availability of credit; b) ensure the balanced interests of all
stakeholders and c) promote time-bound resolution of insolvency in case of corporate
persons, partnership firms and individuals.

</p><p id="p_159">60. The highlight of the Code is the institutional framework it envisions. This
framework consists of the regulator (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India)
insolvency professionals, information utilities and adjudicatory mechanisms (NCLT
and National Company Law Appellate Tribunal-NCLAT). These institutions and
structures are aimed at promoting corporate governance and also enable a time bound
and formal resolution of insolvency. The major features of the Code include a two-
step process -insolvency resolution for corporate debtors where the minimum amount
of the default is ₹1,00,00,000/-. Two processes are proposed by the Code: a) Insolvency
resolution process (Sections 6 to 32 of the Code) - In this, the creditors play a crucial
role in evaluating and ultimately determining whether the debtor&#x27;s business can be
continued and if so, what are the choices for its revival; and b) Liquidation [Sections
33-54 Code] - If revival fails or is not a feasible option, then creditors can resolve to
wind up the company. Upon winding up, assets of the debtor are to be distributed.
</p><p id="p_160">61.    The insolvency resolution process under <a href="/doc/999373/" id="a_198">Section 6</a> can be initiated by the
financial creditor [Section 7 of the Code] or operational creditor [subject to issuing a
demand notice to the corporate debtor stating the amount involved in the default,
under <a href="/doc/1911494/" id="a_199">Section 8</a>, of the Code] against the corporate debtor in the NCLT. Voluntary
insolvency proceedings may also be initiated by the defaulting company, its
employees or shareholders [Section 10 of the Code]. Once the resolution process
begins, for the entire period, a moratorium is ordered by the NCLT on the debtor&#x27;s
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                              39</span>

operations. During this period, no judicial proceedings can be initiated. There can
also be no enforcement of securities, sale or transfer of assets or termination of
essential contracts against the debtor. The next step is appointment of an Interim
Resolution Professional under Section16 of the Code. The resolution professional has
to work under the broad guidelines of the committee of creditors (or “COC”- in terms
of Section 21 of the Code). The CoC includes all the financial creditors of the
corporate debtor, except all related parties and operational creditors. Further, Section
22 of the Code provides that the CoC has to appoint the resolution professional. This
resolution professional can also be the interim resolution professional. A vote of 75%
of the voting share shall determine the decisions of the committee to opt for either a
revival or liquidation (<a href="/doc/1295756/" id="a_200">Section 30</a>). The decision of the CoC is binding not only on
debtors, but also on all the other creditors. Different types of revival plans include
fresh finance, sale of assets, haircuts (i.e. acceptance by creditors of amounts lower
than what is due to them), change of management etc. The committee should approve
the resolution plan forwarded by the creditor. Only upon approval does the resolution
professional forward the plan to the adjudicating authority for final approval. The
resolution plan has to be approved by the NCLT; while doing so, it can consider
objections to the resolution plan by any party interested in voicing such objections
(i.e. operational creditors, financial creditors, etc).
</p><p id="p_161">62.     Section 78(3) of the Code states that the adjudicating authority, for the
purpose of Part III (that deals with insolvency Resolution and bankruptcy of
individuals and partnership firms) would be the Debt Recovery Tribunal(DRT) that
was established under the RDBFI Act. The adjudicating authority for corporate
insolvency (companies, LLPs and limited liability entities), on the other hand, is the
NCLT. The appeal from the NCLT lies to the National Company Law Appellate
Tribunal (NCLAT). The appeal from the DRT lies to the Debt Recovery Appellate
Tribunal (DRAT). This court hears appeals from both the NCLAT and the DRAT.

V     Analysis and conclusions

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">64.   The principal ground of attack in all these proceedings has been that the
executive government could not have selectively brought into force the Code, and
applied some of its provisions to one sub-category of individuals, i.e., personal
guarantors to corporate creditors. All the petitioners in unison argued that the
impugned notification, in seeking to achieve that end, is ultra vires. This argument is
premised on the nature and content of <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_210">Section 1(3)</a>, which the petitioners characterize
to be conditional legislation. Unlike delegated legislation, they say, conditional
legislation is a limited power which can be exercised once, in respect of the subject
matter or class of subject matters. As long as different dates are designated for
bringing into force the enactment, or in relation to different areas, the executive acts
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                           41</span>

within its powers. However, when it selectively does so, and segregates the subject
matter of coverage of the enactment, it indulges in impermissible legislation.
</blockquote><p id="p_163">Reliance has been placed on several judgments of this court, with respect to the limits
of such power- notably the decisions of the Privy Council in Burah, of the Federal
Court in Narothamdas Jethabai; <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_211">In Re Delhi Laws Act</a>, 1912, Jatindranath Gupta,
Hamdard Dawakhana, Sabanayagam and Vasu Dev Singh.
</p><p id="p_164">65.   In Burah, the question arose in the context of a law made by the Indian
Legislature removing the district of Garo Hills from the jurisdiction of the civil and
criminal courts and the law applied to them, and to vest the administration of civil
and criminal justice within the same district in such officers as the Lieutenant-
Governor of Bengal might appoint for the purpose. By <a href="/doc/1589358/" id="a_212">Section 9</a>, the Lt. Governor
was empowered from time to time, by notification in the Calcutta Gazette, to extend,
mutatis mutandis, all or any of the provisions contained in the Act to the Jaintia, Naga
and Khasi Hills and to fix the date of application thereof as well. By a notification,
the Lt. Governor extended all the provisions, which was challenged by Burah, who
was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The High Court of Calcutta upheld
his contention and held that <a href="/doc/1589358/" id="a_213">Section 9</a> of the Act was ultra vires the powers of the
Indian Legislature as it was a delegate of the Imperial Parliament and as such further
delegation was not permissible. The Privy Council overturned that verdict, and held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">          “Legislation which does not directly fix the period for its own
          commencement, but leaves that to be done by an external
          authority, may with quite as much reason he called incomplete; as
          that which does not itself immediately determine the whole area
          to which it is to be applied, but leaves this to be done by the same
          external authority. If it is an act of legislation on the part of the
          external authority so trusted to enlarge the area within which a
          law actually in operation is to be applied, it would seem à fortiori
          to be an act of legislation to bring the law originally into
          operation by fixing the time for its commencement…..”

It was also observed that:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">          “Their Lordships agree that the Governor-General in Council
          could not, by any form of enactment, create in India, and arm with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                           42</span>

          general legislative authority, a new legislative Power, not created
          or authorized by the <a href="/doc/1369884/" id="a_214">Councils Act</a>. Nothing of that kind has, in their
          Lordships&#x27; opinion, been done or attempted in the present case.”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">66.   The next case cited was Jatindra Nath Gupta where the validity of Section 1(3)
of the Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1948 was challenged on the ground
that it empowered the Provincial Government to extend the life of the Act for one
year with such modification as it could deem fit. The Federal Court held that the
power of extension with modification is not a valid delegation of legislative power
because it is an essential legislative function which cannot be delegated. The court
observed, inter alia, that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">          “The proviso contains the power to extend the Act for a period of
          one year with modifications, if any. It is one power and not two
          severable powers. The fact that no modifications were made in the
          Act when the power was exercised cannot help in determining the
          true nature of the power. The power to extend the operation of the
          Act beyond the period mentioned in the Act prima facie is a
          legislative power. It is for the Legislature to state how long a
          particular legislation will be in operation. That cannot be left to the
          discretion of some other body. The power to modify an Act of a
          Legislature, without any limitation on the extent of the power of
          modification, is undoubtedly a legislative power. It is not a power
          confined to apply the Act subject to any restriction, limitation or
          proviso (which is the aim as an exception) only. It seems to me
          therefore that the power contained in the proviso is legislative.”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">67.     In the case of In re <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_215">Delhi Laws Act</a>, 1912, a reference made under <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_216">Article 143</a>
of the Constitution, saw a polyvocal court and a plurality of judicial opinion by the
seven judge bench of this court. Three provisions were referred for the opinion of this
court. Having regard to the majority view, it was held that essential legislative
functions could not be delegated, and that the power to repeal an enactment, extended
by the Central Government, to a part C state, could not be delegated. The majority’s
conclusion was that the power of repeal is legislative. The observations in some of
the judgments are telling, and are reproduced below. Kania, CJ observed as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_43">             “53. It is common ground that no law creating such bodies has
          been passed by the Parliament so far. <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_217">Article 246</a> deals with the
          distribution of legislative powers between the Centre and the States
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                           43</span>

          but Part ‘C’ States are outside its operation. Therefore on any
          subject affecting Part ‘C’ States, Parliament is the sole and
          exclusive legislature until it passes an Act creating a legislature or
          a council in terms of <a href="/doc/1823046/" id="a_218">Article 240.</a> Proceeding on the footing that a
          power of legislation does not carry with it the power of delegation
          (as claimed by the Attorney-General), the question is whether
          <a href="/doc/1818930/" id="a_219">Section 2</a> of the Part ‘C’ States (Laws) Act is valid or not. By that
          section the Parliament has given power to the Central Government
          by notification to extend to any part of such State (Part ‘C’ State),
          with such restrictions and modifications as it thinks
          fit, any enactment which is in force in Part A State at the date of the
          notification. The section although framed on the lines of the <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_220">Delhi
          Laws Act</a> and the Ajmer-Merwara Act is restricted in its scope as
          the executive Government is empowered to extend only an Act
          which is in force in any of the Part A States. For the reasons I have
          considered certain parts of the two sections covered by Questions 1
          and 2 ultra vires, that part of <a href="/doc/1818930/" id="a_221">Section 2</a> of the Part ‘C’ States (Laws)
          Act, 1950, which empowers the Central Government to extend laws
          passed by any legislature of Part A State, will also be ultra vires. To
          the extent the Central Legislature or Parliament has passed Acts
          which are applicable to Part A States, there can be no objection to
          the Central Government extending, if necessary, the operation of
          those Acts to the Province of Delhi, because the Parliament is the
          competent legislature for that Province. To the extent however the
          section permits the Central Government to extend laws made by
          any legislature of Part A State to the Province of Delhi, the section
          is ultra vires.”

Mahajan, J had this to say:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_44">          “The section does not declare any law but gives the Central
          Government power to declare what the law shall be. The choice to
          select any enactment in force in any province at the date of such
          notification clearly shows that the legislature declared no
          principles or policies as regards the law to be made on any subject.
          It may be pointed out that under the Act of 1935 different provinces
          had the exclusive power of laying down their policies in respect to
          subjects within their own legislative field. What policy was to be
          adopted for Delhi, whether that adopted in the province of Punjab
          or of Bombay, was left to the Central Government. Illustratively,
          the mischief of such law-making may be pointed out with reference
          to what happened in pursuance of this section in Ajmer-Merwara.
          The Bombay Agricultural Debtors&#x27; Relief Act, 1947, has been
          extended under cover of this section to Ajmer-Merwara and under
          the power of modification by amending the definition of the word
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                          44</span>

         ‘debtor’ the whole policy of the Bombay Act has been altered.
         Under the Bombay Act a person is a debtor who is indebted and
         whose annual income from sources other than agricultural and
         manly labour does not exceed 33 per cent of his total annual
         income or does not exceed Rs 500, whichever is greater. In the
         modified statutes “debtor” means an agriculturist who owes a debt,
         and “agriculturist” means a person who earns his livelihood by
         agriculture and whose income from such source exceeds 66 per
         cent of his total income. The outside limit of Rs 500 is removed. The
         exercise of this power amounts to making a new law by a body
         which was not in the contemplation of the Constitution and was not
         authorized to enact any laws. Shortly stated, the question is, could
         the Indian Legislature under the Act of 1935 enact that the
         executive could extend to Delhi laws that may be made hereinafter
         by a legislature in Timbuctoo or Soviet Russia with modifications.
         The answer would be in the negative because the policy of those
         laws could never be determined by the law making body entrusted
         with making laws for Delhi. The Provincial Legislatures in India
         under the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_222">Constitution Act</a> of 1935 qua Delhi constitutionally stood

         enactments mentioned therein are ultra vires the constitution in the
         particulars stated, this question is also answered similarly. It might,
         however, be observed that in this case express power to repeal or
         amend laws already applicable in Part-C States has been conferred
         on the Central Government. Power to repeal or amend laws is a
         power which can only be exercised by an authority that has the
         power to enact laws. It is a power coordinate and coextensive with
         the power of the legislature itself. In bestowing on the Central
         Government and clothing it with the same capacity as is possessed
         by the legislature itself the Parliament has acted
         unconstitutionally.”

<blockquote id="blockquote_47">         “342. It will be noticed that the powers conferred by this section
         upon the Central Government are far in excess of those conferred
         by the other two legislative provisions, at least in accordance with
         the interpretation which I have attempted to put upon them. As has
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                           45</span>

          been stated already, it is quite an intelligible policy that so long as
          a proper legislative machinery is not set up in a particular area,
          the Parliament might empower an executive authority to introduce
          laws validly passed by a competent legislature and actually in
          force in other parts of the country to such area, with each
          modifications and restrictions as the authority thinks proper, the
          modifications being limited to local adjustments or changes of a
          minor character. But this presupposes that there is no existing law
          on that particular subject actually in force in that territory. If any
          such law exists and power is given to repeal or abrogate such laws
          either in whole or in part and substitute in place of the same other
          laws which are in force in other areas, it would certainly amount to
          an unwarrantable delegation of legislative powers. To repeal or
          abrogate an existing law is the exercise of an essential legislative
          power, and the policy behind such acts must be the policy of the
          legislature itself. If the legislature invests the executive with the
          power to determine as to which of the laws in force in a particular
          territory are useful or proper and if it is given to that authority to
          replace any of them by laws brought from other provinces with
          such modifications as it thinks proper, that would be to invest the
          executive with the determination of the entire legislative policy and
          not merely of carrying out a policy which the legislature has
          already laid down. Thus the power of extension, which is
          contemplated by Section 2 of Part-C States (Laws) Act, includes
          the power of introducing laws which may be in actual conflict with
          the laws validly established and already in operation in that
          territory….”

virtually granted what was described as a carte blanche in regard to whether to
extend the provisions of any state Act, if so, which, the power of modification, as
well as the power of repeal. The judges were agreed that within the broad remit of
delegated legislative power, as long as essential legislative powers were not
delegated, the provisions would not be ultra vires. However, the power to extend laws
that Parliament had not enacted (as it was competent to enact, in respect of Part C
states) as well as the power to repeal, was held to be legislative in content. Therefore,
the court held such power to be ultra vires. This is evident from the following
Opinion of the court, recorded as a result of the majority judgment:

              mentioned on Question 3, the first part was held to be intra vires,
              but the second portion, which is in the following terms:

concerned the question of empowering the executive to designate a court to exercise
jurisdiction upto ₹ 25,000/-, i.e. Section 4 of the Bombay City Civil Courts Act 60. The
contention successfully raised before the High Court was that once the legislature had
conferred jurisdiction upto a pecuniary limit of ₹10,000/- to the City Civil Court,
delegating the power to increase that jurisdiction was ultra vires. The argument was
repelled by a majority of judges (Mahajan, Fazal Ali and B.K. Mukherjea, JJ). Fazal
Ali, J stated that

              “22. It is contended that this section is invalid, because the

              does not appear to me to be sound. The section itself shows that the
              Provincial Legislature having exercised its judgment and
              determined that the New Court should be invested with jurisdiction
              to try suits and proceedings of a civil nature of a value not
              exceeding Rs. 25,000, left it to the Provincial Government to
              determine when the Court should be invested with this larger
              jurisdiction, for which the limit had been fixed. It is clear that if
              and when the New Court has to be invested with the larger
              jurisdiction, that jurisdiction would be due to no other authority
              than the Provincial Legislature itself and the court would exercise
              that jurisdiction by virtue of the Act itself. As several of my learned

          persons in whom it places confidence, is no uncommon thing, and
          in many instances it may be highly convenient and desirable.”

Mahajan, J observed as follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_53">          “The fixation of the maximum limit of the court&#x27;s pecuniary

          the outside limit of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the new court. The
          policy of the legislature in regard to the pecuniary jurisdiction of
          the court that was being set up was settled by <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_225">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/1332830/" id="a_226">4</a> of
          the Act and it was to the effect that initially its pecuniary

          circumstances make it desirable - and this was left to the
          determination of the Provincial Government - it could be given
          jurisdiction to hear cases up to the value of Rs. 25,000. It was also
          determined that the extension of the pecuniary jurisdiction of the
          new court will be subject to the provisions contained in the
          exceptions to <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_227">Section 3</a>. I am therefore of the opinion that the
          learned Chief Justice was not right in saying that the legislative
          mind was never applied as to the conditions subject to which and
          as to the amount up to which the new court could have pecuniary
          jurisdiction. All that was left to the discretion of the Provincial
          Government was the determination of the circumstances under
          which the new court would be clothed with enhanced pecuniary
          jurisdiction. The vital matters of policy having been determined,
          the actual execution of that policy was left to the Provincial
          Government and to such conditional legislation no exception could
          be taken.”

Again, the court upheld the exercise of executive discretion on the ground that there
was proper legislative framework and guidance to the government, with respect to
conferring jurisdiction upon the City Civil Court, beyond the limit enacted by <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_228">Section

two notifications was involved. <a href="/doc/1332830/" id="a_230">Section 4</a> of the original ordinance enacted that as

The validity of this ordinance, enacted originally in 1949 (and in force for two years),
was extended twice, for two years each (by notifications dated June 14, 1951 and
June 20, 1953). The Legislative Assembly of Rajasthan was constituted and came
into being on March 29, 1952. Till then, the Rajpramukh was vested with legislative
authority. On October 15, 1955, a new enactment, the Rajasthan Tenancy Act No. III
of 1955 came into force, and the relationship between landlords and tenants was
governed by it. Negativing the challenge to the extension of the ordinance, this court
ruled, (after considering Burah, In re <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_231">Delhi Laws Act</a> and Jatindra Nath Gupta) that:

          on an understanding of the situation as it then existed. At the same
          time, it conferred a power on the Rajpramukh to extend the life of
          the Ordinance beyond that period, if the state of affairs then should
          require it. When such extension is decided by the Rajpramukh and
          notified, the law that will operate is the law which was enacted by
          the legislative authority in respect of &quot; place, person, laws, powers
          &quot;, and it is clearly conditional and not delegated legislation as laid
          down in The Queen v. Burah ([1878] 5 I.A. 178), and must, in
          consequence, be held to be valid. It follows that we are unable to
          agree with the statement of the law in <a href="/doc/93291465/" id="a_233">Jatindra Nath Gupta v. The,
          State of Bihar</a>([1949] F.C.R. 595) that a power to extend the life of

          In this view, the question as to the permissible limits of delegation
          of legislative authority on which the judgments in In re <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_234">The Delhi

          that under that Article his authority ceased when the Legislature of
          the State was constituted, which was in the present case, on March
          29, 1952. This argument proceeds on a misconception as to the
          true character of a notification issued under <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_236">Section 3</a> of the
          Ordinance. It was not an independent piece of legislation such as
          could be enacted only by the then competent legislative
          (1).authority of the State, but merely an exercise of a power
          conferred by a statute which had been previously enacted by the
          appropriate legislative authority. The exercise of such a power is
          referable not to the legislative competence of the Rajpramukh but
          to Ordinance No- IX of 1949, and provided <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_237">Section 3</a> is valid, the
          validity of the notification is co- extensive with that of the
          Ordinance. If the Ordinance did not come to an end by reason of
          the fact that the authority of the Rajpramukh to legislate came to
          an end-and that is not and cannot be disputed-neither did the
          power to issue a notification which is conferred therein. The true
          position is that it is in his character as the authority on whom
          power was conferred under <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_238">Section 3</a> of the Ordinance that the
          Rajpramukh issued the impugned notification, and not as the

          legislature having laid down the broad principles of its policy in the

          administrative authority. In other words by delegated legislation
          the delegate completes the legislation by supplying details within
          the limits prescribed by the statute and in the case of conditional

          time and manner -of carrying its legislation into effect as also the
          determination of the area to which it is to extend.”

The court held that the impugned provision was impermissible delegation as it lacked
legislative guidance as regards the exercise of executive power:

<blockquote id="blockquote_60">          “The question for decision then is, is the delegation constitutional
          in that the administrative authority has been supplied with proper

          has established no criteria, no standards and has not prescribed
          any principle on which a particular disease or condition is to be
          specified in the Schedule. It is not stated what facts or
          circumstances are to be taken into consideration to include a

the date of its issue, thus resulting in the application of the <a href="/doc/720619/" id="a_248">Payment of Bonus Act</a> for
previous accounting years. As to the nature of the power (to exempt), this court, after
considering various previous decisions, held that there are three broad categories of
conditional legislation, and elaborated as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">          “In the first category when the Legislature has completed its task of
          enacting a Statute, the entire superstructure of the legislation is
          ready but its future applicability to a given area is left to the
          subjective satisfaction of the delegate who being satisfied about the
          conditions indicating the ripe time for applying the machinery of
          the said Act to a given area exercises that power as a delegate of
          the parent legislative body. Tulsipur Sugar Co. &#x27;s case (supra) is an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                51</span>

illustration on this point. <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_249">When the Act</a> itself is complete and is
enacted to be uniformly applied in future to all those who are to be
covered by the sweep of the Act, the Legislature can be said to have
completed its task. All that it leaves to the delegate is to apply the
same uniformly to a given area indicated by the parent Legislature
itself but at an appropriate time. This would be an act of pure and
simple conditional legislation depending upon the subjective
satisfaction of the delegate as to when the said Act enacted and
completed by the parent Legislature is to be made effective. As the
parent Legislature itself has laid down a binding course of conduct
to be followed by all and sundry to be covered by the sweep of the
legislation and as it has to act as a binding rule of conduct within
that sweep and on the basis of which all their future actions are to
be controlled and guided, it can easily be visualised that of the
parent Legislature while it enacted such law was not required to
hear the parties likely to be affected by the operation of the Act, is
delegate exercising an extremely limited and almost ministerial
function as an agent of the principal Legislature applying the Act to
the area at an appropriate time is also not supposed and required to
hear all those who are likely to be affected in future by the binding
code of conduct uniformly laid down to be followed by all within
the sweep of the Act as enacted by the parent Legislature.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">However, there may be second category of conditional legislations
wherein the delegate has to decide whether and under what
circumstances a completed Act of the parent legislation which has
already come into force is to be partially withdraw from operation
in a given area or in given cases so as not to be applicable to a
given class of persons who are otherwise admittedly governed by
the Act. When such a power by way of conditional legislation is to
be exercised by the delegate a question may arise as to how the
said power can be exercised. In such an eventuality if the
satisfaction regarding the existence of condition precedent to the
exercise of such power depends upon pure subjective satisfaction of
the delegate and if such an exercise is not required to be based on
the prima face proof of factual data for ad against such an exercise
and if such an exercise to uniformly apply in future to a given
common class of subjects to be governed by such an exercise and
when such an exercise is not to be confined to individual cases only,
then even in such category of cases while exercising conditional
legislative powers the delegate may not be required to have an
objective assessment after considering rival versions on the data
placed before it for being taken into consideration by it in exercise
of such power of conditional legislation. For example if a tariff is
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                 52</span>

fixed under the Act and exemption power is conferred on the
delegate whether to grant full exemption or partial exemption from
the tariff rate it may involve such an exercise of conditional
legislative function wherein the exercise has to be made by the
delegate on its own subjective satisfaction and once that exercise is
made whatever exemption is granted or partially granted or
partially withdrawn from time to time would be binding on the
entire class of persons similarly situated and who will be covered
by the seep of such exemptions, partial or whole, and whether
granted or withdrawn, wholly or partially, and in exercise of such a
power there may be no occasion to hear the parties likely to be
affected by such an exercise. For example from a settled tariff say if
earlier 30% exemption is granted by the delegate and then reduced
to 20% all those who are similarly situated and covered by the
sweep of such exemption and its modification cannot be permitted
to say in the absence of any statutory provision to that effect that
they should be given a hearing before the granted exemption is
wholly or partially withdrawn.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_166">In the aforesaid first two categories of cases delegate who
exercises conditional legislation acting on its pure subjective
satisfaction regarding existence of conditions precedent for
exercise of such power may not be required to hear parties likely to
be affected by the exercise of such power. Where the delegate
proceeds to fill p the details of the legislation for the future - which
is part of the integrated action of policy-making for the future, it is
part of the future policy and is legislative. But where he merely
determines either subjectively or objectively - depending upon the
&quot;conditions&quot; imposed in the statute permitting exercise of power by
the delegate - there is no legislation involved in the real sense and
therefore, in our opinion, applicability of principles of fair play,
consultation or natural justice to the extent necessary cannot be
said to be foreclosed. Of course, the fact that in such cases of
`conditional legislation&#x27; these principles are not foreclosed does
not necessarily mean that they are always mandated. In a case of
purely ministerial function or in a case where no objective
conditions are prescribed and the matter is left to the subjective
satisfaction of the delegate (as in categories one and two explained
above) no such principles of fair play, consultation or natural
justice could be attracted. That is because the very nature of the
administrative determination does not attract these formalities and
not because the determination is legislative in character. There
may also be situations where the persons affected are

</p><p id="p_167">73.     In another decision, Vasu Dev Singh, the court had to decide upon the validity
of a notification issued by the Administrator of Chandigarh dated 7.11.2002, directing
that the provision of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949, (which was
extended by Parliament to Chandigarh by the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act
(Extension to <a href="/doc/241270/" id="a_250">Chandigarh) Act</a> 1974) was not applicable to buildings and rented lands
whose monthly rent exceeded ₹1500. The Administrator justified the notification as
an instance of conditional legislation since the power under <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_251">Section 3</a> enabled him to
exempt provisions of the Act to classes of buildings.61 This court disagreed with the
contention that the exemption was in the exercise of conditional legislative power:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_64">              “16. We, at the outset, would like to express our disagreement with
              the contentions raised before us by the learned counsel appearing
              on behalf of the respondents that the impugned notification is in
              effect and substance a conditional legislation and not a delegated
              legislation. The distinction between conditional legislation and
              delegated legislation is clear and unambiguous. In a conditional
              legislation the delegatee has to apply the law to an area or to
              determine the time and manner of carrying it into effect or at such
              time, as it decides or to understand the rule of legislation, it would
              be a conditional legislation. The legislature in such a case makes
              the law, which is complete in all respects but the same is not
              brought into operation immediately. The enforcement of the law
              would depend upon the fulfilment of a condition and what is
              delegated to the executive is the authority to determine by
              exercising its own judgment as to whether such conditions have
              been fulfilled and/or the time has come when such legislation
              should be brought into force. The taking effect of a legislation,
              therefore, is made dependent upon the determination of such fact or
              condition by the executive organ of the Government. Delegated
              legislation, however, involves delegation of rule-making power of
              legislation and authorises an executive authority to bring in force
              such an area by reason thereof. The discretion conferred on the
              executive by way of delegated legislation is much wider. Such
              power to make rules or regulations, however, must be exercised
              within the four corners of the Act. Delegated legislation, thus, is a

61“3. Exemptions.—The Central Government may direct that all or any of the provisions of this Act, shall not apply to
any particular building or rented land or any class of buildings or rented lands.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                           54</span>

          device which has been fashioned by the legislature to be exercised
          in the manner laid down in the legislation itself. By reason of
          <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_252">Section 3</a> of the Act, the Administrator, however, has been
          empowered to issue a notification whereby and whereunder, an
          exemption is granted for application of the Act itself.”

After considering a large number of decisions, including those where this court had
upheld exemptions issued by different states based on rent, this court concluded that
there was insufficient justification for the impugned exemption notification, and that
it was ultra vires the power conferred upon the Administrator:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">          “150. Moreover, the notification has not been issued for a limited
          period. It will have, therefore, a permanent effect. Submission of Mr
          Nariman that having regard to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/905940/" id="a_253">General
          Clauses Act</a>, the same can be modified, amended at any time and
          withdrawn, cannot be accepted for more than one reason. Firstly,
          the respondent proceeded on the basis that the said notification has
          been issued with a view to give effect to the National Policy i.e.
          amendments must be carried out until a new <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_254">Rent Act</a> is enacted.
          Whether the Act would be enacted or not is a matter of surmises
          and conjectures. It would be again a matter of legislative policy
          which was not within the domain of the Administrator. Secondly, the
          Administrator in following the National Policy proceeded on the
          basis that the provisions of the Act must ultimately be repealed.
          When steps are taken to repeal the Act either wholly or in part, the
          intention becomes clear i.e. the same is not meant to be given a
          temporary effect. When the repealed provisions are sought to be
          brought back to the statute-book, it has to be done by way of fresh
          legislation. (…) What can be done in future by another authority
          cannot be a ground for upholding an executive act.”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_66">74.    A close reading of the decisions cited on behalf of the petitioners would
reveal that the power to extend laws has been upheld. As B.K. Mukherjea observed,
in In re <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_255">Delhi Laws Act</a>, 1912 (supra):
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_67">          “it is quite an intelligible policy that so long as a proper legislative
          machinery is not set up in a particular area, the Parliament might
          empower an executive authority to introduce laws validly passed by
          a competent legislature and actually in force in other parts of the
          country to such area, with each modifications and restrictions as
          the authority thinks proper, the modifications being limited to local
          adjustments or changes of a minor character.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                            55</span>

       Lord Selborne, in Burah (supra)held such power to be unexceptionable, saying
that

          “Legislation, conditional on the use of particular powers, or on the
          executive of a limited discretion, entrusted by the Legislature to persons
          in whom it places confidence is no uncommon thing; and, in many
          circumstances, it may be highly convenient”

In Jitendra Nath Gupta (supra), what the Federal Court held objectionable was the
conferment of power to extend provisions of an enactment, beyond its expressed
duration or time:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_68">          “It is for the Legislature to state how long a particular legislation
          will be in operation. That cannot be left to the discretion of some
          other body. The power to modify an Act of a Legislature, without
          any limitation on the extent of the power of modification, is un-</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_69">          doubtedly a legislative power.”

The plurality of judgments, as well as opinions rendered in <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_256">In Re Delhi Laws Act</a>,
1912, makes that decision a somewhat complex reading. Yet, the final per curiam
opinion of the court was that the power to extend, modify or repeal enactments of
Part C States, in respect of matters which the Parliament had not directly enacted,
amounted to excessive legislation. Additionally, exception was taken to the power to
repeal, being delegated, as it was an essential legislative power.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_168">75.     In Sardar Inder Singh (supra), the extension of rent restriction ordinances was
in question; the court did not apply the rule in Jatindra Nath Gupta (supra), and
ultimately held that the true position was that the Rajpramukh “in his character as
the authority on whom power was conferred under <a href="/doc/858315/" id="a_257">Section 3</a> of the Ordinance that
the Rajpramukh issued the impugned notification, and not as the legislative authority
of the State.” In Hamdard Dawakhana (supra), the argument that <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_258">Section 3</a> was
conditional legislation was negatived and it was held to be an instance of excessive
delegation, where Parliament did not indicate any guidance for inclusion of particular
instances in the schedule, leaving it to the executive government to decide the issue,
in what could be an arbitrary manner. Vasu Dev Singh (supra)was a case where the
court held that the power to exclude from application of the enactment, based on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                            56</span>

quantum of rent, was premised on the Administrator’s opinion that the legislation
would be repealed, having regard to a National Policy. Moreover, the notification
excluded the application of the Act in relation to premises based on rent and had a
permanent character. This court held that the notification was an instance of
impermissible legislation by the executive. It is evident that the court ruled in
Jitendra Nath Gupta, In re <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_259">Delhi Laws Act</a> and Vasu Dev Singh that the exercise of
extending an enactment beyond the time of its designated application by the
legislature; the power of extension, modification and repeal of laws made by other
legislative bodies; and the limiting the application of an enactment based on a
quantification (an amount of rent) were legislative exercises, beyond the powers
conferred. They stricto sensu fall in the category of “general legislative authority, a
new legislative Power, not created or authorized” by the parent legislation, (per
Burah, supra). In Hamdard Dawakhana, the power to include new drugs, was held to
be uncanalized, i.e. without any legislative guidance. The decision did not involve
bringing into force provisions of an enactment, or exclusion, but inclusion within its
fold, without any statutory guidance on new drugs. The case therefore involved
delegated legislation.
</p>
<p id="p_169">76.     It would now be useful to analyse some decisions cited by the respondents. In
Bishwambhar Singh (supra)the power under Section 3(1) of the Orissa Estates
Abolition (Amendment) Act, 1952 was involved. The provision enabled the state to
declare that an estate had – in terms of notifications issued in that regard- vested in it,
free from all encumbrances. This court negatived the challenge to that provision:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_70">          &quot;77. The long title of the Act and the two preambles which have
          been quoted above clearly indicate that the object and purpose of
          the Act is to abolish all the rights, title and interest in land of
          intermediaries by whatever name known. This is a clear
          enunciation of the policy which is sought to be implemented by the
          operative provisions of the Act. Whatever discretion has been
          vested in the State Government under <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_260">Section 3</a> or <a href="/doc/1332830/" id="a_261">Section 4</a> must
          be exercised in the light of this policy and, therefore, it cannot be
          said to be an absolute or unfettered discretion, for sooner or later
          all estates must perforce be abolished. From the very nature of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                           57</span>

          things a certain amount of discretionary latitude had to be given to
          the State Government. It would have been a colossal task if the
          State Government had to take over all the estates at one and the
          same time. It would have broken down the entire administrative
          machinery. It could not be possible to collect sufficient staff to take
          over and discharge the responsibilities. It would be difficult to
          arrange for the requisite finance all at once. It was, therefore,
          imperative to confer some discretion on the State Government. It
          has not been suggested or shown that in practice any
          discrimination has been made.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p id="p_170">In Basant Kumar Sarkar (supra), the power in question was <a href="/doc/68508/" id="a_262">Section 1(3)</a> of the
Employees State Insurance Act, which enabled the government to extend the
enactment to establishments. This court negatived that the power was ultra vires:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_71">         “4. The argument is that the power given to the Central
         Government to apply the provisions of the Act by notification,
         confers on the Central Government absolute discretion, the
         exercise of which is not guided by any legislative provision and is,
         therefore, invalid. <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_263">The Act</a> does not prescribe any considerations in
         the light of which the Central Government can
         proceed to act under <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_264">Section 1(3)</a> and such un-canalised power
         conferred on the Central Government must be treated as invalid.
         We are not impressed by this argument. <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_265">Section 1(3)</a> is really not an
         illustration of delegated legislation at all; it is what can be
         properly described as conditional legislation. <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_266">The Act</a> has
         prescribed a self-contained Code in regard to the insurance of the
         employees covered by it; several remedial measures which the
         legislature thought it necessary to enforce in regard to such
         workmen have been specifically dealt with and appropriate
         provisions have been made to carry out the policy of the Act as laid
         down in its relevant sections. <a href="/doc/494623/" id="a_267">Section 3(1)</a> of the Act purports to
         authorise the Central Government to establish a Corporation for
         the administration of the scheme of Employees&#x27; State Insurance by
         a notification. In other words, when the notification should be
         issued and in respect of what factories it should be issued, has been
         left to the discretion of the Central Government and that is
         precisely what is usually done by conditional legislation. [......]

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">          5. […] In the very nature of things, it would have been impossible
          for the legislature to decide in what areas and in respect of which
          factories the Employees&#x27; State Insurance Corporation should be
          established. It is obvious that a scheme of this kind, though very
          beneficent, could not be introduced in the whole of the country all

          at once. Such beneficial measures which need careful
          experimentation have some times to be adopted by stages and in
          different phases…”

</blockquote><p id="p_171">77.    The next decision cited was Lachmi Narain (supra). Here, the Central
Government was empowered by Section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) (Act), 1950 to
extend through a notification any enactment in Part A States. The Central
Government had issued a Notification in 1951 to extend the provisions of the Bengal
Finance (Sales Tax) Act to the then Part C State of Delhi. In 1957, a notification in
exercise of this power under <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_268">Section 2</a> was issued modifying the earlier notification
resulting in withdrawal of certain benefits. In the background of these facts, a three-
judge bench of this Court dealing with an argument on whether the power to extend
with or without modifications any enactment was conditional or delegated legislation,
made the following observations:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_73">          “49. Before proceeding further, it will be proper to say a few words
          in regard to the argument that the power conferred by <a href="/doc/789287/" id="a_269">Section 2</a> of
          the Laws Act is a power of conditional legislation and not a power
          of ‘delegated’ legislation. In our opinion, no useful purpose will be
          served to pursue this line of argument because the distinction
          propounded between the two categories of legislative powers
          makes no difference, in principle. In either case, the person to
          whom the power is entrusted can do nothing beyond the limits
          which circumscribe the power; he has to act – to use the words of
          Lord Selbourne – “within the general scope of the affirmative
          words which give the power” and without violating any “express
          conditions or restrictions by which that power is limited”. There is
          no magic in a name. Whether you call it the power of “conditional
          legislation” as Privy Council called it in Burah’s case (supra), or
          ‘ancillary legislation’ as the Federal Court termed it in Choitram
          v. C. I. T., Bihar, or ‘subsidiary legislation’ as Kania, C. J. Styled it,
          or whether you camouflage it under the veiling name of
          ‘administrative or quasi-legislative power’ – as Professor
          Cushman and other authorities have done it – necessary for
          bringing into operation and effect an enactment, the fact remains
          that it has a content, howsoever small and restricted, of the law-</blockquote>
<p id="p_172">          making power itself. There is ample authority in support of the
          proposition that the power to extend and carry into operation an
          enactment with necessary modifications and adaptations is in truth
          and reality in the nature of a power of delegated legislation.”
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                           59</span>

After these observations, this court held that the power of modification could not
have been exercised by the Government in the manner that it did, and observed as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_74">           “60. The power given by <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_270">Section 2</a> exhausts itself on extension of
           the enactment; it cannot be exercised repeatedly or subsequently to
           such extension. It can be exercised only one, simultaneously with
           the extension of the enactment. This is one dimension of the
           statutory limits which circumscribe the power. The second is that
           the power cannot be used for the purpose other than that of
           extension. In the exercise of this power, only such “restrictions and
           modifications can be validly engrafted in the enactment sought to
           be extended, which are necessary to bring it into operation and
           effect in the Union territory. “Modifications” which are not
           necessary for, or ancillary and subservient to the purpose of
           extension, are not permissible. And, only such “modifications” can
           be legitimately necessary for such purpose as are required to
           adjust, adapt and make the enactment suitable to the peculiar local
           conditions of the Union territory for carrying it into operation and
           effect. In the context of the section, the words “restrictions and
           modifications” do not cover such alterations as involve a change
           in any essential feature, of the enactment or the legislative policy
           built into it. This is the third dimension of the limits that
           circumscribe the power.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_75">           61. It is true that the word “such restrictions and modifications as
           it thinks fit” if construed literally and in isolation, appear to give
           unfettered power of amending and modifying the enactment sought
           to be extended. Such a wide construction must be eschewed lest the
           very validity of the section becomes vulnerable on account of the
           vice of excessive delegation. Moreover, such a construction would
           be repugnant to the context and the content of the section, read as
           a whole, and the statutory limits and conditions attaching to the
           exercise of the power. We must, therefore, confine the scope of the
           words “restrictions and modifications” to alterations of such a
           character which keep the inbuilt policy, essence and substance of
           the enactment sought to be extended, intact, and introduce only
           such peripheral or insubstantial changes which are appropriate
           and necessary to adapt and adjust it to the local conditions of the
           Union territory.”

</p><p id="p_187">79.    The above tabular chart reveals that the provisions relating to the Insolvency
and Bankruptcy Board of India were brought into force at the earliest point of time,
i.e., 05.08.2016. This was to enable the setting up of the regulatory body so that it
could commence its task of examining the relevant issues and evolving standards to
be embodied in rules and regulations. Thereafter, the notification dated 19.08.2016
brought into force Chapter VII) of Part-IV and some provisions of Part-V – relating
to finance, acts, audit and miscellaneous provisions. These were the provisions
ancillary to the working of the Board. The next to be brought into force were parts of
<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_336">Sections 196-197</a> and <a href="/doc/503377/" id="a_337">223</a>, again which dealt with the Board’s functions, its funds etc.
as well as <a href="/doc/159362904/" id="a_338">Sections 244</a>, <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_339">246-248</a> and <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_340">250-252</a>. These were general provisions relating
to the provisions that amended various other enactments in terms of the Schedules set
out to the Code. The fourth notification dated 15.11.2016 brought into force those
provisions relating to insolvency professional agencies and some other provisions
which amended other enactments.
</p><p id="p_188">80.    The notification of 30.11.2016 brought into force certain provisions that had
the effect of operationalizing the enactment in respect of four distinct categories, i.e.
companies incorporated under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_341">Companies Act</a>, companies governed by special
Act, LLPs and other bodies incorporated under any law which the Central
Government could by notification specify. These provisions triggered the application
of the Code to corporate debtors as well as LLPs and other companies and
corporations. Significantly, provisions with regard to voluntary liquidation or
bankruptcy were excluded from application by this notification. Those provisions
were brought into force by the eighth notification dated 01.04.2017, with effect from
15.05.2017. In the meanwhile, the notification dated 09.12.2016 with effect from
15.12.2016, operationalized <a href="/doc/1393668/" id="a_342">Sections 33</a> to <a href="/doc/1513012/" id="a_343">44</a> which deal with the liquidation
process.
</p><p id="p_189">81.    It is quite evident that the method adopted by the Central Government to
bring into force different provisions of the Act had a specific design: to fulfill the
objectives underlying the Code, having regard to its priorities. Plainly, the Central
Government was concerned with triggering the insolvency mechanism processes in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                            62</span>

relation to corporate persons at the earliest. Therefore, by the first three notifications,
the necessary mechanism such as setting up of the regulatory body, provisions
relating to its functions, powers and the operationalization of provisions relating to
insolvency professionals and agencies were brought into force. These started the
mechanism through which insolvency processes were to be carried out and regulated
by law. In the next phase, the part of the Code dealing with one of its subjects, i.e.,
corporate persons [covered by Section 2(a) to 2(d) of the Code] was brought into
force. The entire process for conduct of insolvency proceedings and provisions
relating to such corporate persons were brought into force. The other notifications
brought into force certain consequential provisions, as well as provisions which give
overriding effect to the Code (as also the provisions that amend or modify other
laws). All these clearly show that the Central Government followed a stage-by-stage
process of bringing into force the provisions of the Code, regard being had to the
similarities or dissimilarities of the subject matter and those covered by the Code.
</p><p id="p_190">82.     As discussed in a previous part of this judgment, insolvency proceedings
relating to individuals is regulated by Part-III of the Code. Before the amendment of
2018, all individuals (personal guarantors to corporate debtors, partners of firms,
partnership firms and other partners as well as individuals who were either partners or
personal guarantors to corporate debtors) fell under one descriptive description under
the unamended <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_344">Section 2(e)</a>. The unamended <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_345">Section 60</a> contemplated that the
adjudicating authority in respect of personal guarantors was to be the NCLT. Yet,
having regard to the fact that <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_346">Section 2</a> brought all three categories of individuals
within one umbrella class as it were, it would have been difficult for the Central
Government to selectively bring into force the provisions of part –III only in respect
of personal guarantors. It was here that the Central Government heeded the reports of
expert bodies which recommended that personal guarantors to corporate debtors
facing insolvency process should also be involved in proceedings by the same
adjudicator and for this, necessary amendments were required. Consequently, the
2018 <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_347">Amendment Act</a> altered <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_348">Section 2(e)</a> and subcategorized three categories of
individuals, resulting in <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_349">Sections 2(e)</a>, (f) and (g). Given that the earlier notification
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                         63</span>

of 30.11.2016 had brought the Code into force in relation to entities covered under
<a href="/doc/420719/" id="a_350">Section 2(a)</a> to <a href="/doc/877630/" id="a_351">2(d)</a>, the amendment Act of 2018 provided the necessary statutory
backing for the Central Government to apply the Code, in such a manner as to
achieve the objective of the amendment, i.e. to ensure that adjudicating body dealing
with insolvency of corporate debtors also had before it the insolvency proceedings of
personal guarantors to such corporate debtors.
</p><p id="p_191">83.    The amendment of 2018 also altered <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_352">Section 60</a> in that insolvency and
bankruptcy processes relating to liquidation and bankruptcy in respect of three
categories, i.e. corporate debtors, corporate guarantors of corporate debtors and
personal guarantors to corporate debtors were to be considered by the same forum,
i.e. NCLT.
</p><p id="p_192">84.   <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_353">Section 2</a>, i.e., (application provision of the Code, in relation to different
entities), as originally enacted, did not contain a separate category of personal
guarantors to corporate debtors. Instead, personal guarantors were part of a category
or group of individuals, to whom the Code applied (i.e. individuals, proprietorship
and partnership firms, per <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_354">Section 2(e)</a> which stated “partnership firms and
individuals”). The Code envisioned that the insolvency process outlined in provisions
of Part III was to apply to them. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the
Amendment Bill of 2017, which eventually metamorphosized into the <a href="/doc/1210757/" id="a_355">Amendment
Act</a>, stated that the Code provided for insolvency resolution for individuals and
partnership firms
         “which are proposed to be implemented in a phased manner on
         account of the wider impact of these provisions. In the first phase,
         the provisions would be extended to personal guarantors of
         corporate debtors to further strengthen the corporate insolvency
         resolution process and a clear enabling provision for the purpose
         has been provided in the Bill.&quot;
</p><p id="p_193">85.   The amendment introduced <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_356">Section 2(e)</a> i.e. personal guarantors to corporate
debtors, as a distinct category to whom the Code applied. Now, the amendment was
brought into force retrospectively, on 23 November, 2017. <a href="/doc/1677127/" id="a_357">Section 1</a> of the
Amendment Act states:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                          64</span>

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_77">           (2) It shall be deemed to have come into force on the 23rd day of
           November, 2017.”

</blockquote><p id="p_194">86.   In addition to amending <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_361">Section 2</a>, the same Amendment also amended <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_362">Section
60(2)</a>. Interestingly, though “personal guarantor” was not defined, and fell within the
larger rubric of “individual” under the Code, the adjudicating authority for insolvency
process and liquidation of corporate persons including corporate debtors and personal
guarantors was the NCLT- even under the unamended Code. The amendment of
<a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_363">Section 60(2)</a> added a few concepts. This is best understood on a juxtaposition of the
unamended and the amended provisions: The unamended <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_364">Section 60</a> (2) read as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">           “(2) Without prejudice to sub-section (1) and notwithstanding
           anything to the contrary contained in this Code, where a corporate
           insolvency resolution process or liquidation proceeding of a
           corporate debtor is pending before a National Company Law
           Tribunal, an application relating to the insolvency resolution or
           bankruptcy proceeding of a personal guarantor of the corporate
           debtor shall be filed before the National Company Law Tribunal.”

      The amended <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_365">Section 60</a> (2) reads as follows:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_79">           “(2) Without prejudice to sub-section (1) and notwithstanding
           anything to the contrary contained in this Code, where a corporate
           insolvency resolution process or liquidation proceeding of a
           corporate debtor is pending before a National Company Law
           Tribunal, an application relating to the insolvency resolution or
           liquidation or bankruptcy of a corporate guarantor or personal
           guarantor, as the case may be, of such corporate debtor shall be
           filed before the National Company Law Tribunal”

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_80">87.   The amendment inserted the expression “or liquidation” before the words “or
bankruptcy” and also inserted the expression “of a corporate guarantor… as the
case may be, of” such corporate debtor. The interpretation of this expression has to be
contextual. There is no question of liquidation of a personal guarantor, an individual.
</blockquote><p id="p_195">In such cases, this court has ruled that the principle behind the maxim “reddendo
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                            65</span>

singular singulis” applies. This court had, in <a href="/doc/1070247/" id="a_366">Koteswar Vittal Kamath v. K. Rangappa
Baliga</a>&amp; Co62quoted Black&#x27;s Interpretation of Laws, to explain the meaning of that
maxim:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_81">            “Where a sentence in a statute contains several antecedents and
            several consequences, they are to be read distributively, that is to
            say, each phrase or expression is to be referred to its appropriate
            object.”

Koteswar Vittal Kamath was concerned with the interpretation of the proviso to
<a href="/doc/191273/" id="a_367">Article 304(b)</a> of the Constitution of India which provided that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_82">            “Provided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause (b)
            shall be introduced or moved in the Legislature of a State without
            the previous sanction of the President.”

The term “no Bill or amendment” was construed distributively. The Court held

            “In our opinion, the High Court did not correctly appreciate the
            position. The language of the proviso cannot be interpreted in the
            manner accepted by the High Court without doing violence to the
            rules of construction. If both the words “introduced” or “moved”
            are held to refer to the Bill, it must necessarily be held that both
            those words will also refer to the word “amendment”. On the face
            of it, there can be no question of introducing an amendment.
            Amendments are moved and then, if accepted by the House,
            incorporated in the Bill before it is passed. There is further an
            indication in the Constitution itself that wherever a reference is
            made to a Bill, the only step envisaged is introduction of the Bill.
            There is no reference to such a step as a Bill being moved. The
            Articles, of which notice may be taken in this connection, are
            Articles 109, 114, 117, 198 and 207. In all these articles, whatever
            prohibition is laid down relates to the introduction of a Bill in the
            Legislature. There is no reference at any stage to a Bill being
            moved in a House. The language thus used in the Constitution
            clearly points to the interpretation that, even in the proviso to
            <a href="/doc/1392920/" id="a_368">Article 304</a>, the word “introduced” refers to the Bill, while the
            word “moved” refers to the amendment.”

or bankruptcy, or liquidation of three categories, i.e. corporate debtors, corporate
guarantors (to corporate debtors) and personal guarantors (to corporate debtors) they

corporate debtors and their corporate guarantors, whereas insolvency resolution and
bankruptcy processes apply to personal guarantors, (to corporate debtors) who cannot
be subjected to liquidation.
</p><p id="p_198">89.    The case law cited on behalf of the petitioners shows a certain pattern. In
many cases (In re <a href="/doc/476269/" id="a_371">Delhi Laws Act</a>, Jitendra Kumar Gupta) this court had held that the
power to extend the law, existing or future, that had not been enacted by the
competent legislature, and the power of repeal, as well as the power to extend the life
of the law, were instances of excessive delegation of legislative power. In
Narottamdas Jethabhai (supra), this court upheld the extension of pecuniary
jurisdiction of city civil courts beyond the statutorily prescribed limit, because there
was a provision enabling it, and the executive confined the exercise of its power to
extend the jurisdiction, within the limits enacted. Hamdard Dawakhana was an
instance of grant of un-canalized power (without legislative guidance) of inclusion in
the schedule to the Act, acts falling within its application; it was clearly a case of
excessive delegation. In Lachmi Narain (supra), this court held that the power of
modification cannot be used at any time, but has to be resorted to initially by the
executive, at the time a law is extended and applied. The observations in
Bishwambhar Singh and Basant Kumar Sarkar (supra) reveal that the executive is
tasked with implementing the Act in stages, as it “would have been impossible for the
legislature to decide in what areas” and in respect of what subject matters (in that
case, factories and establishments) the provisions can apply. Crucially, it was held
that “a scheme of this kind, though very beneficent, could not be introduced in the
whole of the country all at once.”Further, held this court, such provisions may “need
careful experimentation have some times to be adopted by stages and in different
phases.”

</p><p id="p_199">90.    The theme of gradual implementation of law or legal principles, was also spo-
ken about in <a href="/doc/1572027/" id="a_372">Javed v. State of Haryana64</a> by this court, which held that there is no
constitutional imperative that a law or policy should be implemented all at once:
</p>            “16. A uniform policy may be devised by the Centre or by a State.
<p id="p_200">            However, there is no constitutional requirement that any such
            policy must be implemented at one go. Policies are capable of
            being implemented in a phased manner. More so, when the policies
            have far-reaching implications and are dynamic in nature, their
            implementation in a phased manner is welcome for it receives
            gradual willing acceptance and invites lesser resistance.”

Similar observations were made in <a href="/doc/1494202/" id="a_373">Pannalal Bansilal Pitti v. State of A.P</a>.65 where the
court held that imposition of a uniform law, in some areas, or subjects may be
counterproductive and contrary to public purpose. Sabanayagam (supra) too
emphasized discretion to extend an enactment, having regard to the time, area of
operation, and its applicability when it was emphasized that such power is “limited
and almost ministerial function as an agent of the principal Legislature applying the
Act to the area at an appropriate time”
</p><p id="p_201">91.    The close proximity, or inter-relatedness of personal guarantors with corporate
debtors, as opposed to individuals and partners in firms was noted by the report of the
Working Group, which remarked that it:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_84">            “recognizes that dynamics, the interwoven connection between the
            corporate debtor and a guarantor (who has extended his personal
            guarantee for the corporate debtor) and the partnership firms en-
            gaged in business activities may be on distinct footing in reality,
            and would, therefore, require different treatment, because of eco-
            nomic considerations. Assets of the guarantor would be relevant for
            the resolution process of the corporate debtor. Between the finan-</blockquote>
<p id="p_202">            cial creditor and the corporate debtor, mostly the guarantee would
            contain a covenant that as between the guarantor and the financial
            creditor, the guarantor is also a principal debtor, notwithstanding
            that he is guarantor to a corporate debtor.”

<p id="p_204">92.    As noticed earlier, <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_374">Section 60</a> had previously, under the original Code,
designated the NCLT as the adjudicating authority in relation to two categories:
corporate debtors and personal guarantors to corporate debtors. The 2018 amendment
added another category: corporate guarantors to corporate debtors. The amendment
seen in the background of the report, as indeed the scheme of the Code (i.e., <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_375">Section 2</a>
</p><p id="p_205">(e), <a href="/doc/931937/" id="a_376">Section 5</a> (22), <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_377">Section 29A</a>, and <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_378">Section 60</a>), clearly show that all matters that
were likely to impact, or have a bearing on a corporate debtor’s insolvency process,
were sought to be clubbed together and brought before the same forum. <a href="/doc/931937/" id="a_379">Section 5</a>
(22) which is found in Part II (insolvency process provisions in respect of corporate
debtors) as it was originally, defined personal guarantor to say that it“means an indi-
vidual who is the surety in a contract of guarantee to a corporate debtor.” There are
two more provisions relevant for the purpose of this judgment. They are Sections 234
and 235 of the Code; they read as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_85">          “234. (1) The Central Government may enter into an agreement
          with the Government of any country outside India for enforcing the
          provisions of this Code.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_86">          (2) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official
          Gazette, direct that the application of provisions of this Code in re-
          lation to assets or property of corporate debtor or debtor, including
          a personal guarantor of a corporate debtor, as the case may be, sit-
          uated at any place in a country outside India with which reciprocal
          arrangements have been made, shall be subject to such conditions
          as may be specified.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_87">          235. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Code or any
          law for the time being in force if, in the course of insolvency reso-
          lution process, or liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings, as the
          case may be, under this Code, the resolution professional, liquida-
          tor or bankruptcy trustee, as the case may be, is of the opinion that
          assets of the corporate debtor or debtor, including a personal
          guarantor of a corporate debtor, are situated in a country outside
          India with which reciprocal arrangements have been made under
          <a href="/doc/1677975/" id="a_380">section 234</a>, he may make an application to the Adjudicating Au-
          thority that evidence or action relating to such assets is required in
          connection with such process or proceeding.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_88">          (2) The Adjudicating Authority on receipt of an application under
          sub-section (1) and, on being satisfied that evidence or action re-
          lating to assets under sub-section (1) is required in connection with
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">                                            69</span>

          insolvency resolution process or liquidation or bankruptcy pro-
          ceeding, may issue a letter of request to a court or an authority of
          such country competent to deal with such request.”

</blockquote><p id="p_206">93.   These two provisions also reveal that the scheme of the Code always
contemplated that overseas assets of a corporate debtor or its personal guarantor
could be dealt with in an identical manner during insolvency proceedings, including
by issuing letters of request to courts or authorities in other countries for the purpose
of dealing with such assets located within their jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_207">94.   The impugned notification operationalizes the Code so far as it relates to
personal guarantors to corporate debtors:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_89">      (1) <a href="/doc/161182168/" id="a_381">Section 79</a> pertains to the definitional section for the purposes of
      insolvency resolution and bankruptcy for individuals before the Adjudicating
      Authority.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_90">       (2) <a href="/doc/117865296/" id="a_382">Section 94</a> to <a href="/doc/1929180/" id="a_383">187</a> outline the entire structure regarding initiation of the
      resolution process for individuals before the Adjudicating Authority.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_208">95.    The impugned notification authorises the Central Government and the Board
to frame rules and regulations on how to allow the pending actions against a personal
guarantor to a corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority. The intent of the
notification, facially, is to allow for pending proceedings to be adjudicated in terms of
the Code. <a href="/doc/162878528/" id="a_384">Section 243</a>, which provides for the repeal of the personal insolvency laws
has not as yet been notified. <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_385">Section 60(2)</a> prescribes that in the event of an ongoing
resolution process or liquidation process against a corporate debtor, an application for
resolution process or bankruptcy of the personal guarantor to the corporate debtor
shall be filed with the concerned NCLT seized of the resolution process or
liquidation. Therefore, the Adjudicating Authority for personal guarantors will be the
NCLT, if a parallel resolution process or liquidation process is pending in respect of a
corporate debtor for whom the guarantee is given. The same logic prevails, under
<a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_386">Section 60(3)</a>, when any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding pending against the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                          70</span>

personal guarantor in a court or tribunal and a resolution process or liquidation is
initiated against the corporate debtor. Thus if A, an individual is the subject of a
resolution process before the DRT and he has furnished a personal guarantee for a
debt owed by a company B, in the event a resolution process is initiated against B in
an NCLT, the provision results in transferring the proceedings going on against A in
the DRT to NCLT.
</p>
<p id="p_209">96.    This court in V. Ramakrishnan (supra), noticed why an application under
<a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_387">Section 60(2)</a> could not be allowed. At that stage, neither Part III of the Code nor
<a href="/doc/162878528/" id="a_388">Section 243</a> had not been notified. This meant that proceedings against personal
guarantors stood outside the NCLT and the Code. The non-obstante provision under
<a href="/doc/1060416/" id="a_389">Section 238</a> gives the Code overriding effect over other prevailing enactments. This
is perhaps the rationale for not notifying <a href="/doc/162878528/" id="a_390">Section 243</a> as far as personal guarantors to
corporate persons are concerned. <a href="/doc/162878528/" id="a_391">Section 243(2)</a> saves pending proceedings under
the Acts repealed (PIA and PTI Act) to be undertaken in accordance with those
enactments. As of now, <a href="/doc/162878528/" id="a_392">Section 243</a> has not been notified. In the event <a href="/doc/162878528/" id="a_393">Section 243</a> is
notified and those two Acts repealed, then, the present notification would not have
had the effect of covering pending proceedings against individuals, such as personal
guarantors in other forums, and would bring them under the provisions of the Code
pertaining to insolvency and bankruptcy of personal guarantors. The impugned
notification, as a consequence of the non obstante clause in <a href="/doc/1060416/" id="a_394">Section 238</a>, has the
result that if any proceeding were to be initiated against personal guarantors it would
be under the Code.
</p>
<p id="p_210">97.    In the opinion of this court, there was sufficient legislative guidance for the
Central Government, before the amendment of 2018 was made effective, to
distinguish and classify personal guarantors separately from other individuals. This is
evident from <a href="/doc/931937/" id="a_395">Sections 5(22)</a>, <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_396">60</a>, <a href="/doc/1677975/" id="a_397">234</a>, <a href="/doc/1817248/" id="a_398">235</a> and unamended <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_399">Section 60</a>. In V.
Ramakrishnan (supra) this court noted the effect of various provisions of the Code,
and how they applied to personal guarantors:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                 71</span>

<p id="p_211">“22. We are afraid that such arguments have to be turned down on
a careful reading of the sections relied upon. Section 60 of the
Code, in sub-section (1) thereof, refers to insolvency resolution and
liquidation for both corporate debtors and personal guarantors,
the adjudicating authority for which shall be the National
Company Law Tribunal, having territorial jurisdiction over the
place where the registered office of the corporate person is located.
This sub-section is only important in that it locates the Tribunal
which has territorial jurisdiction in insolvency resolution processes
against corporate debtors. So far as personal guarantors are
concerned, we have seen that Part III has not been brought into
force, and neither has <a href="/doc/162878528/" id="a_400">Section 243</a>, which repeals the <a href="/doc/1622833/" id="a_401">Presidency
Towns Insolvency Act</a>, 1909 and the <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_402">Provincial Insolvency Act</a>,
1920. The net result of this is that so far as individual personal
guarantors are concerned, they will continue to be proceeded
against under the aforesaid two <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_403">Insolvency Act</a>s and not under the
Code. Indeed, by a Press Release dated 28-8-2017, the
Government of India, through the Ministry of Finance, cautioned
that Section 243 of the Code, which provides for the repeal of the
said enactments, has not been notified till date, and further, that the
provisions relating to insolvency resolution and bankruptcy for
individuals and partnerships as contained in Part III of the Code
are yet to be notified. Hence, it was advised that stakeholders who
intend to pursue their insolvency cases may approach the
appropriate authority/court under the existing enactments, instead
of approaching the Debts Recovery Tribunals.
</p>
<p id="p_212">23. It is for this reason that sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_404">Section 60</a> speaks of
an application relating to the “bankruptcy” of a personal
guarantor of a corporate debtor and states that any such
bankruptcy proceedings shall be filed only before the National
Company Law Tribunal. The argument of the learned counsel on
behalf of the respondents that “bankruptcy” would
include SARFAESI proceedings must be turned down as
“bankruptcy” has reference only to the two <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_405">Insolvency Act</a>s
referred to above. Thus, SARFAESI proceedings against the
guarantor can continue under the <a href="/doc/52229129/" id="a_406">SARFAESI Act</a>. Similarly, sub-
section (3) speaks of a bankruptcy proceeding of a personal
guarantor of the corporate debtor pending in any court or tribunal,
which shall stand transferred to the adjudicating authority dealing
with the insolvency resolution process or liquidation proceedings
of such corporate debtor. An “Adjudicating Authority”, defined
under Section 5(1) of the Code, means the National Company Law
Tribunal constituted under the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_407">Companies Act</a>, 2013.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                          72</span>

<p id="p_213">          24. The scheme of <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_408">Sections 60(2)</a> and (3) is thus clear — the
          moment there is a proceeding against the corporate debtor pending
          under the 2016 Code, any bankruptcy proceeding against the
          individual personal guarantor will, if already initiated before the
          proceeding against the corporate debtor, be transferred to the
          National Company Law Tribunal or, if initiated after such
          proceedings had been commenced against the corporate debtor, be
          filed only in the National Company Law Tribunal. However, the
          Tribunal is to decide such proceedings only in accordance with the
          <a href="/doc/1622833/" id="a_409">Presidency Towns Insolvency Act</a>, 1909 or the <a href="/doc/393016/" id="a_410">Provincial
          Insolvency Act</a>, 1920, as the case may be. It is clear that sub-
          section (4), which states that the Tribunal shall be vested with all
          the powers of the Debts Recovery Tribunal, as contemplated under
          Part III of this Code, for the purposes of sub-section (2), would not
          take effect, as the Debts Recovery Tribunal has not yet been
          empowered to hear bankruptcy proceedings against individuals
          under Section 179 of the Code, as the said Section has not yet been
          brought into force. Also, we have seen that <a href="/doc/52000033/" id="a_411">Section 249</a>, dealing
          with the consequential amendment of the <a href="/doc/79851569/" id="a_412">Recovery of Debts Act</a> to
          empower Debts Recovery Tribunals to try such proceedings, has
          also not been brought into force. It is thus clear that <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_413">Section 2(e)</a>,
          which was brought into force on 23-11-2017 would, when it refers
          to the application of the Code to a personal guarantor of a
          corporate debtor, apply only for the limited purpose contained in
          <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_414">Sections 60(2)</a> and (3), as stated hereinabove. This is what is meant
          by strengthening the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process in
          the Statement of Objects of the Amendment Act, 2018.”

</p><p id="p_214">98.    This court was clearly cognizant of the fact that the amendment, in so far as it
inserted <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_415">Section 2(e)</a> and altered <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_416">Section 60(2)</a>, was aimed at strengthening the
corporate insolvency process. At the same time, since the Code was not made
applicable to individuals (including personal guarantors), the court had no occasion to
consider what would be the effect of exercise of power under Section 1(3) of the
Code, bringing into force such provisions in relation to personal guarantors.
</p>
<p id="p_215">99.    The argument that the insolvency processes, application of moratorium and
other provisions are incongruous, and so on, in the opinion of this court, are
insubstantial. The insolvency process in relation to corporate persons (a
compendious term covering all juristic entities which have been described in <a href="/doc/831280/" id="a_417">Sections
2</a> [a] to [d] of the Code) is entirely different from those relating to individuals; the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                                          73</span>

former is covered in the provisions of Part II and the latter, by Part III. <a href="/doc/941332/" id="a_418">Section 179</a>,
which defines what the Adjudicating authority is for individuals 66 is “subject to”
<a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_419">Section 60</a>. <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_420">Section 60(2)</a> is without prejudice to <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_421">Section 60(1)</a> and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Code, thus giving overriding effect to
<a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_422">Section 60(2)</a> as far as it provides that the application relating to insolvency
resolution, liquidation or bankruptcy of personal guarantors of such corporate debtors
shall be filed before the NCLT where proceedings relating to corporate debtors are
pending. Furthermore, <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_423">Section 60(3)</a> provides for transfer of proceedings relating to
personal guarantors to that NCLT which is dealing with the proceedings against
corporate debtors. After providing for a common adjudicating forum, <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_424">Section 60(4)</a>
vests the NCLT &quot;with all the powers of the DRT as contemplated under Part III of
this Code for the purpose of sub-section (2)&quot;. <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_425">Section 60</a> (4) thus (a) vests all the
powers of DRT with NCLT and (b) also vests NCLT with powers under Part III.
Parliament therefore merged the provisions of Part III with the process undertaken
against the corporate debtors under Part II, for the purpose of <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_426">Section 60(2)</a>, i.e.,
proceedings against personal guarantors along with corporate debtors. <a href="/doc/941332/" id="a_427">Section 179</a> is
the corresponding provision in Part III. It is &quot;subject to the provisions of <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_428">Section 60</a>&quot;.
<a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_429">Section 60</a> (4) clearly incorporates the provisions of Part III in relation to proceedings
before the NCLT against personal guarantors.
</p>
<p id="p_216">100.      It is clear from the above analysis that Parliamentary intent was to treat
personal guarantors differently from other categories of individuals. The intimate
connection between such individuals and corporate entities to whom they stood

guarantee, as well as the possibility of two separate processes being carried on in
different forums, with its attendant uncertain outcomes, led to carving out personal
guarantors as a separate species of individuals, for whom the Adjudicating authority
was common with the corporate debtor to whom they had stood guarantee. The fact
that the process of insolvency in Part III is to be applied to individuals, whereas the
process in relation to corporate debtors, set out in Part II is to be applied to such
corporate persons, does not lead to incongruity. On the other hand, there appear to be
sound reasons why the forum for adjudicating insolvency processes – the provisions
of which are disparate- is to be common, i.e through the NCLT. As was emphasized
during the hearing, the NCLT would be able to consider the whole picture, as it were,
about the nature of the assets available, either during the corporate debtor’s
insolvency process, or even later; this would facilitate the CoC in framing realistic
plans, keeping in mind the prospect of realizing some part of the creditors’ dues from
personal guarantors.
</p>
<p id="p_222">101.   In view of the above discussion, it is held that the impugned notification is not
an instance of legislative exercise, or amounting to impermissible and selective
application of provisions of the Code. There is no compulsion in the Code that it
should, at the same time, be made applicable to all individuals, (including personal
guarantors) or not at all. There is sufficient indication in the Code- by <a href="/doc/1089645/" id="a_432">Section 2(e)</a>,
<a href="/doc/931937/" id="a_433">Section 5(22)</a>, <a href="/doc/1426985/" id="a_434">Section 60</a> and <a href="/doc/941332/" id="a_435">Section 179</a> indicating that personal guarantors, though
forming part of the larger grouping of individuals, were to be, in view of their
intrinsic connection with corporate debtors, dealt with differently, through the same
adjudicatory process and by the same forum (though not insolvency provisions) as
such corporate debtors. The notifications under <a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_436">Section 1(3)</a>, (issued before the
impugned notification was issued) disclose that the Code was brought into force in
stages, regard being had to the categories of persons to whom its provisions were to
be applied. The impugned notification, similarly inter alia makes the provisions of
the Code applicable in respect of personal guarantors to corporate debtors, as another
such category of persons to whom the Code has been extended. It is held that the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                             75</span>

impugned notification was issued within the power granted by Parliament, and in
valid exercise of it. The exercise of power in issuing the impugned notification under
<a href="/doc/1095847/" id="a_437">Section 1(3)</a> is therefore, not ultra vires; the notification is valid.
</p>
<p id="p_223">102.    The other question which parties had urged before this court was that the
impugned notification, by applying the Code to personal guarantors only, takes away
the protection afforded by law; reference was made to <a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_438">Sections 128</a>, <a href="/doc/129666/" id="a_439">133</a> and <a href="/doc/1769901/" id="a_440">140</a> of
the Contract Act; the petitioners submitted that once a resolution plan is accepted, the
corporate debtor is discharged of liability. As a consequence, the guarantor whose
liability is co-extensive with the principal debtor, i.e. the corporate debtor, too is
discharged of all liabilities. It was urged therefore, that the impugned notification
which has the effect of allowing proceedings before the NCLT by applying provisions
of Part III of the Code, deprives the guarantors of their valuable substantive rights.
</p>
<p id="p_224">103. Section 31 of the Code, inter alia, provides that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_91">          “31. (1) If the Adjudicating Authority is satisfied that the resolution
          plan as approved by the committee of creditors under sub-section

          regards future transactions.

          of such security or not; and if the creditor loses, or, without the
          consent of the surety, parts with such security, the surety is
          discharged to the extent of the value of the security.”

</blockquote><p id="p_226">104.     All creditors and other classes of claimants, including financial and
operational creditors, those entitled to statutory dues, workers, etc., who participate in
the resolution process, are heard and those in relation to whom the CoC accepts or
rejects pleas, are entitled to vent their grievances before the NCLT. After considering
their submissions and objections, the resolution plan is accepted and approved. This
results in finality as to the claims of creditors, and others, from the company (i.e. the
company which undergoes the insolvency process). The question which the
petitioners urge is that in view of this finality, their liabilities would be extinguished;
they rely on <a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_444">Sections 128</a>, <a href="/doc/129666/" id="a_445">133</a> and <a href="/doc/1769901/" id="a_446">140</a> of the Contract Act to urge that creditors
cannot therefore, proceed against them separately.

<p id="p_227">105.    <a href="/doc/188716489/" id="a_447">In Vijay Kumar Jain v. Standard Chartered Bank67</a>, this court, while dealing
with the right of erstwhile directors participating in meetings of Committee of
Creditors observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_101">           “we find that Section 31(1) of the Code would make it clear that
           such members of the erstwhile Board of Directors, who are often
           guarantors, are vitally interested in a resolution plan as such
           resolution plan then binds them. Such plan may scale down the
           debt of the principal debtor, resulting in scaling down the debt of
           the guarantor as well, or it may not. The resolution plan may also
           scale down certain debts and not others, leaving guarantors of the
           latter kind of debts exposed for the entire amount of the debt. The
           regulations also make it clear that these persons are vitally
           interested in resolution plans as they affect them”

</blockquote><p id="p_228">106. The rationale for allowing directors to participate in meetings of the CoC is
that the directors’ liability as personal guarantors persists against the creditors and an
approved resolution plan can only lead to a revision of amount or exposure for the
entire amount. Any recourse under <a href="/doc/129666/" id="a_448">Section 133</a> of the Contract Act to discharge the
liability of the surety on account of variance in terms of the contract, without her or
his consent, stands negated by this court, in V. Ramakrishnan where it was observed
that the language of <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_449">Section 31</a> makes it clear that the approved plan is binding on the
guarantor, to avoid any attempt to escape liability under the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_450">Contract Act</a>. It was observed that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">           “25. <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_451">Section 31(1)</a>, in fact, makes it clear that the guarantor
           cannot escape payment as the resolution plan, which has been
           approved, may well include provisions as to payments to be made
           by such guarantor.…”

And further that:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_103">           “26.1 <a href="/doc/1728676/" id="a_452">Section 14</a> refers only to debts due by corporate debtors,
           who are limited liability companies, and it is clear that in the vast
           majority of cases, personal guarantees are given by Directors who
           are in management of the companies. The object of the Code is not
           to allow such guarantors to escape from an independent and co-</blockquote>

            why <a href="/doc/1728676/" id="a_453">Section 14</a> is not applied to them. However, insofar as firms
            and individuals are concerned, guarantees are given in respect of
            individual debts by persons who have unlimited liability to pay
            them. And such guarantors may be complete strangers to the
            debtor — often it could be a personal friend. It is for this reason
            that the moratorium mentioned in <a href="/doc/132563140/" id="a_454">Section 101</a> would cover such
            persons, as such moratorium is in relation to the debt and not the
            debtor.”

Gupta68</a> (the “Essar Steel case”) this court refused to interfere with proceedings
initiated to enforce personal guarantees by financial creditors; it was observed as

<blockquote id="blockquote_105">            “106. Following this judgment in V. Ramakrishnan case [SBI v. V.
            Ramakrishnan, (2018) 17 SCC 394], it is difficult to accept Shri
            Rohatgi&#x27;s argument that that part of the resolution plan which
            states that the claims of the guarantor on account of subrogation
            shall be extinguished, cannot be applied to the guarantees
            furnished by the erstwhile Directors of the corporate debtor. So far
            as the present case is concerned, we hasten to add that we are
            saying nothing which may affect the pending litigation on account
            of invocation of these guarantees. However, NCLAT judgment being
            contrary to Section 31(1) of the Code and this Court&#x27;s judgment

</blockquote><p id="p_230">108. It is therefore, clear that the sanction of a resolution plan and finality imparted
to it by <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_456">Section 31</a> does not per se operate as a discharge of the guarantor’s liability.
As to the nature and extent of the liability, much would depend on the terms of the
guarantee itself. However, this court has indicated, time and again, that an
involuntary act of the principal debtor leading to loss of security, would not absolve a
guarantor of its liability. In Maharashtra State Electricity Board (supra) the liability
of the guarantor (in a case where liability of the principal debtor was discharged
under the insolvency law or the company law), was considered. It was held that in
view of the unequivocal guarantee, such liability of the guarantor continues and the

<p id="p_231">creditor can realize the same from the guarantor in view of the language of <a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_457">Section
128</a> of the Contract Act as there is no discharge under <a href="/doc/1029885/" id="a_458">Section 134</a> of that Act. This
court observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_106">            “7. Under the bank guarantee in question the Bank has undertaken
            to pay the Electricity Board any sum up to Rs 50,000 and in order
            to realise it all that the Electricity Board has to do is to make a de-
            mand. Within forty-eight hours of such demand the Bank has to pay
            the amount to the Electricity Board which is not under any obliga-
            tion to prove any default on the part of the Company in liquidation
            before the amount demanded is paid. The Bank cannot raise the
            plea that it is liable only to the extent of any loss that may have
            been sustained by the Electricity Board owing to any default on the
            part of the supplier of goods i.e. the Company in liquidation. The
            liability is absolute and unconditional. The fact that the Company
            in liquidation i.e. the principal debtor has gone into liquidation
            also would not have any effect on the liability of the Bank i.e. the
            guarantor. Under <a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_459">Section 128</a> of the Indian Contract Act, the lia-
            bility of the surety is coextensive with that of the principal debtor
            unless it is otherwise provided by the contract. A surety is no doubt
            discharged under <a href="/doc/1029885/" id="a_460">Section 134</a> of the Indian Contract Act by any
            contract between the creditor and the principal debtor by which
            the principal debtor is released or by any act or omission of the
            creditor, the legal consequence of which is the discharge of the
            principal debtor. But a discharge which the principal debtor may
            secure by operation of law in bankruptcy (or in liquidation pro-
            ceedings in the case of a company) does not absolve the surety of
            his liability (see <a href="/doc/1845651/" id="a_461">Jagannath Ganeshram Agarwala v. Shivnarayan

Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Cannanore Spg. &amp; Wvg. Mills Ltd. 69An earlier decision of
three judges, <a href="/doc/849832/" id="a_462">Punjab National Bank v. State of U.P</a>.70 pertains to the issues regarding
a guarantor and the principal debtor. The court observed as follows:

            the Industries (Development and <a href="/doc/1489134/" id="a_463">Regulation) Act</a>, advanced some
            money to the said Respondent 4. In respect of the advance so made,

principal borrower being unable to pay the same.
</blockquote><p id="p_233">Subsequently, Respondent 3 which had taken over the management
of Respondent 4 became sick and proceedings were initiated under
the <a href="/doc/1044174/" id="a_464">Sick Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act</a>, 1974 (for short
‘the Act’). The appellant filed suit for recovery against the
guarantors and the principal debtor of the amount claimed by it.
The following preliminary issue was, on the pleadings of the
parties, framed:
</p><p id="p_234">‘Whether the claim of the plaintiff is not maintainable in view of
the provisions of Act 57 of 1974 as alleged in para 25 of the written
statement of Defendant 2?’
The trial court as well as the High Court, both came to the
conclusion that in view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/1818467/" id="a_465">Section 29</a> of the Act,
the suit of the appellant was not maintainable.
</p><p id="p_235">We have gone through the provisions of the said Act and in our
opinion the decision of the courts below is not correct. <a href="/doc/931937/" id="a_466">Section 5</a> of
the said Act provides for the owner to be liable for certain prior
liabilities and <a href="/doc/1818467/" id="a_467">Section 29</a> states that the said Act will have an
overriding effect over all other enactments. <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_468">This Act</a> only deals
with the liabilities of a company which is nationalized and there is
no provision therein which in any way affects the liability of a
guarantor who is bound by the deed of guarantee executed by it.
The High Court has referred to a decision of this Court
in Maharashtra SEB v. Official Liquidator, High Court,
Ernakulam [(1982) 3 SCC 358 : AIR 1982 SC 1497] where the
liability of the guarantor in a case where liability of the principal
debtor was discharged under the insolvency law or the company
law, was considered. It was held in this case that in view of the
unequivocal guarantee such liability of the guarantor continues
and the creditor can realize the same from the guarantor in view of
the language of <a href="/doc/1377136/" id="a_469">Section 128</a> of the Contract Act as there is no
discharge under <a href="/doc/1029885/" id="a_470">Section 134</a> of that Act.
</p><p id="p_236">In our opinion, the principle of the aforesaid decision of this Court
is equally applicable in the present case. The right of the appellant
to recover money from Respondents 1, 2 and 3 who stood
guarantors arises out of the terms of the deed of guarantee which
are not in any way superseded or brought to a naught merely
because the appellant may not be able to recover money from the
principal borrower. It may here be added that even as a result of the
<a href="/doc/72652/" id="a_471">Nationalisation Act</a> the liability of the principal borrower does not
come to an end. It is only the mode of recovery which is referred to
in the said Act.”

</p><p id="p_237">110. In Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander Ltd. (supra) the UK Supreme Court re-
viewed a large number of previous authorities on the concept of double proof, i.e. re-
covery from guarantors in the context of insolvency proceedings. The court held that:
</p>

<blockquote id="blockquote_108">          &quot;The function of the rule is not to prevent a double proof of the
          same debt against two separate estates (that is what insolvency
          practitioners call &quot;double dip”). The rule prevents a double proof
          of what is in substance the same debt being made against the same
          estate, leading to the payment of a double dividend out of one
          estate. It is for that reason sometimes called the rule against
          double dividend. In the simplest case of suretyship (where the
          surety has neither given nor been provided with security, and has
          an unlimited liability) there is a triangle of rights and liabilities
          between the principal debtor (PD), the surety (S) and the creditor
          (C). PD has the primary obligation to C and a secondary
          obligation to indemnify S if and so far as S discharges PD&#x27;s
          liability, but if PD is insolvent S may not enforce that right in
          competition with C. S has an obligation to C to answer for PD&#x27;s
          liability, and the secondary right of obtaining an indemnity from
          PD. C can (after due notice) proceed against either or both of PD
          and S. If both PD and S are in insolvent liquidation, C can prove
          against each for 100p in the pound but may not recover more than
          100p in the pound in all.”


</blockquote><p id="p_238">111.   In view of the above discussion, it is held that approval of a resolution plan
does not ipso facto discharge a personal guarantor (of a corporate debtor) of her or his
liabilities under the contract of guarantee. As held by this court, the release or
discharge of a principal borrower from the debt owed by it to its creditor, by an
involuntary process, i.e. by operation of law, or due to liquidation or insolvency
proceeding, does not absolve the surety/guarantor of his or her liability, which arises
out of an independent contract.
</p>

<p id="p_239">112.   For the foregoing reasons, it is held that the impugned notification is legal and
valid. It is also held that approval of a resolution plan relating to a corporate debtor

does not operate so as to discharge the liabilities of personal guarantors (to corporate
debtors). The writ petitions, transferred cases and transfer petitions are accordingly
dismissed in the above terms, without order on costs.
