                              &#x27;proposed to be used&#x27; basis, which shows that Defendant
                              has not and cannot lay any claim of being a prior user. This
                              is also pointer to the fact that Defendant has recently
                              adopted the impugned mark, with a view to encash on the
                              formidable reputation and goodwill garnered by the
                              Plaintiff over two decades and is a dishonest adoption.

                                       Another v. Antox India P. Ltd</a>., 1990 Supp SCC 727, the
                                       Court observed that injunctions are normally granted when
                                       Defendant is yet to commence its enterprise. In the present
                                       case, the plaint is predicated on a quia timet action as there
                                       was a credible and imminent apprehension that Defendant
                                       may begin selling identical products under the impugned
                                       mark in Delhi, causing irreparable harm and injury to the
                                       Plaintiff.

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                A. the plaint deserves to be returned to the appropriate
                                       Court having jurisdiction as this Court lacks territorial
                                       jurisdiction to entertain the present suit. Plaintiff has
                                       combined two causes of action: (a) infringement of
                                       trademark and copyright; and (b) passing off. Plaintiff has
                                       claimed jurisdiction in the plaint on two grounds viz. (a)
                                       Plaintiff being the proprietor of the trademark and artistic
                                       work, is carrying on its business for gain within the
                                       territorial jurisdiction of this Court through its principal and
                                       registered office located at Delhi; and (b) Defendant has
                                       filed trademark applications with all-India effect, operating
                                       throughout the territory of India, including Delhi and
                                       therefore, there is imminent and credible apprehension that
                                       Defendant is likely to sell, distribute and market the
                                       impugned products in Delhi and/or expand his activities to
                                       Delhi and/or has dealings with traders from Delhi. Not a
                                       shred of evidence is placed on record to show that
                                       Defendant intends to launch the product under the impugned
                                       mark in Delhi. Defendant is located at Jodhpur, Rajasthan.

                              Parties are in liquor business, which is highly regulated and
                              no sales can be carried out without mandatory prior
                              approvals from the competent authorities and liquor license
                              for Delhi. The only material placed on record by the
                              Plaintiff are the photographs of the bottles, allegedly sold by
                              the Defendant and copies of trademark applications, which
                              have no relevance to the issue of territorial jurisdiction;
                          B. Plaintiff is a registered proprietor of the label mark only and
                              does not have registration in the word marks &#x27;DHOLA

                              MARU&#x27;/&#x27;                   &#x27;. The label mark, it is believed by
                              the Defendant, has never been used by the Plaintiff and even
                              along with the plaint no documents have been filed, to prove
                              otherwise. Thus, the trademark is liable to be cancelled for
                              non-use under <a href="/doc/1360925/" id="a_7">Section 47(2)</a> of the Act. Seen in this light, in
                              essence, the suit is a simpliciter suit for passing off and the
                              claim of infringement is a mere smokescreen, with no merit.
                              For conferring jurisdiction on this Court with respect to
                              passing off action, Plaintiff will be required to show that
                              Defendant has sold goods in Delhi. Nothing is placed on
                              record or specifically pleaded by the Plaintiff which
                              demonstrates sale of Defendant&#x27;s products within the
                              jurisdiction of this Court. Plaintiff itself has no sales in
                              Delhi, which is evident from the invoices placed on record.
                              Hence, I.A. 7206/2022 be allowed and plaint be returned to
                              the appropriate Court having jurisdiction;
                          C. without prejudice to the aforesaid stand, it was submitted
                              that Plaintiff only has registration in a label mark. When the
                              competing label mark is seen as a whole, it is clear that no

                              a descriptive mark has acquired a secondary meaning can
                              only be adjudicated after trial. During the prosecution of
                              Plaintiff&#x27;s label trademark, the Examiner of Trade Marks
                              had raised an objection under <a href="/doc/1549225/" id="a_10">Section 9</a> of the Act, which is
                              proof enough that the trademark is non-distinctive and can

                              law pertaining to labelling. Order dated 05.02.2022, issued
                              by the Excise Department of the State of Rajasthan, makes it
                              mandatory for caps and labels of country liquor bottles to be
                              restricted to blue and red colours, which connotes the
                              concentration of alcohol content for them to be recognisable
                              by the consumers and members of trade. Similarly, there are
                              restrictions with respect to the labels used on the bottles,
                              which explains why Defendant has adopted the colour

                              two products with the impugned marks and this is also

                          examined their rival contentions.
</p><p id="p_31">                          11.      Since an objection has been raised to the territorial jurisdiction
                          of this Court, it is imperative to decide the application filed by the
                          Defendant under Order VII Rule 10 CPC, before proceeding to
                          examine the application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 CPC. The
                          jurisdiction of this Court is questioned by the Defendant on two-fold
                          grounds. In respect of the claim for infringement, it is the contention
                          of the Defendant that no evidence has been placed on record by the
                          Plaintiff to support the alleged imminent threat or apprehension that
                          Defendant intends to launch his product in Delhi. Parties being in
                          liquor business, the sales are regulated and cannot be carried out
                          without mandatory excise approvals etc. Therefore, no cause of action
                          for infringement lies before this Court. With respect to passing off, it
                          is urged that the invoices produced in the plaint show that the
                          Plaintiff&#x27;s factory is located in Rajasthan with no sales in Delhi and
                          nothing is placed on record or pleaded by the Plaintiff to demonstrate
                          sales of Defendant&#x27;s products, within the jurisdiction of this Court.
                          There is no pleading with respect to specific targeting of customers in
                          Delhi.

                          The Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">                                &quot;20. We have also wondered whether owing to the statement
                                aforesaid of the respondent / defendant, of not intending to market
                                the product in India, the territorial jurisdiction of this Court,
                                otherwise invoked in accordance with law, can be ousted. We are
                                unable to find any basis for holding that though on the basis of
                                averments in the plaint, this Court will have territorial jurisdiction,
                                the same can be ousted on the statement of the respondent /
                                defendant of not doing / intending to do act, to prevent which suit is
                                filed, within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. We are of the
                                opinion that once the appellants / plaintiffs have pleaded
                                apprehension of sale / marketing in Delhi, the Courts in Delhi would
                                have jurisdiction to entertain the suit and such jurisdiction cannot be
                                ousted by the defendant by making a statement not to do any such
                                act in Delhi, though the defendant would be entitled to prove that
                                there is no basis for such apprehension. If such a course of action
                                were to be permitted, it would enable a defendant to avoid action in
                                a particular Court by making such a statement and indulge in forum
                                shopping. We also find that the same was not permitted by this Court
                                in Rana Steels Vs. Ran India Steels Pvt. Ltd. (2008) 37 PTC 24
                                (Del); there, though the counsel for the defendant stated that the
                                defendant had no intention to sell its products in Delhi, it was held
                                that the plaint could not be ordered to be returned on the basis of the
                                said statement. Though the matter was taken in appeal by way of
                                FAO(OS) 212/2008 but was compromised.&quot;

                          OnLine Del 177, the learned Single Judge of this Court observed that
                          a threat of selling the offending goods in Delhi would itself confer
                          jurisdiction in the Courts in Delhi to entertain a suit claiming
                          injunction in respect thereof. Whether a threat perspective is justified
                          or not, is a matter which has to be considered and decided upon in an
                          application filed by the Plaintiff under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2
                          CPC or on merits when the suit is taken up for disposal. Insofar as
                          Order VII Rule 10 CPC is concerned, taking whatever is stated in the
                          plaint is correct, one would have to assume that the threat or intention
                          of the Defendant to sell or offer for sale the offending goods in Delhi,
                          is correct. <a href="/doc/474885/" id="a_33">In Exphar SA and Another v. Eupharma Laboratories

                          while considering an application, where issue of territorial jurisdiction
                          is raised, only the plaint needs to be seen on a plain demurrer and the
                          allegations or averments are to be taken as correct. In order to succeed
                          in the objection to the jurisdiction, Defendant must demonstrate that
                          granted the averments made in plaint, Court does not have territorial

                                &quot;14. Considering the very language of <a href="/doc/999236/" id="a_45">Section 62</a> of the
                                Copyright Act and <a href="/doc/969470/" id="a_46">Section 134</a> of the Trade Marks Act, an
                                additional forum has been provided by including a District
                                Court within whose limits the plaintiff actually and voluntarily
                                resides or carries on business or personally works for gain.
                                The object of the provisions was to enable the plaintiff to
                                institute a suit at a place where he or they resided or carried
                                on business, not to enable them to drag the defendant further
                                away from such a place also as is being done in the instant
                                cases. In our opinion, the expression &quot;notwithstanding
                                anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure&quot; does not
                                oust the applicability of the provisions of Section 20 of the
                                Code of Civil Procedure and it is clear that additional remedy
                                has been provided to the plaintiff so as to file a suit where he is
                                residing or carrying on business, etc. as the case may be.
                                Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure enables a plaintiff to
                                file a suit where the defendant resides or where cause of action
                                arose. <a href="/doc/698400/" id="a_47">Section 20(a)</a> and <a href="/doc/698400/" id="a_48">Section 20(b)</a> usually provides the
                                venue where the defendant or any of them resides, carries on
                                business or personally works for gain. Section 20(c) of the
                                Code of Civil Procedure enables a plaintiff to institute a suit
                                where the cause of action wholly or in part, arises. The
                                Explanation to Section 20 CPC has been added to the effect
                                that corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its
                                sole or principal office in India or in respect of any cause of
                                action arising at any place where it has subordinate office at
                                such place. Thus, &quot;corporation&quot; can be sued at a place having
                                its sole or principal office and where cause of action wholly or
                                in part, arises at a place where it has also a subordinate office
                                at such place.

                                the plaintiff has a choice of forum to institute a suit. The
                                intendment of the Explanation to Section 20 of the Code of
                                Civil Procedure is that once the corporation has a subordinate
                                office in the place where the cause of action arises wholly or in
                                part, it cannot be heard to say that it cannot be sued there
                                because it did not carry on business at that place. The linking
                                of the place with the cause of action in the Explanation where
                                subordinate office of the corporation is situated is reflective of
                                the intention of the legislature and such a place has to be the
                                place of the filing of the suit and not the principal place of
                                business. Ordinarily the suit has to be filed at the place where

                                which the latter provisions have been enacted, it is clear that if
                                a cause of action has arisen wholly or in part, where the
                                plaintiff is residing or having its principal office/carries on
                                business or personally works for gain, the suit can be filed at
                                such place(s). The plaintiff(s) can also institute a suit at a
                                place where he is residing, carrying on business or personally
                                works for gain dehors the fact that the cause of action has not
                                arisen at a place where he/they are residing or any one of them
                                is residing, carries on business or personally works for gain.
                                However, this right to institute suit at such a place has to be
                                read subject to certain restrictions, such as in case the plaintiff
                                is residing or carrying on business at a particular
                                place/having its head office and at such place cause of action
                                has also arisen wholly or in part, the plaintiff cannot ignore
                                such a place under the guise that he is carrying on business at
                                other far-flung places also. The very intendment of the

                                provisions has to be such which prevents the mischief of

                                removed the embargo of suing at place of accrual of cause of

                                that the impediment imposed under Section 20 CPC to a

                                cannot be interpreted in the manner that it has authorised the

                                the backdrop of the observations in Dhodha House (supra), the
                                appellant/plaintiff carries on business in Deogarh, Jharkhand. It

                                the appellant/plaintiff cannot sue the defendants/respondents in
                                Delhi in view of the decision in Sanjay Dalia (supra). Thus, this
                                court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
                                And, on this count, the decision of the learned single judge cannot be
                                faulted. But, the suit ought not to have been dismissed. As this court

                          action were similar to the present case. In the context of the pleadings
                          therein, after examining the plea of jurisdiction, the Division Bench
                          held as follows, which in my view, covers the case of the Plaintiff in
                          entirety:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                                &quot;21. In paragraph 27, the purported cause of action is with regard
                                to the sale of the respondent&#x27;s product in the State of Andhra
                                Pradesh. In paragraph 28, however, while making the averments
                                with regard to territorial jurisdiction, the plea of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_70">Section 134(2)</a> and
                                <a href="/doc/1987046/" id="a_71">Section 62(2)</a> of the Trade Marks Act and the Copyrights Act,
                                respectively, has also been taken. It is, however, stated that the scale
                                of the business activity of the defendant is not known and that &quot;it is
                                apprehended as being highly likely that the product sold under the
                                impugned mark &#x27;Regular Choice&#x27; will be made available in New
                                Delhi&quot;. It is further alleged that there is a strong apprehension that
                                the respondents will launch the impugned product in New Delhi and
                                would be available within the jurisdiction of this court. Furthermore,
                                it is averred that the threat that the respondent/defendant would sell
                                and or offer for sale the impugned product within the jurisdiction of
                                this court is both credible and imminent. It is clearly stated that this
                                apprehension on the part of the plaintiff constituted a substantial
                                and integral part of the cause of action which, according to the
                                appellant/plaintiff, accrued within the jurisdiction of this court. And,

                                therefore, it was pleaded that this court would have territorial
                                jurisdiction by virtue of Section 20 CPC also.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">                                22. Now, if all these averments in the plaint are taken to be correct,
                                it would mean that there is a reasonable and credible apprehension
                                that the impugned product would be launched and sold in New
                                Delhi. These are the ingredients for a quia timet action. In other
                                words, they constitute the cause of action for instituting a suit in the
                                nature of a quia timet action. It is in this backdrop that we feel that
                                the learned single Judge has fallen into error when he has prima
                                facie taken the view that no part of the cause of action has occurred
                                in Delhi. Just because the respondent/defendant had been selling the
                                product under the impugned mark in Andhra Pradesh does not mean
                                that when there is an imminent threat of the respondent/defendant
                                launching and selling the same product under the same mark in
                                Delhi, no cause of action, based on such apprehension, could arise.
                                Clearly, the apprehension of the respondent launching its product
                                under the impugned trade mark in Delhi, on a demurrer, would
                                constitute cause of action or at least a part of the cause of action.
                                Therefore, independent of the fact that as to where the
                                appellant&#x27;s/plaintiff&#x27;s registered office or subordinate office was
                                located, under section 20(c) of the CPC itself, this court would have
                                territorial jurisdiction because part of the cause of action had arisen
                                in Delhi as per the plaint.&quot;

                          selling the products in Delhi; (b) pan-India application by the
                          Defendant for trademark registrations; (c) principal place of business

                          alcohol business since the year 1988 i.e. roughly over three and a half

                          decades. The trademarks &#x27;                         &#x27;/DHOLA MAARU, as
                          per the averment in the plaint, were adopted in the year 2004, for a
                          range of country liquor and have been continuously, uninterruptedly
                          and openly used commercially in connection with the liquor trade. It is
                          undisputed that Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the trademark

                          &#x27;                   &#x27; (label) only, in class 33, while applications for

                          there cannot be a speck of doubt that being a registered proprietor of
                          the label mark, Plaintiff has an exclusive right to use it and to protect
                          the mark from infringement by an unauthorized and illegal user.
</p><p id="p_51">                          20.   <a href="/doc/202028/" id="a_77">Section 29</a> of the Act provides that a registered trademark is
                          infringed by a person, who not being a registered proprietor or a
                          person using by way of permitted use, in the course of trade, uses a
                          mark, which is identical with or deceptively similar to the registered
                          trademark, in respect of the goods or services which are identical or
                          similar. The question, therefore, that needs to be considered is whether
                          the claim for infringement, made by the Plaintiff against the
                          Defendant is justified. It is an undisputed fact that the registered
                          trademark of the Plaintiff in question is a label mark and the Plaintiff

                          does not have registration in the marks &#x27;                        / DHOLA
                          MAARU&#x27; (words per se). It is in this backdrop that Defendant urges
                          that Plaintiff cannot lay a claim of infringement of word mark

                          &#x27;                &#x27;, in the absence of a separate registration.

                          the rule of anti-dissection and stated that the Courts while dealing with
                          the case of trademark infringement, involving composite marks must
                          consider the same in their entirety as an indivisible whole rather than

                          removal of the mark &#x27;FORZID&#x27; registered in favour of the Appellant
                          in class 05, on the ground that it was deceptively similar to an earlier
                          registered trademark &#x27;ORZID&#x27; (label mark), also registered in class
                          05, in favour of the Respondent therein. Erstwhile IPAB had allowed
                          the rectification application and the learned Single Judge dismissed
                          the writ petition, challenging the said order. Deciding an intra-court
                          Appeal, where the primordial argument of the Appellant was that
                          Respondent&#x27;s assertion of statutory right in the word &#x27;ORZID&#x27; was

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">                                &quot;26. We find that the learned Single Judge rightly held that when
                                a label mark is registered, it cannot be said that the word mark
                                contained therein is not registered. We, thus, are of the opinion that
                                although the word &quot;ORZID&quot; is a label mark, the word &quot;ORZID&quot;
                                contained therein is also worthy of protection. The learned Single

                                       Trade Marks v. Ashok Chandra Rakhit</a>, AIR 1955 SC 558,
                                       which concerned the proprietory mark &#x27;Shree&#x27; which
                                       formed part of the device as a whole and was an
                                       important feature of the device. The Supreme Court
                                       observed that registration of a trade mark as a whole
                                       would give the proprietor &quot;a right to the exclusive use of
                                       word &#x27;Shree&#x27; as if separately and by itself.&quot; Therefore it
                                       would not be correct for UBPL to contend that the
                                       registration held by OCPL does not cover the word mark

                          v. S.B.L. Limited</a>, 2012 SCC OnLine Del 5701, elucidated the
                          significance of the &#x27;essential&#x27; features of the trademark and observed
                          as under:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">                                &quot;44. The courts have propounded the doctrine of prominent and
                                essential feature of the trade mark for the purposes of adjudication
                                of the disputes relating to infringement of trade mark. While
                                deciding the question of infringement, the court has to see the
                                prominent or the dominant feature of the trade mark. Even the
                                learned single judge agrees to this proposition when the learned
                                judge quotes McCarthy on Trade Marks that all composite marks
                                are to be compared as whole. However, it is dependent on case to
                                case to basis as a matter of jury question as to what can be the
                                possible broad and essential feature of the trade mark in question.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_13">                                45. It is settled law that where the defendant&#x27;s mark contains the
                                essential feature of the plaintiff&#x27;s mark combined with other matter,
                                the correct approach for the court is to identify an essential feature
                                depending particularly &quot;on the court&#x27;s own judgment and burden of
                                the evidence that is placed before the Court&quot;. In order to come to the
                                conclusion whether one mark is deceptively similar to another, the
                                broad and essential features of the two are to be considered. They
                                should not be placed side by side to find out if there are differences,
                                rather overall similarity has to be judged. While judging the question
                                as to whether the defendant has infringed the trade mark or not, the
                                court has to consider the overall impression of the mark in the minds
                                of general public and not by merely comparing the dissimilarities in
                                the two marks.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">                                46. The ascertainment of an essential feature is not to be by ocular
                                test alone but if a word forming part of the mark has come in trade
                                to be used to identify the goods of the owner of the trade mark, it is
                                an infringement of the mark itself to use that word as the mark or
                                part of the mark of another trader for which confusion is likely to
                                result. The likelihood of confusion or deception in such cases is not
                                disproved by placing the two marks side by side and demonstrating

                          registered in Jamaica, and the defendants used a similar label with
                          the words &quot;Karsote Vapour Rub&quot; as the essential feature, and it was
                          shown that the expression &quot;VapoRub&quot; had become distinctive of the

                                deceive, but where the similarity between the plaintiff&#x27;s and the

                                &quot;24. Where Mr. Kadam sees a conflict (between seeing the mark as
                                an inseverable whole and enforcing a monopoly on the use of a
                                particular, essential element of it), I see none. Of course the statute
                                provides that where a mark has multiple elements, its registration
                                gives exclusivity in the use of the entirety of the mark. But this
                                cannot mean that where the mark has a unique, distinctive,
                                memorable, leading and essential feature, albeit not one separately
                                registered, that that feature can be used willy-nilly by all and sundry
                                without fear of repercussion. In the context of trade mark law, a
                                leading or essential feature is akin to a synecdoche, a figure of
                                speech where a part is uniquely representative of the whole (and
                                sometimes vice-versa):&quot;sails&quot; for boats, or &quot;willow&quot; for a cricket
                                bat for instance. I believe there is a valid analogy to be drawn with
                                trade mark law, for it often happens that a singular feature of a
                                trade mark is so utterly unique and distinctive that it at once
                                connotes the whole of the mark. In Mr. Kadam&#x27;s formulation, were
                                these components not separately registered, it would be open
                                hunting season on them all and anyone could use them even in
                                conjunction with rival products. That seems to me to be a concept
                                that entirely undermines the fundamentals of trade mark protection
                                law.&quot;

<p id="p_59">                          25.   Therefore, what emerges from a reading of the aforesaid
                          judgments is that even in case of a label/device marks, it is possible
                          for the Court to follow the &#x27;dominant&#x27; mark test and in case it is found

                          Plaintiff&#x27;s mark, albeit it is a component of a whole mark (label or
                          device), Court can compare the essential features of the rival marks to
                          determine if there is any identity/deceptive similarity to determine if
                          there is infringement. Of course, in every case, this would be purely a
                          matter of judgment of the Court, depending on the facts and
                          circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the overall impression of
                          the mark that would be generated in the minds of a general public.

                          and dominant part of the registered label mark of the Plaintiff,
                          Applying the &#x27;dominant mark&#x27; test, which has been held to be
                          complementing the anti-dissection rule, this Court finds no merit in
                          the contention of the Defendant that Plaintiff cannot assert a right to

                          exclusive use of the part of the word mark &#x27;                              &#x27; only
                          because it has registration in the label mark, as a whole.

                          consideration is whether the rival marks &#x27;                                &#x27; and

                          &#x27;               &#x27; are identical/deceptively similar, which is one of the
                          ingredients of infringement under <a href="/doc/202028/" id="a_89">Section 29(2)</a> of the Act. It is clear
                          that rival marks are not identical and thus the controversy narrows
                          down to see if they are deceptively similar. The test for comparison of
                          two word marks was formulated by Lord Parker in Re Pianotist Co.&#x27;s
                          Application, (1906) 23 RPC 774, as follows:

                                consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is
                                used in a normal way as a trade mark for the goods of the

<p id="p_66">                                In fact, any intelligent person, seeking to encash upon the goodwill

                                minor changes here and there so as to claim in the event of a suit or
                                other proceeding, being initiated against him that the trademark

                                does not lay down any criteria for determining what is likely to
                                deceive or cause confusion. Therefore, every case must depend on its
                                own particular facts, and the value of authorities lies not so much in
                                the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is
                                likely to deceive or cause confusion. On an application to register,
                                the Registrar or an opponent may object that the trade mark is not
                                registrable by reason of clause (a) of <a href="/doc/1661909/" id="a_95">Section 8</a>, or sub-section (1) of
                                <a href="/doc/938587/" id="a_96">Section 10</a>, as in this case. In such a case the onus is on the
                                applicant to satisfy the Registrar that the trade mark applied for is
                                not likely to deceive or cause confusion. In cases in which the
                                tribunal considers that there is doubt as to whether deception is
                                likely, the application should be refused. A trade mark is likely to
                                deceive or cause confusion by its resemblance to another already on
                                the register if it is likely to do so in the course of its legitimate use in
                                a market where the two marks are assumed to be in use by traders in
                                that market. In considering the matter, all the circumstances of the
                                case must be considered. As was observed by Parker, J. in Pianotist
                                Co.&#x27;s Application, Re [(1906) 23 RPC 774] which was also a case of
                                the comparison of two words--

                                      by their look and by their sound. You must consider the
                                      goods to which they are to be applied. You must consider
                                      the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy
                                      those goods. In fact you must consider all the surrounding
                                      circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely
                                      to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal
                                      way as a trade mark for the goods of the respective owners
                                      of the marks.&quot; (p. 777)
                                For deceptive resemblance two important questions are: (1) who
                                are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to deceive
                                or confuse, and (2) what rules of comparison are to be adopted in
                                judging whether such resemblance exists. As to confusion, it is
                                perhaps an appropriate description of the state of mind of a
                                customer who, on seeing a mark thinks that it differs from the
                                mark on goods which he has previously bought, but is doubtful
                                whether that impression is not due to imperfect recollection.

                                Co. v. Skangrila Food Products Ltd</a>. [(1960) (1) SCR 968] the
                                question has to be approached from the point of view of a man of
                                average intelligence and imperfect recollection. To such a man
                                the overall structural and phonetic similarity-of the two names
                                &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot; is, in our opinion, likely to
                                deceive or cause confusion. We must consider the overall
                                similarity of the two composite words &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and
                                &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. We do not think that the learned Judges of the
                                High Court were right in saying that no Indian would mistake one
                                for the other. An unwary purchaser of average intelligence and
                                imperfect recollection would not, as the High Court supposed,
                                split the name into its component parts and consider the
                                etymological meaning thereof or even consider the meaning of the
                                composite words as &quot;current of nectar&quot; or &quot;current of
                                Lakshman&quot;. He would go more by the overall structural and
                                phonetic similarity and the nature of the medicine he has
                                previously purchased, or has been told about, or about which has
                                otherwise learnt and which he wants to purchase. Where the
                                trade relates to goods largely sold to illiterate or badly educated
                                persons, it is no answer to say that a person educated in the Hindi
                                language would go by the etymological or ideological meaning
                                and see the difference between &quot;current of nectar&quot; and &quot;current
                                of Lakshman&quot;. &quot;Current of Lakshman&quot; in a literal sense has no
                                meaning; to give it meaning one must further make the inference
                                that the &quot;current or stream&quot; is as pure and strong as Lakshman
                                of the Ramayana. An ordinary Indian villager or townsman will
                                perhaps know Lakshman, the story of the Ramayana being
                                familiar to him; but we doubt if he would etymologise to the
                                extent of seeing the so-called ideological difference between
                                &quot;Amritdhara&quot; and &quot;Lakshmandhara&quot;. He would go more by the
                                similarity of the two names in the context of the widely known
                                medicinal preparation which he wants for his ailments.&quot;

                          trademark was &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; to the product in question and was accorded
                          protection. It is trite that when a common word is applied in an

                          is referred to an &#x27;arbitrary&#x27; mark, for instance, APPLE for computer or

<blockquote id="blockquote_27">                                &quot;37. This Court is further of the view that mere filing of a search

                                mentioned in the search report is actually being used by third
                                parties. To prove the defence of common to trade, it is imperative on
                                the part of the party who relies upon the mark of third parties to
                                produce cogent and clear evidence of use of the said mark. <a href="/doc/15654482/" id="a_107">In

                                     have failed to produce any evidence of the actual user of the
                                     said marks referred by the defendants. In order to take the said
                                     defence, the party has to give cogent evidence before this court
                                     as to since when these trade marks are being used and what is
                                     the goodwill and reputation of the said trade marks. The

                                        elements therefore only assist the applicant when those
                                        marks are in extensive use in the market. The onus of
                                        proving such user is of course on the applicant, who wants
                                        to rely on those marks. Now in the present case the
                                        applicant, the respondent before us, led no evidence as to
                                        the user of marks with the common element. What had
                                        happened was that Deputy Registrar looked into his register
                                        and found there a large number of marks which had either
                                        &#x27;Gluco&#x27; or &#x27;Vita&#x27; as prefix or suffix in it. Now of course the
                                        presence of a mark in the register does not prove its user
                                        all. It is possible that the mark may have been registered
                                        but not used. It is not permissible to draw any inference as
                                        to their user from the presence of the marks on the
                                        register.&quot;&quot;</blockquote>

</blockquote><p id="p_93">                          47.   In Shree Nath Heritage Liquor Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Division
                          Bench held that merely because the mark is common to the register of
                          trademarks it may not be common to trade. For an argument
                          predicated on common to trade to succeed, evidence of extensive use
                          of the mark in question needs to be shown. Merely relying on a few
                          third-party labels is not enough to prove that the mark is common to
                          trade. Applying the observations in the above judgments to the present
                          set of facts the documents placed on record by the Defendant are
                          trademark registration certificates or applications or some results from
                          random internet search. There are no documents showing actual
                          extensive user by any third party. It is, even otherwise, trite that the
                          mere entry of the mark in the Register of Trade Marks is not evidence
                          of its actual use for a mark may be registered by an entity, but may not
                          have been put to actual use. In any case, this argument does not inure
                          to the benefit of the Defendant, for the reason that the mark

                          &#x27;               &#x27; is purely arbitrary to the products in question in the

                          Defendant was that Plaintiff&#x27;s registered mark suffers from non-use.
                          It was contended that Plaintiff has not placed on record any material to
                          show that it has used the registered label mark bearing application no.
                          1373603 since its registration in the year 2005. The trademark which
                          is not used is liable to be cancelled under <a href="/doc/232464/" id="a_110">Section 47(2)</a> of the Act and
                          therefore, Plaintiff is not entitled to claim monopoly on the basis of

                          registered mark but is separately written in the actual used marks;
                          colour schemes, symbols used thereunder and the font of the tagline

                          below the word &#x27;                   &#x27;are different.

                          is liable to be cancelled and removed from the Register of Trade
                          Marks, on account of non-use under <a href="/doc/232464/" id="a_111">Section 47(2)</a> of the Act, in my
                          view, the contention deserves to be rejected. The Supreme Court in
                          Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. and Others (supra), has held that protection
                          of a registered trademark is not dependent on its use. Relevant para is
                          as under:

                                certain statutory rights have been conferred on the registered
                                proprietor which enable him to sue for the infringement of the trade
                                mark irrespective of whether or not that mark is used.

                          trademark to be filed on a &#x27;proposed to be used&#x27; basis and therefore, it
                          is apparent that registration of a trademark is not dependent on its use.
                          In any case, in the event of a non-use of a registered trademark, in a
                          given case, the Act itself provides a remedy and mechanism to the

                          similar issue had come up before a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court
                          and relying on the provisions of the Act and the judgements, the Court
                          held that Plaintiff being the registered proprietor of the mark had an
                          exclusive right to use the same and the right to sue for infringement
                          was not dependent on the use of the mark.
</p><p id="p_97">                          51.   On facts, Plaintiff has traversed the objection of non-use by
                          pointing out to the categorical stand taken in the pleadings in the
                          plaint that the trademarks have been in use since 2004. Sales turnover
                          figures from the years 2005-06 upto 2021-22 have been placed on
                          record, supported by invoices. Sales turnover figures reflect that the
                          sales of the product of the Plaintiff, under its trademarks have steadily
                          increased from Rs.18,64,24,594/- to Rs.162,18,82,915.11/- and at

                          the goods or services to which the application relates. Plaintiff has
                          sought refuge under the exception of <a href="/doc/232464/" id="a_118">Section 47(2)</a> on the ground that
                          Plaintiff had to vary the label on account of the requirement of a
                          Notification issued by the Office of Excise Commissioner, Rajasthan,
                          which requires a strong concentration liquor to have a red background
                          and the light concentration liquor to have a blue background and the
                          change is necessitated due to these regulatory requirements, including
                          mention of statutory warnings etc. No changes other than those
                          mandated by law for sale of country liquor, are discernible on the label
                          marks used by the Plaintiff and certainly none to the essential
                          elements which are under the cover of registration. Thus, in my prima
                          facie view, the defence set up by the Defendant against infringement,
                          predicated on alleged non-use of the label mark by the Plaintiff,
                          cannot be accepted. Interestingly, Defendant has himself relied on the
                          Notification issued by the Excise department to justify use of similar
                          colour scheme etc. to get over the allegations of infringement and
                          passing off.
</p><p id="p_100">                          54.   In this context, I may profitably refer to the judgment of the
                          Bombay High Court in <a href="/doc/197569386/" id="a_119">Sabmiller India Ltd. v. Jagpin Breweries Ltd</a>.,
                          2014 SCC OnLine Bom 4842, where the Court held that only because
                          a registered trademark is not used in exactly the same form as it is
                          registered, it cannot be said that the mark is abandoned. So long as the
                          trademark, which is actually used by the Plaintiff, consists of its
                          leading, essential and prominent features, the use of the mark will be
                          deemed to constitute the use of the registered trademark itself. It was
                          also observed that the trademark label undergoes change in
                          shapes/sizes to suit the container on which it is affixed. Sometimes,
                          additions/deletions are made in the trademark label in accordance with

                          trademark labels will be deemed to constitute use of the registered
                          trademark. Of course, a caveat was added by the Court that the
                          alterations should not be such as would substantially alter the identity
                          of the mark with reference to its prominent, leading and essential
                          features. Reliance was placed by the Court on the decisions of the

                          present case, the only alteration or variation in the registered label of
                          the Plaintiff is on account of the regulatory regime under the Excise
                          law, relating to sale of country liquor and Plaintiff cannot escape
                          mandatory compliances required by law.

                          by the Plaintiff, it was submitted that the word THARU was adopted
                          as the Defendant has various companies under the name THAR or its
                          formatives. Thereafter, the position adopted was that the word
                          THARU refers to a community in Nepal, which is fond of liquor and
                          the word DHOLA/DHOL is a common word across the country
                          denoting drum/large drum and is used in celebrations. Therefore, the

                          allegedly coined word                 indicates celebrations. While the
                          Defendant may be right in its submission that the word THARU has
                          been adopted after its various companies under the name THAR and
                          its formatives and the word THARU refers to a community in Nepal
                          and the word DHOLA refers to a term, however, this explanation in
                          the present context for country liquor is not plausible or believable and
                          to say the least, is a dishonest adoption. Plaintiff has been in the
                          business of liquor trade from the year 1988 and has been using the

                          mark &#x27;             &#x27; since 2004, which is prima facie evident from the
                          sales invoices placed on record. Both parties sell identical goods i.e.
                          country liquor and Plaintiff sells its product in the State of Rajasthan,
                          where Defendant also carries on business. Both parties are well-
                          known Companies in their respective fields and it cannot be said that
                          the Defendant was unaware of Plaintiff&#x27;s business or trademarks. It is
                          hard to believe that Defendant was unaware of the Plaintiff&#x27;s trade in

                          liquor or the marks &#x27;                   &#x27;/DHOLA MAARU and the

                          nearly two decades. The effort by the Defendant to come as close as
                          possible to the mark of the Plaintiff is evident by juxtaposing the two
                          words DHOLA and THARU, assuming that the companies of the
                          Defendant are run under the name THAR/THARU. It is not explained

                          goodwill. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Court in
                          <a href="/doc/30560910/" id="a_123">Slazenger &amp; Sons v. Feltham &amp; Co</a>., 6 RPC 531, where the Court
                          observed as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                                &quot;One must exercise one&#x27;s common sense, and, if you are driven to
                                the conclusion that what is intended to be done is to deceive if
                                possible, I do not think it is stretching the imagination very much to
                                credit the man with occasional success or possible success. Why
                                should we be astute to say that he cannot succeed in doing that
                                which he is straining every nerve to do?&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_104">                          58.   In another decision in Munday v. Carey, 22 RPC 273, the Court
                          held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_37">                                &quot;... where you see dishonesty, then even though the similarity were
                                less than it is here, you ought, I think, to pay great attention to the
                                items of similarity, and less to the items of dissimilarity.&quot;

                          preparations grocery etc., while Respondent was using the mark
                          ANANDA for construction and sale of apartments and therefore there
                          was no similarity in the goods. The sales were to the tune of Rs. 200
                          crores in the last 10 years. The facts are wholly inapplicable to the
                          present case where the competing goods are identical and Plaintiff has
                          been able to prima facie demonstrate its sales turnover is to the tune of
                          Rs.1,630 crores between 2005 and 2022.

                          common knowledge that Lord Krishna was known for his love of milk

                          generic and was being used by thousands of persons and institutes,
                          including 117 Companies, which were readily identifiable. In the

                          present case, it cannot be said that the mark &#x27;                       &#x27; is

                          found that the word VARDHMAN is itself of a non-distinctive
                          character and is not only common to the trade in question but to
                          several other businesses. In the present case, Plaintiff&#x27;s registration is

                          for a label mark, essential part of which is                           and

                          was common to trade for alcohol. Court also noted that the cases
                          referred to by the Plaintiff have no bearing as in all the said cases, the
                          trademarks were not single letter marks and the Defendants in those
                          cases had appropriated the entire mark of the Plaintiff. In OM
                          Logistics Ltd. (supra), the marks in question were &#x27;OM EXPRESS
                          LOGISTICS&#x27; and OM LOGISTICS LTD. The injunction was
                          primarily vacated in the said case on account of concealment and

                          Allegran Inc. &amp; Anr. (supra). Insofar as, Veerumal Praveen Kumar

                          judgment holding that in Veerumal Praveen Kumar (supra) there had
                          been non-use of the registered marks for 40 years, except between
                          1977 to 1979 and nothing was placed on record to show that the
                          Plaintiff had come into business in India at any subsequent stage. The
                          Court also noted that the delay on the part of the Plaintiff permitted
                          the Defendant to expend money over a considerable period of time
                          and build up a business bearing the mark in question. In the present
                          case, prima facie this Court has come to a finding that Plaintiff cannot
                          be condemned on ground of non-use of the mark, for the aforestated
                          reasons and the invoices and figures of sales placed on record from the
                          year 2005-06 evidence to the contrary. In Fedders Llyod Corporation
                          Ltd. &amp; Anr. (supra), it was held that the mark can lose its
                          distinctiveness by non-use where non-use is on the part of the

                          statutory right. The entire basis or edifice of a passing off action is that
                          no one has right to represent his goods or services as those of someone
                          else and Courts would come to aid and restrain the misrepresentation,
                          even though it may not be fraudulent. Lord Diplock in <a href="/doc/149821556/" id="a_128">Erven

                          forth the essential ingredients of an action for passing off which may
                          be aptly concised as: (i) misrepresentation; (ii) made by a trader in the
                          course of trade; (iii) to prospective customers of goods or services
                          supplied by him; (iv) which is calculated to injure the business or
                          goodwill of another trader; and (v) which causes actual damage to a
                          business or goodwill of the trader who brings an action for passing off.
                          An important ingredient which the common law tort of passing off
                          envisions is therefore misrepresentation. On the first principles, if the

                          Supreme Court held as follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_38">                                &quot;10. A person may sell his goods or deliver his services such as in
                                case of a profession under a trading name or style. With the lapse of
                                time such business or services associated with a person acquire a
                                reputation or goodwill which becomes a property which is protected
                                by courts. A competitor initiating sale of goods or services in the
                                same name or by imitating that name results in injury to the business
                                of one who has the property in that name. The law does not permit
                                any one to carry on his business in such a way as would persuade
                                the customers or clients in believing that the goods or services
                                belonging to someone else are his or are associated therewith. It
                                does not matter whether the latter person does so fraudulently or
                                otherwise. The reasons are two. Firstly, honesty and fair play are,
                                and ought to be, the basic policies in the world of business.
                                Secondly, when a person adopts or intends to adopt a name in
                                connection with his business or services which already belongs to
                                someone else it results in confusion and has propensity of diverting

                          judgment every attempt has been made by the Defendant to come as

                          close as possible to the Plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks &#x27;                               &#x27;/

                          strengthens this view. A very important facet of an action of passing
                          off is the trade dress, the letter and font style of the label or the
                          trademark used by the competing parties. In the present case a bare
                          perusal of the rival label marks would show that the manner in which

                          the words                 have been placed and used by the Defendant,
                          there is every likelihood of confusion and misrepresentation. Even
                          assuming for the sake of arguments that the Defendant was bound to
                          use certain colours on account of excise regulations, the use of the

                          same style of writing and font and similarity in large part of the trade
                          dress, is a pointer to his intent to misrepresent and take undue
                          advantage of Plaintiff&#x27;s goodwill.
</p><p id="p_116">                          70.   Plaintiff has been able to show at least prima facie from the
                          sales figures supported by invoices on record that it has continuously,
                          uninterruptedly   and    extensively    used    the   trademark    (label)

                                        since the year 2005-06 and the sales have steadily
                          increased. For the year 2021-22 alone, the sales turnover of the
                          Plaintiff is Rs. 162,18,82,915.11/-. The reputation and goodwill that
                          Plaintiff has been prima facie able to establish gives strength to the
                          arguments of the Plaintiff that the intention of the Defendant by using
                          a deceptively similar mark, both phonetically and visually, was to
                          encash on its stellar reputation and misrepresent to the unwary
                          purchasers that the product of the Defendant emanates from the
                          Plaintiff or has some association with the Plaintiff. This Court is also
                          persuaded to come to this prima facie conclusion, keeping in backdrop
                          the fact that the product in question is country liquor and the classes of
                          consumers which are likely to purchase this kind of liquor, may not be
                          very literate or discernible so as to make out the alleged fine and
                          microscopic distinction or difference between the suffixes MARU and
                          THARU, which the Defendant is seeking to draw. Defendant is prima
