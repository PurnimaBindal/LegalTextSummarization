</p><p id="p_11">5.    The matter was listed on 15.3.2023 with the others

involving the same issue in this matter. The matter was

finally heard with the consent of parties at the

admission stage and reserved for order and thereafter it

was listed on 22.03.2023 along with others as &quot; For

Being Spoken To&quot; for further clarification from both the

parties and reserved for final order.


</p><p id="p_12">6.    The applicant has taken the following grounds in

his OA. The grounds are further substantiated by the

counsel for the Applicant, Shri Saurav Kumar.


</p><p id="p_13">       i) That the transfer order dated 12.9.2022 and the

       relieving order dt 27.01.2023 are against the

       Transfer Guidelines, 2021. These guidelines were

       formulated to maintain transparency and to avoid

       arbitrariness and discrimination. The Order date

       12.9.2021          suspending   Clause-6   of     the     said

       guidelines defeats the very objective of ensuring

       transparency and fair play. There is no cogent

       reason given as to why this clause has been

       suspended.

Court No.6 (item No.13)



</p><p id="p_16">       (ii) The transfer Order dt 12.9.2022 violates the

       Clauses 6,7,9 and 16 of the Transfer Guidelines.

       Clause-5           talks   about   the   Administrative

       Transfers, Clause -6 assigns Displacement Count

       and the higher the displacement count, the more

       likely the employee will get transferred. Clause -7

       stipulates the modes of Administrative Transfers

       and Clause -16 deals with request Transfers.

       None of these processes are followed while

       effecting the transfers on 12.9.2022.        In view of

       this the transfers are arbitrary and smacks non-

       application of mind.
</p>
<p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">       (iii) The impugned suspension of Clause -6 of the

       Transfer Guidelines was issued in violation by the

       Education Code issued the BOG of Kendriya

       Vidyalay Sangathan on 28.12.2012. The BOG is

       competent to modify the Transfer Guidelines,

       where as the suspension of Clause -6 and Annual

       Transfers was issued by an executive order

       without taking approval of the BOG. Hence the

       impugned orders are issued without competency.

Court No.6 (item No.13)



</p><p id="p_20">       (iv) The transfer order dated 12.9.2022 is against

       DOPT OMs dated 30.9.2009                   and 23.8.2004

       which state that as far as possible the husband

       and wife will be posted at the same station. The

       applicant&#x27;s husband is serving in UP police and

       posted         in   UP.   She   should    not   have     been

       transferred on account of a couple case.


</p><p id="p_21">       (v)      The        impugned     orders    rejecting        the

       representations of the applicant dated 23.12.2022

       and 25.12.2022 in which she had mentioned the

       she had a single minor daughter, and her and

       daughter&#x27;s illness requires best medical facilities

       within 15-20 kms from their residence were

       ignored without valid reasons.

<p id="p_22">
</p><p id="p_23">       (vi) The present applicant has been transferred to

       another state where she has to teach in their

       mother tongue. The applicant is not conversant

       with the local language of Araia, Bihar.


</p><p id="p_24">       (vii) Moreover, the transfer order is violative of

       the      National Education Policy 2020, framed by

       Government of India. Para 5.3 of this policy (NEP

       2020) says that, &quot;the harmful practice of excessive

</p><p id="p_26">       (viii)     The     transfer          order   Dt     12.9.2022       is

       discriminatory         as        the     applicant     has     been

       transferred despite the fact that she has a low

       Displacement count (4) as compared to others in

       the KVs.
</p>
<p id="p_27">
</p><p id="p_28">7. The counsel for the applicant has further averred

that the         coordinated       bench of this            Tribunal       at

Ahmedabad has adjudicated the matter in OA No. 347

of 2022 and other 13 tagged OAs passing the following

orders on 16.1.2023:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">       &quot;13. In view of the above circumstances, we are of
       the view that if the impugned transfer order qua
       the applicants are not quashed, it will create more
       inconvenience to all the concerned than to serve
       the purpose behind effecting the impugned
       transfer . It will not be in the interest of the
       students for which the teachers are meant. As
       stated earlier the academic session is going to
       complete soon and status quo is already in
       existence regarding posting place of the present
       applicants. In the facts and circumstances of the
       case discussed above, we set aside the transfer
       order dated 16.09.2022 qua the applicants.
       However, it is made clear that after completion of
       the current academic session, the respondents
       are at liberty to pass fresh transfer order in
       accordance with the latest transfer guidelines and
       Government Order as also principles of natural
       justice.&quot;

The counsel for the applicant argued that the Transfer

order qua the applicants in said OAs was quashed

because it would create more      inconvenient to the

applicants and an the said transfer orders are not in

the interest of students as these orders were issued in

the middle of the academic session. Drawing parallel

with these OAs, the counsel for the applicant argued

that the transfers in the instant case have been

effected in the middle of the academic session and the

applicant has all the personal and family issues to

attend. Being transferred to a far off place, she would

face grave personal difficulty. The Transfer Guidelines

of 2021 have provision to look into such eventualities

to consider the personal and family of employees of

KVS. However, the respondents have squarely rejected

her request to cancel the impugned orders dt12.9.2022

and vide order dated 13.1.2023. The respondent

Commissioner has rejected her prayers of personal

difficulties in pursuance of the order of CAT Principal

bench dated 23.9.2022 in OA no. 2692/2022. The

rejection of her prayers is not accompanied by a

reasoned and speaking order.</blockquote><p id="p_30">

Court No.6 (item No.13)



</p><p id="p_32">8.    The counsel for the respondents argued that the

Transfer orders are not merely transfers.            He argued

that the suspension of Clause-6 and the Annual

Transfers has effectively taken away the provisions

under Clauses 5, 7 and 9. Moreover, the order dated

12.9.2022 has also mentioned that the said orders are

not only transfer orders; these are also redistribution of

the teaching staff for effecting rationalization of the

deployment of teaching staff in various Kendriya

Vidyalays in the country.                The rationale for the

rationalization           and   redistribution   comes   from       a

detailed exercise undertaken by the KVS authorities to

access the staff strength, existing deployment and

vacancies in various KVS. It was a massive exercise to

find out the KVS having less than 50% of sanctioned

strength and KVs having 80% or more regular teaching

staff. As per station seniority, the staff having longest

stay at a particular station having existing staff to the

tune of 80% or more of regular vacancies                      were

transferred out to locations having 50% or less regular

staff.     He further stated that the Transfer guidelines

allow the KVS Authorities to transfer any employee on

administrative Exigencies. These transfers are called

Administrative Transfers which are defined as &quot;those

transfers which KVS orders suomotu in the exigencies

of service and administration and public interest.&quot;


</p><p id="p_33">9. The counsel for the Respondent quoted the following

Order Dated 20.12.2022 (Annexure A-1) [in respect of

the representation of the present applicant, in support

of the massive exercise undertaken for rationalization

of deployment of teaching staff in KVs; which reads as

follows:-
</p>
<p id="p_34">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       Whereas the above transfers have been effected
       recently in KVS for reasons that due to disruption
       in normal schooling for past two years owing to
       the pandemic situation, there has been significant
       learning loss amongst students due to online
       blended mode of teaching. According to the
       mental health and well being of school students
       2022 report published by NCERT in the chapter
       relating to KVS, it has been stated that during
       COVID-19, as classes were taking place in online
       mode, 54% of the students who participated in
       the survey reported facing difficulties in
       understanding and learning of content through
       online mode. Hence the need was felt to address
       on priority, the learning challenges being faced by
       the students for the past two years due to
       pandemic through administrative means. The
       rationalization of teachers &amp; redistribution of the
       existing teaching staff have been effected to
       address the above core challenges after the
       pandemic so that at least 50% of regular teaching
       staff (inclusive of all cadres) are available in all
       KVs.</blockquote><p id="p_35">
</p><p id="p_36">       Whereas, KVS has identified around 237 KVs
       having less than 50% of regular teaching staff on
       its rolls and about 481 KVs having 80% or more
       regular teaching staff on its rolls in all over India
       on the basis of available vacancy. As per Station
       Seniority (All India /cadre/subject wise), who has

        the longest stay in a station, as per date of joining
        at the station was taken as the criteria for
        transfer. Most of the teachers who have been
        transferred have had a stay in a particular station
        for more than 10 years. Out of the total teaching
        staffs in position, only 1455 transfers have been
        effected which is less than 4 % of the total
        teaching strength in position.
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">10. The counsel for the respondents further argued

that The Transfer Guidelines of 2021 have the following

objectives:
</p>
<p id="p_39">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">        &quot;Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangthan (KVS) shall strive
        to maintain equitable distribution of its employees
        across all locations to ensure efficient functioning
        of the organization and optimize job satisfaction
        amongst employees. All employees are liable to be
        transferred anywhere in India at any point of time
        and transfer to a desired location cannot be
        claimed as a matter of right. While effecting
        transfers the organizational interest shall be given
        uppermost consideration and that the problems
        and constraints of employee shall remain
        subservient.&quot;

       meeting by all Senior Officers of department and
       KVS including Education Minister which was
       Presided over by Education Minister. So
       allegations regarding decision for keeping in
       abeyance Para 6 of the Transfer Guidelines was
       taken subsequently by the competent authority
       after issuing of transfer orders in not true, as
       decision for suspension of Para 6 of the Transfer
       Guidelines was taken on 19.07.2022 in a meeting
       presided by the Education Minister.&quot;
       &quot;16. Since there is no allegation of mala fide
       against any officers of the respondents nor any
       allegation with regard to competency of the officer,
       who has passed the impugned orders of transfer,
       we do not find any ground to interfere with the
       impugned orders of transfer.&quot;

        a particular cadre of transferable posts from one
        place to the other is an incident of service. No
        Government servant or employee of Public
        Undertaking has legal tight for being posted at
        any particular place. Transfer from one place to
        other is generally a condition of service and the
        employee has no choice in the matter. Transfer
        from one place to other is necessary in public
        interest     and    efficiency   in     the    Public
        administration. Whenever, a public servant is
        transferred he must comply with the order but if
        there be any genuine difficulty in proceeding on
        transfer it is open to him to make representation
        to the competent authority for stay, modification
        or cancellation of the transfer order. If the order of
        transfer is not stayed, modified or cancelled the
        concerned public servant must carry out the
        order of transfer. In the absence of any stay of the
        transfer order a public servant has no
        justification to avoid or evade the transfer order
        merely on the ground of having made a
        representation, or on the ground of his difficulty
        in moving from one place to the other. If he fails
        to proceed on transfer in compliance to the
        transfer order, he would expose himself to
        disciplinary action under the relevant Rules, as

<p id="p_49">14.     The counsel for the respondents countered the

argument that the Order dated 12.9.2022 suspending

Clause 6 was ultra vires because of lack of competency.

The decision to suspend clause 6 of the Transfer

Guidelines, 2021 was taken in a meeting chaired                        by

the Union Education Minister                   (who is Chairman of

BOG)          wherein senior Officers of the Education

department           and KVS      (who are ex-officio member of

BOG) were present . Hence, the assertion that the

order is ultra vires of the Education Code 2012 falls

flat.     As the annual transfers were suspended and the

transfers        vide     order   dt.    12.9.2022       effected     for

administrative exigencies, other clauses of the Transfer

guidelines are not attracted in such exigencies.


</p><p id="p_50">15. The counsel for the respondent                 further averred,

that in pursuance of the order dated 23.9.2022, of this

tribunal, the representation of the applicant was duly

considered. Her personal and family problems were

also considered. Because of administrative exigencies,

the personal discomfort of the present applicant was

considered          subservient    to    the    public    interest      of

providing adequate teaching staff at KVS having 50%

view of this, the applicant has no valid cause of action

to agitate. He averred that the OA lacks merit and

pleaded that it should be dismissed.


</p><p id="p_51">16. I have gone through the records of the case

thoroughly and heard the arguments carefully. It has

been held in several judgments by the Apex court that

transferring an employee and reassigning duties and

responsibilities at the same place of posting or at a new

location is the prerogative of the competent authorities.


</p><p id="p_52">17.          Transfers,       deployments,            redeployment         or

placement of organizational human resources are

essential          components             of      Human            Resources

Management Strategies of any organization, be it in

private sector or in the Government or Public sector.

These       strategies       are    s         aimed   at    realizing     the

organizational            goals    for        furtherance     of     mission

subordinate legislation or delegated competencies is

the charter for mission objectives.


</p><p id="p_53">18.      Deployment or transfer is also the process of

providing sub-entities and subordinate offices                          with

the required human resources and support they need

to be successful in their roles. This is akin to allocation

of organizational resources to achieve organizational

goals. Modern governments and organizations begin

the     process           prior   to    adopting        transfers     as     a

redeployment tool by assessing the organization&#x27;s

current and future human resources needs. Following

these assessments, the competent authority makes

decisions how best to deploy the human resources to

meet the identified needs. These include the type of

human resources required, the number of human

resources         required,       the        location   of   the    human

resources, and the timing of the deployment. In

Government, generally this task is assigned to an

Administrative/Establishment/                       Placement/Transfer

Committee.

responsibilities to meet organizational needs or to

authorities have a prerogative to redeploy or transfer

an employee for better utilization of human resources

of the organization for furtherance of organizational

mission objectives have been well settles in several case

job does not have any vested right to remain at a

        The transfer policies are in the form of executive

        prerogative of the government to transfer its
        employees to ant place of posting for
        administrative exigencies. The transfer guidelines
        are subservient to public interest.

        transfers or containing transfer policies at best
        may afford an opportunity to the officer or servant
        concerned to approach their higher authorities for
        redress but cannot have the consequence of
        depriving or denying the competent authority to
        transfer a particular officer/servant to any place
        in public interest and as is found necessitated by
        exigencies of service as long as the official status
        is not affected adversely and there is no infraction
        of any career prospects such as seniority, scale of
        pay and secured emoluments. This Court has
        often reiterated that the order of transfer made
        even in transgression of administrative guidelines
        cannot also be interfered with, as they do not
        confer any legally enforceable rights, unless, as

        orders, which could assess the niceties of the
        administrative needs and requirements of the

       competent authorities of the State and even

policy or suspension of particular clause of transfer

policy is good or bad, it is              for the administrative

authorities to consider the grievances of the employees

in respect of a particular issue regarding transfer

policy. In Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi and others Vs

Sate of UP and Others [1991 AIR 537, 1990 SCR

Supl. (1) 625], the Apex Court held that:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">       &quot;The wisdom of the policy or the lack of it or the
       desirability of a better alternative is not within the
       permissible scope of judicial review in such cases.
       It is not for the courts to recast the policy or to
       substitute it with another which is considered to
       be more appropriate, once the attack on the
       ground of arbitrariness is successfully repelled by
       showing that the act which was done, was fair
       and reasonable in the facts and circumstances of
       the case.

       is limited to the grounds of illegality, irrationality

<p id="p_79">31. The aforementioned judgments of the Apex Court

have       given          upper   hand   to   the   administrative

authorities or the Government in matters of Transfers.

However, transfers may affect negatively the level of

productivity, motivation, innovation quality, relations,

and participation and communication patterns among

other core human resources activities. When handled

well      and       in     accordance         with     the     employees&#x27;

circumstances,               deployment          increase        employee

performance through increased innovation, creativity,

quality, productivity, profitability, loyalty flexibility,

efficiency, effectiveness, and low levels of discontents,

dysfunctional conflicts. In other words, em[ployee

welfare is also in the interest of the organizations. The

principles of effectiveness, efficiency and economy in

matters of deployment of human resources are sought

to be aligned with organizational mission goals.




</p><p id="p_80">32.      While effecting redeployment through transfers,

the organizations should also treat all such employees

fairly     and        without     any         bias   or      malafide      or

discrimination. Moreover, a model employer like the

government            also    treats    its     employees       far    more

transparently and it is expected that the government

ensures that there is no violation of Articles 14 and 16

Indian Constitution.            Based on the twin objectives of

satisfying organizational goals (public interest and

better governance for delivery of public services ) and

employee            welfare,      growth         and         development,

Court No.6 (item No.13)



formulate transfer /placement policies. These policies

ensure         transparency           and     also     provide      better

opportunities to officers for excellence and more

planned approach to cadre planning.                      Such transfer

policies develop some sort of reasonable employee

expectations              to   be   treated   fairly    while    effective

redeployment               through      transfers.     Similarly,       the

government                departments       also     have   reasonable

expectations from its employees to cooperate in such

deployment to achieve mission goals of departments

and other entities.

<p id="p_81">


</p><p id="p_82">33. Redeployment in the form of transfers inter alia

should also satisfy the test of reasonable expectations

of the employees to be treated fairly and such

administrative action should not be based on malafide,

bias and unreasonable factors.                       There are several

judgments of the Apex court which have moderated the

absolute power of the government/ administrative

authorities in the matters of transfer. The earliest of

this genre is the judgment of the Apex court in E.P.

Royappa Vs State Of Tamil Nadu &amp; Anr [ 1974 AIR

555, 1974 SCR (2) 348; Dated 23/11/1973]. The

Apex court has held that:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                 27</span><p id="p_83">

Court No.6 (item No.13)



          &quot;It is an accepted principle that in public service
          transfer is an incident of service. It is also an
          implied condition of service and appointing
          authority has a wide discretion in the matter. The
          Government is the best judge to decide how to
          distribute and utilize the services of its employees.
          However, this power must be exercised honestly,
          bona fide and reasonably. It should be exercised
          in public interest. If the exercise of power is based
          on extraneous considerations or for achieving an
          alien purpose or an oblique motive it would
          amount to mala fide and colorable exercise of
          power. Frequent transfers, without sufficient
          reasons to justify such; transfers, cannot, but be
          held as mala fide. A transfer is mala fide when it
          is made not for professed purpose, such as in
          normal course or in public or administrative
          interest or in the exigencies of service but for
          other purpose, than is to accommodate another
          person for undisclosed reasons. It is the basic
          principle of rule of law and good administration
          that even administrative actions should be just
          and fair.&quot;

SLR 684 (SC), has summarized the scope of judicial

review         in         transfer   matters   under     certain

circumstances: It was held that a judicial review of an

administrative action is of course permissible, but

orders of transfer are interfered when:-

Court No.6 (item No.13)



       &quot;(a) the transfer is malafide or arbitrary or
       perverse;
</p>
<p id="p_103">       (b) when it adversely alters the service conditions

</p><p id="p_107">36. In the instant case, the applicant has failed to

assert that the transfer order dt 12.9.2022                        and

impugned order dated 13.1.2023 are based on non-

application of mind and these suffer from malafide or

bias on the part of the competent authority. The

assertion that the order dated 12.9.2022 suffers from

competency has been squarely rebutted by the counsel

for the respondent. The BOG Chairman, i.e. the Union

Education Minister held meeting of senior officers of

the education department and the KVS , who are ex-

officio Members of the BOG. Hence, it has the

equivalent competency of the BOG. A formal meeting of

BOG would not have taken any different decision as

most of the members of BOG were present in the

meeting        chaired    by   the        Education   minister,     the

chairperson of BOG.

</p><p id="p_110">37. In the instant case, the applicant has failed to

assert any arbitrariness, malafide or bias in the

suspension of the Clause-6 of the Transfer Guidelines

and also ordering the transfer in three tranches. The

transfers are part of rationalization and redistribution

of the human resources following a well-thought-out

exercise to find out KVs having 50% or less staff

compared to their sanctioned strength and also KVs

having 80% or more staff. As it has been stated in the

impugned           order   dated   13.01.2023,   most    of    the

teachers, who were transferred out, were based on the

seniority roster maintained at each station and most of

the transferred teachers had a stay of more than 10

years at their respective previous KVs. In view of this

well thought out exercise, the suspension of clause-6 of

the Transfer guidelines and non-operationaliation of

other clauses of the transfer guidelines applicable for

annual transfers and request transfers cannot be said

arbitrary or non-application of mind.

matters of Transfers. In all those judgments, the Apex

Court held that the Public Interest is paramount in

such administrative exercises and there is very limited

scope for judicial review in the matters of transfer. As it

has been held in the other set of judgments cited in

paragarph 36 above,                  unless there is malafide, bias,

infringement              of    statutory         provisions,      lack       of

competency, non-application of mind, etc, the courts

and tribunals should not interfere in the administrative

decision in respect of transfers. In the instant case, as

we have already discussed above, we do not find any

such bias or non-application of mind in the present

case.

1995 decided 19.1.1995] held that the administrative

Authority is best judge to consider such hardships and

take appropriate decision keeping balance between

personal hardship of employee and public interest .

The apex court in this judgment held that :


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">       &quot;It is further contended that in an unfortunate
       situation the respondent&#x27;s wife committed suicide
       leaving three children and he would suffer
       extreme hardship if he has to work in the tribal
       area. This court cannot go into that question of
       relative hardship. It would be for the
       administration to consider the facts of the given
       case and mitigate the real hardship in the interest
       of good and efficient administration. If there is
       any such hardship, it would be open to make a
       representation to the government and it is for the
       government to consider and take appropriate
       decision in that behalf.&quot;
