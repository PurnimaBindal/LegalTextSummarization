       JUSTICE PRATHIBA M. SINGH
Prathiba M. Singh, J. (Oral)
</pre>
<p id="p_1">1.     The present petition has been filed, challenging the order of the
Deputy Controller of Patents &amp; Designs (hereinafter, "Deputy Controller")
dated 14th March, 2019 as the Intellectual Property Appellate Board
(hereinafter, "IPAB") is not currently fully constituted and is not functional.
The present writ petition was filed seeking setting aside of the impugned
order as at that time, the technical member of IPAB had not been appointed.
Thereafter, in view of judicial orders, the IPAB commenced its hearings.
However, during the pendency of the present writ petition, the Chairperson
of IPAB has demitted office.
</p><p id="p_2">2.     The contention of Ms. Rajeshwari, ld. counsel appearing for the
Petitioner is that the Petitioner had filed a pre-grant opposition challenging


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">W.P.(C) 5571/2019                                                     Page 1 of 6</span>
 the grant of a patent to Respondent No.3, which relates to `Methods of
Evaluating Peptide Mixtures'. The Petitioner is stated to have relied upon
four prior arts, which, according to the ld. counsel for the Petitioner, have
not been considered and no reasons have been given by the Ld. Deputy
Controller while rejecting the pre-grant opposition. Her contention is that all
the prior arts cited by the Petitioner have been dealt with in one paragraph
and the same does not constitute adequate reasons. Hence, according to Ld.
Counsel, no proper order has been passed on merits.
</p><p id="p_3">3.     On the other hand, ld. counsel for Respondent No.3 which is the
contesting respondent, submits that hearings in the pre-grant opposition
were held in January, 2019 and parties were permitted to file written
submissions. It is also submitted that the claims of the patent itself were
amended, owing to the prior arts which had been cited by the Petitioner, and
that the ld. Deputy Controller has, in fact, examined the matter fully,
including the amended claims, as is evident from the last four pages of the
impugned order. The order is quite well-reasoned. Ld. Counsel further
relies upon the judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/187976027/" id="a_1">UCB Farchim Sa v. Cipla Ltd. &amp;
Ors</a>., (2010) 167 DLT 459, which holds that no appeal or writ is
maintainable against the order deciding the pre-grant opposition.
</p><p id="p_4">4.     The Court has considered the impugned order as also the judgment in
UCB Farchim (supra). <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_2">The Patents Act</a>, 1970 (hereinafter, "the Act")
provides for filing of pre-grant oppositions and post-grant oppositions under
<a href="/doc/1443542/" id="a_3">Sections 25(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/801099/" id="a_4">25(2)</a>, as also revocation under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_5">Section 64</a>, by a person
who is challenging the grant of the patent or who is seeking revocation of
the patent. Since there are three distinct remedies available under the Act,
the scheme of the Act was considered in detail in UCB Farchim (supra)

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">W.P.(C) 5571/2019                                                     Page 2 of 6</span>
 wherein a ld. Single Judge of this Court, after analysing the judgment of the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1161164/" id="a_6">J. Mitra &amp; Company v. Assistant Controller of Patents
&amp; Designs</a>, (2008) 10 SCC 368, held as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">            "15. In the first eventuality, where the pre-grant
            opposition is rejected, it is apparent from the decision
            in J. Mitra and from a reading of Section 25 with
            Section 117A that as long as the person who has filed
            that opposition happens to be a person interested, he
            would, after 1st January, 2005 [the date with effect
            from which Section 25 (2) came into force although the
            provision was introduced only on 4th April, 2005] have
            the remedy of filing a post-grant opposition. He can,
            after 2nd April, 2007, also file an application before the
            IPAB under <a href="/doc/217797/" id="a_7">Section 64</a> of the Patents Act for
            revocation of the patent. In other words, as explained
            by the Supreme Court in J. Mitra &amp; Co. as long as that
            person is able to show that he is a person "interested",
            he is not without a remedy after his pre-grant
            opposition is rejected. He in fact has two remedies.
            Even if his post-grant opposition is rejected, he can
            thereafter file an appeal to the IPAB under <a href="/doc/103434899/" id="a_8">Section
            117A</a>. Against the decision of the IPAB in either event
            he will have the remedy of seeking judicial review in
            accordance with law by filing a petition in the High
            Court. At this juncture it may be noticed that in an
            order dated 2nd March, 2009 in SLP (C) No. 3522 of
            2009 (Indian Network for People with HIV/AIDS v. F.
            Hoffman-La Roche) the Supreme Court permitted the
            unsuccessful pre-grant opposer, who had challenged
            the rejection of his opposition by the Controller, to
            participate in the post-grant stage.

            High Court has the power and the jurisdiction under
            <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_9">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to interfere with the
            orders of any statutory authority which is of a quasi-

<p id="p_5">5.     In the present case, a perusal of the impugned order shows that the ld.
Deputy Collector has considered all the prior arts, though not in detail, and
has also considered the amended claims. After considering these documents,
the following conclusion has been arrived at:

            moiety from glatiramer acetate. It imparts sensitivity to

<p id="p_6">6.     In the opinion of this Court, the pre-grant opposition was, therefore,
decided on merits and following the scheme of the Act, as laid down in UCB
Farchim (supra), the remedy of the Petitioner would be to either file a post-
grant opposition or an application for revocation. Thus, the present petition
would not be liable to be entertained.

by "any person interested" within a period of one year from the date of
publication of grant of the patent.      Considering that the Petitioner is a
"person interested", the Petitioner is permitted to file a post-grant
opposition, which shall be decided in accordance with the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1485322/" id="a_11">Section 25</a> of the Act, after constituting an Opposition Board.
