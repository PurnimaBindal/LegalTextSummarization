CORAM:
      Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice Javed Iqbal Wani, Judge.
                                  ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">                                 17.11.2021.
</p><p id="p_2">1.    Through the medium of instant petition filed under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_1">Article 227</a> of the

      Constitution of India, petitioner herein seeks quashing of order dated

      19.07.2021 passed by the court of Judge Small Causes, Srinagar and

      order dated 26.08.2021 (for short the impugned orders) passed by the

      3rd Additional District Judge, Srinagar, (for short „the trial court‟ and

      „the appellate court‟ respectively).
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.    Before adverting to the grounds of challenge urged in the petition,

      brief facts under the cover of which the petitioner has filed the instant

      petition are that a suit for declaration and specific performance of

      contract is stated to have been filed by the respondent herein before

      the trial court on 20.04.2021 wherein ex-parte interim order dated

      20.04.2021 is stated to have been passed by the trial court in the

      application for interim relief accompanying the suit. The said

      application for interim relief is stated to have been disposed of by the
      trial court in terms of order dated 19.07.2021 while making the order

     dated 20.04.2021 absolute.
</p>
<p id="p_4">3.   Aggrieved of the order dated 19.07.2021, an appeal is stated to have

     been preferred by the petitioner herein before the appellate court

     which appeal is stated to have been disposed of, upholding order dated

     19.07.2021 passed by the trial court and further providing that since

     counsel for the appellant/petitioner herein has raised issue regarding

     maintainability/jurisdiction of the suit before the trial court, as such,

     the trial court is directed to frame preliminary issue in this context

     and return its finding, preferably within a period of one month.

</p><p id="p_5">4.   The impugned orders are being assailed by the petitioner inter-alia on

     the grounds that same are bad in law and that plaintiff/respondent had

     no right/locus to maintain the suit being barred under Section 14(c)

     and Section 41 (e) of <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_2">Specific Relief Act</a> and thus, the trial court lack

     jurisdiction to try the suit and as such, could not have passed the

     impugned order and that in the application for interim relief

     consequently interim relief could not have been passed in view of the

     aforesaid bar and that the trial court in essence granted final relief

     while keeping in abeyance notice dated 16.04.2021 and that the trial

     court did not appreciate the principles of prima-facie case, balance of

     convenience and irreparable loss in its true spirit and that the trial

     court passed impugned order erroneously while imaginary linking the

     loan agreement with lease agreement though same being distinct and

     different from each other and that the courts below lost sight of the

     fact that the impugned orders would result in grave miscarriage of

     justice being detrimental to the petitioner bank which holds public
      money and that the impugned orders resulted in abuse process of law

     causing serious miscarriage of justice and that the courts below failed

     to take notice of willful suppression of material on the part of

     respondent herein and that the courts below passed the orders in

     contradiction of their own observations while holding on one hand

     that the primary business of the respondent is a hotel business being

     conducted in the premises in question and on the other hand making

     the base that the primary security given in the loan agreements

     separately executed in the year 2018 is the rentals of the premises

     which are being paid by the petitioner bank and that there appears to

     be a link between the lease agreement and the loan agreement least

     carrying that both are different and executed on different dates and

     providing for different set of rights and obligations and that under

     <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_3">Article 227</a>, the High court having powers of superintendence over all

     the Subordinate courts is vested with the power of judicial review for

     correcting judicial errors and therefore, in the present case power

     under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_4">Article 227</a> of the Constitution is warranted to be exercised as

     the courts below have passed impugned order in a suit which is barred

     by law.
</p>
<p id="p_6">5.   Learned appearing counsel for the petitioner while making his

     submissions reiterated the contentions raised and grounds urged in the

     petition and prayed for setting aside of the impugned orders, whereas,

     per-contra learned counsel for the caveator/respondent herein would

     controvert and resist the contentions raised and grounds urged by the

     petitioner‟s counsel and while defending the impugned orders would
      contend that the petition is misconceived and is not maintainable in

     the facts and circumstances of the case.
</p>
<p id="p_7">6.   Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.

</p><p id="p_8">7.   Before proceeding to advert to the issues involved in the petition, it

     would be appropriate and advantageous to refer to the nature, scope

     and object of injunctions enshrined in Order 39 of CPC as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                  Rule 1 of Order 39 of the Code enables a court to grant
                  temporary injunction in the following cases:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                  (i)     Where the disputed property is in danger of being
                          wasted, damaged or alienated by any party to the
                          suit, or is wrongfully sold in execution of a
                          decree;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                  (ii)    Where the defendant threatens, or intends to
                          remove or dispose of his property with a view to
                          defrauding his creditors;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                  (iii)   Where the defendant threatens to dispossess the
                          plaintiff or otherwise cause injury to the plaintiff
                          in relation to the disputed property.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_5">                  Rule 1 of Order 39 has to be read with Rule 2 of Order
                  39 as also clause (c) of <a href="/doc/1671917/" id="a_5">Section 94</a>. So temporary
                  injunction can also be granted in the following cases:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_6">                  (i)     Where the defendant is about to commit breach of
                          contract, or cause other injury (Or.39, R.2);
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_7">                  (ii)    Where grant of temporary injunction is necessary
                          to prevent the ends of justice being defeated
                          [S.94(c)].</blockquote><p id="p_9">
</p><p id="p_10">           An interim or temporary injunction/relief is a judicial remedy

     by which a person is ordered to refrain from doing or to do a

     particular act or thing. The primary purpose of granting interim relief
 is the preservation of property in dispute till legal rights and

conflicting claims of the parties before the court are adjudicated.

</p><p id="p_11">      The object of making an order of interim relief is to evolve a

workable formula required in a particular situation, keeping in mind

pros and cons of the matter while striking a delicate balance between

two conflicting interests. The underlying object of grant temporary

injunction is to maintain and preserve the lis/subject matter and to

prevent any change in it until the final determination of the suit. An

injunction may be in a restrictive form or a mandatory form.

</p><p id="p_12">      The Apex court in case titled as &quot;Dalpat Kumar and another

Vs. Prahlad Singh and Others, reported in 1992 (1) SCC 719,

being relevant and germane herein at Para 4, &amp; 5, restated the

principles qua grant of interim injunctions as follows: -


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_8">             &quot;4........................Injunction is a judicial process by
             which a party is required to do or to refrain from doing
             any particular act. It is in the nature of preventive relief
             to a litigant to prevent future possible injury. In other
             words, the court in exercise of the power of granting ad
             interim injunction is to preserve the subject matter of
             the suit in the status quo for the time being. It is settled
             law that the grant of injunction is a discretionary relief.</blockquote><p id="p_13">
</p><p id="p_14">             The exercise thereof is subject to the court satisfying
             that (1) there is a serious disputed question to be tried
             in the suit and that an act, on the facts before the court,
             there is probability of his being entitled to the relief
             asked for by the plaintiff/defendant; (2) the court&#x27;s
             interference is necessary to protect the party from the
             species of injury. In other words, irreparable injury or
             damage would ensue before the legal right would be
             established at trial; and (3) that the comparative
 hardship or mischief or inconvenience which is likely to
occur from withholding the injunction will be greater
than thatwould be likely to arise from granting it.


</p><p id="p_15">5. Therefore, the burden is on the plaintiff by evidence
aliunde by affidavit or otherwise that there is &quot;a prima
facie case&quot; in his favour which needs adjudication at the
trial. The existence of the prima facie right and
infraction of the enjoyment of his property or the right
is a condition for the grant of temporary injunction.
Prima facie case is not to be confused with prima facie
title which has to be established, on evidence at the
trial. Only prima facie case is a substantial question
raised, bona fide, which needs investigation and a
decision on merits. Satisfaction that there is a prima
facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction.
The Court further has to satisfy that non-interference by
the Court would result in &quot;irreparable injury&quot; to the
party seeking relief and that there is no other remedy
available to the party except one to grant injunction and
he   needs protection from the consequences of
apprehended injury or dispossession. Irreparable
injury, however, does not mean that there must be no
physical possibility of repairing the injury, but means
only that the injury must be a material one, namely one
that cannot be adequately compensated by way of
damages. The third condition also is that &quot;the balance
of convenience&quot; must be in favour of granting
injunction. The Court while granting or refusing to
grant   injunction   should    exercise   sound    judicial
discretion to find the amount of substantial mischief or
injury which is likely to be caused to the parties, if the
injunction is refused and compare it with that it is likely
to be caused to the other side if the injunction is
granted. If on weighing competing possibilities or
                probabilities of likelihood of injury and if the Court
               considers that pending the suit, the subject-matter
               should be maintained in status quo, an injunction would
               be issued. Thus the Court has to exercise its sound
               judicial discretion in granting or refusing the relief of ad
               interim injunction pending the suit.

<p id="p_16">          Further Apex court in case titled as &quot;<a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_6">Gujarat Bottling

Co. Ltd. vs. Coca Cola Co</a>. reported in 1995 (5) SCC 545, observed

following: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">               In the leading case of <a href="/doc/104935066/" id="a_7">Gujarat Bottling Co. Ltd. V. Coca
               Cola</a> co., the Apex Court observed that the decision
               whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction has to
               be taken at a time when the existence of the legal right
               assailed by the plaintiff and its alleged violation are both
               contested and uncertain and remain uncertain till they
               are established at the trial on evidence. Relief by way of
               interlocutory injunction is granted to mitigate the risk of
               injustice to the plaintiff during the period before that
               uncertainty could be resolved. The object of the
               interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against
               injury by violation of his right for which he could not be
               adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the
               action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at
               thetrial.&quot;</blockquote><p id="p_17">
</p><p id="p_18">           A further reference to the judgement of the Apex court

passed in &quot;<a href="/doc/1722050/" id="a_8">Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd V. Hindustan Lever

Ltd</a>., reported in 1999 (7) SCC 1, wherein at Para 24, being

relevant and germane herein, the Apex court laid down as under:-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_10">               &quot;24.We, however, think it fit to note herein below certain
               specific considerations in the matter of grant of
               interlocutory injunction, the basic being non-expression
               of opinion as to the merits of the matter by the court,
                    since the issue of grant of injunction, usually, is at the
                   earliest possible stage so far as the time-frame is
                   concerned.&quot;
</blockquote><p id="p_19">8.   In view of the aforesaid legal position and the principles laid down

     by the Apex court, the validity or otherwise the impugned orders is

     required to be tested, having regard to the case setup in the petition.

</p><p id="p_20">9.   Perusal of the record would tend to show that the respondent herein in

     the suit in question has sought a decree for declaring the notice dated

     16.04.2021 as null and void with the consequential relief for directing

     the defendant petitioner herein to comply with the terms of the

     contract and complete 15 years and to ensure further liquidation of

     loan linked with rent account on the premise, that the petitioner and

     respondent had entered into an agreement on 19.04.2010 for a period

     of 15 years whereunder the plaintiff being the owner of property

     agreed to lease hotel namely &quot;Hotel Shanhenshah Palace&quot; situated at

     Dalgate, upto 3500 sqfts in the ground floor and that in furtherance

     of the contract obligation modified his estate making available

     additional space for making the terms of the agreement workable and

     in this regard the loan account linked with rent account was made

     operational    so   as   to   deduct   the   rent   paid   towards    the

     plaintiff/respondent herein in the loan account and that the

     defendant/petitioner herein complied with the terms of agreement for

     10 years, but proceeded illegally and terminated lease agreement in

     terms of notice dated 16.04.2021, while violating the express

     provisions of lease agreement wherein the bank was supposed to pay

     in advance amount equivalent to 6 months rent payable during the

     Block of 05 years at a start of each Block of lease period for adjusting
       and appropriating against 50% of monthly rent payable during the last

      5 years of relative Block of the respective Block as the bank had

      proceeded to enter into the least Block of 5th year, as such, the bank

      was estopped from terminating the terms of the contract.

</p><p id="p_21">10.   Perusal of the record would reveal that in response to the notice issued

      by the trial court, defendant/petitioner herein filed response and raised

      a preliminary objection about the maintainability of the suit on the

      basis of <a href="/doc/124747/" id="a_9">Section 14</a> (c) read with <a href="/doc/1436285/" id="a_10">Section 41</a> (e) of the Specific and

      Relief Act.
</p>
<p id="p_22">11.   Perusal of the record would further reveal that the trial court while

      taking notice of the said objection raised by the defendant/petitioner

      herein opined that the said objection can be taken as an issue for final

      disposal of the suit and not while deciding the application for interim

      relief and thus proceeded to decide the application for interim relief.

</p><p id="p_23">12.   Perusal of the record in general and impugned orders in particular

      would reveal and suggest that the trial court rightly refrained from

      undertaking and exercise qua the merits of case which is forbidden in

      law while deciding an application for interim relief as law is no more

      res-integra that while considering an application for interim relief, the

      trial court has not to hold a mini trial, but has to follow the mandate

      enshrined in Order 39 CPC coupled with the golden and settled

      principles of prima-facie case, balance of convenience               and

      irreparable loss. The trial court has thus, rightly proceeded to dispose

      of the application keeping in mind the said mandate and the said

      principles, leaving it open for dealing with question of maintainability

      of the suit to be decided upon framing of the issue. The trial court
       thus, cannot be said to have faulted while passing the impugned order

      dated 19.07.2021.
</p>
<p id="p_24">13.   The appellate court as well while considering the appeal filed by the

      petitioner herein has rightly upheld the order passed by the trial court

      in terms of impugned order dated 26.08.2021. The power of appellate

      court while testing the validity or otherwise is circumscribed and is

      not to be interfered unless same is perverse or against the settled

      principle of law. The appellate court has declined to interfere with the

      order of trial court fundamentally and rightly on the ground that

      question of maintainability/jurisdiction of the suit can be adjudicated

      upon framing of a preliminary issue preferably within a stipulated

      period of one month. The appellate court as well cannot by any sense

      of imagination be said to have faulted while passing the impugned

      order dated 26.08.2021 which has agreed with the reasoning given by

      the trial court in respect of grant of interim relief.

</p><p id="p_25">14.   The settled position of law is that High courts in exercise of

      Supervisory Jurisdiction can neither on the drop of a hat in exercise of

      its power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_11">Article 227</a> of the Constitution interfere with the

      orders of courts inferior to it, nor can it act as a court of appeal over

      the orders of the subordinate courts and also High Court cannot under

      the said jurisdiction interfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or

      just because another view than the view taken by the subordinate

      court is a possible view. The jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_12">Article 227</a> of the

      Constitution has to be exercised very sparingly and has not to be

      exercised just for grant of relief in individual case. An improper and a
           frequent exercise of power under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_13">Article 227</a> of the Constitution has

          been held by the Apex court to be counter-productive.

</p><p id="p_26">15.       Having regard to what has been observed, considered and analyzed

          hereinabove, impugned orders does not call for any interference in

          exercise of Supervisory Jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1331149/" id="a_14">Article 227</a> of the

          Constitution of this court. Resultantly petition fails and is dismissed.

</p><p id="p_27">16.       It is made clear that nothing herein above shall be construed to be

          expression of any opinion about the merits of the case.
