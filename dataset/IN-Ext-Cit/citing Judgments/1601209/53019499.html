         gifted according to his capacity. After marriage, she came to her

         Sasural where it was consummated, as a result of which, she begotten

         a son. It has further been alleged that just after Vidai when his

         daughter came at her Sasural, her husband Sunil Mandal, Debar,

         Nawal Mandal, mother-in-law, Meera Devi and father-in-law,

         Shambhu Mandal began to torture her for procurement of dowry.

         she informed over phone. He any how consoled her. Today, he

                              endless technicalities. The object<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_27"> of the Code</a> is to
                              ensure that an accused person gets a full and fair trial
                              along certain well-established and well-understood
                              lines that accord with our notions of natural justice. If
                              he does, if he is tried by a competent court, if he is told
                              and clearly understands the nature of the offence for
                              which he is being tried, if the case against him is fully
                              and fairly explained to him and he is afforded a full and
                              fair opportunity of defending himself, then, provided

                              on which<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_29"> the Code</a> is based.

                              refusal to allow him to defend himself, a refusal to
                              explain the nature of the charge to him and so forth.
                                  These go to the foundations of natural justice and

                              or because it is so abhorrent to well-established notions
                              of natural justice that a trial of that kind is only a
                              mockery of a           trial and not of the kind envisaged
                              by the laws of our land, because either way they would
                              be struck down at once.

                                   It is the substance that we must seek. Courts have to
                              administer justice and justice includes the punishment
                              of guilt just as much as the protection of innocence.
                              Neither can be done if the shadow is mistaken for the
                              substance and the goal is lost in a labyrinth of
                              unsubstantial technicalities. Broad vision is required, a
                              nice balancing of the rights of the State and the
                              protection of society in general against protection from
                              harassment to the individual and the risks of unjust
                              conviction.
</p><p id="p_23">                                   Every reasonable presumption must be made in
                              favour of an accused person; he must be given the
                              benefit of every reasonable doubt. The same broad
                              principles of justice and fair play must be brought to
                              bear when determining a matter of prejudice as in
                              adjudging guilt. But when all is said and done what we
                              are concerned to see is whether the accused had a fair
                              trial, whether he knew what he was being tried for
                              whether the main facts sought to be established against
                              him were explained to him fairly and clearly and
                              whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend

                              shown the conviction must stand whatever the
                              irregularities whether traceable to the charge or to a

</p><p id="p_25">                                   "In adjudging the question of prejudice the fact that
                              the absence of a charge, or a substantial mistake in it, is
                              a serious lacuna will naturally operate to the benefit of
                              the accused and if there is any reasonable and
                              substantial doubt about whether he was, or was
                              reasonably likely to have been, misled in the
                              circumstances of any particular case, he is as much
                              entitled to the benefit of it here as elsewhere; but if, on
                              a careful consideration of all the facts, prejudice, or a
                              reasonable and substantial likelihood of it, is not
                              disclosed the conviction must stand; also it will always
                              be material to consider whether objection to the nature
                              of the charge, or a total want of one, was taken at an
                              early stage. ...But these are matters of fact which will
                              be special to each different case and no conclusion on
                              these questions of fact in any one case can ever be
                              regarded as a precedent or a guide for a conclusion of
                              fact in another, because the facts can never be alike in
                              any two cases however alike they may seem. There is
                              no such thing as a judicial precedent on facts though
                              counsel, and even Judges, are sometimes prone to argue

                              occasion for a failure of justice by adopting such a
                              course as to convict an accused of the offence under

                              although he was not charged with the said offence? ...
</p><p id="p_31">                                   ... a conviction would be valid even if there is any
                              omission or irregularity in the charge, provided it did
                              not occasion a failure of justice ... The criminal court,
                              particularly the superior court should make a close
                              examination to ascertain whether there was really a
                              failure of justice or whether it is only a camouflage.
</p><p id="p_32">                                   One of the cardinal principles of natural justice is
                              that no man should be condemned without being heard,
                              (audi alteram partem). But the law reports are replete
                              with instances of courts hesitating to approve the
                              contention that failure of justice had occasioned merely
                              because a person was not heard on a particular aspect.
                              However, if the aspect is of such a nature that non-
                              explanation of it has contributed to penalising an
                              individual, the court should say that since he was not
                              given the opportunity to explain that aspect there was
                              failure of justice on account of non-compliance with the
                              principle of natural justice."

                              will be prejudiced. Where an accused is charged with

                              evidence led, he is convicted for committing offence

                              in a failure of justice. But there will be no prejudice or
                              failure of justice where there was an error in the charge
                              and the accused was aware of the error. Such
                              knowledge can be inferred from the defence, that is, if
                              the defence of the accused showed that he was
                              defending himself against the real and actual charge and

                              to satisfy the legal ingredients of an offence already
                              known to the law, and if those facts can be proved
                              without much difficulty, the existing criminal law can
                              be resorted to for bringing the offender to book. In
                              practice, however, two main impediments arise--

                              proof of directly incriminating facts is thereby rendered
                              difficult.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_15">                                  The first impediment mentioned above is aptly
                              illustrated by the situation where a woman takes her life
                              with her own hands, though she is driven to it by ill-
                              treatment. This situation may not fit into any existing
                              pigeon-hole in the list of offences recognised by the
                              general criminal law of the country, except where there
                              is definite proof of instigation, encouragement or other
                              conduct that amounts to „abetment‟ of suicide. Though,
                              according to newspaper reports, there have been
                              judgments of lower courts which seem to construe
                              „abetment‟ in this context widely, the position is not
                              beyond doubt.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                                  The second situation mentioned above finds
                              illustration in those incidents in which, even though the
                              circumstances raise a strong suspicion that the death
                              was not accidental, yet, proof beyond reasonable doubt
                              may not be forthcoming that the case was really one of
                              homicide. Thus, there is need to address oneself to the
                              substantive criminal law as well as to the law of
                              evidence."

                              can and indeed ought to frame a charge of murder
                              punishable under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_79">Section 302</a> IPC, which would then
                              be the main charge and not an alternative charge as is
                              erroneously assumed in some quarters. If the main
                              charge of murder is not proved against the accused at
                              the trial, the court can look into the evidence to
                              determine whether the alternative charge of dowry
                              death punishable under <a href="/doc/1763444/" id="a_80">Section 304-B</a> is established.
                              The ingredients constituting the two offences are
                              different, thereby demanding appreciation of evidence
                              from the perspective relevant to such ingredients. The
                              trial court in that view of the matter acted mechanically
                              for it framed an additional charge under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_81">Section 302</a>
                              IPC without adverting to the evidence adduced in the
                              case and simply on the basis of the direction issued in
                              Rajbir case(2010) 15 SCC 116. The High Court no
                              doubt made a half-hearted attempt to justify the framing
                              of the charge independent of the directions in Rajbir
                              case (2010) 15 SCC 116, but it would have been more
                              appropriate to remit the matter back to the trial court for
                              fresh orders rather than lending support to it in the
                              manner done by the High Court."

                              that the trial court has not made any serious attempt to
                              make an inquiry in that regard. If there is evidence
                              available on homicide in a case of dowry death, it is the
                              duty of the investigating officer to investigate the case
                              under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_83">Section 302</a> IPC and the prosecution to proceed

                              perspective. Merely because the victim is a married
                              woman suffering an unnatural death within seven years
                              of marriage and there is evidence that she was subjected
                              to cruelty or harassment on account of demand for
                              dowry, the prosecution and the court cannot close its
                              eyes on the culpable homicide and refrain from
                              punishing its author, if there is evidence in that regard,

         lower court during course of recording statement of the appellant

         failed to locate incriminating material which has been found on

         record, having adduced against the appellant by the prosecution, and

         thus failed to exercise its legal obligation with due diligence. That

         means to say, the incriminating circumstances having placed on

         record by the prosecution, due to casual conduct of the learned lower

         court, could not be confronted, and due to such lapses, the appellant,

         perhaps would have been ignorant of the same. That being so, it

         could be perceived serious lacuna persisting on the record,

         whereupon there happens to be miscarriage of justice.

                              considered view, does not satisfy the requirements of

                              warranted by law, it will deny to the accused-appellant
                              a valuable right vested in him by law to properly and
                              effectively project his defence. At the same time,
                              prosecution, to our mind, cannot be made to suffer
                              solely for the lapse on the part of the learned trial Court

                              We are, therefore, clearly of the view, if we may
                              reiterate, that this case needs to be remanded to the
