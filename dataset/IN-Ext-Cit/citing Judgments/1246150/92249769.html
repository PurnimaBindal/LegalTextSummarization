<blockquote id="blockquote_1">      10.   The principle for referring and handing over
      investigation of a criminal case to an independent
      agency like the Central Bureau of Investigation
      has been considered time and again by the
      Hon'ble Supreme Court in various cases as are
      detailed herein above, particularly in the case of
      Committee for protection of Democratic Rights
      (supra) and all these principles were recently
      considered by the Supreme Court in the case of
      Pooja Pal (supra). In the aforesaid case after
      considering all the judgments on the question
      from para 50 onwards, the law has been
      summarized by the Hon'ble Supreme Court by
      holding that while exercising the extraordinary

matter of issuing directions to CBI to conduct
investigation must exercise jurisdiction with great
caution, as has been underlined in the case of
Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights
(supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that
although no inflexible guidelines can be laid down
in this regard but it is emphasized that such an
order cannot be passed as a matter of routine or
merely because the party has levelled some
allegations against the local police or any person
of authority. It has been laid down by the
Supreme Court that the power can be exercised in
exceptional situations where it becomes necessary
to provide credibility and instil confidence into the
investigation or where the incident may have
national and international ramifications or it is
required for doing complete justice and for
enforcing the fundamental rights. In the case of
Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights
(supra), the principles have been laid down from
para 60 onwards. It is held that the power,
extraordinary in nature, available under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article
226</a> of the Constitution must be exercised
sparingly, cautiously and in exceptional situations.

exercised in each and every case, the CBI would
be flooded with a large number of cases and with
it limited resources, may find it difficult to properly

scrutinized in the backdrop of the material

      except for vague allegations are made out to say
      that moral of the police force in the State of M.P.

      consideration to the facts available on record, we
      find that the ingredients necessary for transfer of
      an investigation to Central Bureau of Investigation
      and the principles laid down by the Supreme Court
      in the catena of judgments to do so are not
      fulfilled or available in the present case and

      circumstances           or      extraordinary           situation

      necessary to emphasis that despite wide powers
      conferred    by   Articles   32   and        226   of     the
      Constitution, while passing any order, the Courts
      must bear in mind certain self-imposed limitations
      on the exercise of these Constitutional powers.
      The very plenitude of the power under the said
      Articles requires great caution in its exercise. In so
      far as the question of issuing a direction to the
      CBI   to    conduct   investigation     in    a    case    is
      concerned, although no inflexible guidelines can
      be laid down to decide whether or not such power
      should be exercised but time and again it has
      been reiterated that such an order is not to be
      passed as a matter of routine or merely because a
      party has levelled some allegations against the

consideration all the factual aspect found that except that

some police personnel are being prosecuted allegedly at the

      however, holds good. Explanation VI to S.11
      provides :

      of a public right or of a private right claimed in
      common for themselves and others, all persons
      interested in such right shall, for the purposes of
      this section be deemed to claim under the persons
      so litigating."

      But it is only when the conditions of Explanation
      VI are satisfied that a decision in the litigation will
      bind all persons interested in the right litigated
      and the onus of proving the want of bona fides in
      respect of the previous litigation is on the party
      seeking to avoid the decision. The words "public
      right" have been added in Explanation VI in view
      of the new s.91 C.P.C. and to prevent multiplicity
      of litigation in respect of public right. In view of
      Explanation VI it cannot be disputed that Section
      11 applies to public interest litigation as well but it
      must be proved that the previous litigation was
      the public interest litigation not by way of a
      private grievance. It has to be a bonafide litigation
      in respect of a right which is common and is
      agitated in common with others.

<p id="p_22">14.   The proposition that the decision on earlier occasion has

to be in a bona fide litigation in respect of a right which is

common and is agitated in common with others, has been

reiterated   in    <a href="/doc/348205/" id="a_22">State    of      Karnataka      vs       All    India

      Litigation, the petitioner is not agitating his
      individual rights but represents the public at large.
      As long as the litigation is bona fide, a judgment
      in a previous Public Interest Litigation would be a
      judgment in rem. It binds the public at large and
      bars any member of the public from coming
      forward     before   the     court   and    raising     any
      connected issue or an issue, which had been
      raised/should have been raised on an earlier

      Somashekar Reddy (supra) was acting bona fide.
      Further, we may note that, as a retired Chief Engineer,
      Somashekar Reddy had the special technical expertise to
      impugn the Project on the grounds that he did and so,
      he cannot be dismissed as a busybody. Thus, we are
      satisfied in principle that Somashekar Reddy (supra), as
      a Public Interest Litigation, could bar the present
      litigation.

<p id="p_23">15.   The principle that the judgment in a public interest

litigation operates in rem is reiterated in Avishek Goenka (2)

(supra) wherein their Lordships were pleased to observe that

"it was neither expected of the Court nor is it the requirement

of law that the Court should have issued notice to every

shopkeeper selling the films, every distributor distributing the

films and every manufacturer manufacturing the films.

establish that WP-17302-2016 (PIL) was not a bona fide public

interest litigation. Thus, the decision therein that the

investigation in respect of the offence registered against the

police personnel cannot be handed over to the CBI operates

as res judicata.

receiving the written complaint was discharging the statutory

duty cast vide <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_30">Section 154</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

1973. It is urged that since the offence registered against

      reliable and genuine or otherwise and refuse to
      register a case on the ground that the information is

proposed to make a detailed discussion about the
power of a police officer in the field of investigation
of a cognizable offence within the ambit of Sections

an officer in charge of a police station refuses to
exercise the jurisdiction vested in him and to register
a case on the information of a cognizable offence
reported and thereby violates the statutory duty cast
upon him, the person aggrieved by such refusal can
send the substance of the information in writing and

him discloses a cognizable offence, should either
investigate the case himself or direct an

and cautiously used the expression "information"

</p><p id="p_35">(g)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_38"> of the Code</a> wherein the expressions,
"reasonable complaint" and "credible information"

word "information" in <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_39">Section 154(1)</a> unlike in
<a href="/doc/170198/" id="a_40">Section 41(1)(a)</a> and (g)<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_41"> of the Code</a> may be for the
reason that the police officer should not refuse to

a cognizable offence and to register a case thereon
on the ground that he is not satisfied with the
reasonableness or credibility of the information. In
other words, 'reasonableness' or 'credibility' of the
said information is not a condition precedent for
registration of a case. A comparison of the present
<a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_42">Section 154</a> with those of the earlier Codes will

Criminal Procedure of 1861 (Act 25 of 1861) passed
by the Legislative Council of India read that 'every
complaint or information' preferred to an officer in
charge of a police station should be reduced into
writing which provision was subsequently modified
by <a href="/doc/1541278/" id="a_44">Section 112</a> of the Code of 1872 (Act 10 of 1872)
which thereafter read that 'every complaint'
preferred to an officer in charge of a police station
shall be reduced in writing. The word 'complaint'
which occurred in previous two Codes of 1861 and
1872 was deleted and in that place the word
'information' was used in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_45"> the Code</a>s of 1882 and
1898 which word is now used in <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_46">Sections 154</a>, <a href="/doc/1062869/" id="a_47">155</a>,

of 1974). An overall reading of all<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_50"> the Code</a>s makes
it clear that the condition which is sine qua non for
recording a first information report is that there
must be an information and that information must
disclose a cognizable offence.
</p><p id="p_37">33. It is, therefore, manifestly clear that if any
information disclosing a cognizable offence is laid
before an officer in charge of a police station
satisfying the requirements of <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_51">Section 154(1)</a> of the
Code, the said police officer has no other option
except to enter the substance thereof in the

has reason to suspect the commission of a
cognizable offence, he must either proceed with the
investigation or cause an investigation to be
proceeded with by his subordinate, that in a case

on the basis of which no prudent person can ever
reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient
ground for proceeding against the accused.
