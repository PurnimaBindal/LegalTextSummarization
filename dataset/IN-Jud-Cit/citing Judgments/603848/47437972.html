 taken up for hearing, as to ad-interim reliefs. The urgency as set out on

 behalf of the plaintiff is that the movie/film in question namely

 "Mission Mangal" (for short the "said film") is stated to be released on

 15 August 2019.

<p id="p_4">

</p><p id="p_5"> 2.       This is a plaintiff's Notice of Motion filed in a copyright

 infringement suit. The plaintiff is before the Court with a case that

 defendant Nos.2 and 3, in the manner as set out in the plaint, are

 infringing the copyrights of the plaintiff in respect of a registered

 script/screenplay titled "A Most Auspicious Journey" owned by the

 plaintiff and registered in the United States of America, in producing

 the said film "Mission Mangal". The plaintiff has contended that the

 script of this movie being produced by defendant nos. 2 and 3 is

 strikingly and substantially similar to the theme, idea and concept as

 contended in the plaintiff's script. It is stated that following special

 features as contained in the script of the plaintiff can be seen in the

 teaser and the trailer issued by defendant nos. 2 and 3:

        together the teams.

</pre><blockquote id="blockquote_7"> 3.       It is contended that all these similarities can be instantly seen

 from the teaser &amp; trailer as issued by defendant nos. 2 and 3. It is

 the     plaintiff's     case   that   the   plaintiff      had     entered       into     a

 Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure Agreement with defendant no. 1 on

 20th April, 2016 with defendant No.1, so as to share the script with

 an intention that a movie can be produced in association with

 defendant no. 1. Also a Memorandum of Understanding to that

 effect came to be entered on 22 nd December, 2016. The plaintiff

 contends that when the said agreements were subsisting, so that the

 further course of action could be finalised, defendant no. 1 shared

 the script with defendant no. 4 and accordingly defendant no. 4 has

 received knowledge of the theme and concept of the plaintiff's

 script. It is contended that defendant no. 1 and defendant no. 4 in a

 collusive action appeared to have breached the confidentiality of the

 plaintiff's script and has exploited the plaintiff's script to be copied

 by the scriptwriter Mr. Jagdeeshan Damodaran, who now has

 associated with defendant nos. 2, 3 and 4 for production of the film

 in question "Mission Mangal".          The case of the plaintiff is that

 defendant no. 1 has unauthorizedly disclosed the plaintiff's script to

 defendant no. 4. To support this contention, the plaintiff refers to

 correspondence           between the plaintiff and respondent no. 1 and

 their representatives.

 as the scriptwriter Mr. Jagdeeshan Damodaran has himself

 undertaken the entire exercise of visiting ISRO and on information

 received from his research has penned down a different concept

 which has no similarities whatsoever to the plaintiff's works.

 Affidavit of Mr. Jageeshan Damodaran is also placed on record.

 There is also an affidavit of Mr. R. Balkrishnan (Mr. Balki) placed on

 record, who has also denied the case of the plaintiff and contended

 that Mr. Jagdeeshan Damodaran had approached him in January

 2017 with a concept of agreeing a film "Mars Orbiter Mission". He

 has stated that he had heard the concept and same had appealed to

 him and decided to proceed further and agreed to involve himself in

 association with Damodaran to develop a concept in screenplay, as

 he and Damodaran has been professionally associated in the past.

 He has stated that storyline/script titled as Mangal Mahila Mandal

 was prepared and registered with screenwriters association on 6 th

 September, 2018. He has further stated in his affidavit that how he

 approached defendant no. 2 for porduction of the suit film.

 dragged into the suit. It is stated that there is no material against

 her for the plaintiff's to contend with certainty, that she has in any

 manner shared any information in regard to the script of the

 plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_9">

</p><p id="p_10"> 8.       Mr. Jagtiani, learned counsel for defendant no. 1 would

 contend that his client is not concerned with the film. He has drawn

 my attention to the reply affidavit on behalf of defendant no. 1, who

 has denied the plaintiff's case that there is any action taken on the

 part of defendant no. 1 to unauthorizedly share the script with

 defendant no. 4. Mr. Jagtiani would submit that no case of breach

 of confidentiality is made out in the plaint.

 submit that the script of both the parties is not available before the

 Court and thus there is no question of the Court considering

 granting any relief, on the premise that there is infringement of

 copyright of the plaintiff. It is submitted that the plaintiff at all

 material times was aware that defendant no. 2 is producing the film

 "Mars Orbiter Mission" and more particularly from the time of filing

 of the present suit in November, 2018.           It is submitted that the

 plaintiff was also aware that that the movie was announced to be

 released on 15th August, 2019 at the time of filing of the suit itself.

 The submission of Mr. Seervai is that there is gross delay on the part

 of plaintiff to be entitled to the discretionary reliefs as prayed for.

 On the ground of delay, Mr. Seervai would point out that in

 September, 2018, the plaintiff was aware about the said movie

 being produced by defendant no. 2.              The suit was filed on 19 th

 November, 2018. It was moved for the first time on 20 th January,

 2019 and at the behest of the plaintiff, it was adjourned to 18 th

 February, 2019.               It is submitted that on 15 th April, 2019 an

 amendment application came to be moved and it came to be granted

 on July, 2019. Mr. Seervai would, therefore, submit that there is a

 clear indication that the plaintiff was never serious about the suit.



</p><p id="p_12"> 10.      Mr. Seervai would also point out that the averments as made

 in the plaint and the averments as made in the amended plaint

 would clearly show that the plaintiff is trying to change its case even

 in respect of alleged infringement of copyright. It is accordingly

 contended that the plaintiff has in fact now shifted its stand in the

 suit on the basis the developments which have taken place during

 the pendency of the suit. To support this contention, Mr. Seervai

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                                                      8/18</span>

 has referred to paragraph 14 and paragraph 32D(c) of the plaint to

 show that there is clear shift in the case of the plaintiff in regard to

 the basic theme of plaintiff's own script. It is contended that the

 plaintiff has never placed the script on record, when complaining of

 a breach of copyright.
</p>
<p id="p_13">

</p><p id="p_14"> 11.      Mr. Kadam, learned senior counsel for defendant no. 3 would

 submit that there is complete legal misconception on the part of the

 plaintiff and which is fatal to the reliefs as prayed for in the present

 Notice of Motion. Mr. Kadam would submit that there is no material

 before the Court that the alleged breach of copyright can be

 considered to form an opinion even prima facie that there is

 infringement of plaintiff's copyright in respect of her script. It is

 submitted that infringement of copyright is required to be

 understood in the context of Section 14 which defines "copyright"

 and in the context of Section 51 which provides for infringement of

 a said copyright.             It is submitted that in the present case, the

 concern would be in respect of literary work, namely, of a

 movie/script.          It is submitted that in the present case, Mr.

 Jagdeeshan, owner of the script is not a party to the present suit. In

 copyright is being prayed by the plaintiff. Mr. Kadam would next

 contend that in the absence of scripts of both the parties being

 before the Court, no ad-interim reliefs on a Motion seeking

 injunctory reliefs can be granted. It is submitted that the presence

 of the works before the Court is necessary in the context of said

 provisions of <a href="/doc/1136195/" id="a_3">Copyright Act</a>, as the only endeavour of the plaintiff

 would be to show any reproduction of her works in the works of Mr.

 Jagdeeshan, author of the work and who is the first owner and

 consequently of the movie in question being produced by defendant

 no. 2 in breach of any copyrights of the plaintiff. It is submitted that

 this basic elements not being present, the plaint itself ought to have

 been rejected.

</p><p id="p_16"> 12.       Mr. Kadam would submit that the copyright principles are

 well established and no case of any breach of the copyright by the

 plaintiff is made out considering to the settled principles.               Mr.

 Kadam in this context has referred to the decision of United States

 District Court, C.D. California in Livia MILANO vs. NBC Universal,

</p><p id="p_18"> 13.      Mr. Andhyarujina, learned counsel for the applicant/plaintiff

 in rejoinder would submit that the script was sought to be made

 available to this Court by the plaintiff. He submits that same was

 also offered to the defendants, however, the defendants have

 refused to receive the plaintiff's script.    He has referred to the

 correspondence in this regard which is mainly, letters dated 14 th

 June, 2019, 7th August, 2019. He, however, submits that by letter

 dated 22nd June, 2019, defendant no. 2 has refused to provide the

 copy of the scripts to the plaintiff. It is submitted that even Mr.

 Balki has not offered to provide the script. It is submitted that a

 cause of action has clearly been established for an ad-interim relief

 to be granted in favour of the plaintiffs, in as much as the whole

 conduct of the defendant is to defeat the copyrights of the plaintiff.

 Mr. Andhyarujina would submit that the defendants have no answer

 to the peculiar dramatic slant as contended in the script of the

 plaintiff and which is the very theme of the movie in question of

 defendant no. 2. In responding to Mr. Seervai's argument that there

 is delay in the plaintiff's prayer for this relief, it is submitted that

 although on 29th January, 2019, this Court (Coram :S.J. Kathawalla,

 J.) had directed that the Notice of Motion itself to be heard for final

 disposal on 18th February, 2019, that cannot be accepted to be

 rejection of ad-interim reliefs on the Notice of Motion.                  It is

 contended that the subsequent order dated 16 th July, 2019 passed by

 this Court (Coram : K.S. Shriram, J.) would indicate that Notice of

 Motion was to be heard for ad-interim relief. It is submitted that in

 any case the delay would not defeat the injunction in copyright

 matters. He has submitted that there are apparent contradictions in

 the case of Mr. Jagdeeshan and Mr. Balki, hence there is sufficient

 material for this Court to hold that prima facie case for injunction

 has been made out in the plaint.

</p><p id="p_22"> 15.      At the outset, it needs to be noted that when the Court is

 concerned for grant of any injunctory reliefs, the consideration of

 the Court is to apply the three basic principles namely of the plaintiff

 making out a prima facie case, of a balance of convenience being in

 favour of the plaintiff and the test of irreparable prejudice and injury

 being caused to the plaintiff. It is on these principles the present

 Notice of Motion would require to be considered.

</p><p id="p_24"> 16.      Admittedly the suit was filed on 19th November, 2018. What

 would weigh with the Court is that the plaintiff at all material times

 even prior to the filing of the plaint was aware that the said film

 was being produced by defendant no. 2 which according to the

 plaintiff had an element of infringement of plaintiff's copyright. The

 plaintiff was also aware that the film was to be released on 15 th

 August, 2019 (see paragraphs 23 and 24(d)(vi) on page 11 of the

 plaint). The plaintiff was also aware that none of the defendants are

 the persons who have written the script of the movie "Mangal

 Mission". The basic defect in the plaint cannot be overlooked that

 the writer of the script Mr. Jagdeeshan who is the owner of the

 script is not a party to the suit. In these circumstances, Mr. Kadam

 would be correct in relying on the decision of Livia MILANO v. NBC

 UNIVERSAL, INC., et al. (supra) where the Court has recognized

 following principles:

<p id="p_25">          "B.    COPYRIGHT PRINCIPLES

<p id="p_26">          [4] [5] [6] These basic principles of copyright law
          provide the foundation for a copyright infringement
          claim. To establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff
          must show that: (1) she owns the copyright; and (2)
          defendant copied or infringed protected elements of
          the work. Shaw v. Lindheim, 919 F.2d 1353, 1356
          (9th Cir.1990); 4-13 Melville B. Nimmoer, et al.,
          Nimmer on Copyright 13.01 (2005) ("Nimmer").
          Absent direct evidence of copying, proof of
          infringement involves fact-based showings that (1)
          the defendant had access to the plaintiff's work; and
          (2) the two works are "substantially similar." E.g.,
          Funky Films, Inc. v. Time Warner Entm't Co., 462 F.3d
          1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2006) (citing Three Boys Music
          Corp. v. Bolton, 212 F.3d 477, 481 (9th Cir.2000).
          Where a high degree of access is shown, courts
          require a lower standard of proof for substantial
          similarity. Swirsky v. Carey, 376 F.3d 841 (9th
          Cir.2004) (citing Bolton, 212 F. 3d at 485).

          plot, themes, dialogue, mood, setting, pace,
          characters, and sequence of events." Rice, 330 F.3d

          plot ideas for stories, but the actual concrete
          elements that make up the total sequence of events
          and the relationships between the major characters."
          Funky Films, 462 F.3d at 1077 (quoting Berkic, 761
          F.2d at 1293). Courts "must take care to inquire only
          whether the protect[a]ble elements, standing alone,
          are substantially similar." Cavalier v. Random House,
          Inc., 297 F.3d 815, 822 (9th Cir.2002) (citations and
          internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in
          original); see also Nimmer 14.03 ("[A]n essential
          element of an infringement case is that 'plaintiff must
          show that defendants' works are substantially similar
          to elements of plaintiff's work that are copyrightable
          or protected by the copyright.' When similar works

<p id="p_28">          Berkic v. Crichton, 761 F.2d 1289, 1293 (9th
          Cir.1985), provides helpful guidance on this point,
          In Berkic,a case that compared two works involving
          the murder of healthy young people for the purpose
          of removing and selling their organs to wealthy older
          people in need of organ transplants, the Ninth Circuit
          plainly stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_14">                        No one can own the basic
                        idea for a story. General
                        plot     ideas  are   not
                        protected by copyright

<p id="p_29">          Id. Thus, in Berkic, even though the plot lines
          revealed "a certain gruesome similarity," that
          similarity in expression did not give rise to a
          viable infringement claim because the plot line
          itself was not protectable. Id. Later decisions
          have emphasized this point, admonishing trial
          courts to distinguish between the protectable and
          unprotectable material because only similarlity in

 the different High Court and Supreme Court.

<p id="p_31">

</p><p id="p_32"> 18.      In the present proceedings, when the Court is considering the

 Application for an ad-interim relief, certainly the argument of delay

 would be a valid argument. It is quite apparent that the plaintiff with

 all bundle of facts to her knowledge waited for so long to bring a

 position that the scripts are available to the Court so that any issue on

 copyright infringement can be looked into even for the purpose of

 interlocutory application. However, it appears that the plaintiff wasted

 valuable time in entering into correspondence in that regard. Today

 the situation is that the basic material of which copyright infringement

 is being asserted by the plaintiff is not before the Court. The plaintiff

 cannot run away from these basic deficiencies. It is thus, obviously

 difficult for the Court to ascertain as to how even a prima facie case of

 copyright infringement can be considered.

 without the Court looking at the actual works (script) to reach even to

 a prima facie conclusion to a copyright infringement, it would trading

 on a dangerous path. The Court granting injunctory reliefs on such

 considerations is unacceptable and would lead to serious consequences.

 Certainly the Court cannot overlook that during all these times from

 the filing of the suit, the plaintiff permitted the defendants to proceed

 on the basis of their script, complete their production of the film, create

 third party rights and take all possible steps to release the film on 15 th

 August, 2019. Any injunction which would be granted would result in

 a serious prejudice being caused to defendant nos. 2 to 4.

 to contend that there are substantial and strikingly similarities,

 certainly cannot be accepted in as much as in all these cases, the

 material for considering breach of copyright was before the Court.

 Even in considering the reliefs in Notice of Motion on first principles,

 the Court cannot overlook the very basis and the foundation on which

 such relief can be granted in a copyright infringement action.
