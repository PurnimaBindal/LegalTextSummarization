<p id="p_4">      4.     Mr. Lall, learned Senior Counsel who appears along with

      Ms. Nancy Roy on behalf of the plaintiff has stated that through

      the present suit the plaintiff seeks to restrain defendants Nos. 1

      and 3 i.e. Google India Pvt. Ltd. and Google LLC (hereinafter

      &#x27;Google&#x27;) from the use of the plaintiff&#x27;s registered trademarks

      which constitute a part of ad-title, ad-text, URL and meta-tag or

      keyword. Mr. Lall states that meta-tags or keywords trigger

      search results on Google i.e. by way of Google Ads.

</p><p id="p_5">      5.     It is the case of the plaintiff that several third party

      infringers use the services of Google for inserting their

      infringing advertisements when a user on the internet looks for

      the plaintiff by typing &quot;Agarwal Packers &amp; Movers&quot;. Plaintiff

      has moved against third parties and despite having decrees in its

      favour it states that Google did not stop the use of infringing

      advertisements on their platforms. He stated that one party

      namely Agarwal Packers India (Agarwal Express Links Pvt.



</p><p id="p_6">CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                     Page 6/137
       Ltd.) against whom a decree has been passed, continues to

      appear in the keyword, Ad-title and URL.
</p>
<p id="p_7">      6.    It is the case of the plaintiff that obtaining orders against

      individual advertisers on the Google platform was ineffective

      and it is due to this reason that the plaintiff was compelled to

      initiate the present suit against defendant Nos. 1 &amp; 3 and

      defendant No.2 i.e. Just Dial. Mr. Lall has pointed to the

      averments made in the plaint wherein it has been stated that the

      plaintiff has been asked to pay more money or else the

      defendants would advertise the infringers of the plaintiff&#x27;s

      brand on their website.
</p>
<p id="p_8">      7.    Mr. Lall argued that these actions of the defendants

      amount to blackmailing through the AdWords Program. He has

      argued that there are numerous tutorials available online which

      suggest that by bidding for one&#x27;s own brand, which is used as a

      keyword by the Google AdWord Services the owner can protect

      the advertisement panels on the search engine result page from

      being used by the competitors and from stopping the

      competitors from stealing the traffic.

</p><p id="p_10">CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                      Page 7/137
</p><p id="p_11">       8.    It is the case of Mr. Lall that the suit has been initiated

      against Google alone and not against their customers who use

      Google services, which are constantly changing. The suit targets

      the mechanism of Google and the cause of action relates to all

      activities where the registered trademark of the plaintiff is used

      to direct internet traffic to the website of the infringer and seeks

      injunction from using the same as a keyword / meta tag, etc.

</p><p id="p_12">      9.    He has pointed out, that at the time of filing of the suit

      brand infringement was permissible on Google by use of

      registered trademarks in the ad-title and ad-text as also in the

      URL and of course keywords. However, Google has agreed to

      block the trade mark &quot;Agarwal Packers &amp; Movers&quot; and other

      similar marks of the plaintiff from appearing in the Ad-title and

      Ad-text. According to him, on URL, the defendants in their

      written statement in paragraph 14 have also stated that, in terms

      of the policies of Google Inc., which are implemented by

      Google Inc, itself no registered trademarks will be displayed in

      the Ad-text and Ad-title of an advertisement or sponsored link.

      The trademarked term would also not appear in the URL of the




CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                       Page 8/137
       advertisement and that the said policies would be applicable to

      the plaintiff as well.
</p>
<p id="p_13">      10.    According to him, on the issue of keywords, Google had

      asserted that it only implements the policy to restrict keywords

      in certain countries which include China but does not include

      India. Mr. Lall has pointed to the policy of Google as existing

      before the Madras High Court in <a href="/doc/586984/" id="a_1">Consim Info Pvt. Ltd. vs.

      Google India Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>. 2011 (45) PTC 575 (Mad) (SJ)

      (&#x27;Consim I&#x27; hereinafter) and <a href="/doc/586984/" id="a_2">Consim Info Pvt. Ltd. vs. Google

      India Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors</a>. 2013 (54) PTC 578 (Mad) (DB)

      (&#x27;Consim II&#x27; hereinafter) to list the countries where it restricts

      the use of keywords. However, when it comes to India the

      defendant Nos. 1 and 3 have stated that Google would not

      investigate or restrict the use of a trademark term in keywords,

      even if a trademark complaint is received. According to him,

      Google does not consider use of trademarks as keywords as use,

      or infringement of a registered trademark.

</p><p id="p_14">      11.    As per Mr. Lall in the earlier cases before the Madras

      High Court viz. Consim I and Consim II both Google India and

      Google Inc. were parties and the stand taken by Google has



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                     Page 9/137
       changed from 2009 to 2014 which is when the current suit was

      filed.
</p>
<p id="p_15">      12.      According to Mr. Lall, the Division Bench of the Madras

      High Court held the Plaintiff/Appellant therein to be entitled to

      an injunction. He stated that the Court had given a finding

      stating that Google had discriminated against the appellants

      therein and also arbitrarily used the trademark words as

      keywords; and that Google could have used some other words

      as keywords on sponsored link and also held that Google&#x27;s

      action would only create confusion in the minds of the public.

      Further that Google was bound by the policy that has been

      reproduced in the order of the Division Bench.

</p><p id="p_16">      13.      He further pointed to the written statement of the

      defendant No. 1 to state that they have in paragraph 20 admitted

      to the applicability of judgment in the case of Consim I to the

      instant case and therefore the change in policy now is

      completely mischievous and contumacious. Further, he stated

      that in an affidavit filed by Google there was an admission that

      right up to 2009 the AdWords Policy applicable to India did not

      allow trademarks as part of keywords. According to him,



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 10/137
       Google asserts that they revised their Ad Policy on June 4, 2009

      to allow use of trademarks as keywords in more than 100

      countries including India. The decision in Consim I is dated

      September 30, 2010 wherein Google was bound to follow the

      keyword policy in India prior to amendment. The policy that

      was to be followed for India was also clarified in paragraph 51

      of Consim II.
</p>
<p id="p_17">      14.   Mr. Lall relied on the judgment of the Bomaby High

      Court in the case of People Interactive (I) Pvt. Ltd. vs. Gaurav

      Jerry, MIPR 2014 (3) 101, to state that, meta-tags are special

      lines of code embedded in the web pages which provide

      structured data (meta data) about the web page and that these

      meta-tags are used by search engine robots to assess webpage

      contents and other relevant material relating to a webpage in the

      building of search engine indices. The illicit use of meta-tags

      could be severely damaging and that this is a form of hijacking

      the plaintiff&#x27;s reputation and goodwill. <a href="/doc/107853771/" id="a_3">Similarly, Mattel Inc. &amp;

      Ors. vs. Jayant Agarwalla &amp; Ors</a>., 2008 (38) PTC (416) (Del)

      held that meta-tags are machine readable codes used by search

      engines to index sites. Additionally, he stated that meta-tags are

       included in the code that defines the functionality of a website

      by a website owner and that the use of trademarks as meta-tags

      constitutes infringement and passing off since the defendant

      Nos. 1 and 3 through such tags divert internet traffic away from

      the plaintiff&#x27;s website.
</p>
<p id="p_18">      15.   By placing reliance on Consim I, he also argued that

      keywords are meta-tags which have been commercialised and

      are available to third parties for a price. According to him,

      defendant No.3 describes a keyword as words or phrases you

      choose that can trigger your ad to show on search and other

      sites; these keywords are used synonymously with &#x27;search

      terms&#x27; and &#x27;AdWords&#x27;.
</p>
<p id="p_19">      16.   Mr. Lall argued that Google is not an intermediary, but

      rather a direct beneficiary through the sale of keywords. As per

      the judgement of Consim II, Google explained that advertisers

      who vie with one another are asked to bid upon the basic price

      fixed by the search engine for selection of the keyword; and

      parties can advertise their services on the sponsored links by

      paying necessary charges to Google. According to the written

      statement of defendant No.3, Google India is the reseller of

       Adwords Program in India and as per Consim I. Google guides

      the advertiser in selection of the keyword and charges them

      either a fixed rate or gives it to the highest bidder.

</p><p id="p_20">      17.      Mr. Lall has pointed to Google&#x27;s policy to state that

      Google maximises its revenues by linking keywords with the

      goods/services of the advertisers and that these keywords enable

      the advertisements to appear on diverse Google platforms. The

      relevant section of Google&#x27;s policy has been reproduced as

      under.

      defendant No.3 in their written statement that the sponsored

      results / ads are obtained by the mechanism put in place under

      the AdWords Program. Only advertisers having an AdWords

      account can access the AdWords Program, which allows

      advertisers to create, select, edit and manage keywords based on

      which their advertisements can show up as a &#x27;sponsored links&#x27; /

      that the defendant admitted that the keyword mechanism is at

      the heart of Google&#x27;s programming, as they have stated in the

      written statement that, the automated response which Google

      search engine makes to a user&#x27;s search request by displaying a

      sponsored link is wholly determined by the keywords and other

      content of the sponsored link which the advertiser has chosen.

      screenshot of how the keyword Planner which assists the

      advertisers in selecting certain terms and combinations thereof

      as keywords under the AdWords Program which can help

      improve the likelihood of an advertisement receiving a higher

      relevancy score of Ad rank; which reads that the keyword

      searches and the screenshot reads that the competition against

      this keyword as &#x27;High&#x27; and suggests a bid of ₹168.69. The

      keyword planner tool according to them provides data and

      information to an advertiser relating to popular keywords in the

      same field of business and gives information such as average

      monthly searches for any popular keyword or a suggested value

      of the bid amount to help the advertiser plan its bid value,

      keeping in mind other advertisers in the same field of business.

      Mr. Lall argued that by the virtue of the above acts, Google

      cannot be termed as an intermediary, as the term has been

      defined under the <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_4">Information Technology Act</a>, 2000 (&#x27;<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_5">IT Act</a>&#x27;

      IT Act as it is Google itself which provides the service of

      keywords, selects the people who can participate and actually

      shepherds them through the process and conspires and abets the

      commission of unlawful acts. Mr. Lall has placed reliance on

      afterthought. Its AdWords Policy itself acknowledged that the

      use of trademarks as part of keywords constituted violation of

      trademark rights and merely because they now unilaterally

      decide to change that policy, the legal position remains

      unchanged and Google is estopped from claiming to the

      contrary. He further anchors his argument on the fact that the

      use of keywords by search engines require licenses, a fact

      which has been acknowledged by Google; as per the plaint

      wherein the plaintiff has submitted that the plaintiff also

      participates in the Google AdWords Program and when it does,

      in such a case the plaintiff licenses the use of its registered

      trademark to the defendant No.1 and the defendant No.3 for use

      as a keyword. According to him defendants specifically admit

      the position that its AdWords Policy, Terms of Service requires

      the trademark owner to grant to Google a license to use the

      keywords in future. The need to obtain a license by Google

      constitutes an admission that unlicensed use is not authorised.

      services are not restricted to goods/services for which the

      trademark is registered.

<p id="p_26">      22.    Mr. Lall has argued that defendant No.2 Just Dial is

      another service provider which collaborates with Google and its

      AdWords Policy; when one searches for the plaintiff&#x27;s

      registered trademark a Just Dial advertisement appears on top.

      The name of Just Dial is in juxtaposition to the trademark of the

      plaintiff. Just Dial is then able to direct traffic to a telephone

      number who pays them the highest fee, just like Google. The

      first number that appears on Just Dial is of the person who pays

      the highest fee for the listing.

      Senior Counsels who appear with Mr. Neel Mason and Mr.

      Saransh Jain on behalf of defendant Nos. 1 and 3 (collectively

      referred to as &#x27;Counsels for Google&#x27;), argued that the Google

      Ads program, is an advertising service where any advertiser can

      create and display an online advertisement in relation to its



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 18/137
       website, including search-based advertising on the Google

      search engine. The search results on the first page of the Google

      Search engine are of two types, i.e., &#x27;Sponsored Search Results&#x27;

      and &#x27;Organic Search Results&#x27;. The former comprises of

      advertisements and appear separately from the organic search

      results; and are differentiated from the label &#x27;Ad&#x27;.

</p><p id="p_28">      24.   The Counsels for Google have submitted that for creation

      of an advertisement, the advertiser inter alia has to provide the

      text of his Ad, i.e., the Ad-Text and also provide the search

      terms or phrases, which are known as keyword(s), which the

      advertiser believes are most relevant to its business. When the

      said keyword is typed in by any internet user on the Google

      Search Engine, as a search query, the Ad of the advertiser may

      be eligible for display on the Google Search Engine Results

      Page. Counsels for Google have maintained that each and every

      element of the Ad is created and provided solely by the

      advertiser, whereas the Google Ads program merely provides

      an advertising platform and interface for creating and placing

      such an Ad on Google Search. A keyword provided by the

      advertiser is treated as just a backend trigger for an Ad to be



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 19/137
       displayed and is never used in a trademark sense. Keywords

      provided by the Advertiser are not visible anywhere within the

      advertisement nor are they used in any tangible or perceptible

      manner to the end user.
</p>
<p id="p_29">      25.   The Counsels for Google have explained that the search-

      based Ads are triggered by a way of automated software

      algorithms that match the search query entered by a user with

      the set of keywords provided by various advertisers and

      algorithmically determines which Ad is most relevant to the

      search query and should be triggered, if at all. The actual

      display and ranking of an Ad is not determined by the selection

      of keywords alone nor the highest bid, but is a function of a

      combination of the bid amount, quality score (that factors the

      relevance of the Ad), the context of a user&#x27;s search and the

      expected impact of Ad formats and extensions. It is the case of

      Google that revenue is not earned or generated by Google

      merely by an advertiser participating in the Google Ads

      program or upon the mere display of an Ad. A charge is made

      to the advertiser only if the Ad is clicked upon by the end user.

</p><p id="p_31">       26.   It has been argued by the Counsels for Google that the

      keywords are neither sold by Google nor are they purchased by

      the advertiser in the sense of exclusively reserving the term or

      phrase for the purpose of triggering Ads. Google has stated that

      none of the Advertisers acquire any proprietary rights in the

      keywords provided by them to Google and that multiple

      advertisers can select the same keyword.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      27.   With regard to the keyword Planner Tool, the Counsels

      for Google have argued that, this is a standalone research tool,

      i.e., the keyword planner which was earlier known as Keyword

      Suggestion Tool. They have submitted that this is a tool for the

      benefit of advertisers to gain statistical information and

      understanding   about    the   kind   of   words,   expressions,

      combinations that may be relevant for an advertiser to consider

      as keywords for triggering their advertisements. They state that,

      the keyword planner tool is not a mandatory step for creating or

      running advertisements on Google Ads and is simply a free

      facility or a software tool that is separately available to the

      advertiser and can be used to help plan an advertisement

      campaign, should the advertiser choose to avail of it. This



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 21/137
       keyword planner is only for the internal reference of advertises

      and is not publicly accessible except to advertisers who

      specifically look for this tool on the Google Ads program.

      According to them, prospective advertisers can use this tool to

      generate and compile lists containing some relevant statistical

      data e.g., number of average monthly searches, the competition

      level, the amounts bid by advertisers for a keyword, etc.,

      regarding a given business field and learn which keywords and

      search phrases would generate an optimum value for the

      advertiser. They have stated that, the information that is

      ultimately displayed using this tool is based on the millions of

      bits of data that is being stored dynamically to the extent it

      matches with the queries fed in by the user of the tool; and

      Google has taken a stand that the advertiser is free at all times

      whether or not to use the keyword planner tool and has the full

      discretion and choice to provide or not provide a keyword,

      irrespective of whether it forms a part of keyword planner or

      not and may even provide a keyword that is not a part of the

      keyword planner at all. Google has maintained that the said tool




CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 22/137
       is line, both with the applicable law in India as well as honest

      commercial/industrial practices.
</p>
<p id="p_33">      28.   In context of their trademark policy vis-a-vis the Google

      Ads, the Counsels for Google have stated that the Google Ads

      Trademark policy explicitly prohibits any advertisements that

      infringe the trademark rights of others. They have also stated

      that under the policy, Google investigates the use of

      trademarked terms in the Ad-Text of competitor ads, i.e., in the

      visible portion of the ad that appears on the search results page.

      Google does not restrict or investigate use of trademarks as

      keywords. They have stated that the, trademark policy permits

      use of the trademark term in the Ad-text by resellers,

      informational sites and authorized advertisers, if they meet the

      necessary requirements, consistent with the applicable law in

      India. According to them, Google Ads Trademark policy which

      is applicable globally including in India is aligned with global

      legal precedent, finding that a mere use of a trademark as a

      keyword, without more, does not amount to infringement or

      unfair competition. They have stated that the said policy had

      been recorded and accepted in Consim I and reiterated by the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 23/137
       Division bench in Consim II. The said policy has not

      undergone any significant change since then, contrary to what

      the plaintiff has alleged. They have stated that the only issue

      subsisting in the present matter is whether permitting a third

      party to register a keyword that is a registered trademark

      amounts to infringement, which according to them is a question

      answered in the negative, based on the findings of numerous

      foreign Courts.
</p>
<p id="p_34">      29.   It is the case of Google that, once the Ad is created or

      edited by an advertiser, the Ad is reviewed in an automated

      manner for compliance with the Google Ads policies and

      applicable laws. The process of review involves the Ad being

      reviewed in an automated manner and algorithmically without

      any human intervention to check any Ad that may be placed in

      the system for violations of applicable laws. The content,

      including headline, description, keywords, destination and any

      images and videos are reviewed within one business day. Ads

      which on the face of it violate Google Ad policies; for instance,

      Google algorithms will automatically track and block

      advertisements which are prohibited under the Pre-Conception



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 24/137
       and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994 (&#x27;PCPNDT

      Act&#x27;, for short). At the same time, for certain policy violations

      such as trademark violations (in the Ad Text), the Ads tools can

      detect and block the misuse of a trademarked term in the Ad

      Text once the owner of such rights has informed Google of its

      valid and existing rights and as to how a particular

      advertisement is in violation of such rights. It is Google&#x27;s case

      that the plaintiff itself has benefitted from the said feature and is

      very well aware of the nature and functioning of review of Ads

      by Google.
</p>
<p id="p_35">      30.   According     to   the   counsels    for   Google,     Google

      Advertisement Policies also include the Misrepresentation

      Policy. The thrust of the said policy is to route out ads that seek

      to mislead users or misrepresent themselves to offer genuine or

      authorised goods or services or in any manner seek to play a

      fraud on the users. For instance, Ads scamming users by

      impersonating brands or businesses by referencing the brand

      content in the ads, URL, destinations or an advertiser

      misrepresenting itself as the brand or business in user

      interactions is not permitted under the said policy. An Ad which



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                       Page 25/137
       is suspended for violation of this policy also leads to suspension

      of the associated accounts of advertisers of such Ads, since this

      is considered to be a gross violation of the Ad policies. It had

      also been submitted, that the Plaintiff in the present proceedings

      had reported certain Ads for violation of their trademark rights.

      However according to Google, such ads were not found to be in

      violation of the Trademark policy of Google Ads because they

      did not feature the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark in the Ad Text, the

      same were found to be in violation of the Misrepresentation

      policy and had been acted upon accordingly. It has been

      submitted that, Google Ads program does not permit bad ads,

      that are intended to deceive users by excluding relevant

      information or providing misleading information and such ads

      will be reviewed under the Misrepresentation Policy, as and

      when reported by the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_36">      31.   Another limb of argument advanced by the Counsels for

      Google, has been that keywords are not meta-tags. According to

      them, meta-tags are neither used by Google in the organic

      search result nor are they part of sponsored links/Ads section.




</p><p id="p_37">CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 26/137
       On the specific issue of meta-tags the Counsels for Google

      addressed the following issues:
</p>
<p id="p_38">        i.   That there is neither any pleading nor any factual

             foundation laid down in the plaint to allege what meta-

             tags are or how Google is allegedly infringing the

             Plaintiff&#x27;s   trademark     rights   through    meta-tags.

             According to them the only reference is in the prayer

             clause of the plaint, which is entirely unsupported by

             pleadings. The arguments raised regarding meta-tags

             have been raised for the first time in rejoinder arguments

             and that too only in oral submissions. It is a well settled

             principle that a party cannot be allowed to bring a fresh

             from raising this argument at this stage. It has been their

             submission that meta-tags are &#x27;website descriptors&#x27; or

             &#x27;tags&#x27; that can be words, expressions or phrases that are

             put in the source coding of any website to help describe

             the contents of their website. If the website owner puts

             certain keywords in his website&#x27;s source coding and

               designates them as met-tags, they are referred as

              &#x27;keyword meta-tags&#x27;. However &#x27;keyword meta-tags&#x27;

              cannot be confused with &#x27;keywords&#x27;. A keyword is

              conceptually different from a meta-tag. A keyword is a

              word/phrase that is provided by an advertiser to act as a

              trigger for its ad. It is not embedded, included or

              incorporated into any source code or other text of either

              the ad or the advertiser&#x27;s website. On the other hand a

              meta-tag is a word /phrase put in source code by a

              website developer.

              [2016] FCA 255, wherein it has been noted that

              &quot;keyword meta-tags&quot; were trademarked words embedded

              in the source code of a website and its pages by the

              creator/editor of the site. It had also been that unlike the

              &#x27;keywords&#x27; employed by Google as a trigger at the

              backend, &#x27;keyword meta-tags&#x27; were not entirely invisible

             on the judgments in the cases of People Interactive

             (supra)   and      Mattel   (supra),   is   misplaced    and

             unsustainable. According to them the Courts have not in

             any way held a search engine responsible for use of

             meta-tags by a website owner in his website&#x27;s coding and

             are being read by the Plaintiff to suit his own case. They

             have argued that the aforesaid cases are inapplicable to

             the facts of the present case and that the plaintiff has read

             orders as well as concept of meta-tags to its own liking

             and same does not reflect the correct position of facts.

</p><p id="p_42">      32.    Another argument taken by the counsels for Google has

      been that the use of Trademarks as keywords does not amount

      to &quot;use&quot; under the TM Act. According to them, <a href="/doc/188370/" id="a_8">section 2(2)</a> (b)

      requires a trademark to be used &quot;in a printed or other visual

      representation&quot; as a prerequisite before use under <a href="/doc/545792/" id="a_9">section 2</a>

      (2)(c) can even be examined. The key requirement here is that

       is &quot;represented&quot; to an end user / consumer. Mere providing of a

      trademark term as a keyword as a back-end trigger by the

      advertiser to display its ads does not in any manner amount to

      such &quot;representation&quot; and does not qualify as &quot;trademark use&quot;

      particularly by Google.

<p id="p_43">      33.   It has been their case that as per the Federal Court of

      Australia in Veda Advantage (supra) wherein the Court had

      held that the use of a trademark as a keyword &quot;which is

      invisible to the consumer&quot; is not a use as trademark. The Court

      rejected the proposition that using the words which are invisible

      and inaudible, indeed imperceptible, to consumers, amounts to

      trademark use. Further, the UK Court of Appeal in the case of

      Reed Executive Plc &amp; Anr. vs. Reed Business Information

      Ltd. and Ors., [2004] EWCA (Civ) 159 had stated in relation to

      use of trademarks as keywords, that an invisible use of such

      sort, may not be use at all, for the purpose of the trademark

      legislation as there is no meaning being conveyed to anyone -

      &quot;no sign&quot;. In another decision given by the Moscow City

      Arbitrazh (Commercial) Court in the case of Nebo vs.

      Almazakh, Case No. A40-128465/17-91-1116 (2017) had held

       that using a trademark as a keyword does not constitute use of a

      trademark and observed that keywords cannot be viewed as

      means of using a trademark as such words do not carry the

      &quot;branding&quot; capacity. The Court had observed that keywords do

      not form part of the advertisement proper, they are not included

      in its content and are not shown to the user. Keywords cannot

      even be used for identifying a particular ad as the same

      keywords may be used for multiple advertisements. Therefore,

      users do not know on the basis of which keyword a particular

      advertisement is shown nor can they determine which exact

      keywords correlates with the said advertisement.

      trademark term as a keyword as a back-end trigger by the

      &quot;statement&quot; to the end user / consumer and does not qualify as

       Credit Corp Financial Solutions Pty Ltd T/A Wallet Wizard

      [2019] NZHC 654 held that an advertiser is not using a

      keyword as a &quot;badge of origin&quot; for its goods or services, but

      rather it is being used in Google&#x27;s paid service &quot;to place its

      comparative or competitive offering&quot; in the search results along

      with the trademark owner&#x27;s offering which indicates that there

      is &quot;no use as a trademark&quot;; and also in the case of Veda

      Advantage (supra) it was observed that keywords being

      indiscernible to the consumers are not being used by the

      advertiser to &quot;distinguish the services of one trader from

      another&quot; and cannot denote a connection in trade between

      them. Such use by the advertiser is merely to &quot;identify internet

       especially by Google. It is their case that it has been held across

      that a trademark may be removed from the register, if a

      which is not &quot;seen&quot; or &quot;known&quot; or understood by the

      consumer, it could thereby not be &quot;taken as&quot; anything, let alone

      amounting to use that this is &quot;likely to be taken as being used as

      Anr. vs. Mediplan Health Consulting, 425 F. Supp 2d 402 and

      They state that, Courts have around the world held that in cases

      of no visible appearance of a third-party trademark in keyword

      advertising, it cannot amount to infringement. Reliance has

      been placed on Reed Executive (supra) and Veda Advantage

      infringing if it is &quot;likely to cause confusion on part of the

      public&quot;. They have contended that it is settled law that

      confusion to the public or even likelihood of confusion cannot

      be automatically assumed in a vacuum where the actual

      advertisement and corresponding website does not mislead the

      consumer in any way. In absence of any actual or visible use of

      question of likelihood of confusion or deception arises. Mere

      triggering of an advertisement of a third party cannot per se

      give rise to an assumption of confusion in public. Counsels for

      Unfair Competition to state that a computer user who sees a

      search engine results page and clicks on a non-deceptive

      advertising link resulting from a trademark keyword purchased

      any ultimate purchase that is made from that website and after

      literate, having a basic understanding of how to search websites

      on the internet, having a basic knowledge of English language,

      understand how search results appear, and understand the

      difference between normal organic search results and Ads, and

      also are aware of the various industry players in the packing and

      the   websites     like   www.amazon.in,        www.flipkart.com,

      very much in a position to make well-informed choices. The

      likelihood of confusion in respect of such a select class of

      when Plaintiff is appearing prominently in the organic results

      and that the entire right-hand side of the page which displays

      [1991] R.P.C. 425, had observed that it would be unnatural for

      identifies the source. If neither the advertisement nor the

      advertiser&#x27;s website contains any reference to the trademark

      owner then consumers ought to conclude that it is not related to

      the trademark owner&#x27;s products or services, causing no

      interest of public enlightenment and competition. Such use is

      prima facie basis to establish ingredients of section 29(4) of the

      TM Act, as there is no basis to establish that the use of

      Plaintiff&#x27;s alleged trademark as a backend trigger is without due

      cause or takes unfair advantage of the Plaintiff or is detrimental

      to the distinctive character or repute of the trademark. They

      have also argued that a case under section 29(5) of the TM Act

      is also not made out, as plaintiff&#x27;s case is that the advertiser or

      Google has used the Plaintiff&#x27;s alleged trademarks as its trade

      name or part of its trade name, business concern or part of the

      name, of its business concern dealing in goods and services in

      respect of which the plaintiff&#x27;s alleged trademarks are

      advertising where a person can lawfully use his competitor&#x27;s

      registered trademark within the advertisement itself to compare

      his goods/services to those of the competitors&#x27; and offer

      consumers with choices to make informed decisions. If the law

      permits honest usage of trademarks within the advertisement, it

      can be permitted as a back-end, invisible trigger for

      advertisements, even more so when the &quot;overall effect&quot; of the

      advertisement is neither misleading nor deceptive.

</p><p id="p_55">      43.   Another argument that has been advanced, is that the

      absence of establishing any confusion or misrepresentation to

      the end user or any harm to the plaintiff&#x27;s reputation and

      goodwill by any advertiser&#x27;s use of the Google Ads program. In

      relation to passing off, reliance has been placed on Vancouver

      Community College vs. Vancouver Career College (Burnaby)

      Inc. &amp; Ors. 2017 BCCA 41 to state that mere bidding on a

      keyword is not sufficient to amount to a component of passing

      off and factors like how the advertiser has presented himself

       and his advertisement is what needs to be considered to test any

      misrepresentation. Reliance has also been placed upon Reed

      Executive (supra) to state that when the user clicks through the

      advertisement and then finds misleading material on the website

      of the advertiser and not on the advertisement of a search

      engine result page.

      assumed that the &quot;use&quot; and &quot;infringing use&quot; of trademark on

      Google&#x27;s part, such use by Google is fair and in line with

      industry practice and is therefore exempt under <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_23">section 30(1)</a>. It

      is their case that several other notable search engine providers

      such as Yahoo and Microsoft (Bing) also provide for a similar

      keyword advertising service, whereby they permitted use of

      registered trademarks not only as keywords but also within the

       text of the advertisement itself. Many e-commerce providers,

      such as FlipKart and Amazon, use registered trademarks in their

      backend systems to trigger offers for alternative brands and

      products. They have drawn an analogy to Netflix to state that

      even it shows alternatives to a particular title searched by a user,

      presumably using that information in its backend systems as

      well. The TM Act itself permits descriptive use of a trademark

      under <a href="/doc/454306/" id="a_24">Section 30(2)(a)</a> or under <a href="/doc/789170/" id="a_25">Section 35</a>; nominative fair use

</p><p id="p_61">      48.   Mr. Kshitij Parashar learned Counsel who appears for

      defendant No.2, Justdial Ltd. has argued that the main objective

      of defendant No. 2 is to provide people with immediate access

      to fast, reliable and comprehensive information on businesses,

      products and services across India and that the database of

      defendant No.2 comprises of approximately 6 million business

      listings across various cities and towns in India as of June 30,

      2011. It has been submitted that defendant No.2 Company

      provide two types of listing i.e. Free/Non-Paid listing and Paid

      Listing to the business entities who want to register at the

      search engines of the defendant No.2. It was also submitted that

      many users or business entities register themselves as the

      Free/Non-paid Listers and that these Free/Non-paid Listing of

      the user or the business entity can be created by any person by

      just logging on the website of the of the defendant No.2

      Company and thereafter by entering the details of their business

      entity or services which they intend to provide. In this regard he

      has placed reliance on the screenshots of the website of



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 45/137
       defendant No.2 reproduced in their written statement. He stated

      that the information so entered needs to be validated through a

      mobile verification of the person making such an entry and once

      the validation is done the entry goes live. Once this is done, the

      users can visit and change the company details as per their

      requirement. He has stated that the defendant No.2 also

      provides an option of &quot;REPORT ABUSE&quot;, through which if

      any wrong details have been updated for any company the user

      or the affected party can comment on it which gets rectified on

      a priority basis.

<p id="p_62">      49.    He then went onto to explain the Paid listing option

      which is available on the website of defendant No.2 where any

      prospective user who wishes to avail the services of the

      defendant No.2 has to pay a certain amount to defendant No.2.

      The process of paid listing has been explained as under:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">               i.   A telemarketing executive of the defendant No.2

                    would   schedule    an    appointment    with   the

                     defendant No.2, who would then explain to him the

                    various   categories   of   listing   e.g. platinum,

                    diamond, gold, etc. along with the different

                    payment options.
</p>
<p id="p_65">             iii.   Once the mode of payment and the contract

                    amount is finalised, the prospective Advertiser

                    would then sign a contract with defendant No.2

                    after agreeing to the terms and conditions therein.

             iv.    Only after the contract is finalised and the

                    formalities completed the information of the said

                    Advertiser would go live on the website of

                    defendant No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_66">              v.    Any customer who calls the defendant No.2 for an

                    inquiry regarding the services which are also

                    provided by the said Advertiser, only once a

                    confirmation is received from the said customer the

                    defendant No.2 shares the customer&#x27;s number with

                    the advertiser.
</p>
<p id="p_67">      50.   He explained that the basic difference between the

      Free/Non-Paid listing and the Paid Listing is that the Paid

       Listing Advertisers would get leads from the defendant No.2

      Company on the instance when any customer calls the helpline

      number of the defendant No.2 for certain inquiries regarding

      any service/goods. That the information retrieval officer (IRO)

      after responding to the said inquiry of the customer also

      suggests similar services which are also being provided by other

      company(s) and once the customer is satisfied and confirms that

      his information can be shared, it is then forwarded with the paid

      listing advertisers of defendant No.2.
</p>
<p id="p_68">      51.   It is the case of the defendant No.2 Company, that it

      cannot keep a regular watch on the free listing or the paid

      listing. Defendant No. 2 Company believes the information

      provided by any prospective advertiser to be correct and

      genuine. That in case a person is listed as a free lister/paid lister

      he can change his information as and when he wants and it is

      practically impossible for the defendant No.2 to keep a regular

      watch on it. He reiterated the option of &quot;REPORT ABUSE&quot;

      wherein if a wrong detail is updated for any company, the user

      or the affected party can comment on it, after which it gets

      rectified on a priority basis. Mr. Parashar has referred to the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                       Page 48/137
       Warranty Disclaimer Policy on its website, which clearly states

      that   the   defendant     No.2   would     not   examine     the

      authenticity/reputation of the advertisers and the same would be

      the sole responsibility of the advertiser. He has referred to the

      terms and conditions of the contract which specifically states

      that defendant No.2 does not have any liability towards the

      information which is being provided by the listers and the same

      belongs to the listers alone.
</p>
<p id="p_69">      52.    It is the case of Defendant No.2 that, it has not put any

      advertisement       on      its   website      infringing     the

      trademarks/copyright of the plaintiff. It has been argued that the

      listing which has been questioned, does not belong to the

      plaintiff as it is DRS LOGISTIC and not DRS LOGISTICS. Mr.

      Parashar has referred to the screenshots which have been

      reproduced in the written statement of defendant No.2. It is the

      case of defendant No.2 that it has not infringed upon the

      trademark or copyright of the plaintiffs and that it is also not

      gaining any monetary benefits from the free listing as the same

      have been provided by defendant No.2 for the sake of

      convenience to the general public.

</p><p id="p_72">       53.   Mr. Lall in his rejoinder arguments has stated that the

      plaintiff&#x27;s grievance is against the defendants&#x27; services which

      enable third party infringers and counterfeiters to direct internet

      traffic towards themselves and receive inquiries and deliver on

      packing and moving services by deceiving consumers into

      believing that the services are being provided by the Plaintiffs.

      He has argued that many users have lost articles and household

      goods on account of such deception and the services of the

      defendants enable dubious operators to set up fraudulent

      accounts with the defendants temporarily, deceive consumers

      and then disappear. Had it not been for the services of the

      defendants, such parties would have no means of promoting or

      advertising their services and perpetrating such fraud. The

      services offered by defendant Nos. 1 and 3 include, Google

      Adwords, Google Maps and Just Dial, i.e., defendant No.2

      enables third parties to provide users fraudulent websites,

      fraudulent telephone numbers and fraudulent addresses, due to

      which ultimately people have lost their household items and

      valuables. In this regard Mr. Lall has referred to affidavits of

      Ramesh Agarwal and Gaurav Bakshi, the latter who got



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                     Page 50/137
       confused and suffered huge damages due to such confusion

      created by the Defendants. Additionally, he has also referred to

      newspaper articles in order to establish this point.

</p><p id="p_73">      54.    Mr. Lall argued that the algorithm developed by Google

      permits the mischief that has been complained of by the

      plaintiff. According to him, Google developed algorithms that

      look for relevance, i.e., it connects the Keywords to the relevant

      service provided which in this case &quot;APM&quot; is linked to moving

      services. They have argued that these keywords are sold to third

      parties by Google on bidding and Google then charges a fee for

      such bids and for successful clicks. It is his argument, that it is

      correct that keywords are never sold, by them; they are kept

      under ownership of Google and leased to the highest bidder.

      This he states is the case of Google trading in Trademarks of

      third parties.
</p>
<p id="p_74">      55.    Mr. Lall has argued that there is an admission on behalf

      of Google that its Keyword Suggestion Tool provides the

      necessary historic information to induce third parties to select

      keywords consisting of well-known trademarks. Google admits

      that it collects information on the plaintiff and its use of the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                     Page 51/137
       keyword such as &#x27;Agarwal Packers and Movers&#x27; and this data is

      then used to induce third parties to select this trade mark as their

      keyword and attaches it to their website. In the case when

      someone looks for &#x27;Agarwal Packers and Movers&#x27;, Google is

      able to direct that traffic meant for the plaintiff, to the site of

      infringing third parties. Mr. Lall, has argued that this is a classic

      case of direct infringement and inducement to infringe.

</p><p id="p_75">      56.   He has referred to the statement by defendant No.3 in its

      written submission, &quot;Trademark Policy permits use of the

      trademarked term in the Ad-Text by resellers, informational

      sites and authorized advertisers, if they meet the necessary

      requirements, consistent with the applicable law in India&quot;,

      which does not form part of the Court order dated January 22,

      2020 and cannot be an exception now sought to be carved out

      by Google. The same is liable to be disregarded. He argued that,

      such permission can only be granted by Google which,

      according to their own statement, makes a determination

      whether the user of the trademark term is a reseller or

      authorised agent or not. This he stated was proof that Google

      plays an active role in granting keywords to third parties.



</p><p id="p_76">CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                       Page 52/137
</p><p id="p_77">       57.   Mr. Lall has countered the submissions made by the

      Counsels for Google with respect to Google&#x27;s review of an

      advertisement by stating that such submissions are beyond

      pleading and therefore liable to be disregarded. He stated that

      this too would go to show that Google plays an active role in

      selection of keywords and that Google possesses the capability

      to assess and reject mischievous ads and keywords selected by

      advertisers, but chooses to ignore them with an incentive for

      profiteering.
</p>
<p id="p_78">      58.   Mr. Lall argued that in the pleadings Google has admitted

      that keywords are meta-tags. In the plaint these terms have been

      used synonymously by the plaintiff, which according to him,

      are admitted in the pleadings.    He stated that, the reliance

      placed on Veda Advantage (supra) is misplaced as in paragraph

      130 it was stated that keywords are &quot;words embedded in

      metatags&quot;; and that meta-tags are used in indexing and ranking

      of websites, which is exactly what keywords are used for, i.e.,

      they are one and the same thing. He argued that it was the

      Defendants who failed to distinguish the two binding precedents

      of law in People Interactive (supra) and Mattel Inc. (supra).



</p><p id="p_79">CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                  Page 53/137
</p><p id="p_80">       59.   Mr. Lall has countered the argument advanced by the

      Counsels for Google that use of trademarks as Keywords does

      not amount to &quot;use&quot; under the TM Act by stating that when an

      entity participates in the Google AdWords Program it licenses

      the use of its registered trademark to Google for use as a

      keyword. He referred to paragraph 60 of Veda Advantage

      (supra) to state that it had been recorded in the said judgment

      that, sponsored links were advertisements, which Google&#x27;s

      AdWords program allows advertisers to create, change, and

      monitor. They are triggered by keywords privately supplied by

      the advertiser to Google. Courts while discussing the law in the

      context of the United Kingdom (&#x27;UK&#x27; for short) and European

      Union (&#x27;EU&#x27; hereinafter) stated that in the European context it

      was stated that the keywords used in course of trade in respect

      of goods or services would amount to use as a trademark.

      However, it was held that the laws in Australia were different

      from the laws in the UK and similarly the laws in India are

      different and recognise that the use of keywords / meta-tags

      constitute use and infringement of a trademark.

</p><p id="p_82">       60.   Mr. Lall has argued that the interpretation of the decision

      by Google in Reed Executive (supra) is incorrect as the Court

      in that case had categorically expressed itself when it in

      paragraph 140 stated that, whether the use as a reserved word

      can fairly be regarded as use in course of trade or not, on which

      the Court expresses no opinion. In paragraph 142 the Court

      again restrained itself from expressing opinion and hence there

      is no finding at all on the question that the use of keywords does

      not equal to use in trade.
</p>
<p id="p_83">      61.   He argued that reliance placed on Nebo (supra) is

      misplaced as the <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_28">Article 1484</a><a href="/doc/1645922/" id="a_29"> of the Civil Code</a> of the Russian

      Federation is very different from the Indian Law. Similarly, the

      laws of New Zealand are completely different from Indian

      Laws and therefore the decision in the cases of Intercity Group

      (NZ) (supra) and NZ Fintech (supra) would not be applicable

      in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_84">      62.   He stated that <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_30">section 29(6)</a> is to be read with <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_31">section

      29(7)</a> and indeed is in addition to the definition of &quot;use&quot; under

      <a href="/doc/188370/" id="a_32">section 2(2)</a>. Admittedly use of a trademark in the keyword by

      Google amounts to use &quot;in advertising&quot; as per <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_33">sections 29(6)</a>,



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 55/137
       29(7) and 29(8) and it is also admitted that a Google

      advertisement cannot be triggered without keywords. This

      indicates that it is an integral part of &quot;use&quot; in advertising and in

      background of the instant case where the question of &quot;use in

      advertising&quot; amounting to &quot;use&quot; is concerned, foreign cases

      cannot be relied on as the laws in India are very specific when it

      comes to &quot;use in advertising&quot; constituting &quot;use&quot; of a

      trademark. If a registered trademark is used in a keyword, it

      would constitute use of trademark and can be used to ward off

      an action for cancellation.
</p>
<p id="p_85">      63.   The argument, that even if the use is established,

      elements of infringement/passing off under the TM Act have

      not been established, has been opposed by Mr. Lall by arguing

      that there is no requirement of visibility of a trademark to

      constitute infringement. Such limitations to infringement are

      only figments of imagination of Google and are not supported

      by law. A trademark, need not be visible which is apparent

      from <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_34">section 29(9)</a> wherein it is stated that infringement may

      occur even by spoken use. So is the case of a keyword. He

      argued that the use in any case is not invisible as Google



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                      Page 56/137
       actually makes the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark visible to its customers/

      prospective advertisers by offering it to be selected by third

      party advertisers.
</p>
<p id="p_86">      64.   He submitted that in the case of Mattel Inc.(supra) and

      People Interactive (supra) it was held that use of trademark in

      meta-tags constituted use and therefore the visibility of a

      trademark is not a prerequisite to constitute infringement. Since

      it is his case that meta-tags are keywords, the use of keywords

      would constitute infringement and in the direct applicability of

      aforementioned judgments on the issue, foreign laws should not

      be relied upon. He argued that Google has misread section

      29(3) of the TM Act which categorically states that where

      marks are identical, confusion on part of the public is presumed;

      in this case Google admittedly sells and pawns an identical

      trademark of the plaintiff and in fact correlates the use of an

      identical mark to identical services, by its specially made

      algorithms, which amounts to &quot;taking unfair advantage&quot; and is

      detrimental to the distinctive character and repute of a mark.

       search engine results page and clicks on a non-deceptive

      advertising link resulting from a trademark keyword purchased

      by a competitor is not confused as to the source or affiliation of

      any ultimate purchase that is made from that website. Mr. Lall

      stated that even if this is taken to be true, would Google ensure

      that the advertising is non-deceptive. He contends that Google

      has stated that it does not control the content in the advertising.

      He argued that this submission of Google is not relevant to the

      case as advertisers use a host of techniques to confuse its

      consumers and Google intentionally pawns well-known

      trademarks to such parties. According to him, as per <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_35">section

      29(7)</a> there is no requirement of confusion, mere use in

      advertising amounts to infringement and similarly for the use in

      advertising, confusion is not a pre-requisite under <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_36">section 29(8)</a>.

      The use of plaintiff&#x27;s trademark as a keyword is not authorised

      by the plaintiff which is a pre-requisite under <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_37">section 29(7)</a>.

      Moreover <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_38">section 29(8)</a> has been violated since the plaintiff&#x27;s

      trademark is being sold as a keyword. Use by Google cannot be

      said to be honest use under any circumstances, especially when

      Google does not ensure that the overall effect is neither

       misleading nor deceptive. He also stated that on the basis of the

      material placed on record which shows instances of actual

      confusion and passing off, the submissions made by Google that

      there is no case of passing off, is unacceptable. In contradiction

      Google&#x27;s argument that no case of use of a trademark or

      infringement is made out under any part of section 29 of the TM

      Act. Mr. Lall stated that the terminology used in Section 29(7)

      of TM Act is &quot;material intended to be used....for advertising

      goods or services&quot; and keywords are used by Google to trigger

      advertisements. It is therefore admittedly a &quot;material&quot; intended

      to be used for advertising. The term &quot;within its advertising&quot;

      used in the note by Google does not exist in TM Act. It is the

      case of the plaintiff that there is no exception to <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_39">section 29(7)</a>

      for fair use; there is no fair use as evidence has been filed by the

      plaintiff showing actual confusion on account of mischievous

      advertising and that none of the assertions with regard to

      statutory exemption under sections 30 and 35 of the TM Act

      have been pleaded and there is no evidence that other e-

      commerce providers also use keywords in their back-end

      programming.

      basic understanding of how to search for websites on the

      internet and have basic knowledge of English language and

      understand the difference between organic search results and

      Ads. Mr. Lall argued that Google is available in a number of

      different languages and English is not the primary language of

      Google. Even otherwise, majority of the people in India are not

      well versed in English and are likely to be confused between

      organic results and Ads which are not clearly demarcated. He

      stated that Google has not placed any evidence to prove these

      submissions and this argument is covered by the judgment of

      <a href="/doc/503400/" id="a_40">Baker Hughes Ltd. &amp; Ors. vs. Hiroo Khushlani &amp; Ors</a>. 2004

      the Court held that there is nothing improper with defendant&#x27;s

      purchase of sponsored links to their websites from searches of

      keyword &quot;ZOCOR&quot;, because the defendants therein actually

      sold &quot;ZOCOR&quot; manufactured by plaintiff on their website.

       According to him, the Court relied upon the Geico case to hold

      that Google&#x27;s sale to advertisers of right to use specific

      trademark as keywords to trigger their ads would constitute use

      in commerce.

<p id="p_93">      68.   Google relies on foreign decisions of Jive Commerce

      LLC (supra), Passport Health (supra), Nebo (supra) and

      Cochrane Steel Products (supra) to assert that consumers

      cannot be misled by a labelled ad. Mr. Lall rebutted this

      submission by stating that Google gives no assurances, those

      advertisements which use the plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks as

      keywords would have all these features. He pointed out that the

      plaint shows many instances where it is impossible to discern to

      whom a website belongs to. He stated that in many instances the

      keyword triggers the advertisement, which shows a phone

      number and the consumer, under the impression that he is

      calling the plaintiff, calls on the phone number and gets duped

      by the advertiser, i.e., a fraudulent party.

</p><p id="p_94">      69.   He argued that in the Cochrane Steel Products (supra)

      the Court found that Google earns revenue through keywords,

      that advertisers purchase keywords and that the highest bidder

       gets the keyword. The Court in that case questioned, whether

      the Google advertisement which appears in response to the

      search using the keyword does not enable normally informed

      and reasonably observant internet users, or enables them only

      with difficulty, to ascertain whether the goods or services

      referred to in Google advertisement originates from the

      proprietor of the trademark or an undertaking economically

      connected to it or, which originate from third parties. He stated

      that in that case too, the Court cautioned against use of foreign

      law and that the ads should be clearly marked different from

      organic results and held that use of trademarks as keywords

      could only be permitted if there is no confusion. In the case of

      Vancouver Community College (supra) the Court held that

      keywords can cause confusion.

      (supra), supports the case of the plaintiff, the conclusion arrived

      by the Grand Chamber was use of a trademark as keyword does

      constitute use in relation to goods or services. Such &quot;use&quot; has

      been further held to have the capability of adversely affecting

       a finding that that even the Internet Service Provider is liable if

      the role played by the Internet Service Provider is not neutral

      and the moment it acquires knowledge of the unlawful nature of

      those data or of that advertiser&#x27;s activities, it fails to act

      expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the data

<p id="p_96">      71.   He stated that in the case of L&#x27;Oreal SA (supra) there

      were several findings in favour of the plaintiff, he stated the

      said judgment was based on <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_41">article 14</a> of the EU Directive

      200/31 which stipulates a requirement wherein the intermediary

      does not have actual knowledge of the illegal activities and

      upon obtaining such knowledge acts expeditiously to remove or

      disable access to the information. The Court ultimately found

      that the proprietor of a trademark is entitled to prevent an online

      marketplace operator from advertising - on the basis of a

      keyword which is identical to his trademark and which has been

      selected in an internet referencing service by that operator. The

      Court also stated that the use of a keyword is also objectionable.

      This is especially so where the intermediary plays an active role

      as to give it knowledge of, or control over, the data. The Court

      the plaintiff therein was the owner of the &quot;Mr. Spicy&quot; trademark

      and attempted to sue third parties and Yahoo for choice of

      descriptive words such as &quot;Spicy&quot;, &quot;spicy soup&quot;, etc. as

      keywords. It was on this basis that the Court concluded that

      there was no infringement and there could be no objections to

      Yahoo soliciting third party use of &quot;Mr. Spicy&quot; as a keyword in

      return for payment, if the keyword is going to attach goods and

      services that are different from those protected in that case. This

      case too Mr. Lall argued is favourable to the plaintiff but

      recognises the weakness of such a descriptive mark to be

      restricted to goods/services for which it is registered.

      Google Ads program is pro user choice and permissible is

      completely flawed as the same is contrary to law. The DG

      report set out in Matrimony.com Ltd. (supra) tells how Google

      selection process of keywords by advertisers.

      (supra) relates to specific advertising by law. The case

      concerned the name of particular university leading to the

      students getting confused. In that case it was stated that the

      sponsored links were displayed along with organic search

      results separated by a vertical line and within either a yellow or

      blue shaded box. In both the cases the search results are clearly

      designated as such or as &quot;sponsored results&quot;. Conversely, in the

      present case Google has refused to make such a demarcation. In

      that case the Court opined that selection of the university had a

      high financial cost and personal commitment, hence the

      students are expected to exercise a high degree of care, which is

      contrary to the present case and that these findings are contrary

      to the decision in Baker Hughes (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_100">      75.   Mr. Lall has submitted that the decision in Chocolat

      Lamontagne (supra) is concerned it has been clearly recorded

      therein that Google sells keywords which is contrary to their

      claims that keywords are never sold or purchased. In this case



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 65/137
       too Google used a yellow shaded box to identify the sponsored

      links. The plaintiff in that case had not been successful in

      showing customer confusion on account of defendant&#x27;s

      activities of a fundraising drive and use the of the term

      &quot;Alternative to&quot; the plaintiff&#x27;s brand.

      Commissioner of Income Tax, LNINDORD 2017 ITATND

      are useful in particular month of the year. He stated that it was

      recorded     that   Google&#x27;s     AdWords     program    changes

      FINDINGS

</p><p id="p_102">      77.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, and

      perused the record, the grievance of the plaintiff is when a user

      on internet searches for the plaintiff by typing &quot;Agarwal

       Packers and Movers&quot; despite the plaintiff having a registered

      trademark in its favour with regard to the said mark.        The

      website of the advertiser who may be a competitor of the

      plaintiff or having similar / deceptive mark pops up over and

      above the organic results pertaining to the plaintiff within the

      sponsored results by using Google&#x27;s services. This is because

      of the AdWord program of the defendant Nos.1 &amp; 3 under

      which an advertiser having AdWord account can create, select,

      keywords based on which their advertisement shows up as a

      sponsored link thereby diverting the traffic from the plaintiff&#x27;s

      website to the advertiser.
</p>
<p id="p_103">      78.   It is clear from the above that google being a search

      engine does give information about the number of searches

      made, using any popular keyword, that too in the same filed of

      business. So, assuming that, the advertiser chooses the keyword,

      but that is with the help of the information provided by Google.

      In the case in hand, the keyword is &quot;Agarwal Packers and

      Movers&quot;, which keyword, has been selected by the advertiser

      on the basis of statistical information provided by Google and

      the keyword is the registered mark of the plaintiff. This factum

       is not disputed by Mr.Sethi and Mr.Kathpalia. So, I proceed on

      the basis that the keyword being &quot;Agarwal Packers and

      Movers&quot; is also the registered trademark of the plaintiff. The

      question which needs to be determined is whether this use of

      the mark as a keyword shall amount to infringement of trade

      mark and or passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_104">      79.   The submission of Mr.Sethi was that the use of the

      keyword does not amount to &quot;use&quot; under the TM Act,

      inasmuch as <a href="/doc/188370/" id="a_43">section 2(2)(b)</a> requires a trademark to be used in a

      printed or other visual representation; before &quot;use&quot; under

      <a href="/doc/188370/" id="a_44">Section 2(2)(c)</a> can be examined. In other words, a trade mark

      used as a keyword which is invisible to the consumer, is not a

      use of the trademark. He also stated that Section 2(2)(c) of the

      TM Act requires the plaintiff&#x27;s trademark to be used as a part of

      any statement availability, provision or performance of its

      services for it to qualify as a trademark &quot;use&quot;.

      the use of printed or other visual representation of the mark in

      relation to the goods or services, but the reading of Sections

      29(6), 29(7) and 29(8) of the TM Act, it is seen that the

      disparagement held that on a reading of <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_56">Section 29</a> (9) it is clear

      that the said section provides that it is an infringement of the

      trademark by way of spoken use of the words which are

      contained in the trademark and the visual representation thereof.

      So, it follows, what is infringement, is not merely visual

      representation of the product in bad light under the provision of

      <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_57">Section 29(9)</a> but it is infringement of the trademark if the same

      is caused by way of spoken use of the words and the visual

      representation of the said words. Furthermore, a Division Bench

      the use of a mark in meta-tags or in advertising without the

      www.shaadi.com as part of meta-tags in the first defendant&#x27;s

      malafide use of plaintiff&#x27;s mark and name in the meta-tags of

                    Dishonesty is writ large on the actions of the 1st

<p id="p_126">             It must be stated here that the working of the meta-tags

      and also the keywords, as contended by Mr. Sethi is governed

       through the use of algorithms. The use of meta-tags within

      codes and keywords with respect to the sponsored search

      produces a desired result which is on the basis of Google&#x27;s

      algorithm. According to the Oxford Reference website,

      algorithm has been defined as, a &quot;documented series of steps

      which leads to the transformation of some data. For example, in

      order to calculate the sum of a series of numbers a possible

      algorithm would involve repeatedly adding the numbers to be

      summed to a running total. Computer programs are a

      manifestation of algorithms which allow them to be executed

      very quickly&quot;. Whereas the Collins online dictionary defines

      algorithm as, &quot;a series of mathematical steps, especially in a

      computer program, which will give you the answer to a

      particular kind of problem or question&quot;.
</p>
<p id="p_127">      88.   It is contended by Mr.Sethi, Google&#x27;s use of its

      advertising / sponsored result algorithm is different from that of

      the algorithm involved in producing organic search result

      through use of meta-tags. It is the case of Mr. Sethi that it is the

      use of Google&#x27;s algorithm in the AdWord program which

      triggers a sponsored result i.e., the advertisements, which is



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                      Page 77/137
       different from the use of meta-tags, which produces Google&#x27;s

      organic result. He stated that the sponsored result is triggered,

      based on many parameters, wherein each ad is given a quality

      score which is an aggregate of many factors such as relevancy

      of ad to search query, landing page quality, number of ad

      extensions, past history of the advertiser, geographical

      relevance of Ads to the webpage user; which goes to show that

      the AdWords Program is not driven by monetary consideration

      alone. No doubt, that meta-tags and keywords may be

      conceptually different however, both are used to show

      relevancy and appear on the top of the search engine result

      page, whether in organic or sponsored result. The question now

      is whether the use of mark as a keyword, results in diversion of

      traffic from the website of the original proprietor to that of the

      advertiser, this aspect has not been disputed / contested by

      Google, nor it has been argued that the end result from use of

      meta-tags and keywords is different; inasmuch as both are

      instrumental for a search result (whether organic or sponsored)

      to appear on the top of the search engine result page, except that

      sponsored links to the advertiser&#x27;s web page is marked with the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 78/137

      in the following manner:             .
</p>
<p id="p_128">      89.   I must also state that it is Google&#x27;s policy that it will only

      investigate the Ad content and not the keywords, the former

      includes the ad text and ad title but not the keywords. In order

      to assess the quality score, Google also sees the quality of the

      landing page which is primarily the website of the advertiser

      which may or may not have / display the infringed trademark.

      In other words, it is not the case of Google that as keywords are

      not visible to a consumer the use of same shall not amount to an

      infringement of trademark. However, under the AdWords

      Program they also see the landing page i.e., website of the

      advertiser, which in a given case shall have the infringing

      trademark, which is also used as a keyword, in such a scenario,

      Google cannot absolve themselves from the liability of ensuring

      that the keyword is not an infringement of trademark.

</p><p id="p_129">      90.   It is important to note, that had the AdWords Program of

      Google not existed, the only option available to the infringer /

      prospective advertiser in order to achieve the same result would

      have been to change their meta-tags (source coding) which has


CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                      Page 79/137
       already been held to be &quot;use&quot; of trademark and as such

      infringement. This aspect also highlights the fact that the same

      result is sought to be achieved through different means.

</p><p id="p_130">      91.   It may also be necessary for me to refer to the AdWords

      Policy of Google. Before I refer to the same, it is also necessary

      to mention that Google in their affidavits dated March 16, 2015,

      August 13, 2015 and August 03, 2017 has referred to two

      documents, viz. privacy policy and agreement of Google with

      the advertiser i.e., the AdWords Program Agreement. This

      Court may not require to go into the privacy policy and the

      agreement Google has with the advertiser as the same may not

      have any bearing on the issue which has arisen for

      consideration.

            use of that trademark in AdWords text ads. More help for

            As described in the section above, Google can investigate
            and may restrict the use of trademarks in ad text. This
            process does not apply to trademarks used in an ad&#x27;s

            an ad).
</p><p id="p_138">            Google will not investigate and restrict use of the
            trademark in display URLs because the presence of
            trademarked term within a URL may not necessarily
            constitute trademark use, such as in the case of post-
            domain paths or subdomains. Trademark owners can
            contact the advertiser directly regarding any concerns
            about display URLs. Please understand that Google is
            not in a position to be the arbiter of third-party disputes.
            Additionally, if the domain name contains or is similar to
            a trademark, but is actually owned by the advertiser, the
            trademark owner is the appropriate party to handle the
            matter, such as through the Uniform Domain Resolution

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_54">             Google recognizes the importance of trademarks. Our
            AdWords Terms and Conditions with advertisers
            prohibits intellectual property infringement by
            advertisers.     Advertisers are responsible for the
            keywords they choose to generate advertisements and
            the text that they choose to use in those advertisements.
            Google takes allegations of trademark infringement
            very seriously and as a courtesy we investigate matters
            raised by trademark owners.             Trademarks are
            territorial and apply only to certain goods or services.
            Therefore, different parties can own the same mark in
            different countries or different industries. Accordingly,
            in processing complaints, Google will ask the
            trademark owner for information regarding where the
            mark is valid and for what goods or services. Please
            note the following about our complaint process:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_55">                • The trademark owner doesn&#x27;t need to be a

      o When we receive a complaint from a trademark owner, our
      review is limited to ensuring that the advertisements at issue are
      not using a term corresponding to the trademarked term in the
      ad text or as a keyword. If they are, we will require the
      advertiser to remove the trademarked term from the ad text or
      keyword list and will prevent the advertiser from using the
      trademarked term in the future. Any such investigation will
      only affect ads served on or by Google.
</p><p id="p_148">      o We do not take any action in situations where an
      advertisement is being triggered by non-trademark terms even
      though the search query contains a trademarked terms. This
      occurrence stems from the fact that google allows advertisers to
      use a broad matching system to target their ads. For example,
      if an advertiser has selected the keyword &quot;shoes&quot; that
      advertiser&#x27;s ad will appear when a user enters the word
      &quot;shoes&quot; as a search query, regardless of other search terms
      that may be used. So, the ad would show if the user entered any
      of the following search queries: &quot;tennis shoes&quot;, &quot;red shoes&quot; or
      &quot;Nike shoes.&quot; This system eliminates the need for the
      advertiser to specify each of the myriad different search query
      combinations that are relevant to the ad.

      AdWords Counterfeit Goods Complaint in Sponsored Links&#x27;
      A Google advertiser is selling counterfeit goods. What is
      Google&#x27;s Counterfeit Goods policy?
</p><p id="p_155">      Google AdWords prohibits the sale or promotion of counterfeit
      goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is
      identical with or substantially indistinguishable from the
      trademark or another. Counterfeiters attempt to deceive
      consumers into believing the counterfeit is a genuine product of
      the brand owner or sell the goods as faux, replicas, imitations
      or clones of the original product. Counterfeit goods differ from

CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 90/137
       standard trademark infringement in that counterfeiters attempt
      to pass off their goods as the originals instead of merely using a
      similar mark in a confusing manner. Counterfeit goods differ
      from pirated products or copyright infringement because it is
      the trademark that is copied, rather than software, books,
      artwork, etc.
      We will investigate all reasonable complaints: our actions may
      include disapproving or disabling ads and / or terminating
      advertisers. Any such investigation and action will only affect
      ads served on or by Google.
</p><p id="p_156">      Please note, that upon request and approval, a complainant&#x27;s
      contact details may be forwarded to the affected advertiser(s).
      If you have concerns about the sale of counterfeit goods in
      AdWords ads, please file a complaint. Note: this information is

</p><p id="p_160">      94.   From the aforesaid, it is noted that in Consim I and

      Consim II, Google relied upon their policy that they would

      investigate any infringement of trademark in the Ad-titles, Ad-

      text and also keywords. The investigation with regard to

      keywords was only confined to countries listed in paragraph 93

      above. As per the Annexure-3 of the affidavit dated March 16,

      2015 the change in the AdWords trademark policy was brought

      about in the year 2015, wherein Google has changed the policy

      to mean that they shall &quot;not investigate or restrict the use

      trademark terms in keyword&quot;. It appears, the same is for the

      reason already stated above under the submissions of Mr.Sethi


CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 91/137
       i.e., the use of trademark as keywords does not imply &quot;use&quot;. I

      may also state here that as per Google&#x27;s policy they investigate

      use of the trademark as a keyword but i.e., only confined for the

      EU. This is in addition to the investigation undertaken for an

      infringement of trademark in Ad-title and Ad-text. From the

      above, it is clear that the fact that Google is investigating an Ad

      where use of trademark as a keyword is being used, there

      cannot be any reason why such a procedure is not followed in

      India. It appears this stipulation has been incorporated in their

      policy with regard to EU countries for the reason that there

      might be a chance of deception / confusion in a given Ad which

      pops-up on the basis of search query which has also been

      chosen as a keyword, which may trigger the advertisement

      consisting of the infringed trademark / references to it.

</p><p id="p_161">      95.   It can also be a case where the search query itself is a

      trademark which triggers the advertisement consisting of

      infringed trademark and / or material which may cause

      confusion. For example, a hypothetical advertiser may use the

             It may be seen from the above, that according to

      Google&#x27;s AdWords Policy only ad appearing at &#x27;C&#x27; would be

      treated as infringing their AdWords Policy. No doubt, it would

      also cause confusion in the minds of the average consumer who

      is looking for Beetroute Transport. Whereas the average

      consumer may differentiate Ad appearing at &#x27;B&#x27; to be not what

       was searched for. However, the Ads appearing at &#x27;A.1&#x27; and

      &#x27;A.2&#x27; with its combined use of parts of a mark and its variants

      in URL along with Ad-title may cause confusion in the minds

      of the average consumer, ride on the original owner&#x27;s goodwill

      and still not be investigated by Google as it would be deemed to

      be policy compliant according to them. This advertisement

      though not in violation of Google&#x27;s AdWords Policy may still

      cause confusion in the minds of the average consumer.

      Needless to say, that it is ultimately the owner of the trademark

      whose goodwill is getting tarnished.
</p>
<p id="p_173">      96.   It has to be noted that in such a scenario the

      advertisement in the sponsored result may not feature the

      trademark of the plaintiff as a whole which is why the overall

      effect of the Ad-content (Ad-title, Ad-text and URL) has to be

      taken into consideration, inasmuch as the idea that is sought to

      be conveyed, i.e., the advertiser is the plaintiff or somehow

      associated with the plaintiff. It is Google&#x27;s case that it does not

      investigate use of a trademarked term in the URL, i.e., Google

      restricts its investigation to Ad-text and Ad-title. Whereas it is

      trite law that use of trademarks in URLs or deceptively similar

      so, because any Ad-content consisting of Ad-title, Ad-text and

      URL which is likely to deceive or cause confusion to an

      average person with imperfect recollection [Ref: <a href="/doc/368264/" id="a_63">Amritdhara

      Pharmacy vs. Satyadeo Gupta</a>, AIR 1963 SC 449], in the

      context of India shall constitute infringement of trademark or

      passing off. A defence may be taken that the trademark of the

      plaintiff does not feature in the said advertisement. This defence

      may sound appealing at a first blush however, it can be seen

      from such advertisement that using the written part / words of a

      trademark an attempt is sought to be made to take advantage of

      the trademark owner&#x27;s goodwill. The judgment of the Supreme

      Court in the case of <a href="/doc/1114158/" id="a_64">Cadila Health Care Ltd. vs. Cadila

      trademarked term or use parts of the trademark interspersed

      with generic words in the Ad-title and / or Ad-text may

      constitute an infringement of a trademark and / or passing off.

      It is for this reason, reliance on foreign jurisprudence may be

      misplaced as the European Courts have held the average

      consumer to be normally informed and reasonably attentive

      [Ref: Google France SARL (supra)]. It is unclear that on what

      basis has a distinction been drawn by Google between certain

      countries with regard to the trademark policies so formulated

      and followed. Be that as it may, it is clear from Google&#x27;s EU

      and EFTA policy that Google provides a higher duty of care in

      a jurisdiction where large portions of the population are internet

      literate. This aspect further fortifies my finding as to why such

      a policy should be followed in India. Mr. Lall is right in relying

      on the judgment of Baker Hughes Ltd. &amp; Ors. (supra) to state

CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 99/137
       that even sophisticated consumers can be confused and the

      affidavit filed by Mr. Gaurav Bakshi dated October 27, 2015

      supports the proposition advanced by Mr. Lall.

</p><p id="p_179">      97.   Google has stated that it also factors in the quality of the

      landing page which is what the consumer would be directed to

      in case if he were to click on the sponsored results.

</p><p id="p_180">      98.   One of the pleas of Mr. Sethi was that the keyword

      planner tool is an optional software and keywords provided by

      the advertisers may have been provided by the keyword planner

      tool or may not be part of the keyword planner tool at all. This

      submission of Mr. Sethi has no bearing on the issue that is

      being decided by this Court in these applications, though on a

      prima facie view, in the eventuality a trademark is used as a

      keyword and what is the effect thereof in the context of TM

      Act. Suffice to state, if the keyword is not a trademark then

      there cannot be a question of infringement or passing off of the

      trademark. However, it is a conceded position that an advertiser

      can provide a keyword which is not part of the keyword planner

      tool only goes to show that in such a case registered trademarks

      including well known trademarks should be accorded a higher



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 100/137
       degree of protection by Google through its policies so as to

      ensure that the goodwill of the marks is safeguarded. In a

      situation where these safeguards are not in place the trademark

      owner must enter the Google AdWords program in order to

      protect its own goodwill, which is the case of the plaintiff as

      well.
</p>
<p id="p_181">      99.     Although Mr. Sethi has stated that the keyword planner

      tool is an optional software, however, the same is contrary to

      the stand taken by Google wherein it has been stated that the

      quality score of the advertisement is based on an aggregate of

      factors such as relevancy of Ads, keywords, quality of landing

      page, etc., it is clear that the advertiser has much to gain from

      bidding on trademark as keywords. The advertiser would want

      his own Ad to appear on top of the sponsored results list in

      order to gain maximum publicity. Even though, the keyword

      planner tool may not be mandatory but if not used by an

      advertiser, may result in poorer quality score of the Ad thereby

      reducing the chances for the Ad to appear in the sponsored

      result list. Resultantly, it may be stated that the same though not

      mandatory has become essential for an advertiser. It was also

       the plea of Mr. Sethi that trademarks are even permitted in ad-

      text by resellers, informational sites and authorized advertisers

      and as such may not constitute an infringement. This plea of

      Mr. Sethi is not vehemently opposed by Mr. Lall in his

      rejoinder submission while countering the reliance placed by

      Mr. Sethi on the Judgment of Merck &amp; Co. (supra) by stating

      that the defendant (advertisers) therein being the resellers of the

      plaintiff&#x27;s (Trademark owner&#x27;s) product can be permitted to use

      the trademark being a fair use. In other words, where the use of

      trademark as a keyword as fair / bonafide use, is an exception to

      infringement and / or passing off.
</p>
<p id="p_182">      100. Though Mr. Sethi did argue that Google algorithmically

      reviews the advertisements submitted in violation of Google ad

      policies such as ads supporting advertisements under the

      PCPNDT Act and the same are blocked, but the review does not

      remove the trademark infringing ads and the same are only

      investigated   after   complaint     under    the   trademark     /

      misrepresentation policy, but the same does not answer the

      issue raised by Mr. Lall that use of trademark as a keyword

      need to be reviewed and acted upon by Google. The

       advertisement not featuring a trademark and using trademark as

      a keyword even if not infringing Google&#x27;s policies creates

      confusion as to the origin of goods and services, the keyword

      along with the overall effect of the advertisement, (including

      Ad-title, Ad-text and URL) needs to be investigated in terms of

      paragraph 96 above.
</p>
<p id="p_183">      101. The plea of Mr. Sethi that if the use of trademarks as

      keywords were to be considered as use under the TM Act, then

      Section 47 of the TM Act would be defeated as it states, non-

      use of trademark for five years would open the possibility of

      cancellation proceedings; this plea is unmerited. In the case in

      hand, the issue pertains to the use of a trademark as keyword by

      a third party and not non-use of the trademark by the original

      owner. This Court need not go into this issue as the instant suit

      pertains to use of trademarks by third parties and not non-use of

      the trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_184">      102. I must at this stage state that it is a conceded position that

      up to 2009, Google in terms of its AdWords Policy as

      applicable to India did not allow the trademark as a keyword. It

      was only during the hearing of the Consim I before the Madras



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 103/137
       High Court, did Google come up with a policy that they shall

      not investigate the use of trademark as a keyword. But this

      aspect demonstrates that it was the thought process of Google

      that a trademark cannot be used as a keyword. In fact, it is a

      policy which is being followed by Google to the extent that they

      shall investigate the use of trademark as a keyword in EU &amp;

      EFTA countries and not in India.
</p>
<p id="p_185">      103. One of the pleas of Mr. Sethi was that the suit is bad for

      non-joinder of necessary parties such as Safe Packers and

      Movers, Gati Ltd., DTC Packers and Movers which according

      to him are the competitors of the plaintiff in the business. The

      plea is unmerited for the simple reason inasmuch as it is not the

      case of the plaintiff that the names as suggested by the plaintiff

      have in fact used the trademark of the plaintiff as a keyword to

      score over the plaintiff and pop-up above the plaintiff in the

      Google search result page. In the absence of parties which have

      bid for the trademark of the plaintiff and any statement on

      record to that effect that the entities so named by Mr. Sethi have

      bid upon the trademark of the plaintiff as a keyword, they are

      not a necessary party. Hence to that extent, there is no cause of



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 104/137
       action for the plaintiff against those entities to be made parties

      in this suit. Be that as it may, the submission of Mr. Sethi does

      suggest that the said entities being competitors of the plaintiff

      may bid for a trademark of the plaintiff as a keyword under the

      AdWords Program of Google. So, it is not disputed that a

      competitor may bid for a trademark of an entity to ensure its ads

      pop-up above the entity owning the trademark in the search

      results.
</p>
<p id="p_186">      104. Regarding the reliance placed by the parties on the case

      of Consim I and Consim II, the observations on the issue of

      functioning of meta-tags and keywords have been relied upon

      by this Court in the paragraphs above; however, it may be stated

      that the issue before the Madras High Court was that the

      Trademark of the plaintiff / appellant therein was appearing in

      the Adtext and Adtitle of the defendants / respondents therein.

      The Madras High Court also looked into the generic /

      descriptive nature of the words appearing in the Ad-text and

      Ad-title, which is not the case here. It is the stand taken by

      Google and so submitted by Mr. Sethi that the current Google

      policy states that &quot;Google does not allow any third party to put



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 105/137
       / publish / refer to a Trademark of an owner in the Adtext /

      Adtitle as per its policy&quot;. Since this statement has already been

      taken on record that the Trademarks of the plaintiff shall not

      appear in the Adtext and Adtitle, the factual situation has

      departed from what was the issue before the Madras High

      Court. I may also state that the appearance of the sponsored

      links was different from what it is today, i.e., earlier (at the time

      of Consim I and Consim II) the sponsored links appeared on

      the search engine results page with a yellow / blue background.

      The issue that whether these ads appeared on the top of the

      organic search results or on the right-hand side of the organic

      search results; Mr. Lall states that the former was the scenario,

      whereas the counsels for Google have pointed to the policy as

      existing then to state that the sponsored results could have also

      appeared on top of the search engine results page. Be that as it

      may, the position which exists today is that the sponsored links

      appear on top of the organic search results.

</p><p id="p_187">      105. The Division Bench of Madras High Court in Consim II

      while stating that the appellant / plaintiff is entitled for

      injunction observed that Google has been adopting double



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                     Page 106/137
       standards as the benefits given to the respondent Nos. 2 - 4

      (advertisers) therein were not given to the appellant (Trademark

      owner). Even in the instant case, it is unclear as to how exactly

      a sponsored link is given the first rank and placed on top of the

      sponsored search results, over above the organic search results

      i.e., it is unclear whether some components as listed out by Mr.

      Sethi being; bid amount, quality of landing page, relevancy of

      ads etc. are given more weightage than others. It has also not

      been explained by the defendants the functioning of their

      current policy (as available online) which also incorporates a

      broad search and negative search option [Ref. Paragraph 50

      expert witness testimony in judgment of Intercity Group (NZ)

      (supra)]. Since, it is Google&#x27;s proprietary algorithm, which

      controls not only the ranking, place of appearance and review of

      ads, this issue would have to be looked into at the time of trial.

      It is clear from the current Trademark policy of Google that it

      can &quot;either prohibit all use or allow all use of a particular term

      by an advertiser&quot; and despite such prohibition on use of a

      Trademark term in Adtext and Adtitle, there are possibilities of

      passing off. In Consim II it had been clearly stated by the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 107/137
       Madras High Court that it is clear that the search engine has

      control over selection of keywords by an advertiser but the

      search engine may not be aware of all the registered trademarks

      in various jurisdictions and in respect of various goods and

      services. I am in agreement with this observation and state that

      once the search engine has been made aware of a registered

      Trademark in a certain jurisdiction, it is incumbent upon the

      search engine to exercise a higher duty of care to ensure

      protection of the goodwill attached to such Trademark.

      Especially in light of the Judgment of a Coordinate Bench of

      this Court in the case of <a href="/doc/193227833/" id="a_66">DRS Logistics (P) Ltd. vs. Rajesh

      Agarwal &amp; Ors</a>., 2013 SCC Online Del 1299 wherein the mark

      of the plaintiff in paragraph 15 has been declared as a well-

      known trademark.
</p>
<p id="p_188">      106. While considering the judgments relied upon by the

      counsels for Google, I may refer to the judgment of the

      Supreme Court in the case of <a href="/doc/29725/" id="a_67">Forasol vs. Oil and Natural Gas

      Commission</a>, AIR 1984 SC 241, wherein the Court while

      recognizing the high persuasive value of decision of the foreign

      Courts cautioned by stating that the rule laid down in those



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                 Page 108/137
       particular cases must be judged in the Indian contextual

      background including the prevalent statutes and the legal

      procedure and the realities which exist in this country. This

      observation becomes relevant in the context of evaluating the

      aspect of confusion since in the cases of Google France SARL

      (Supra), L&#x27;Oreal SA (supra), Google Ireland Ltd. (supra),

      Cosmetic Warriors (supra), Intercity Group (NZ) (supra), NZ

      Fintech (supra), Private Career Training (supra), Chocolat

      Lamontagne (supra), Vancouver Community College (supra)

      and Cochrane Steel Products (supra), wherein the average

      consumer has been taken to be normally informed and

      reasonably attentive or liable to exercise a higher duty of care

      while searching on the internet, which as held by this Court

      above is not the definition of an average consumer in this

      country. Hence reliance on these judgments is misplaced.

</p><p id="p_189">      107. In so far as the reliance placed by Mr. Sethi on the

      judgment of the Australian Court in the case of Veda

      Advantage (supra) is concerned, he contended that keyword

      meta-tags are trademarked words embedded in the source code

      of a website by the creator, unlike the keywords used by Google



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                 Page 109/137
       in the AdWords Program, meta-tags are not entirely invisible.

      They can be located by someone who knows what to look for,

      whereas trademarked as keywords are invisible to the

      consumer; and they are not used as a trademark and their

      invisible use shall not amount to infringement, nor does a

      keyword denote connection in trade between the advertiser and

      the trademark owner. Keywords are also not being used to

      distinguish the service of one trader from another. Suffice to

      state, I have already in paragraph 88 above held that the effect

      of meta-tags and keywords is the same. I have also held above

      that even invisible use of a trademark would constitute &quot;use&quot;

      within the meaning of the provisions of the TM Act. That part,

      I have also held that the result of use of meta-tags and keywords

      is not different as both are instrumental for a search result to

      appear on the top of the search engine result page except that

      the sponsored links to the advertisers&#x27; web page is marked with

      the symbol denoting &quot;Ad&quot;, which is followed by the URL. So,

      the keyword even assuming is invisible, the effect it has for

      advertising is that the traffic of the website of the trademark

      owner is diverted to that of the advertiser which shall have the

       effect of passing off of the goods and services of the trademark

      owner as that of the advertiser.
</p>
<p id="p_190">      108.   Mr. Lall is right in stating that the keywords embedded

      in meta-tags are used in indexing of website, which is what

      keywords of Google AdWords Program are used for and in any

      case, Mr. Sethi has not been able to distinguish the precedents

      in the case of People Interactive (supra) and Mattel (supra).

      Even on the facts, this case can be differentiated since in that

      case the advertiser was providing services which were ancillary

      to the trademark owner. In other words, the trademark owner

      was providing financial services related to credit rating whereas

      the advertiser conducted a business assisting the consumers

      with poor credit rating and rectifying errors in the credit reports

      given by the proprietor of the trademark. Furthermore, it was

      stated that an ordinary and reasonable consumer in the context

      of Australia would not get confused between the organic search

      result and the sponsored search result, which appears within a

      yellow ad box. Even in that case the Court has stated in

      paragraphs 253 and 263 that certain words in the Adtext

      including the single word trademark of the owner which was

       visible, suffixed with generic words was likely to cause

      confusion. The definition of an average consumer in India has

      been well settled. For the reasons above, this judgment has no

      applicability in the facts of this case.

<p id="p_191">      109. In so far as the reliance placed by Mr. Sethi in the case of

      Reed Executive (supra) making similar submissions that

      invisible use may not be use at all as no meaning is being

      conveyed to anyone and it is only when the user clicks through

      the advertisement, he finds misleading material on web page of

      the advertiser and not on advertisement appearing on search

      engine results page and the same may not be attributable to

      Google, is concerned, I have already held, that even invisible

      use of trademark more specifically would constitute a use and in

      fact the precedents being available in the country in the form of

      People Interactive (supra), Mattel (supra), Amway India

      (supra) and <a href="/doc/99622088/" id="a_68">Christian Louboutin SAS vs. Nakul Bajaj &amp; Ors</a>.,

      (2018) 253 DLT 728 the reliance place on the judgment of Reed

      Executive (supra) is misplaced. The issue is well settled. The

      question is not when the user clicks through the advertisement,

      he finds misleading material on web page of advertiser, but



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                  Page 112/137
       whether by the use of invisible use of a trademark, the

      advertisement of the advertiser scores a march over the organic

      search result, where the website of the trademark owner

      appears. I may state here, Mr. Lall by drawing my attention to

      paragraph 140 of the judgement has stated that the Court has

      clearly stated that use as a reserved word can be regarded as use

      in course of trade, the Court has not expressed its opinion. In

      any case, the law in this regard even in that jurisdiction has

      changed since the judgments of the European Court of Justice in

      the cases of Google France SARL (supra), L&#x27;Oreal SA (supra)

      and the judgment in the case of <a href="/doc/135552291/" id="a_69">Interflora Inc. vs. Marks &amp;

      Spencer</a>, [2015] F.S.R. 10. Needless to state that this case can

      be differentiated on the ground of the average consumer being

      normally informed and reasonably attentive. Be that as it may,

      the laws prevailing in the UK are different and the issue in the

      present case has to be judged in the context of Indian Laws and

      precedents [Ref: Forasol (supra)]

</p><p id="p_192">      110. While relying on the judgment of Merck &amp; Co. (supra),

      Mr. Sethi stated that the internal use of trademark does not

      constitute as trademark use. The United States District Court

      was selling the trademarked drug &quot;ZOCOR&quot; for cholesterol

      medication which was manufactured by the Canadian affiliate

      of the trademark owner and the same does not amount to

      infringement in context of the laws prevalent in the United

      States. Based on the judgments delivered by the Courts in India,

      this reliance is totally misplaced. I must state here that Mr. Lall

      has fairly conceded, the fair use of trademark may not constitute

      infringement inasmuch as there is nothing wrong in the

      purchase of trademark as keyword where the advertisers sold

      medicines manufactured by the trademark owner.

      sale, signs, corresponding to trademarks by the online service

      provider. This judgment may not be applicable to the facts of

      this case as in that case, the trademark was &quot;Mr. Spicy&quot; and the

      owner attempted to sue third-party and Yahoo for use of

      descriptive words such as &quot;spicy&quot;, &quot;spicy soup&quot;, etc., as

       keywords.      Firstly, respondent therein was Yahoo and not

      Google. Even the policy that is being followed by Yahoo has

      not been placed on record. That apart, it was held that there is

      no infringement if the keyword is going to be attached to goods

      and services which are different from those protected in that

      case. In any case, the weakness of such a descriptive mark was

      held to be restricted to goods and services for which it is

      registered.

      space such as yellow book and such practice is not misleading.

      Suffice to state the judgment is distinguishable on facts

      inasmuch as the Court held that the students who are concerned

      with the Ads had to exercise higher duty of care while

      distinguishing ads from the organic search result and secondly

      the sponsored result which was appearing in a yellow shaded

       box was sufficient to distinguish the website of the parties and

      the parties before the Court were the advertiser / owner and not

      Google or YAHOO or any search engine.              In Chocolat

      Lamontagne (supra), the submission of Mr. Sethi was,

      keyword advertising is not different from accepted market

      practice. In this case too the search results appearing which

      were in French in the sponsored results were clearly

      distinguishable as the hyperlinks listed under the heading

      sponsored links were preceded by the phrase &#x27;Alternative to

      Lamontagne chocolate and other products&#x27;         Similar is the

      position in so far as the judgment relied upon by Mr. Sethi in

      the case of Vancouver Community College (supra).            The

      Courts of Canada have also proceeded in terms of Canadian

      laws on the subject and also on a premise that the average

      consumer is internet literate and can differentiate sponsored

      results from organic results. The Court in this case however,

      made certain findings which may be noted such as in paragraph

      55, the aspect of confusion is to be determined on the search

      engine result page and the Court came to a conclusion in that

      case, the components of the tort of passing off were met.

       Therefore, one cannot overlook the fact that there is a

      possibility of confusion even in cases where the consumers are

      aware of the functioning of search engines. These judgments do

      not act as a bulwark for the case as presented by the counsels

      for Google.

<p id="p_196">      113. Reliance placed by Mr. Sethi on the Judgement of

      Google France SARL (supra) to contend that the use of

      trademark as back-end trigger does not amount to infringement

      and passing off. According to him, Google has not used their

      mark in course of its trade or in relation to goods or services in

      respect of which the trademark is registered or within its

      advertising or in a manner to have taken unfair advantage or in

      a manner detrimental to distinctive character or repute of

      plaintiff&#x27;s trademarks or in a manner likely to be taken as being

      used as a trademark. In other words, Mr. Sethi agrees that the

      use of trademark as a keyword held to be use, but only where

      the advertisement does not enable an average internet user or

      enables the user with great difficulty to ascertain the origin of

      goods or services referred therein.

      the judgment on which reliance has been placed by Mr. Sethi is

      from a European Court. The observation of the Court has to be

      read in the context of a purchaser in Europe unlike a purchaser

      in India. It is a settled law that an average consumer in India is

      of average intelligence and imperfect recollection [Ref.

      Amritdhara Pharmacy (supra)]

      (supra) and Google Ireland Ltd. (supra) is concerned, similar

      would be my conclusion as concluded by me in the case of

      Google France SARL (supra), inasmuch as the issue before the

      European Court of Justice was to an extent similar to that in the

      present case, wherein the trademark owner had agitated that

      third parties had been using the trademark of the owner as the

      keyword in order to feature prominently on the search engine

      results page. However, the Court had examined this issue in the

      context of the average consumer in Europe and the European

      Laws / Directives wherein in the Court primarily examined the

      adverse impact of use of such mark on functions of a trademark.

      However, there was a caveat that even in such a scenario the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 118/137
       Court had remarked in paragraph 83 that whether the function

      of a trademark is adversely affected would depend on a

      particular manner in which the Ad is presented and such

      presentation does not enable the average consumer therein to

      ascertain the origin of goods and services.    The Court further

      went on to note that in cases where the Ad does not suggest an

      economic link but remains vague to the origin of goods and

      services and the internet consumer is unable to determine on the

      basis of the advertising link and commercial message attached

      thereto whether the advertiser is a third party with regard to the

      proprietor of the trademark or not, or economically related to it,

      or is a third-party, the Court held that the conclusion must be

      that there is an adverse effect on the function of the trademark.

      This question, the European Court of Justice left open for the

      National Courts to assess on a case-by-case basis and even the

      role played by the service provider whether neutral or not is to

      be assessed by the National Courts. To this extent I am in

      agreement with the findings in Google France SARL (supra).

      The question of neutrality of the service provider in this case

      being Google would be subject matter of trial. A Coordinate

<blockquote id="blockquote_64">            &quot;82. In the world of e-commerce, IP owners face
            challenging times. This is because sellers of
            counterfeit or infringing products seek shelter
            behind the platform&#x27;s legitimacy, like in the case of
            Darveys com. Darveys com is involved in the
            promotion and sale of luxury products. The seller is
            located on a foreign shore. It is not even clear as to
            whether the seller is in fact selling a genuine
            product. As stated above, Darveys com promotes the
            products to its members who sign up on Darveys
            com. Without becoming a member, one cannot effect
            a purchase on Darveys com. In such cases giving
            exemptions of <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_70">Section 79</a> would in fact amount to
            legalizing the infringing activity. The seller is not
            known, the person from whom the seller purchases
            the goods is not known. It is also not known if the
            product is genuine, though Darveys com represents
            to be same to be genuine. In view of these factors,
            Darveys com cannot be termed as an intermediary
            that is entitled to protection under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_71">Section 79</a> of the
            IT Act. The use of the mark, Christian Louboutin,
            the name, the photograph of the founder, without the
            permission of the Plaintiff, and without ensuring

             that the products which are sold are in fact genuine,
            would constitute violation of Plaintiff&#x27;s rights. The
            Defendant has relied on a judgement of a Ld. Single
            Judge in Christian Louboutin v. Abubacker, 250
            (2018) DLT 475 the court was considering
            protection for the red sole trademark. In the said
            judgement the court held that the red sole mark is
            not distinctive as there can be no monopoly on the
            colour red. The present suit does not relate to the
            red sole mark in isolation but the use of the plaintiffs
            marks, name of its name of its founder, use of the
            words constituting the mark in various ways
            including on the website, images, packaging
            material, invoice etc. by the Defendant which is an
            e-commerce platform. Thus the said judgement does
            not help the Defendant in the present case.</blockquote><p id="p_201">
</p><p id="p_202">            83. Meta-tagging: The plaintiff has relied upon a
            judgement in respect of meta-tags. A single judge of
            the Delhi High Court has held that use of meta-tags
            is illegal as it enables the Defendant to ride on the
            reputation of the Plaintiff. Meta tags are links which
            are provided using keywords. If a trade name is
            used as a keyword and a link is provided, the
            website comes up whenever a customer searches for
            the said trade mark. The trade mark used in the
            code as a keyword is invisible to the end-user or
            customer. Such use, though invisible to the


CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                       Page 121/137
             customer, has been held to be illegal in the case of
            <a href="/doc/86466712/" id="a_72">Kapil Wadhwa v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd</a>., 194
            (2012) DLT 23. The Plaintiff claims that when a web
            user enters the Plaintiffs mark in a search engine
            such as Google, Darveys com website is amongst
            the search results and an analysis of the code shows
            that the marks of the Plaintiff are used as meta-
            keyword-tags, with a view to increasing the hits
            which the Defendant&#x27;s website obtains from search
            engines like Google.
</p><p id="p_203">            84. The trademark owner loses its huge customer
            base especially in the case of luxury products. If the
            products turn out to be counterfeit or not up to the
            mark, then it is the trademark owner&#x27;s brand equity
            which is diluted. The seller himself does not suffer.
            Such immunity is beyond what is contemplated to
            intermediaries under <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_73">Section 79</a> of the IT Act. While
            <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_74">Section 79</a> of the IT Act is to protect genuine
            intermediaries, it cannot be abused by extending
            such protection to those persons who are not
            intermediaries and are active participants in the
            unlawful act. Moreover, if the sellers themselves are
            located on foreign shores and the trade mark owner
            cannot exercise any remedy against the said seller
            who is selling counterfeits on the e-commerce
            platform, then the trade mark owner cannot be left
            remediless.&quot;

      case of Google as contended by Mr. Sethi that Google is an

      intermediary is unmerited, surely there is an obligation on part

      of Google to ascertain that the keyword chosen by the advertiser

      is not a trademark and even if it is a trademark the same has

      been licensed / assigned.     Not ascertaining this factum by

      Google, it cannot take / seek the benefit of exemption under

      <a href="/doc/814605/" id="a_75">Section 79</a> of the IT Act as it has been held in the above

      judgment as amounting to legalising the infringing activity.

      That apart, the conclusion of the Coordinate Bench in

      paragraphs of 83 and 84 shall apply on all fours to the facts of

      this case. In view of this conclusion, the plea of Mr. Sethi that

      Google is not an arbiter of third party disputes and shall not

      investigate complaints of violation of trademark infringement is

      unmerited, hence rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_206">      117. The reliance placed by Mr. Sethi in Cosmetic Warriors

      (supra) to contend that use of third-party trademarks as

      keyword does not constitute trademark violation is also not

      appealing. This judgment seems to be an after effect of the


CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                   Page 123/137
       decisions in Google France SARL (supra) and L&#x27;Oreal SA

      (supra) since I have dealt with the issue in the above paragraphs

      the reliance on European Law would not help the case of

      Google. In any case, the matter therein pertained to Amazon

      and its advertising policies which is not the case here. The

      Court had considered three scenarios for a possibility of

      confusion, out of which only the first and second scenarios are

      of interest.   The first and second scenario pertained to

      sponsored links on intermediary websites wherein a consumer

      would be able to see the trademark in the advertisement and in

      the other where the consumer cannot see the trademark term in

      the advertisement. In the case of the former it was held to be

      detrimental to the function of a trademark and in the latter, it

      was stated that the consumers would be aware of appearances of

      sponsored links. Whether this awareness exists in this country is

      unclear and would be subject to Trial especially so when there

      are chances of the advertisements of the trademark owner often

      appearing in the sponsored results with blurred lines of

      distinction between sponsored results and organic results in a

      case where an average Indian consumer has specifically typed a



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                  Page 124/137
       trademarked term. The third scenario concerned the layout of

      Amazon website and the appearances of the trademark therein

      that too when there was no overt statement that Amazon did not

      sell the products of the trademark owner, which is not a

      question for consideration before this Court.

</p><p id="p_207">      118. In Intercity Group (NZ) (supra) and NZ Fintech

      (supra), the same were relied upon by Mr. Sethi to contend that

      trademark as keyword are not seen or known or understood by a

      consumer and the same is not be taken as anything let alone

      amounting to use of trademark. The said judgment is in the

      context of laws of New Zealand which are different from those

      in India and Mr. Lall is right in contending that Section 89 of

      the New Zealand Act does not include advertisement as

      infringement, which position is otherwise in this country as I

      have referred to the provisions of <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_76">Section 29</a> (6) and <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_77">Section 29</a>

      (8) of the TM Act. Even in Intercity Group (NZ) (supra), the

      average consumer has been taken to be well-informed and

      reasonably observant but even so the Court has observed that

      there may exist a possibility of confusion as the case before the

      New Zealand Court was that the advertiser had bid on the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                  Page 125/137
       trademark as keyword being InterCity, which appeared on the

      search engine results page along with the website of the

      advertiser. In NZ Fintech (supra), the plaintiff therein had

      alleged that the defendant therein was using its mark

      &quot;MOOLA&quot; as a keyword.           Whether such use resulted in

      sufficient number of consumers perceiving such use by the

      defendant therein to be a use of the trademark, was to be a

      matter of trial. These judgments therefore are distinguishable

      on facts. However, the New Zealand Court too in both the

      aforementioned judgments had interpretated their own law to

      mean that the use of trademark as a keyword, amounts to use in

      the course of trade. The question which further needs to be

      tried through the trial is whether there is a difference in the

      search engine results page when searching with capital letters,

      spaces, symbols such as hyphens, etc. and the difference

      thereof.
</p>
<p id="p_208">      119. In so far as the reliance placed in Cochrane Steel

      Products (supra) is concerned, Mr. Sethi contended that it is

      unnatural for a consumer to get mislead by a clearly labelled Ad

      which identifies the source. If neither the advertisement nor the



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                  Page 126/137
       advertisers&#x27; website contains any reference to the trademark

      owners products or services, then no confusion exists nor there

      is any evidence that any actual confusion existed and as per

      common market practice, advertisements are placed close to the

      competitors&#x27; advertisements in a yellow book. The trademark

      of the appellant therein was &quot;CLEARVU&quot; which was itself an

      unregistered mark. Wherein it was also held by the Court that

      the organic search result were clearly distinguishable from that

      of the sponsored search result. The said judgment has no

      applicability as the judgment has held that the average

      consumer in South Africa to be a person who is normally

      informed and reasonably observant internet user, which may not

      be the position in the Indian context. The case of Esquire

      Electronics Ltd. (supra) is distinguishable from the case at

      hand as the issue to be decided by the South African Court

      pertained to trading in prerecorded video tapes upon which a

      registered trademark was recorded through magnetic signals.

      Needless to state, that the facts at hand are very different to the

      one sought to be relied upon by the counsels for Google even so




CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                    Page 127/137
       the judgment has to be read in the context of the South African

      Laws.
</p>
<p id="p_209">      120. Reliance has been placed in Nebo (supra) by Mr. Sethi to

      contend that the keywords do not form part of advertisement

      cannot be used for identifying a particular ad as the same

      keyword may be used for multiple advertisements. Users do

      not know the basis of which keyword, a particular

      advertisement is shown or which keyword co-relates with the

      said advertisement. In other words, keywords do not create a

      possibility of confusion of any products of owner with that of

      the advertisement. I am not in agreement with the submission

      made by Mr. Sethi more so with regard to my conclusions

      above and in the context of law laid down by the Indian Courts

      of which a reference has been given above. Even on facts this

      case is distinguishable as the search engine involved in the said

      case was Yandex and the policies governing the advertisements

      through keywords is different from that of Google in the present

      case. Be that as it may, the statutory law governing trademark

      law is very different in Russia as compared to that of the Indian

      Laws.    As I have already concluded above, that use of



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                  Page 128/137
       trademarks as keywords amounts to use in the course of trade in

      terms of the TM Act and the judgments of the Indian Courts in

      this regard, this case provides no succour to the case of the

      counsels for Google.
</p>
<p id="p_210">      121. By relying upon the judgment in the case of Alzheimer&#x27;s

      Disease and Related Disorders Association (supra) the

      contention of Mr. Sethi primarily is that trademark as keywords

      alone without additional behavior that confuses consumers is

      not actionable. In Jive Commerce LLC (supra), consumers are

      unlikely to be confused as the sponsored links clearly marked as

      Ad and the owner&#x27;s Ad being directly below the sponsored

      search result in the organic search result there cannot be any

      confusion. These judgements of the Courts of the United States

      of America do not avail the case of Google, since in the case of

      Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease and Related Disorders Association

      (supra) the Court therein had opined that the mark in question

      was weak and since the consumers were searching for a generic

      term, therefore the likelihood of confusion was less. Similar

      position exits in the case of Jive Commerce LLC (supra)

      wherein the mark of the plaintiff / owner was not registered, it



CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                 Page 129/137
       remained unclear under which class the said mark therein was

      to be categorised even in which case the Court came to a

      conclusion that the mark was either descriptive or suggestive

      which is not the case here. Similar is the position in Passport

      Health (supra) where the mark of the trademark owner being

      &quot;PASSPORT HEALTH&quot; was considered to be weak and the

      Court had observed that the sponsored results could easily be

      differentiated from the organic results as they were appearing

      on the right-hand side titled with the words &quot;related searches&quot;,

      this position no longer exits as of now.
</p>
<p id="p_211">      122. Mr. Sethi has also placed reliance on the judgment in the

      case   of    Matrimony.com     Ltd.   (supra)   of   Competition

      Commission of India to contend that Google keyword bidding

      process promotes competition and provides some benefits and

      choice as compared to traditional advertising.          To this

      submission, Mr. Sethi has accepted the fact that the trademark

      can be used as a keyword to divert the traffic from the website

      of the owner to that of the advertiser to encourage competition

      this according to this Court may in a given case amount to

      infringement and / or passing off.

</p><p id="p_214">       123. Mr. Sethi has relied upon Havells India Ltd. (supra) to

      contend that advertisement is a part of free speech and right to

      carry any business. Competitors use of trademark is protected

      within the ad-text of a competitor provided the competitive

      advertisement under <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_78">Section 29</a> (6) and 29 (8) of TM Act are

      complied with. There cannot be any dispute, that the

      advertisement is part of free speech, but surely that free speech

      cannot be at the cost of the trademark of an owner which

      amounts to a misleading advertisement.
</p>
<p id="p_215">      124. Fischerwerke GmbH &amp; Co. (supra) is on similar

      proposition that use of third-party trademarks does not

      constitute trademark infringement. Reliance on this case is

      misplaced due to the reason that firstly, that the search engine

      involved in that case was Baidu and not Google and; secondly

      the advertising policy of the said search engine has not been

      produced before this Court and even the law related to

      trademarks in that case is different to the case at hand. As per

      the stand of Google that up to 2013, even they did not allow the

      trademarks to be used as keywords in China, whether this




CS (COMM) 1/2017                                                  Page 131/137
       position changed after the judgment in the relied upon case is

      unclear.
</p>
<p id="p_216">      125. In so far as the submission of Mr. Sethi that Google

      investigates   the   Ads    which    under   its   counterfeit   /

      misrepresentation policy is concerned, the same does not

      answer the use of trademark as keyword by an advertiser as

      infringement of trademark. Even if Google under the

      misrepresentation policy investigates an infringing Ad but only

      after a complaint, there is no doubt that the usage of trademark

      as keyword results in diversion of the traffic from the website of

      the trademark owner to the webpage of the advertiser which

      causes prejudice to the owner of the trademark in terms of

      goodwill and credibility with respect to the services and should

      be investigated by Google. In a way the advertiser through

      oblique motives is cashing upon the goodwill of the trademark

      owner for his own benefit and through which process Google is

      earning revenue and as such is equally liable for the omissions

      and commissions of the advertiser. It also follows that when the

      use of trademark as a keyword constitutes infringement /

      passing off which amounts to violation of rights accrued in

       favour of the proprietor under the provisions of the TM Act

      then   on    the   same   analogy    that   Google    investigates

      advertisements which are prohibited under law, Google should

      also investigate the advertisements in this case as well.

      trademark of plaintiff as a keyword the traffic from the webpage

      of the plaintiff is being diverted to the webpage of the

      competitor / advertiser which means that a normal consumer

      who on typing the trademark of plaintiff as a search query was

      led to a webpage which had caused confusion regarding the

      origin of the webpage, whether belonging to the plaintiff or not.

      In cases of intellectual property, the Courts must also be

      mindful of the fact that it is ultimately the public at large which

      gets cheated and feels the brunt of spurious goods and services

      in the market [Ref: <a href="/doc/1752560/" id="a_79">Hindustan Pencils (P) Ltd. vs. India
