<p id="p_82">                      (16)This Court will first deal with Issue [D]. The authority for granting

                          approval to run Engineering Courses is within exclusive domain of the

                          AICETE. The same is very clear from the Scheme of the AICTE Act,

                          1987. The law on this issue is well settled and it does not require any

                          further elaboration. The Anna University is the Affiliating Body for both

                          the petitioner – Institutions / Colleges. The Anna University being the

                          Affiliating Body, will act within its own sphere and it cannot trench upon

                          areas which are exclusively within the domain of AICTE. The interplay

                          of the powers of the AICTE and the Affiliating University has been dealt

                                 that the 1987 Act is referable to Entry 66 of List I. The

                                 field of “determination of standards in institutions for

                                   “30. … Thus, so far as these matters are
                                concerned, in the case of the institutes

                             to show that the Council (AICTE) created

</p><p id="p_101">                               24.The consistent view of this Court has
                          been that where both Parliament and State
                          Legislature have the power to legislate, the
                          <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_25">Central Act</a> shall take precedence in the
                          matters which are covered by such
                          legislation and the State enactments shall
                          pave way for such legislations to the extent
                          they are in conflict or repugnant. As per the
                          established canons of law, primacy of the
                          <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_26">Central Act</a> is undisputable which
                          necessarily implies primacy of AICTE in the
                          field of technical education. Statutes like the
                          present one as well as the National Council
                          for Teachers Education Act, 1993, the
                          <a href="/doc/118783942/" id="a_27">Medical Council of India Act</a>, 1956, etc. fall
                          within the ambit of this canon of law. The
                          AICTE is the authority constituted under the
                          <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_28">Central Act</a> with the responsibility of
                          maintaining operational standards and
                          judging the infrastructure and facilities
                          available     for   imparting     professional
                          education. It shall take precedence over the
                          opinion of the State as well as that of the
                          University. The concerned department of the
                          State and the affiliating university have a
                          role to play, but it is limited in its
                          application. They cannot lay down any
                          guidelines or policies in conflict with the
                          Central statute or the standards laid down by
                          the Central body. The State can frame its
                          policies, but such policy again has to be in
                          conformity with the direction issued by the
                          Central body. Though there is no such
                          apparent conflict in the present case, yet it
                          needs to be clarified that grant of approval

                          has vehemently urged that the said judgment would
                          bind only in relation to the increased intake of seats
                          and not in relation to the decrease or reduction of
                          seats, which falls within the domain of the
                          University. We are unable to accept this submission
                          inasmuch as the power to increase the intake also
                          includes the power to decrease the intake capacity.
                          The power to do on general principles also includes
                          the power to undo, whatever power is being
                          exercised under the 1987 Act. We, therefore, find it
                          difficult to read a parallel exercise of power in the
                          hands of the University in the matter of reduction,

                          shortcomings noticed by them to the notice of
                          the AICTE and seek appropriate action

                          the affiliation to the first petitioner college is
                          wholly untenable and is required to be set

                          of Trichy Engineering College (supra), in paragraph
                          34 to 38 thereof. A careful reading of paragraph 20
                          in the judgment in the case of Parshvanath
                          Charitable Trust (supra) would also indicate that the
                          Apex Court has observed that the role of AICTE vis-
                          a-vis     the   Universities     is     only     advisory,
                          recommendatory and one of providing guidance,

                          as an authority empowered to issue and enforce any
                          sanctions by itself. We find these observations to be
                          weighing enough to grant sufficient authority to the
                          University to take appropriate action in the event
                          any such deficiency is found, but the route and the
                          process of taking such action has to be through the
                          AICTE itself by tendering appropriate information

                                   timely and for taking action by the AICTE. We may,
                                   therefore, also observe that the AICTE, upon
                                   receiving such information, shall be bound to
                                   consider and pass appropriate orders and not shelve
                                   the issue by avoiding to take action on a report
                                   submitted by the University, as it would directly
                                   affect the affiliation of the University, the running of
                                   the courses and also importantly the fate of the
                                   students, who are to be admitted against such
                                   courses. We hope and trust that the University and

                          submitted that the Anna University ventured into an area within the

<p id="p_111">                      (23)It is one thing to conduct an inspection by the Anna University and

                          entirely another thing to conduct the inspection and also act upon it and

                          this is where the authority and jurisdiction of the University becomes

                          questionable. The judgments extracted supra makes it very clear that the

                          Anna University must act more in coalition and coordination with the

                          AICTE and it cannot take upon itself the authority to make decisions on

                          grievance of the petitioner – Institutions / Colleges is that the Anna

                          University has over-reached its authority and has assumed the powers

                          over the areas which are in the exclusive domain of the AICTE.

                          complying with the principles of natural justice.        To that extent, the

                          deficiencies pointed out by the Anna University since this Court finds

                          that the impugned Letters are vitiated on the ground of violation of

<p id="p_118">                      (29)Insofar as Issue [B] is concerned, the AICTE ought to have

                          independently conducted an inspection after receiving the Report from

                          the Anna University. The AICTE cannot piggy back on the Report of the

                          Anna University and take a decision to bring the petitioner – Institutions /

                          Colleges under the ''No Admission'' category. This is more so due to the

                          fact that the AICTE did not find any deficiency on any front and the same

                          is clear from the Reports generated on 09.03.2020 and 10.03.2020

                          respectively from the web portal of the AICTE. These Reports were

                          generated at the time when the AICTE was in the process of extending

                          the approval of the petitioner – Institutions / Colleges for the Academic

                          year 2020-21. The AICTE also committed the mistake of relying upon

                          the Report of the Anna University even without putting the petitioner –

                          Institutions / Colleges on notice. The AICTE ought to have at least sent a

                          explanation and thereafter, the AICTE could have taken a decision and

                          informed the petitioner – Institutions / Colleges. Since this was not

                          done, the impugned Proceedings of the AICTE dated 30.06.2020,

                          bringing the     petitioner – Institutions / Colleges under the ''No

                          Admission'' category, is also liable to be interfered with.

                          same was not done, this Court has held the same to be bad and liable to

                          be interfered with.     Therefore, it is obvious that the           petitioner –

                          Institutions / Colleges were entitled to receive a notice from the Anna

                          University and the AICTE by providing them with all the information and

                          the   petitioner – Institutions / Colleges should have been given an

                          opportunity to give their explanation before the final decision was taken.

                          09.03.2020 and 10.03.2020 respectively, shows that the AICTE

                          extension of affiliation. One of the screen shots taken from the AICTE
