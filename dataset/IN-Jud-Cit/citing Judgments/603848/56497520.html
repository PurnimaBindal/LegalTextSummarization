OTT platform. The trailer of the said Web Series is stated to have been

uploaded on 21.06.2022 by Defendent No.1 on its You Tube channel

which also revealed that all episodes of the said Web Series shall be

available on the OTT platform on 01.07.2022. He has submitted that a

perusal of the trailer of the Web Series makes it clear that the

Respondents have utilized substantial material from the Applicant&#x27;s

original works, being the Scripts, referred to in the plaint as &quot;Modern

Times&quot; (Script No.1) and &quot;Bungalow No.69&quot; (Script No.2). A cease and

desist legal notice dated 23.06.2022 has been issued by the Plaintiff

claiming copyright infringement by the Defendants&#x27; Web Series of the

Plaintiff&#x27;s Scripts and its underlying works.

<p id="p_3">
2            Mr. Kamod has submitted that the First Script titled &quot;Modern

Times&quot; was registered by the Plaintiff with the Screen Writer&#x27;s Association

on 09.01.2015. The Plaintiff further developed the &quot;Modern Times&quot; First

Script so as to improve the existing version of the same and thereby

developing a revised version thereof and same was registered in 2016

under registration No.249779 (R-17304). In paragraphs 21 and 22 of the

plaint it is stated that the Plaintiff had narrated Script No.1 to one Ms.

Tannishtha Chatterjee and had also shared a copy of Script No.1 (more

particularly &quot;Modern Times&quot; Second Script) with Ms. Tannishtha

Chatterjee by Plaintiff&#x27;s e-mail dated 14.12.2016. The receipt was duly

acknowledged by Mrs. Tannishtha Chatterjee and this is borne out from

e-mail dated 14.12.2016 sent to the Plaintiff.      It is further stated in

paragraph 22 that Ms. Tannishtha Chatterjee played a pivotal role in

television Series called &quot;Cartel&quot; which was produced by Defendant No.2

and written by Defendant No.3. Mr. Kamod has submitted that this shows

a clear nexus between Ms. Tennisatha Chatterjee and the Defendant Nos.2

and 3.
</p>
<p id="p_5">
3             Mr. Kamod has further submitted that on 26.03.2019

Plaintiff&#x27;s   independently written story titled &quot;Bungalow No.69&quot; was

registered with the Screen Writer&#x27;s Association on 26.03.2019.                   The

Plaintiff further developed the &quot;Bungalow No.69&quot; story into a full-fledged,

detailed screenplay and registered the same with Screen Writer&#x27;s

Association on 18.01.2020. The screenplay was further improved by the

Plaintiff and registered with Screen Writer&#x27;s Association on 09.03.2020.


4             Mr. Kamod has referred to paragraph 23 of the Plaint wherein

it is stated that Script No.2 has been shared with Actors and Producers as

well as Owners of Talent Company and Creative Directors. Thus, access

to the public was there. He has submitted that in any event the Plaintiff

who is claiming relief of copyright infringement does not have to make

out a case of access to the Defendants.

point of time then the impugned work jointly developed by Defendant

Nos.2 and 3. He has submitted that this is borne out from the affidavit in

reply of Defendant No.2 where it is stated that Defendant Nos.2 and 3

jointly developed the Script/Screenplay then titled &quot;Cheaters&quot; (impugned

work) in July, 2020 and August, 2020.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
6           Mr. Kamod has submitted that the highlight of the Plaintiff&#x27;s

work in Script Nos.1 and 2 have been detailed in paragraph 19 of the

plaint. He has submitted that comparison of the Plaintiff&#x27;s work in the

said Scripts with that of &quot;Miya Biwi aur Murder&quot; trailer has been set out

for in Exhibit-K to the plaint. It clearly reveals that in the &quot;Modern Times&quot;

Script as well as in &quot;Miya Biwi aur Murder&quot; trailer, the lead characters are

a married couple who have been married for a span of seven years. They

are having a dysfunctional relationship. The lead married couple in both

are having issues and arguments with each other leading to marital issues.

There is an angle of extra marital affair in both, which takes the plot

forward. In both, the person which whom the wife is involved with turns

out to be a gang member of a feared crime lord (Panditji) in &quot;Modern

Times&quot; and crime lord (Abbas) in &quot;Miya Biwi aur Murder&quot;.                    He has

referred to other similarities in the Script No.1 when compared with the
Waghmare                                                                             4/17

trailer and both involve the husband and wife being stuck with a dead

body inside the house and not knowing how to deal with the situation.

Both also concern the husband coming across belongings of the dreaded

crime lord i.e. a bag full of money in &quot;Modern Times&quot; and drugs with high

value in &quot;Miya Biwi aur Murder&quot; trailer. Both concern the wife stopping

the husband from involving the police and thereafter the couple trying to

figure out a way to dispose the dead body. The crime lord in both, is

suffering from physical disability involving his leg and needs a support to

stand. The crime lord in both is searching for his valuables and bringing

him to the door step of the married couple. There is a similar phrase used

by the crime lord in both which mentions the same tonality and character

with minor tweak in the words. Thereafter there is chaos as multiple

parties are involved.
</p>
<p id="p_10">
7           Mr. Kamod has thereafter taken the Court to the similarity

between the Plaintiff&#x27;s Script No.2 - &quot;Bungalow No.69&quot; and the &quot;Miya

Biwi aur Murder&quot; trailer which shows that in both the major part of the

story is inside the couple&#x27;s own house occurring over a period of one

night. Both involve conflict starting with dead body inside the house

having been killed. Both involve chaos as multiple characters like police,

gangster involved at the couple&#x27;s house. Both also involve dead bodies

which keep piling inside the house and the couple not knowing how to
Waghmare                                                                            5/17

manage the piling dead bodies and the chaos inside the house.                       The

couple is stuck inside their house with the mad chaos and need to deal

with the situation together and survive the night.
</p>
<p id="p_12">
8            Mr. Kamod has submitted that from this comparison between

the &quot;Modern Times&quot; and &quot;Bungalow No.69&quot; Scripts of the Plaintiff with

that of the Defendants&#x27; trailer &quot;Miya Biwi aur Murder&quot; shows that there is

reproduction or substantial reproduction by the Defendants in their Web

Series of both of the Plaintiff&#x27;s Scripts. He has taken the Court through

the trailer with an attempt to satisfy the Court as to the case of the

Plaintiff.

<p id="p_13">
9            Mr. Kamod has relied upon two decisions of the single Judge

of this Court namely <a href="/doc/56993585/" id="a_1">Shamoil Ahmad Khan vs. Falguni Shah and others</a>

2021 (1) Bom CR 792 decided on 26.05.2020 and <a href="/doc/162638144/" id="a_2">Beyond Dreams

Entertainment Private Limited vs. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited</a> ,

2016 (5) Bom CR 266 decided on 25.03.2015. In Shamoil Ahmad Khan

(supra) he has relied upon paragraph 20 where it is held that the theme,

plot and story line are clearly expressions of the &#x27;central&#x27; theme or

concept. They contain sufficiently developed elements of expression or

realization so as to have a life of their own for copyright protection.

These elements are essential or fundamental to the story and are its life


Waghmare                                                                               6/17

and blood. Without them, the story would be robbed of its meaningful

content. In the said decision, this Court has held that there is a case of

actionable plagiarism. In Beyond Dreams Entertainment Private Limited

(supra) Mr. Kamod has relied upon paragraph 20 where this Court has

held that notwithstanding the variety incidents which give a certain

different colour and complexion to the Defendants&#x27; work than the

Plaintiff&#x27;s copyrighted work, a totality of impression to be gathered is that

by and large the former work is a copy of the latter. At the ad-interim

stage, it is sufficient to note that the Plaintiffs have a statable case even of

a breach of copyright and that the material in which they claim such

copyright ought to be protected.
</p>
<p id="p_15">
10           Mr. Kamod has relied upon the Division Bench decision of the

Court <a href="/doc/603848/" id="a_3">Zee Telefilms Limited vs. Sundilal Communications Private Limited</a>,

(2003) 5 Bom.CR 404, in particular paragraph 10 thereof, in support of

his contention that though this Court held that there can be no copyright

of ideas or information and it is not infringement of copyright to adopt or

appropriate ideas of another or to publish information received from

another. It has been held that this is provided that there is no substantial

copying of the form in which those ideas have, or that information has,

been previously embodied.

11          Mr. Kamod has thereafter referred to the decision of the

</pre><p id="p_17">Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1734007/" id="a_4">R.G. Anand vs. Delux Films and others</a> (1978) 4 SCC

118 which has also been referred to by the learned Counsel for the

Defendants, wherein this Court has laid down in paragraph 46 of the said

decision the propositions in a case where there was copyright

infringement of the author in a play by the Defendants&#x27; impugned films.

It has been laid down that violation of copyright in such cases is confined

to the form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by

author of the copyrighted work. Mr. Kamod has submitted that the law is

well settled that the copyright can be in an expression of the idea as in

this case the expression of the idea is in Script No.1 and Script No.2 of the

Plaintiff who is author of the Scripts. He has submitted that from the

trailer of the Web Series of the Defendants, it appears that the Plaintiff&#x27;s

copyright in the said Script and its underline workings have been

infringed and accordingly its release requires to be stayed, considering

that the impugned Web Series of Defendants is scheduled to release on

the OTT platform on 01.07.2022.

12          Mr. Ashish Kamat, learned Counsel appearing for Defendant

No.2 has tendered affidavit in reply dated 30.06.2022 which is taken on

record. He has submitted that the cease and desist legal notice of the

Plaintiff has been responded to by the letter addressed by Defendant
Waghmare                                                                             8/17

Nos.2 and 3 on 27.06.2022.         Mr. Kamat has placed reliance on the

decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/162078106/" id="a_5">Shivani Tibrewala vs. Rajat Mukherjee and others</a>

(2020) SCC OnLine Bom 68 and in particular paragraph 32 thereof where

it has been held that though access by the Defendants to the Plaintiff&#x27;s

work is not necessary for grant of reliefs in an action for copyright

infringement, it is one of the factors that the Court must take into

consideration while granting relief. Without access to the Plaintiff&#x27;s work

the degree of proof required to establish an allegation of copying is much

higher on the Plaintiff. In that case, the Court had considered that the

Plaintiff has shared Script of the film with some people from the film

industry, however, the Plaintiff has been unable to show access of the

same qua the Defendants. In fact, there was no direct allegation to that

effect. The last evolution of the Script of the film has not even been

shared by the Plaintiff or produced before the Court as the same is stated

to be confidential. In that case, this factor was taken into consideration.

The Plaintiff was held to have failed to make out a prima facie case of

infringement of copyright by the Defendants in the Script of the Plaintiff

as the Script of the Plaintiff&#x27;s play was different from the Script of the

Defendants&#x27; film with respect to certain key elements, which from a major

portion of the Defendants&#x27; film.

13          Mr. Kamat has submitted that in the present case in

</pre><p id="p_21">paragraph 21 of the Plaint it is only stated that the Plaintiff had shared a

copy of the Script No.1 with Ms. Tannishtha Chatterjee and the receipt

was acknowledged by her. It is further stated in paragraph 22 that Ms.

Tannishtha Chatterjee played a pivotal role in the television Series

produced by Defendant No.2 and written by Defendant No.3. It is stated

that this establishes nexus between Ms. Tannishtha Chatterjee and

Defendant Nos.2 and 3. He has further referred to paragraph 23 of the

plaint where it is stated that Script No.2 of the Plaintiff were shared with

the persons mentioned therein who are Actors, Producers, Owner of

Talent Management Company, line Producer, vide e-mails dated

13.05.2019, 19.08.2019 and 11.11.2019.        It is further stated that the

Script No.2 was also shared with creative Director and Producer

subsequently vide e-mail dated 16.05.2020. However, there is no mention

of the Defendants having access to either of the Scripts. He has submitted

that when the Plaintiff has come with a case of access of the Defendants

to the Plaintiff&#x27;s work, this factor is required to be taken into

consideration while granting relief as held in Shivani Tibrewala (supra).


14          Mr. Kamat has then taken this Court to paragraph 8.2.1 of the

affidavit in reply which sets out the Script of the Defendants work namely



Waghmare                                                                           10/17

&quot;Miya Biwi aur Murder&quot;. He has submitted that from this Script it shows

that there are various differences with the Scripts of the Plaintiff, in

particular, the wife Priya connecting to one Varun by signing up on tinder

(an online dating site) and thereafter inviting him over to the house for a

date whilst her husband was away for work. The husband Jayesh is a

Police Officer who is out completing a task of raiding the premises of a

famous drug lord, name &#x27;Abbas&#x27; and is able to seize a box of fentanyl. The

said Varun who comes over to Priya&#x27;s house has come with an intention of

duping her and confesses this plan to one Noor/Noori (his gay boyfriend).

Further, Varun whilst at Priya&#x27;s house consumes too much alcohol and

dies of an overdose. The husband Jayesh is having an affair with house

help Malati and their intimate scene inside Jayesh&#x27;s car has been shot by a

Hawaldar working as Jayesh&#x27;s driver.      Further, the house help Malati

informs Jayesh that she is pregnant and does not want to terminate the

pregnancy. An argument ensues and Malati falls down the staircase and is

presumed dead. Thereafter, there are other scenes which are different

from the plaintiff&#x27;s Script and which are highlighted in paragraph 8.2.1 of

the affidavit in reply.
</p>
<p id="p_23">
15           Mr. Kamat has submitted that it is well settled that though

there may also be common features in the Defendants&#x27; work when

compared with that of the Plaintiff&#x27;s such as a married couple having
Waghmare                                                                           11/17

dysfunctional relationship and their having affairs and dead bodies

turning up in the house, these features cannot be a novelty and/or

distinguishing feature. It is well settled in the decision of the Supreme

Court in R.G. Anand (supra) that there can be no copyright in an idea,

subject matter, themes, plots, etc. He has accordingly submitted that no

case is made out for grant of ad-interim relief, particularly considering

that there has been no substantial adaption by the Defendants in their

Web Series of that of the Scripts of the Plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_25">
16           Mr. Khandekar has also supported the submission of Mr.

Kamat. In addition he has also placed reliance upon Shivani Tibrewala

(supra) and in particular paragraph 4.3 read with paragraph 26 of the

said decision. This Court has in the said decision held that the presence

of common elements like a common plot line of unethical drug testing, a

Court case, nationwide movement against the illegalities committed by

the pharmaceutical company, the depiction of death of children as a result

of drug testing, do not by themselves individually or taken together

establish substantial copying.     The difference between the rival works

cannot be said to be trivial or inconsequential or deliberate as attempt to

escape an allegation of copying. The differences are material and change

the nature of the rival works. He has submitted that the Defendants Web

Series &quot;Miya Biwi Aur Murder&quot; is materially different from the two Scripts
Waghmare                                                                               12/17

of the Plaintiff. He has further submitted that common elements like a

couple married for seven years having a dysfunctional relationship as well

as the involvement of a crime lord and dead bodies piling inside the house

cannot by themselves individually or taken together establish substantial

copy. He has further relied upon the decision of this Court in Mansoob

Haider vs. Yashraj Films Pvt. Ltd.,      Order dated 20.06.2014 and in

particular paragraph 19 thereof which has held that any person can draw

parallels and then say that the rival work is an infringement. But it needs

to be shown that these various ingredients are in themselves original. He

has submitted that the Plaintiff in the present case has failed to show that

the various ingredients of its Scripts are in themselves original.

Accordingly, no case is made out for grant of ad-interim relief.


17           I have considered the rival submissions and had the benefit of

being shown the trailer of the Web Series in respect of which the Plaintiff

claims there is infringement of the Plaintiff&#x27;s copyright in the said Scripts

and underline work.      I am of the prima facie view after seeing the

Defendants&#x27; Web Series trailer that rather than there being similarities

between the Plaintiff&#x27;s Scripts and the Web Series, there are in fact

dissimilarities.   The Defendants&#x27; Script of their Web Series has been

highlighted in paragraph 8.2.1 of the affidavit in reply of Defendant No.2.

It has been held by this Court in Shivani Tibrewala (supra) that
Waghmare                                                                            13/17

differences between rival works cannot be said to be trivial or

inconsequential or deliberate as an attempt to escape an allegation of

copying. The differences are material and change the nature of the rival

works. Further, it has been held that elements like common plot line do

not by themselves or taken together establish substantial copying.


18          Further it is required to be considered that the Plaintiff has in

paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 made averments with regard to access of its

Scripts. In this context it is stated that the Script No.1 was shared with

Ms. Tannishtha Chatterjee and Script No.2 to other Actors, Producers as

well as an Owner of Talent Management Company and Creative Director

in the years 2016 for Script No.1 and 2019-2020 for Script No.2

respectively. There is no explanation as to manner in which the Plaintiff

had access to either of the Scripts other than stating in paragraph 22 with

regard to Script No.1 of which Ms. Tannishtha Chatterjee is claimed to

have had access that she had played a pivital role in television Series

&#x27;Cartel&#x27; produced by Defendant No.2 and written by Defendant No.3. On

that basis it is alleged that there is nexus between Ms. Tannishtha

Chatterjee and Defendant Nos.2 and 3. This link in my view does not

establish any access by the Defendants of the Plaintiff&#x27;s Script No.1.

Regarding Script No.2 there is no case made out of the Defendants having

any access to the Script.    It has been held by this Court in Shivani
Waghmare                                                                           14/17
</p><p id="p_28">                                                   928.IAL.20248.22 in COMIPL.20246.22.doc



Tibrewala (supra) that though access by the Defendants to the Plaintiff&#x27;s

work is not necessary for grant of reliefs in an action for copyright

infringement, it is one of the factors that the Court must take into

consideration while granting reliefs. Without access to the Plaintiff&#x27;s work

the degree of proof required to establish an allegation of copying is much

higher on the Plaintiff. In that view of the matter, in the present case the

Plaintiff would have a much higher degree of proof required to establish

the allegation of infringement of copyrighted.

19          I find from comparison of the Scripts of the Plaintiff with that

of the Defendants Web Series, there are few common elements such as

lead character being a married couple who are married seven years and

having marital issues as well as involvement of crime lord and husband

and wife    being stuck with dead body and the husband finding the

belongings of the dreaded crime lord. Further, the appearance of the

crime lord at the house of the married couple. The crime lord having a

physical disability involving his leg and needing support to stand, as well

as the major part of the story being inside the house of the married couple

over a span of one night. Further there being dead bodies found inside

the married couple&#x27;s house and the married couple not knowing how to

dispose of the dead bodies which results in chaos. However, this plot at

best has common elements like a common plot line but the Plaintiff has in
Waghmare                                                                           15/17
</p><p id="p_30">                                                    928.IAL.20248.22 in COMIPL.20246.22.doc



my prima facie view failed to show these elements or ingredients in their

Scripts having any originality. The decision of this Court in Mansoob

Haider (supra) relied upon by Mr. Khandekar is apposite. This common

plot line and/or elements in the Plaintiff&#x27;s Script are no way novel and in

my prima facie view cannot establish substantial copying to give rise to a

case of infringement of copyright.

<p id="p_31">
20          It is well settled by the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand (supra)

that there can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter, themes, plots or

historical or legendary facts. In the present case in my prima facie view

that Plaintiff has failed to make out a case of violation of copyright in the

form, manner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author

of the copyrighted work, though the theme may be similar, it is treated

differently so that the subsequent work is a completely new work.


21          The decisions relied upon by Mr. Kamod, are distinguishable

on facts as in those cases the Defendants had direct access to the

plaintiff&#x27;s work and substantially adapted the plaintiff&#x27;s work and in view

of which this Court arrived at prima facie finding that there in fact had

been infringement of the copyright of the plaintiff&#x27;s work.


22          Thus, I am of the prima facie view that the Web Series of the

Defendants namely titled &quot;Miya Biwi aur Murder&quot; cannot be considered to

Waghmare                                                                            16/17

                        be an infringement of the copyright of the Scripts and underlying works of

                        the Plaintiff. Accordingly, no ad-interim relief can be granted restraining

                        the Defendants from releasing the episodes of their Web Series on the

                        OTT platform which as stated is scheduled to release on 01.07.2022.


                        23          Place the Interim Application for hearing as per CMIS date.
