:ORDER
</pre><p id="p_1">	The petitioners have come up with the above writ petition, seeking a
Mandamus, to forbear the respondents from erecting any high tension electric
towers in their property in Survey No.195/1D and 195.14, Veerasigamani Village,
Sankarankovil Taluk, Tirunelveli District, in violation of the provisions of the
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_3">Indian Electricity Act</a>.
</p><p id="p_2">	2. I have heard Mr.S.Meenakshisundaram, learned counsel for the
petitioners and Mr.G.Kasinathadurai, learned Standing Counsel for the
respondents.
</p><p id="p_3">	3. There is no dispute about the fact that the petitioners are the owners
of the punja land of an extent of 7 acres and 30 cents with a well and
electricity service connection located in Survey No.194 and 195/14,
Veerasigamani Village,  Sankarankovil Taluk, Tirunelveli District. They also own
another extent of punja land in Survey No.195/14.
</p><p id="p_4">	4. According to the petitioners, they have planted 200 cashewnut trees, 68
palmirah trees and 600 gooseberry trees. The petitioners claim to have obtained
a loan from the Indian Bank and they have also decided to float a Trust for
establishing a school for poor children.
</p><p id="p_5">	5. The grievance of the petitioners is that the respondents decided to
establish a Storage Wind Farm Sub Station at Sarkaraikulam and that for the said
purpose, they made preparations to erect 6 high tension wire linking towers.
Some of those towers were proposed to be located in the middle of the property
owned by the petitioners. The petitioners oppose the erection of the towers on
the ground that their consent was not obtained as required by <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_4">Section 12(2)</a> of
the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and that on the Northern side and Eastern side
of their property, there are roads in which towers could be conveniently
located.
</p><p id="p_6">	6. On 11.8.2011, R.Sudhakar, J., before whom the writ petition came up,
passed an order, appointing an Advocate of this Court as a Commissioner to
inspect the property and to file a report as to whether any concrete structures
are being put up in the property for the purpose of erecting electric poles. The
learned Judge also granted an interim injunction restraining the respondents
from erecting any towers for high tension electrical wires in their property.
Accordingly, the Advocate Commissioner inspected the property and filed a
report. In the meantime, the respondents in the writ petition have come up with
a petition to vacate the interim order of injunction.
</p><p id="p_7">	7. However, since the issues raised in the writ petition lie in a narrow
campus, I took up the writ petition itself for final disposal with the consent
of the learned counsel on both sides.
</p><p id="p_8">	8. As pointed out earlier, the objections of the petitioners to the
erection of the towers in their property are two fold viz., (i) that the consent
of the petitioners as required by <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_5">Section 12(2)</a> of the Indian Electricity Act,
1910, was not obtained; and (ii) that there is alternative land available in the
form of public roads, through which the high tension wires can be carried.
</p><p id="p_9">	9. <a href="/doc/968603/" id="a_6">Section 12(1)</a> of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 empowered the
licensee (Board), among other things, to lay down and place electric supply
lines and other works in any place within the area of supply. But sub-section
(2) of <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_7">Section 12</a> made it clear that nothing contained in sub-section(1), shall
be deemed to authorise or empower a Licensee, without the consent of the owner
or occupier concerned, to lay down or place any electric supply line or other
work in, through or against any building.
</p><p id="p_10">	10. Based upon <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_8">Section 12</a> (2), it was held by a learned Judge of this
Court in Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd vs. Tamil Nadu Electricity Board {2007 (2)
MLJ 111} that the erection of poles in the property of the person, without
obtaining his consent under <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_9">Section 12(2)</a> of the said Act, was illegal. In an
another decision in <a href="/doc/1307064/" id="a_10">Superintending Engineer, TNEB vs. M.Sengu Vijay</a> {2011 (3)
MLJ 625}, a Division Bench of this Court also held that under <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_11">Section 12(2)</a> of
the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Board was bound to get consent from the
owner of the property. The Bench held that the mere silence or inaction on the
part of the land owner, cannot be taken to be implied consent. Therefore, on the
basis of those two decisions, Mr.S.Meenakshisundaram, learned counsel for the
petitioners contended that the erection of poles by the respondents, in the
lands of the petitioners, without first obtaining their consent, was illegal.
</p><p id="p_11">	11. In support of his second contention that alternative location could be
considered, Mr.S.Meenakshisundaram, learned counsel for the petitioners placed
reliance upon a decision in <a href="/doc/163126/" id="a_12">Superintending Engineer, TNEB vs. Vadivelu</a> {2009 (5)
MLJ 1005}, where another learned Judge of this Court found fault with the
discriminatory treatment meted out to the owner of the property. This was on a
factual finding that the Electricity Board chose to erect poles in the poramboke
land adjoining other private lands, but did not extend the same concession to
the party before the Court. Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for
the petitioners is that when there is a public land available adjoining the
lands of the petitioners, the respondents could have erected the poles on such
public land sparing the lands of the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_12">	12. However, it is contended by Mr.G.Kasinathadurai, learned Standing
Counsel for the Electricity Board that the petitioners cannot place reliance
upon <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_13">Section 12(2)</a> of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, since the 1910 Act was
repealed by <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_14">Section 185</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. According to the learned
Standing Counsel, the only right that the petitioners have, is to claim
compensation and that the question of consent did not arise after the advent of
the 2003 Act.
</p><p id="p_13">	13. In support of his above contentions, the learned Standing Counsel for
the respondents relied upon the following decisions:-
</p><p id="p_14">	(i) <a href="/doc/8349/" id="a_15">R.Kannan vs. Power Grid Corporation (India) Ltd</a> {2008 (4) MLJ 892}.
</p><p id="p_15">	(ii) <a href="/doc/782717/" id="a_16">T.Narayanan vs. District Executive Magistrate-cum-District Collector</a>
{2008 (4) MLJ 1024}.
</p><p id="p_16">	(iii) <a href="/doc/1779121/" id="a_17">Daulat Singh Surana vs. First Land Acquisition Collector</a> {2007 (1)
SCC 641}.
</p><p id="p_17">	(iv) E.Mariy Marthal vs. Superintending Engineer, TNEB {W.P.(MD) No.1247
of 2010 dated 18.3.2010}.
</p><p id="p_18">	(v) Tony Abraham vs. Superintending Engineer, TNEB {W.A.(MD) No.521 of
2011 dated 5.9.2011}.
</p><p id="p_19">	14. Before considering the decisions relied upon by both counsel, it is
necessary to look into the fundamental question as to whether the benefit of
<a href="/doc/174266756/" id="a_18">Section 12(2)</a> of the Electricity Act, 1910, is available as on date.
</p><p id="p_20">	15. <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_19">The Indian Electricity Act</a>, 1910, is a pre-independence enactment
which dealt with the supply and use of electrical energy and the rights and
obligations of the licensees. After independence, the <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_20">Electricity (Supply) Act</a>,
1948, was enacted on the broad lines of the <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_21">Electricity (Supply) Act</a>, 1926 of
the United Kingdom, that enabled provincial Governments to set up suitable
organisations to work out "grid system" within the provinces. Therefore, the
1948 Act dealt with the statutory powers and functions of Central Electricity
Authority, State Electricity Boards and Generating Companies. Thus both
enactments viz., 1910 Act and 1948 Act, were intended to operate in different
fields. The latter did not repeal the former except that <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_22">Section 83</a> of the 1948
Act, merely stated that nothing contained in the 1948 Act, shall be deemed to
apply to a licensee on whom a notice under <a href="/doc/674525/" id="a_23">Section 5</a> or 7 of the 1910 Act, had
been served prior to the coming into force of the 1948 Act.
</p><p id="p_21">	16. Though the 1948 Act did not repeal the 1910 Act, <a href="/doc/426520/" id="a_24">Section 42(1)</a> of the
1948 Act declared that notwithstanding anything contained in <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_25">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_26">16</a>
and <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_27">18</a> and <a href="/doc/1140165/" id="a_28">19</a> of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, but without prejudice to the
requirements of <a href="/doc/68693/" id="a_29">Section 17</a> of the 1910 Act, the Board shall have all the powers
of the Telegraph Authority under Part III of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, for
the purpose of placing of any wires, poles, wall-brackets, stays, apparatus and
appliances for the transmission and distribution of electricity, if a provision
in such behalf is made in a sanctioned scheme. The proviso to <a href="/doc/426520/" id="a_30">Section 42(1)</a> of
the 1948 Act, made it clear that where a sanctioned scheme does not make such
provision, all the provisions of <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_31">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/1140165/" id="a_32">19</a> of the 1910 Act shall apply
to the works of the Board.
</p><p id="p_22">	17. Thus, the 1948 Act caused a small dent into the provisions of <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_33">Sections
12</a> to <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_34">16</a> and <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_35">18</a> and <a href="/doc/1140165/" id="a_36">19</a> of the 1910 Act, without repealing the 1910 Act in
entirety. This is due to the fact that the professed objects and reasons of the
1948 Act were different from those of the 1910 Act. Consequently, after the
enactment of the 1948 Act, <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_37">Section 12(2)</a> of the 1910 Act lost its significance
in cases where a provision was made in a sanctioned scheme.
</p><p id="p_23">	18. However, in the year 2003, the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_38">Electricity Act</a>, 2003, was enacted. The
preamble indicated that it is an Act to consolidate the laws relating to
generation, transmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity and
generally for taking measures conducive to the development of electricity
industry, promoting competition therein, protecting the interest of consumers
and supply of electricity to all areas, rationalisation of electricity tariff,
ensuring transparent policies regarding subsidies, promotion of efficient and
environmentally benign policies, constitution of Central Electricity Authority,
Regulatory Commissions and establishment of Appellate Tribunal and matters
connected therewith. All the provisions of the Act, except <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_39">Section 121</a> came into
force with effect from 10.6.2003.
</p><p id="p_24">	19. <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_40">Section 185</a> of the 2003 Act, contained the provision for repeal and
saving. It reads as follows:-
</p><p id="p_25">	"185. Repeal and saving.--(1) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_41">Indian Electricity Act</a>, 1910 (9 of 1910), <a href="/doc/701121/" id="a_42">Electricity (Supply) Act</a>, 1948 (54 of
1948) and the <a href="/doc/1056287/" id="a_43">Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act</a>, 1998 (14 of 1998) are
hereby repealed.
</p><p id="p_26">	(2) Notwithstanding such repeal,--
</p><p id="p_27">	(a) anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or
taken including any rule, notification, inspection order or notice made or
issued or any appointment, confirmation or declaration made or any license,
permission, authorisation or exemption granted or any document or instrument
executed or any direction given under the repealed laws shall, insofar as it is
not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or
taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act;
</p><p id="p_28">	(b) the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_44">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_45">18</a> of the Indian
Electricity Act, 1910 and rules made thereunder shall have effect until the
rules under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_46">Sections 67</a> to <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_47">69</a> of this Act are made;
</p><p id="p_29">	(c) the Indian Electricity Rules, 1956 made under <a href="/doc/331108/" id="a_48">Section 37</a> of the Indian
Electricity Act, 1910 as it stood before such repeal shall continue to be in
force till the regulations under <a href="/doc/640941/" id="a_49">Section 53</a> of this Act are made;
</p><p id="p_30">	(d) all rules made under sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1280596/" id="a_50">Section 69</a> of the Electricity
(Supply) Act, 1948 shall continue to have effect until such rules are rescinded
or modified, as the case may be;
</p><p id="p_31">	(e) all directives issued, before the commencement of this Act, by a State
Government under the enactments specified in the Schedule shall continue to
apply for the period for which such directions were issued by the State
Government.
</p><p id="p_32">	(3) The provisions of the enactments specified in the Schedule, not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, shall apply to the States in which
such enactments are applicable.
</p><p id="p_33">	(4) The Central Government may, as and when considered necessary, by
notification, amend the Schedule.
</p><p id="p_34">	(5) Save as otherwise provided in sub section (2), the mention of
particular matters in that section, shall not be held to prejudice or affect the
general application of <a href="/doc/1030013/" id="a_51">Section 6</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897, with regard
to the effect of repeals."
</p><p id="p_35">	20. A reading of sub-section (1) shows that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_52">Indian
Electricity Act</a>, 1910 stands repealed, by the 2003 Act, save as otherwise
provided in the Act. Sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_53">Section 185</a> contains a non abstante
clause. It saves, de hors the repeal, certain things, one of which, is found in
clause (b) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_54">Section 185</a>. Under this <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_55">Section 185</a> (2) (b),
the provisions of <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_56">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_57">18</a> of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and the
Rules made thereunder are allowed to have effect, de hors the repeal, until the
Rules under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_58">Sections 67</a> to <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_59">69</a> of the 2003 Act are made.
</p><p id="p_36">	21. <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_60">Section 67</a> (1) of the 2003 Act, empowers the licensee to carry out,
within his area of supply or transmission, several works such as (i) opening and
breaking up the soil of any street (ii) opening and breaking up of any sewer,
drain or tunnel (iii) altering the position of any line or pipe (iv) laying down
and placing electric lines and other works (v) repairing, altering or removing
the same and (vi) doing all other acts necessary for the transmission or supply
of electricity.
</p><p id="p_37">	22. Sub-Section (2) of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_61">Section 67</a> empowers the appropriate Government to
frame rules specifying several matters listed in clauses (a) to (q). Sub-Section
(3) obliges the licensee to grant compensation for any damage, detriment or
inconvenience caused while exercising any of the powers conferred by this
Section. Sub-Section (4) provides for the reference of any dispute arising under
that Section, to the appropriate Commission and Sub-Section (5) empowers the
appropriate Commission to impose a penalty, in addition to any compensation.
</p><p id="p_38">	23. Just as <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_62">Section 67</a> (1) empowers the licensee to carry out certain
items of work at the ground level, <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_63">Section 68(1)</a> empowers the installation of
overhead lines, with the prior approval of the appropriate Government. The
distinction between <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_64">Section 67</a> (1) and <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_65">Section 68</a> (1) is (i) that the former
deals with the works to be carried out on or under the earth, but the latter
deals with the work to be carried out above the ground level in the form of
overhead lines and (ii) that the former does not speak about prior approval of
anyone, while the latter mandates the prior approval of the appropriate
Government.
</p><p id="p_39">	24. Interestingly, the matters in respect of which the appropriate
Government may frame rules, as specified in <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_66">Section 67</a> (2) include -
</p><p id="p_40">	(a) the cases and circumstances in which the consent in writing of the
appropriate Government, local authority, owner or occupier, as the case may be,
shall be required for carrying out works;
</p><p id="p_41">	(b) the authority which may grant permission in the circumstances where
the owner or occupier objects to the carrying out of works;
</p><p id="p_42">	(c) the nature and period of notice to be given by the licensee before
carrying out works;
</p><p id="p_43">	(d) the procedure and manner of consideration of objections and
suggestions received in accordance with the notice referred to in clause (c);
</p><p id="p_44">	(e) the determination and payment of compensation or rent to the persons
affected by works under this Section; and
</p><p id="p_45">	(g) the right of the owner or occupier to carry out certain works under
this Section and the payment of expenses therefor.
</p><p id="p_46">	25. <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_67">Section 69</a> of the 2003 Act, provides for notice to Telegraph Authority
under certain circumstances. Since we are not concerned here, with the
contingencies arising under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_68">Section 69</a>, I shall not advert to the same.
</p><p id="p_47">	26. In exercise of the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_69">Section 67(2)</a> of the 2003 Act,
the Central Government had already issued a set of Rules known as the Works of
Licensees Rules, 2006. They came into effect from 18.4.2006. Therefore, the
contingencies stipulated in <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_70">Section 185(2)(b)</a> of the 2003 Act, for the repeal of
<a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_71">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_72">18</a> of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, had arisen, with effect
from the date of issue of these rules, viz., 18-4-2006.
</p><p id="p_48">	27. But in view of the fact that <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_73">Section 185(2)(b)</a> makes the provisions of
<a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_74">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_75">18</a> of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, continue to have effect
till Rules under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_76">Sections 67</a> to <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_77">69</a> of the 2003 Act are made, it is contended by
Mr.S.Meenakshisundaram, learned counsel for the petitioner that <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_78">Section 12</a> (2)
of the 1910 Act would continue to have effect until Rules are framed under
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_79">Sections 67</a> to <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_80">69</a> of the 2003 Act. Since the Central Government had issued Rules
only under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_81">Section 67(2)</a> and had not so far issued any rules in terms of
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_82">Sections 68</a> and <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_83">69</a>, it is his contention that <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_84">Section 12(2)</a> of the 1910 Act,
continue to have force.
</p><p id="p_49">	28. But a reading of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_85">Sections 67</a> to <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_86">69</a> of the 2003 Act, shows that it is
only under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_87">Section 67(2)</a> that a rule making power is conferred upon the
appropriate Government. <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_88">Section 68</a> dealing with overhead lines and <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_89">Section 69</a>
dealing with notice to Telegraph Authority, do not confer any rule making power
upon the Government. Therefore, a reference to <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_90">Sections 68</a> and <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_91">69</a> in <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_92">Section 185</a>
(2) (b) of the 2003 Act, is redundant. Consequently, <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_93">Section 185(2)(b)</a> can be
construed only to mean that <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_94">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_95">18</a> of the 1910 Act, would continue to
have effect until the appropriate Government issued rules in terms of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_96">Section 67</a>
(2). Since the Central Government had already issued a set of rules known as the
Works of Licensees Rules, 2006 with effect from 18.4.2006, in exercise of the
power conferred by <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_97">Section 67</a> (2), <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_98">Section 12</a> (2) of the 1910 Act stands
repealed with effect from 18.4.2006.
</p><p id="p_50">	29. The fact that <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_99">Section 12(2)</a> of the 1910 Act, cannot be pressed into
service, can be seen from another perspective also. A comparison of <a href="/doc/968603/" id="a_100">Section
12(1)</a> of the 1910 Act with <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_101">Section 67(1)</a> of the 2003 Act, would show that they
are almost in pari materia. Clause (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of <a href="/doc/968603/" id="a_102">Section 12(1)</a>
of the 1910 Act, are exactly the same as Clauses (a),(b),(d),(e) and (f)
respectively of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_103">Section 67(1)</a> of the 2003 Act. Clause (c) of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_104">Section 67(1)</a> is a
new addition, as it does not find a place in <a href="/doc/968603/" id="a_105">Section 12(1)</a> of the 1910 Act.
</p><p id="p_51">	30. Thus the Parliament has simply adapted <a href="/doc/968603/" id="a_106">Section 12(1)</a> of the 1910 Act
with a slight modification and created <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_107">Section 67(1)</a> of the 2003 Act. After
having copied sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_108">Section 12</a> of the 1910 Act, the Parliament left
out sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_109">Section 12</a> and the provisos thereunder, in total. In
other words, even after making <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_110">Section 67</a> (1) as a provision corresponding to
<a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_111">Section 12</a> (1) of the 1910 Act, the Parliament deliberately did not make a
provision corresponding to <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_112">Section 12</a> (2) of the 1910 Act. On the contrary,
Clause (a) of sub-section (2) of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_113">Section 67</a> merely enables the Appropriate
Government to frame rules, specifying "the cases and circumstances in which the
consent in writing of the appropriate Government, local authority, owner or
occupier, as the case may be, shall be required for carrying out works".
Therefore, the conscious omission of what is contained in <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_114">Section 12(2)</a> of the
1910 Act, in <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_115">Section 67</a> of the 2003 Act, is an indication that the statutory
requirement of consent of the owner or occupier, is a causus omissus, which the
Courts are not entitled to supply.
</p><p id="p_52">	31. Once it is found that <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_116">Section 12(2)</a> of the 1910 Act stands repealed in
terms of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_117">Section 185(2)(b)</a> of the 2003 Act, after the issue of the Works of
Licensees Rules, 2006 under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_118">Section 67</a> (1) of the 2003 Act, the question that
arises next for consideration is about the procedure to be followed under the
2003 Act, whenever the licensees seek to erect electric poles, towers and lines
on private lands.
</p><p id="p_53">	32. As pointed out above, <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_119">Section 67(1)(d)</a> and (f) authorise a licensee (a
person who is granted a license under <a href="/doc/1042017/" id="a_120">Section 14</a> to transmit or distribute or
trade in electricity) to lay down and place electric lines, electrical plants
and other works and to do all other acts necessary for transmission or supply of
electricity. By virtue of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_121">Section 67(2)(a)</a> to (d), the appropriate Government is
entitled to frame rules specifying (i) the cases and circumstances in which the
consent in writing of the owner or occupier is required for carrying out works
</p><p id="p_54">(ii) the authority to grant permission to carry out works, when the owner or
occupier objects (iii) the nature and period of notice to be given by the
licensee before carrying out works and (iv) the procedure and manner of
consideration of objections and suggestions.
</p><p id="p_55">	33. Therefore, it is clear that prima facie the licensee has the power to
lay down and place electrical lines and other works in any place within the area
of supply or transmission. However, this power can be circumscribed only by the
rules framed by the appropriate Government in terms of sub- section (2).
</p><p id="p_56">	34. As we have seen earlier, the Central Government had issued the Works
of Licensees Rules, 2006 with effect from 18.4.2006. Rule 3(1) empowers the
licensee, with the prior consent of the owner or occupier of any building or
land, to carry out works, lay down or place any electric supply line or other
works in, through or against any building, or on, over or under any land
whereon, wherever or whereunder any electric supply line or work has not already
been lawfully laid down or placed by such licensee. The first proviso to Rule 3
(1) states that in case the owner or occupier raises objections, the licensee
shall obtain permission in writing from the District Magistrate or the
Commissioner of Police or any other Officer authorised by the State Government
in this behalf. The second proviso to Rule 3(1) provides a remedy to the owner
or occupier of the building, on whose lands, any works have been carried out.
Under this proviso, if the owner or occupier shows sufficient cause, the
District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police may direct any such works,
support, stay or strut to be removed or altered.
</p><p id="p_57">	35. Thus it is clear from Rule 3 (1) of the 2006 Rules that despite the
repeal of <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_122">Section 12(2)</a> of the 1910 Act, by the 2003 Act, the requirement of
prior consent is introduced under the Rules issued in exercise of the power
conferred by <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_123">Section 67(2)</a>. As a matter of fact, <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_124">Section 12</a> (2) of the 1910 Act
spoke only about consent and not about prior consent. But Rule 3 (1) of the
Works of Licensees Rules, 2006 speaks of prior consent. The new addition under
the 2006 Rules is that the District Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police is
empowered to overrule the objections of the owner or occupier and permit the
licensee to carry out the works. Another addition is that the owner or occupier
also has a remedy, even after the laying down of the poles, overhead lines etc.,
to move the District Magistrate or Commissioner of Police to remove or alter
such poles or lines.
</p><p id="p_58">	36. But unfortunately, sub rule (4) of Rule 3 makes it clear that nothing
contained in this Rule shall affect the powers conferred upon any licensee under
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_125">Section 164</a> of the Act. Therefore, the requirement of prior consent of the owner
or occupier of the land, prescribed under Rule 3(1)(a) of the Works of Licensees
Rules 2006, is subject to the powers, if any conferred upon the licensee under
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_126">Section 164</a>.
</p><p id="p_59">	37. Under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_127">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act, the appropriate Government may
confer upon any Public Officer, Licensee or any person engaged in the business
of supplying electricity, any of the powers possessed by the telegraph authority
under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_128">Indian Telegraph Act</a> 1885, for the purpose of placing electric lines
or electric plant for the transmission of electricity.
</p><p id="p_60">	38. <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_129">Section 10</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the Telegraph Authority
to place and maintain a telegraph line under, over, along or across and posts in
or upon any immovable property. <a href="/doc/540061/" id="a_130">Section 11</a> of the Act empowers the Telegraph
Authority to enter upon any property for the purpose of examining, repairing,
altering or removing any telegraph line or post. Under <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_131">Section 16</a> (1), the
District Magistrate is empowered to pass an order permitting the telegraph
authority to exercise the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/951520/" id="a_132">Section 10</a>, if there is any
resistance or obstruction from anyone, for the exercise of the powers by the
Telegraph Authority under <a href="/doc/951520/" id="a_133">Section 10</a>. Sub-sections (3) and (4) of <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_134">Section 16</a>
provides for resolution of disputes with regard to the compensation payable for
the damage caused to the property, by the telegraph authority while exercising
powers under <a href="/doc/951520/" id="a_135">Section 10</a>.
</p><p id="p_61">	39. It will be relevant to note that the first proviso to Rule 3(1) and
Rule 3(2) of the Works of Licensees Rules 2006, have resemblance to the
provisions of <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_136">Section 16</a> (1) to (3) of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_137">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885. The first
proviso to Rule 3(1) of the Works of Licensees Rules 2006 as well as <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_138">Section 16</a>
(1) of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_139">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885 resemble each other, in the sense that both speak
of removal of obstruction or resistance by the owner or occupier. Similarly,
Rule 3(2) of the said Rules and <a href="/doc/1456724/" id="a_140">Section 16(3)</a> of the 1885 Act, speak of
determination of compensation.
</p><p id="p_62">	40. A combined reading of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_141">Section 67</a> (2) (a) to (d) of the 2003 Act
together with (I) Rule 3 (1) and 3 (4) of the Works of Licensees Rules 2006 (II)
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_142">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act and (III) <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_143">Sections 10</a> and <a href="/doc/100648/" id="a_144">16</a> of the Telegraph Act,
1885, would lead us to the following conclusions:-
</p><p id="p_63">	(i) In normal circumstances, the licensee would require the prior consent
of the owner or occupier of any land, by virtue of Rule 3(1)(a) of the Works of
Licensees Rules 2006, read with <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_145">Section 67</a> (2)(a) to (d) of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_146">Electricity Act</a>
2003.
</p><p id="p_64">	(ii) But if the appropriate Government has, in terms of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_147">Section 164</a> of the
2003 Act, by order in writing, conferred upon any Public Officer or licensee,
the powers of a telegraph Authority under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_148">Indian Telegraph Act</a>, 1885, for
placing of electric lines or electric plant, then the requirement of prior
consent under Rule 3(1)(a) need not be complied with. This is in view of Rule
3(4) of the Works of Licensees Rules 2006.
</p><p id="p_65">	(iii) In other words, if the appropriate Government had passed an order
empowering the licensee to exercise any of the powers conferred by the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_149">Telegraph
Act</a>, 1885, then the licensee can invoke <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_150">Sections 10</a> and <a href="/doc/307295/" id="a_151">11</a> of the Telegraph Act,
1885 and simply enter upon any private land and carry out necessary works,
without the prior consent of the owner. But if the appropriate Government had
not passed any order in terms of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_152">Section 164</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003
conferring such a power upon the licensee, to exercise any power under the
<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_153">Telegraph Act</a>, then the licensee has to obtain prior consent of the owner or
occupier, as per Rule 3(1)(a) of the Works of Licensees Rules 2006 to carry out
the works.
</p><p id="p_66">	41. Therefore, the answer to the question as to whether the prior consent
of the owner is necessary before erecting poles, towers or supply lines, on a
private land, depends upon whether the appropriate Government had conferred
powers upon the licensee, under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_154">Section 164</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 or not.
</p><p id="p_67">	42. To find an answer to the above question, we may have to go back once
again to the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_155">Electricity Act</a>, 1910. <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_156">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act stipulated that
notwithstanding anything contained in <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_157">Sections 12</a> to <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_158">16</a> and <a href="/doc/1988987/" id="a_159">18</a> and <a href="/doc/1140165/" id="a_160">19</a>, the
appropriate Government may by order in writing, confer upon any Public Officer,
Central/State Transmission Utility, Licensee, Transmission Licensee or any
person engaged in the business of transmission, any of the powers of the
Telegraph Authority under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_161">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885. As a matter of fact, <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_162">Section
51</a> of the 1910 Act is in pari materia with <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_163">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act, with
only a slight modification. While <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_164">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act refers to Central
Government in the case of Inter State Transmission and the State Governments in
the case of Intra State Transmission, <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_165">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act refers only to
"Appropriate Government". Additionally, <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_166">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act, speaks of
electric supply lines, appliances and apparatus for transmission of energy. But
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_167">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act speaks of electric lines or electrical plant for the
transmission of electricity. Except this, the provisions of both are almost
identical.
</p><p id="p_68">	43. It is seen from para 4 of the Board proceedings of the Tamil Nadu
Electricity Board in Permanent B.P.(CH) No.368, Technical Branch, dated
25.8.2010, that the appropriate Government had already conferred powers upon the
Electricity Board to exercise the powers of the Telegraph Authority under the
<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_168">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885. This conferment had been made by the Government, in terms
of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_169">Section 51</a> of the Electricity Act, 1910, much before the 2003 Act was issued.
This conferment made under <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_170">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act should be deemed to be a
conferment under the corresponding provision of the 2003 Act, namely <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_171">Section
164</a>, since it is not inconsistent with any of the provisions of the 2003 Act.
This is in view of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_172">Section 185(2)(a)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. Under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_173">Section
185</a> (2)(a) of the 2003 Act, any notification, declaration or authorisation made
under the repealed enactments would be deemed to have been done under the
corresponding provision of the 2003 Act, if it is not inconsistent with the 2003
Act. Since the power of the appropriate Government under <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_174">Section 51</a> of the 1910
Act, to empower a licensee to exercise the powers of the Telegraph Authority, is
retained in tact, under <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_175">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act, there is no inconsistency.
Therefore, the only condition prescribed in <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_176">Section 185(2)(a)</a>, namely that the
act done in terms of the previous enactment should not be inconsistent with the
provisions of the new Act, is also satisfied. Hence, the power conferred upon
the TNEB by the State Government under <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_177">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act, is deemed to
be the power conferred under the corresponding provision of the new Act viz.,
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_178">Section 164</a>.
</p><p id="p_69">	44. Thus it is clear that the respondents have been conferred with the
powers exercisable by the Telegraph Authority in terms of <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_179">Section 10</a> of the
Telegraph Act, 1885. Therefore, Rule 3 (4) of the Works of Licensees Rules 2006,
would come into play in the case on hand. Consequently, the requirement of prior
consent of the owner or occupier, prescribed under Rule 3(1)(a) of these Rules
will not affect the powers deemed to be conferred upon the respondents under
<a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_180">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act, by virtue of <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_181">Section 185(2)(a)</a> of the 2003 Act read
with <a href="/doc/333264/" id="a_182">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act.
</p><p id="p_70">	45. Though the statutory provisions themselves are very clear and they do
not give any scope for any interpretation by any Court, let me also consider,
for the sake of completion of narration, the decisions relied upon by the
learned counsel on both sides.
</p><p id="p_71">	46. In the first decision relied upon by the learned counsel {BHEL vs.
TNEB}, R.Banumathi, J., was concerned with a case where the writ petitioner-BHEL
objected to the grant of electricity service connection to a Church on the
ground that the land on which the Church had been constructed, belonged to BHEL.
While it was the contention of BHEL that their consent was necessary in view of
<a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_183">Section 12(2)</a> of the 1910 Act, it was the contention of the Board and the Church
that the requirement of consent had been dispensed with, by <a href="/doc/426520/" id="a_184">Section 42</a> (1) of
the 1948 Act. But the learned Judge held that <a href="/doc/426520/" id="a_185">Section 42</a> of the 1948 Act can be
invoked only in cases where there is a sanctioned scheme and that it cannot be
invoked for erection of poles for extending supply for domestic or commercial
use. Following the decision of the Orissa High Court in <a href="/doc/1591838/" id="a_186">Orissa State Electricity
Board vs. Pyari Mohan Pattnaick</a> {AIR 1978 Ori. 190} and the decision of
T.Meenakumari,J., in <a href="/doc/623499/" id="a_187">Kannappan vs. Commissioner</a> {1999 (3) MLJ 235}, the learned
Judge held in BHEL vs. TNEB that the requirement of <a href="/doc/1328636/" id="a_188">Section 12(2)</a> of the 1910
Act cannot be circumvented through <a href="/doc/426520/" id="a_189">Section 42</a> of the 1948 Act.
</p><p id="p_72">	47. But in BHEL vs. TNEB, this Court did not consider, unfortunately,
either <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_190">Section 185</a> (2)(b) or <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_191">Sections 67</a> to <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_192">69</a> of the 2003 Act or even the Works
of Licensees Rules 2006, issued in exercise of the powers conferred by <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_193">Section
67(2)</a> of the 2003 Act. Apart from the fact that the repeal and savings provision
contained in the 2003 Act, was not considered by the learned Judge in BHEL vs.
TNEB, the said decision in any case, cannot be pressed into service, by the
petitioner herein. This is in view of the fact that the said case arose much
before the enactment of 2003 Act. Therefore, the reliance placed by
Mr.S.Meenakshisundaram, learned counsel for the petitioner, on the said
decision, is of no avail.
</p><p id="p_73">	48. In the next decision viz., <a href="/doc/1307064/" id="a_194">Superintending Engineer vs. M.Sengu Vijay</a>,
the question that arose for consideration before the Division Bench was entirely
different. In that case, a property in which electrical poles and lines had been
erected long time ago, was developed into a layout of house sites by the
subsequent purchaser. For the approval of the layout, the Director of Town and
Country Planning imposed a condition that the poles and lines had to be shifted
along the road, formed by the promoter in the layout. When the  promoter of the
layout made a request to the Electricity Board, the Board demanded a sum of Rs.6
lakhs towards expenses for shifting. Therefore, the promoter of the layout filed
a writ petition seeking a Mandamus directing the Board to remove the electric
poles and service lines. The writ petition was allowed and the Board preferred
an appeal. The only question that arose before the Division Bench, as seen from
para 6 of the judgment, is as to whether the Board was right in insisting the
first respondent to pay the expenses for shifting the electric poles and lines.
While answering the said question, the Division Bench relied upon <a href="/doc/1896094/" id="a_195">Section 12</a> (2)
of the 1910 Act.
</p><p id="p_74">	49. In view of the fact that the question that arose for consideration in
that decision of the Division Bench was different and also in view of the fact
that the express provisions of the 2003 enactment were not taken into account,
the said decision of the Division Bench will also not go to the rescue of the
petitioner. Moreover, it was found on facts by the Division Bench in that
decision, that neither the consent of the owners was obtained nor any
compensation was paid to the owners. Apart from this fact, it was recorded in
para 7 of the judgment that the poles had been erected 22 years ago, when the
2003 Act had not come into existence. Therefore, the petitioner cannot take
refuge in the said decision.
</p><p id="p_75">	50. In R.Kannan {2008 (4) MLJ 892} relied upon by the Standing Counsel for
the Board, this Court was dealing with a case where the District Magistrate gave
opportunity of hearing to the land owner and the licensee and passed an order
overruling the objections of the land owner and permitting the licensee to carry
on the work, in terms of <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_196">Section 16</a> (1) and (2) of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_197">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885. In
the case on hand, the objections or resistance of the writ petition, had not
been taken up with the District Magistrate, in terms of <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_198">Section 16(1)</a> of the
Telegraph Act, 1885. Therefore, the said decision is of no avail to the
respondents. Similarly, the decision in T.Narayanan {2008 (4) MLJ 1024}, also
arose out of an order passed by the District Magistrate in terms of <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_199">Section
16(1)</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885.
</p><p id="p_76">	51. The decision of the Supreme Court in Daulat Singh Surana {2007 (1) SCC
641}, arose out of the proceedings under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_200">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 1894.
Therefore, the principles enunciated therein cannot be applied to a case arising
under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_201">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 read with <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_202">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885, where no
acquisition of land takes place. In cases arising under the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_203">Land Acquisition
Act</a>, 1894, the Constitutional (not fundamental) right to property, guaranteed
under <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_204">Article 300-A</a>, is sought to be infringed by procedure established by law.
But in cases arising under the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_205">Electricity Act</a> and <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_206">Telegraph Act</a>, a right to
enter into somebody else's property is conferred by statute, upon licensees, for
a limited purpose. Therefore, the question in this case is whether consent is
necessary or not.
</p><p id="p_77">	52. The unreported decision in E.Mary Marthal vs. The Superintending
Engineer dated 18.3.2010 in W.P.(MD) No.1247 of 2010, relied upon by the learned
Standing Counsel, is actually in favour of the petitioner. It is held by
R.S.Ramanathan, J., in the said decision that where there is obstruction or
resistance, by the land owner, the respondents should obtain permission from the
District Magistrate for carrying out the works.
</p><p id="p_78">	53. In the unreported decision of the Division Bench in <a href="/doc/1099633/" id="a_207">Tony Abraham vs.
The Superintending Engineer</a> dated 5.9.2011 in W.A.(MD) No.521 of 2011, the
Division Bench quoted with approval, the following principles enunciated in
another decision in W.P.No.18967 of 2009 (<a href="/doc/1699775/" id="a_208">Dr.M.Ponnuswamy vs. The Chairman</a>):-
	"(1) No notice is necessary to the land owners for laying high tension
wire in their land.
</p><p id="p_79">	(2) The permission of the land owners for laying high tension wire over
and above the land of the petitioners is not necessary and <a href="/doc/951520/" id="a_209">Section 10</a> and
Section 16 of the Telegraphic Act does not contemplate so.
	(3) Such permission is required only in respect of the land owned by the
local authorities.
</p><p id="p_80">	(4) A mere objection by the land owner does not require authorities to
seek permission from the District Magistrate concerned.
	(5) Only if there is an obstruction or resistance by land owners such
permission is necessary."
</p><p id="p_81">	54. But in <a href="/doc/782717/" id="a_210">T.Narayanan vs. Power Grid Corporation India Ltd {W.P.No</a>.49172
of 2006 decided on 18.1.2007}, Prabha Sridevan, J., held in paragraph-20 that
when there are objections to the laying of lines or the erection of transmission
towers, the Corporation was bound to get the permission of the District
Magistrate. In paragraph 21 of the said decision, the learned Judge held "we
have already seen that the objections need not be in a particular form; even a
protest can be termed as an objection. The very fact that all these writ
petitioners have come to Court seeking Mandamus shows that they are protesting
against the project of the Corporation".
</p><p id="p_82">	55. Though the learned Judge who decided Dr.M.Ponnuswamy, referred to the
decision of Prabha Sridevan, J., in T.Narayanan, the learned Judge nevertheless
held that a mere objection does not require the authorities to seek permission
from the District Magistrate concerned, in terms of <a href="/doc/100648/" id="a_211">Section 16</a> of the Telegraph
Act. He held that something more than a mere objection was required, to make it
a case of obstruction/resistance. In other words, the learned Judge who decided
Dr.M.Ponnuswamy, actually took a view which was diametrically opposite to the
view expressed by Prabha Sridevan, J., in T.Narayanan. For taking such a view,
the learned Judge drew a distinction in paragraph 6.3 of his decision (in
Dr.M.Ponnuswamy) between the words "objection" and "obstruction/ resistance"
appearing in <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_212">Section 16(1)</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885. However, an exercise into
semantics was not undertaken by the learned Judge. Therefore, let us now see
whether an objection would tantamount to obstruction/resistance.
</p><p id="p_83">	56. The words "obstruction" and "resistance" are used together, not only
in <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_213">Section 16(1)</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885, but also in several enactments
including Order XXI, Rule 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 as well as in
<a href="/doc/308927/" id="a_214">Section 225</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Even under Order XXI, Rule 97<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_215"> of the
Code</a>, it is left to the decree holder to file an application before the
Executing Court, whenever his attempt at obtaining possession of a property is
resisted or obstructed by anyone. This is similar to the prescription contained
in <a href="/doc/650438/" id="a_216">Section 16</a> (1) of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_217">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885, which makes only the Telegraph
Authority liable to seek an order from the District Magistrate, if there is
obstruction or resistance.
</p><p id="p_84">	57. If understood in the context of the very same expressions used in
Order XXI, Rule 97<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_218"> of the Code</a>, it will be clear that there need not be an
actual physical scuffle or a dharna in front of the land, to constitute an
obstruction/resistance. While dealing with the meaning of the expression
"obstruction" appearing in <a href="/doc/1618955/" id="a_219">Section 133</a> of the Customs Act, 1962, the Supreme
Court pointed out in <a href="/doc/918266/" id="a_220">C.C.E. vs. Paradip Port Trust</a> {1990 (4) SCC 250} the
following:-
</p><p id="p_85">	"On the authority of Hinchliffe vs. Sheldon {1955 (1) W.L.R. 1207}, it can
be said that obstruction is not confined to physical obstruction and it includes
anything which makes it more difficult for the police or the public servant to
carry out their duties".
</p><p id="p_86">In the same decision, the Supreme Court relied upon an earlier decision in
<a href="/doc/1312651/" id="a_221">Santosh Kumar vs. State</a> {AIR 1951 SC 201} to conclude that even an order of
seizure would amount to obstruction. Therefore, obstruction/resistance need not
necessarily be a violent or non-violent physical act. It is always construed as
a defensive act. As a matter of fact, the first proviso to sub-rule (1) of Rule
3 of the Works of Licensees Rules 2006, makes it incumbent upon the licensee to
seek the permission of the District Magistrate, when the owner objects. The
expression used in the said provision is only "objection".
</p><p id="p_87">	58. Therefore, in the light of the foregoing discussion, the following
conclusions emerge:-
</p><p id="p_88">	(i) The provision of <a href="/doc/174266756/" id="a_222">Section 12(2)</a> of the Electricity Act, 1910, requiring
the licensee to obtain consent of the owner or occupier of the land on which it
is proposed to carry out certain works, stands repealed, in terms of <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_223">Section 185</a>
(1) and 185 (2) (b) of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_224">Electricity Act</a>, 2003, with the issue of the Works of
Licensees Rules, 2006, in exercise of the power conferred by <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_225">Section 67</a> (2) of
the 2003 Act.
</p><p id="p_89">	(ii) Primarily, Rule 3(1)(a) the Works of Licensees Rules, 2006 requires
the licensee to obtain the prior consent of the owner or occupier of any
building or land on which it is proposed to carry out certain works.
</p><p id="p_90">	(iii) If the owner or occupier refuses to give consent and raises
objections, the licensee may obtain permission in writing from the District
Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, in terms of the first proviso under
Rule 3(1).
</p><p id="p_91">	(iv) But in cases where powers are conferred upon the licensee under
<a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_226">Section 164</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, the provisions of Rule 3(1) to (3) of
the Works of Licensees Rules, 2006 will not apply. In other words, where the
appropriate Government had conferred upon the licensee, the powers of a
Telegraph Authority under the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_227">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885, the licensee need not take
recourse to the procedure prescribed by Rules 3(1) to (3) of the Works of
Licensees Rules, 2006. But the licensee shall take recourse to the provisions of
the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_228">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885.
</p><p id="p_92">	(v) Since <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_229">Section 164</a> of the 2003 Act, corresponds to <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_230">Section 51</a> of the
1910 Act, the power conferred by the Government upon a licensee, in terms of
<a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_231">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act, is saved by <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_232">Section 185(2)(a)</a> of the 2003 Act.
Therefore, the power conferred upon the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board by the
Government of Tamil Nadu under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_233">Section 51</a> of the 1910 Act, could continue to be
exercised by the Board, as though those powers were conferred under <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_234">Section 164</a>
of the 2003 Act.
</p><p id="p_93">	(vi) <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_235">Section 10</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885, does not contemplate "consent"
or "permission" of the owner or occupier of a property, for the purpose of
placing and maintaining a supply line, under, over, along or across and posts in
or upon any immovable property. The only case where <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_236">Section 10</a> contemplates
permission is in respect of a property vested in or under the control or
management of any local authority.
</p><p id="p_94">	(vii) Though <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_237">Section 10</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885, does not make it
incumbent upon the licensee to obtain permission of the owner or occupier, it
does not also reduce his ownership or right of possession into something
farcical. The right of the owner or occupier to resist or obstruct any act
undertaken under <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_238">Section 10</a>, is recognised indirectly in <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_239">Section 16(1)</a>, which
requires the licensee to obtain an order of the District Magistrate, in such
circumstances. A careful reading of <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_240">Section 16(1)</a> would show two things viz.,
</p><p id="p_95">(a) that the District Magistrate exercises his power under this Section, in his
discretion and (b) that what the District Magistrate does under <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_241">Section 16(1)</a> is
akin to the removal of obstruction as ordered by an Executing Court in terms of
Order XXI, Rules 97 and 98<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_242"> of the Code</a>. Any resistance on the part of the owner
or occupier after an order is passed by the District Magistrate becomes a
punishable offence under <a href="/doc/1432790/" id="a_243">Section 188</a> of the Indian Penal Code, by virtue of
<a href="/doc/100648/" id="a_244">Section 16</a> (2) of the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_245">Telegraph Act</a>, 1885.
</p><p id="p_96">	(viii) The words "resisted or obstructed" appearing in <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_246">Section 16(1)</a> of
the Telegraph Act, 1885 have to be given their ordinary meaning. They have to be
understood as defensive acts as pointed out by the Apex Court in Santosh Kumar
(cited supra). Actual physical acts of omission and commission at site or on the
spot, is not necessary to constitute resistance or obstruction, as held by the
Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/918266/" id="a_247">C.C.E. vs. Paradip Port Trust</a>. The method of
resistance/obstruction adopted by people, vary from person to person depending
upon their status, level of education, mental orientation and social upbringing.
Therefore, any kind of objection or protest by the land owner would tantamount
to obstruction/ resistance. Such an interpretation is necessary in view of the
fact that the <a href="/doc/357830/" id="a_248">Telegraph Act</a> is a colonial Act of pre-Constitutional days, which
came to be adapted after the Constitution and which has come to be borrowed by
the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_249">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 to interfere and infringe upon the rights of owners of
private property to their unhindered enjoyment. The Supreme Court pointed out in
<a href="/doc/1992267/" id="a_250">Dev Sharan vs. State of U.P</a>. {2011 (4) SCC 769} that even the <a href="/doc/7832/" id="a_251">Land Acquisition
Act</a>, 1894, is "a pre-constitutional legislation of colonial vintage and is a
drastic law, expropriatory in nature". Therefore, any interpretation to such
enactments should conform to the Constitutional goals and rights. Despite the
fact that the right to property is no more a fundamental right after the 44th
Amendment to the Constitution, it is nevertheless a constitutional right under
<a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_252">Article 300-A.</a> In several decisions, the Supreme Court has held that to hold
property is not only a Constitutional right but also a human right. {see
<a href="/doc/1077729/" id="a_253">Lachhman Dass vs. Jagat Ram</a> {2007 (10) SCC 448}, <a href="/doc/913087/" id="a_254">Vimlaben Ajitbhai Patel vs.
Vatslaben Ashokbhai Patel</a> {2008 (4) SCC 649}, <a href="/doc/638272/" id="a_255">N.Padmamma vs. S.Ramakrishna Reddy</a>
{2008 (15) SCC 517}, <a href="/doc/1510741/" id="a_256">Chandigarh Housing Board vs. Major General Devinder Singh</a>
{2007 (9) SCC 67}. Therefore, a dignified protest, even in the form of a formal
letter, notice or telegram, would amount to obstruction within the meaning of
<a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_257">Section 16(1)</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885. Once such a protest is lodged, the
licensee should seek an order from the District Magistrate.
</p><p id="p_97">	59. With the above principles of law in mind, if we now come back to the
facts of the case, it is seen that even as per the counter affidavit filed by
the sixth respondent, the survey for the line transmission and erection was
conducted in August 2010 and subsequent check survey was conducted on 1.8.2011.
According to the respondents, the Chief Engineer, TNEB-Transmission published a
notification in the 'Daily Thanthi' on 6.7.2011 itself, inviting objections.
</p><p id="p_98">	60. Though the notice published in the Tamil newspaper 'Daily Thanthi'
dated 6.7.2011, does not indicate the lands on which it was proposed to erect
towers, the petitioner nevertheless sent telegrams to all the respondents on
22.7.2011 itself. These telegrams were issued by the counsel for the petitioner
to all the respondents terming the proposed action of the respondents, high
handed, illegal and arbitrary. Therefore, it is clear that the petitioner has
certainly obstructed the exercise of powers by the respondents under <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_258">Section 10</a>
of the Telegraph Act, 1885. Hence, the respondents ought to have approached the
District Magistrate under <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_259">Section 16(1)</a> for an order permitting them to exercise
the powers under <a href="/doc/1866179/" id="a_260">Section 10</a>. Unfortunately, the respondents have failed to do
so. Therefore, the petitioner is entitled to the reliefs prayed for.
</p><p id="p_99">	61. But unfortunately for the petitioner, the erection of poles appears to
have already been completed. The petitioner filed the above writ petition on
2.8.2011. It was only on 11.8.2011 that an interim injunction was granted by
this Court, even while appointing an Advocate Commissioner simultaneously to
inspect the place and file a report. The Commissioner has filed a report
enclosing photographs showing that the erection had already been completed.
Though the learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the erection was
completed in violation of the interim order of injunction, it is not very clear
from the report of the Commissioner as to when the erection was completed. In
part-II of his report, the Commissioner had stated that at the time of his
inspection on 17.8.2011, he not only found that a concrete structure had been
put up, but also the whole structure of TLCC Tower had been erected and
completed. What remained to be done on the date of inspection by the
Commissioner, was only the completion of connection to the main line. The
Commissioner has indicated the following features:-
</p><p id="p_100">	"That the height of the tower is measuring 23 Meter (approximately 100
feet) and the Length of the bottom portion of the tower on each side is
measuring 19.9 feet and there are totally four sides in the bottom. There are
foursquare typed concrete basements. On each basements measuring 2 feet and
tower been erected up on the four basements."
</p><p id="p_101">	62. Therefore, it is clear that the entire work has now been completed and
the act of providing connection to the supply alone remains. In such
circumstances, it may not be feasible to grant the prayer of the petitioner for
a writ of mandamus to forbear the respondents from erecting the towers. I am not
for a moment suggesting that the prayer has become infructuous. But the grant of
the prayer for mandamus, after the entire exercise has been carried out, would
result in serious consequences.
</p><p id="p_102">	63. Even if I allow the prayer for mandamus, it would be open to the
respondents to seek the permission of the District Magistrate to pass an order
under <a href="/doc/456692/" id="a_261">Section 16(1)</a> of the Telegraph Act, 1885. If the District Magistrate
chooses to exercise his discretion to direct the petitioner to permit the
erection of towers, nothing much could be done thereafter, since the power of
judicial review over such exercise of discretion may be limited. On the other
hand, even if I refuse the prayer for mandamus sought by the petitioner, he
would still have two types of remedies against the respondents. They are (i) a
remedy under <a href="/doc/100648/" id="a_262">Section 16</a> (3) for determining the sufficiency of compensation and
</p><p id="p_103">(ii) a remedy under <a href="/doc/1123529/" id="a_263">Section 17</a> (1) to require the respondents to remove or alter
the line or post and a remedy under <a href="/doc/38951/" id="a_264">Section 17(2)</a> to apply to the District
Magistrate to direct the removal of the line or post. In other words, the grant
of the prayer for mandamus after the respondents have completed the erection of
towers would leave the respondents remedyless, while the refusal of the prayer
for mandamus would not leave the petitioner remedyless.
</p><p id="p_104">	64. Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed. However, the petitioner is
granted liberty to apply to the District Magistrate under <a href="/doc/38951/" id="a_265">Section 17(2)</a> of the
Telegraph Act, 1885 for the removal of the towers or to seek compensation in
terms of <a href="/doc/100648/" id="a_266">Section 16</a>. There will be no order as to costs. Consequently connected
miscellaneous petitions are closed.
