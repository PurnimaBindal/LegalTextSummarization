       Upon aforesaid written complaint, FIR no.55/2006

(Ex.P/13) was registered at Police Station Merta City,

District Nagaur at 11.00 pm. The Investigating Officer

went     on   spot   in   the   morning   and   prepared

Panchayatnama (Ex.P/3) of dead body at 8.15 am on

10.3.2006, so also, the condition of dead body on spot

was also recorded at 8.40 am vide Ex.P/2. The dead

body of Poona Ram was sent to the         Primary Health

Center, Jasnagar, District Nagaur for post mortem.</blockquote><p id="p_3">

</p><p id="p_4">       The post mortem of the body was conducted and

post mortem report (Ex.P/14) was given by the

medical officer.     Thereafter, the dead body of the

deceased Poona Ram who was 80 years of age was

handed to the        complainant Hanuman Ram son of

deceased for cremation.
</p>
<p id="p_5">       During inspection of the place of occurrence blood

stained soil and simple soil was collected vide Ex.P/6 on

10.3.2006 at 3.00 pm thereafter accused appellant

Ram Niwas was arrested in front of two          witnesses

Manak Ram and Baksha Ram by the SHO Police Station

Merta City Chandra Singh Rawal.
</p><p id="p_6">                                                      [4]


     After arrest the shirt of the accused appellant was

taken in possession vide Ex.P/8 and upon information

given by him under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_3">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act one

axe and Lathi were also recovered vide Ex.P/9 at 10.30

pm on 10.3.2006.
</p>
<p id="p_7">     In the incident, injuries were also inflicted to his

mother   Kamla     Devi   by   the   accused   appellant,

thereafter, she was examined by the medical officer

and the injury report Ex.p/16 prepared in which one

incised wound was found upon the hand of Kamla Devi,

mother of accused appellant.
</p>
<p id="p_8">     The blood smeared soil, controlled soiled, shirt,

peace of Safa, axe and Kamiz of accused appellant

were sent for examination to the FSL and in return the

FSL report (Ex.P/17)      dated 28.4.2006 was received

from FSL in which it is reported that on serological

examination blood was found upon the soil, Kamiz and

piece of Safa of deceased, so also, upon shirt (Kamiz)

of the accused appellant, but no blood was found upon

axe recovered at the instance of the accused appellant.

It is further reported that upon all the articles bood of

„B‟ group was found.

     After completion of investigation, the investigating

officer filed charge-sheet in the court of Addl. Civil

Judge (SD) under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_4">Section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_5">326</a> IPC from where

the case was committed to the court of Sessions Judge,

Merta, but later on, transferred to the court of Special

Judge, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Case-cum Addl.

Sessions Judge, Merta for trial.
</p>
<p id="p_10">     In the trial after providing an opportunity of

hearing, the learned trial court framed the charge

under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_6">Section 302</a> and <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_7">326</a> IPC against the accused

appellant, but the accused appellant denied the charges

leveled against him and prayed for trial.

</p><p id="p_11">     In the trial statements of 9 prosecution witnesses

were recorded including eye witness PW--1 Hanuman

Ram and witnesses of recovery PW--2 Baksha Ram and

PW--3 Manak Ram, so also, statement of PW--9 Dr.

Uda Ram to prove the allegation/charge and 18

documents were exhibited in the trial.

</p><p id="p_12">     After   recording    prosecution       evidence,   the

statement under <a href="/doc/767287/" id="a_8">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. of the accused

appellant were recorded on the basis of evidence of

allegations leveled by the prosecution witnesses, but
                                                      [6]


the accused appellant denied all the allegations and

said that he has been falsely implicated on the basis of

false report submitted by his brother Hanuman Ram,

which is evident from the fact that there is no evidence

of motive on record.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     In defence, no oral evidence was produced by the

accused appellant, but three documents were exhibited

in the trial from defence side.
</p>
<p id="p_14">     The learned trial court after recording entire

evidence finally heard the arguments and passed the

judgment dated 10.8.2006 by which the accused

appellant was held guilty for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_9">Section 302</a>

IPC but acquitted from the charge leveled against him

for offence under <a href="/doc/1540253/" id="a_10">Section 326</a> IPC.   The said judgment

is under challenge in this appeal.

</p><p id="p_15">     The Amicus Curiae Dilip Sharma appointed by the

Leal Aid Committee of this court vehemently argued

that the finding arrived at by the learned trial court so

as to hold accused appellant guilty is totally erroneous

because it is based upon the false and concocted story

framed by the complainant Hanuman Ram, real brother

of the accused appellant. It is also argued that as per
                                                             [7]


the FSL report no blood was found upon the axe, which

is said to be recovered as per information given by the

accused appellant under <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_11">Section 27</a> of the Evidence

Act. It is also argued that there is no evidence of

motive, therefore, no offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_12">Section 302</a> IPC is

made out.
</p>
<p id="p_16">     Learned counsel further submits that the entire

case of prosecution is based upon the testimony of sole

eye witness PW--1 Hanuman Ram which is not

corroborated by the medical evidence, so also, it is one

of the fact that upon axe recovered upon information

given by the accused appellant no blood was found,

therefore, the finding of guilt arrived at by the learned

trial court in the impugned judgment deserves to be

quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_17">     Learned Amicus Curiae further submits that main

ingredient of murder which is „motive‟ is absent, so

also, none of the witness of prosecution is supporting

the testimony of sole eye witness, therefore, testimony

of   informant   as        eye   witness   does   not    inspire

confidence.      It   is    also   submitted   that     although

complainant is real brother of the deceased, but there
                                                            [8]


is no corroboration of his allegation that accused

appellant inflicted injury upon the hand of his mother

because mother did not turn up in the trial to prove the

said allegation, therefore, the judgment impugned

deserves to be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_18">        Learned counsel for the appellant invited our

attention towards the fact that eye witness PW--1

Hanuman Ram specifically stated in the FIR that the

accused appellant is real brother of the complainant

entered in the house and first of all tried to inflict injury

upon him, at that time, father Poona Ram intervened

for rescue to whom the accused appellant Ram Niwas

gave blow by axe upon the head and inflicted 2-3

injuries, due to those injuries Poona Ram fell down and

died.    The mother Kamla, witness Natwar and Manak

intervened in the matter, but after inflicting injuries

accused     appellant   ran   away   from   the    place    of

occurrence.      In the FIR there is no allegation with

regard to any quarrel with father and mother but as per

fact stated in the FIR injuries were caused to         them

when      they   intervened   in   the   quarrel   between

complainant Hanuman Ram and accused Ram Niwas,
                                                             [9]


therefore, even if whole prosecution story is accepted

then also no offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_13">Section 302</a> IPC is made

out, more so, the offence cannot travel beyond offence

under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_14">Section 304</a> Part I IPC.
</p>
<p id="p_19">     While inviting attention towards statement of

witness PW--1 Hanuman Ram it is submitted that this

witness categorically stated in his statement that my

brother accused Ram Niwas is crack, therefore, he has

inflicted injury by axe to my father and mother. While

inviting attention towards        cross-examination it is

submitted that as per statement in cross-examination

of Hanuman Ram it is obvious that he was not eye

witness    of   the   incident,    therefore,     the   whole

prosecution story deserves to be disbelieved.

</p><p id="p_20">     Lastly, in the alternative, it is argued that

appellant is behind the bars since 2006 and as per

evidence   on   record,   the     evidence   of    motive    is

completely absent, therefore, conviction of the accused

appellant for offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_15">Section 302</a> IPC may kindly

be set aside and if the incident is accepted then

offence may be altered from offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_16">Section 302</a>

IPC to offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_17">Section 304</a> Part I IPC.
</p><p id="p_21">                                                    [10]


     In support of his arguments, the learned counsel

for the appellant invited our attention towards the

judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Arjun Vs. State of Maharashtra reported in 2012 Cr.L.R.

(SC) 506 and recent judgment in the case of Ahmed

Shah &amp; Anr. Vs. State of Rajasthan reported in 2015

Cr.L.J. 1398 in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court

converted the conviction from offence under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_18">Section

302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_19">34</a> IPC to offence under <a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_20">Section 304</a> Part I IPC.

</p><p id="p_22">     Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor vehemently

argued that it is a case in which no sympathy is

required to be given to the accused appellant because

he has not only inflicted injury upon the head of his

father, who was 80 years old but also to his mother

Kamla when they intervened in the incident inside the

home in which the accused appellant was causing

injuries to his brother complainant Hanuman Ram. It

is also argued that even if the evidence of motive is not

there, but looking to the nature of injuries caused by

the accused appellant to his father, he is not entitled

for any prayer, therefore, the conviction of accused

appellant deserves to be maintained.
</p><p id="p_23">                                                            [11]


    Learned Public Prosecutor submits that not only

PW--1 Hanuman Ram but other witnesses PW--2

Baksha Ram, PW--3 Manak Ram and PW--4 Natwar

proved the allegation against the accused appellant,

therefore, there is no question to say that the

prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt.      The witness PW--9 Dr. Uda Ram

specifically stated in his statement that five incised

wounds were found upon the body of the deceased.

Likewise, one incised would was found upon the body

of Kamla Devi and the injuries caused to Poona Ram

(deceased)   were      sufficient   to   cause    death.    The

Investigating Officer, Chandra Singh Rawal (PW--8)

proved the entire investigation and therefore, it is

obvious   from   the     entire     evidence     that   accused

appellant has rightly been held guilty for committing

offence of murder of his own father and for inflicting

injury to his own mother Kamla, hence, this appeal

may kindly be dismissed.
</p>
<p id="p_24">    After hearing learned counsel for the parties, first

of all we have perused the finding given by the learned

trial court, so also, the statements of eye witness PW--
</p><p id="p_25">                                                                         [12]


1 Hanuman Ram. Admittedly, PW--1 Hanuman Ran is

real brother of accused appellant Ram Niwas and son of

deceased Poona Ram and injured Kamla Devi. In the

written FIR a specific allegation was leveled by the

complainant Hanuman Ram as eye witness that "vkt

cpkus dk iz;kl fd;k" The witness Hanuman Ram accepted

that said FIR (Ex.P/1) was filed by him but in the cross-

examination this eye witness Hanuman Ram said that

no quarrel took place in front of him. Further, it is also

stated by him that I don‟t know who has written the

FIR. I only submitted the FIR (Ex.P/1) before the SHO,

Police Station.        In the cross-examination, further said

that "ejs k HkkbZ fnekx ls Ød
                            s gS blfy;s blus dqYgkMh+ dh ekjh FkhA^^

       Meaning thereby, there is evidence that some

incident occurred on 9.3.2006 in the house of deceased

in which the deceased Poona Ram died. The fact of
                                                     [13]


incident is further corroborated by PW--3 Manak and

PW--4 Natwar as witnesses of the occurrence, but it is

also one of the fact that injured mother Kamla did not

turn up for recording her statement in the trial, but this

Court cannot lose sight of the fact that blood was found

upon the shirt of accused appellant, which is proved

from FSL report (Ex.P/17), so also no blood was found

upon the axe, but blood of „B‟ group was found upon

the shirt of accused appellant and shirt of deceased

Poona Ram. This fact corroborates involvement of the

accused appellant in the crime.
</p>
<p id="p_26">     Upon assessment of the entire evidence in the

light of the judgment cited by the learned counsel for

the appellant, in our opinion, there is strength in the

argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that

there is no wisher about motive, more so, PW--1

Hanuman Ram categorically stated before the court

that my brother is crack, therefore, he has inflicted

injuries by axe to my father. Further in the FIR, he has

categorically stated that accused appellant entered in

the house to cause injury upon him, but upon

intervention by father and mother, injuries were
                                                    [14]


inflicted by him to them, which resulted into death of

his father. In absence of any evidence of motive, it

cannot be presumed that accused appellant was having

any intention to kill his father.

<p id="p_27">     In the case of Arjun Vs. State of Maharasthra

(supra)    the following adjudication is made by the

Hon'ble Supreme Court so as to convert the conviction

from offence under <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_21">Section 302</a> to offence under

<a href="/doc/409589/" id="a_22">Section 304</a> Part I IPC, which reads as under:

"17. We are in agreement with the
concurrent views of the courts below
regarding their overt acts as the same is
proved by the version of eye witnesses
particularly PW-8 who has been consistent in
her deposition regarding the participation
and fatal injuries inflicted by the two
appellants. But as far as their conviction
under <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_27">Sections 302</a>/<a href="/doc/37788/" id="a_28">34</a> IPC is concerned, in

The said exception deals with a case of
prosecution not covered by the first
exception, after which its place would
have been more appropriate. The
exception is founded upon the same
principle, for in both there is absence of
premeditation. But, while in the case of
Exception 1 there is total deprivation of
self-control, in case of Exception 4, there
is only that heat of passion which clouds
men's sober reason and urges them to
deeds which they would not otherwise
do. There is provocation in Exception 4
as in Exception 1; but the injury done is
not the direct consequence of that
provocation. In fact Exception 4 deals
with cases in which notwithstanding
that a blow may have been struck, or
some provocation given in the origin of
the dispute or in whatever way the
quarrel may have originated, yet the
subsequent conduct of both parties puts
them in respect of guilt upon equal
footing. A "sudden fight" implies mutual
provocation and blows on each side. The
homicide committed is then clearly not
traceable to unilateral provocation, nor
in such cases could the whole blame be
placed on one side. For if it were so, the
exception more appropriately applicable
would be Exception 1. There is no
previous deliberation or determination
to fight. A fight suddenly takes place, for
which both parties are more or less to
be blamed. It may be that one of them
starts it, but if the other had not
aggravated it by his own conduct it
would not have taken the serious turn it
did. There is then mutual provocation
and aggravation, and it is difficult to
apportion the share of blame which
attaches to each fighter. The help of
Exception 4 can be invoked if death is
caused: (a) without premeditation; (b)
                                                    [17]


          in a sudden fight; (c) without the
          offender's     having     taken      undue
          advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
          manner; and (d) the fight must have
          been with the person killed. To bring a
          case    within   Exception    4   all  the
          ingredients mentioned in it must be
          found. It is to be noted that the "fight"
          occurring in Exception 4 to <a href="/doc/626019/" id="a_34">Section 300</a>
          IPC is not defined in <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_35">IPC</a>. It takes two to
          make a fight. Heat of passion requires
          that there must be no time for the
          passions to cool down and in this case,
          the parties have worked themselves into
          a fury on account of the verbal
          altercation in the beginning. A fight is a
          combat between two and more persons
          whether with or without weapons. It is
          not possible to enunciate any general
          rule as to what shall be deemed to be a
          sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact
          and whether a quarrel is sudden or not
          must necessarily depend upon the
          proved facts of each case. For the
          application of Exception 4, it is not
          sufficient to show that there was a
          sudden quarrel and there was no
          premeditation. It must further be shown
          that the offender has not taken undue
          advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
          manner.      The    expression     "undue
          advantage" as used in the provision
          means "unfair advantage."
