: Judgement 

                       ORDER (ORAL)
</pre><p id="p_1">         (Passed on this 29th day of March, 2010)
  Writ petitions under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_1">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of

                           India

</p><p id="p_2">1.   The  petitioners, in this batch of  petitions,  are

     aggrieved  by the cancellation of their  respective

     appointment orders, without affording an opportunity of

     hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_3">2.   The question of law involved in this batch of
petitions i.e. W.P. (S) No. 6713, 6714, 6746, 6793, 7170
and 7335 of 2009 is whether the appointments of the
petitioners, who have been appointed after due selection,
can be cancelled on the ground of submission of alleged
false and forged documents by some of the candidates,
without affording an opportunity of hearing ?  Thus, these
petitions are being considered and decided by this common
order.
</p><p id="p_4">3.   The indisputable facts, in nutshell, in the
petitions, are that the petitioners were selected for
appointment on the posts of Multipurpose Health Worker,
Dresser &amp; Assistant Grade - III through proper selection
process and they were accordingly appointed. The
petitioners joined their respective posts at respective
places on 26-8-2003, 26-8-2003, 26-8-2003,
25-8-2003, 26-8-2003 and the petitioner in W.P. (S)
No.7335 of 2009 was joined in the service pursuant to the
order dated                     1-10-2003, respectively.
</p><p id="p_5">After sometime, the Chief Medical &amp; Health Officer,
Raigarh, cancelled the appointment of the petitioners on
the ground of submission of false and forged documents, by
order dated 31-10-2009. The impugned order has been filed
and marked as Annexure P/9 in writ petition (S) No.6713 of
2009.
</p><p id="p_6">4.   Being aggrieved, the petitioners have filed these
petitions seeking a direction to quash the impugned
orders, by which the services of the petitioners have been
terminated, and to grant relief of continuation of their
services on the respective posts and
places.
</p><p id="p_7">5.   Learned counsel appearing for the petitioners would
submit that once the petitioners have been appointed after
following proper selection process and after verification
of the documents, their appointments cannot be cancelled
without affording an opportunity of hearing. Learned
counsel would further submit that the petitioners ought to
have been given at least an opportunity of hearing to
establish the genuineness or bona fide of the documents,
which were allegedly discovered, later on, after a period
of about five years, by the authorities, as false and
forged documents, after appointment of the petitioners.
</p><p id="p_8">6.   Per contra, Shri Bhatia, learned counsel appearing
for the State would submit that, in fact, after affording
an opportunity of hearing, the termination orders have
been passed. Shri Bhatia would next submit that in the
appointment order itself, it has been specifically
mentioned that at any point of time, if the documents
submitted by the candidates are found to be false and
forged, the services of the employee may be terminated.
Therefore, the impugned termination orders have been
passed by the respondent authorities in accordance with
law.
</p><p id="p_9">7.   I have heard learned counsel appearing for the
parties, perused the pleadings and documents appended  
thereto.
</p><p id="p_10">8.   It is admitted that the petitioners were appointed
after due selection process and after verification of
their documents. Subsequently, it was found that some of
the documents filed by some candidates/petitioners were
not genuine; therefore, the appointment orders of the
petitioners, which were made pursuant to the selection
process, were cancelled.
</p><p id="p_11">9.   In this batch of matters, it appears that a notice
was issued on                3-10-2009 (Annexure P/8 to
W.P. (S) No.6713 of 2009) to produce the original
documents.  However, thereafter the petitioners were not
afforded any opportunity of hearing to put forward their
case before passing the impugned orders.
</p><p id="p_12">10.  `Show cause notice' implies opportunity of submitting
an explanation to a clear unambiguous notice. Thus, in the
facts of the case an information was brought in the
knowledge of the petitioners without giving show cause
notice to file response to prove genuineness or bona fide
of the documents.

<p id="p_14">12.  Under the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is of

     the considered opinion that it cannot be held that proper

     opportunity of hearing was afforded to the petitioners

     before passing the impugned orders. In the present cases,

     it appears that no opportunity of hearing as required

     under the principles of natural justice and fair play in

     action was afforded.

visits with civil consequences, the same is vitiated, if
passed without affording an opportunity of hearing to the

                purpose   of   rules  of   natural

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_20">            21.  Applying well settled principle of law to the facts
                of the cases, there is a common thread that the principle
                of natural justice is not unruly horse. The principles of
                natural justice are required to be complied with, having
                regard to the facts situation obtained therein. Thus, the
                principles of natural justice may not be required to be
                followed in the cases, where the facts are admitted.
                Secondly, that it is practically impossible or highly
                improbable to afford an opportunity of hearing, in the
                event, of quashing of selection on account of irregularity
                committed on mass scale, or en-masse cancellation.

<p id="p_18">16.  Applying the well-settled principles of law to  the

     facts of the cases, the impugned orders dated 31-10-2009

     passed  in  these writ petitions are quashed.   The

     petitioners are entitled to reinstate in their respective

     services without back wages. However, having regard to the

     facts situation of the case, liberty is reserved to the

     respondents to take appropriate action/steps in accordance

     with law, if so advised, after complying with basic

     principles of natural justice and fair play in action.
