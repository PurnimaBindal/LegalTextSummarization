HEADNOTE:
%
     The appellant  is an  advocate.  Pursuant	to  an	oral
agreement, he  let out	to the	respondent  a  part  of	 his
residential premises  comprising  of  two  rooms  above	 the
garage, referred to as "servants'quarters" and a hall on the
ground floor,  in July	1976 at	 Rs.600 p.m.  Since November
1976 the  respondent started  paying two separate amounts of
Rs.250 and  Rs.350 the	latter amount by means of cheques in
the name of Balkunj, a registered trust, of which he was the
Secretary.
     In January 1980 the landlord filed an eviction petition
under proviso (e) to <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_4">section 14(1)</a> of the Delhi Rent Control
Act, 1958  on the  ground that	he  required  the  servants'
quarters for  his servants  and the  hall for his office and
library. The respondent resisted the petition on a number of
grounds. The  two grounds with which this Court is concerned
are that  (1) two  separate tenancies  came to be created in
respect of the premises in dispute and hence the petition as
filed was  not maintainable  and (2) the intended use of the
hall  as  office  constituted  a  non-residential  use,	 and
therefore outside  the purview	of proviso  (e)	 to  <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_5">section
14(1)</a>.
     The Rent  Controller  held	 that  there  was  a  single
tenancy, that  the landlord  bona fide required the premises
for his use, and that setting up his office and library fell
within the  scope of  the relevant  statutory provision. The
High Court in the revision petition under sub
1059
section (8) of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_6">section 25B</a> of the Act, reversed the findings
of the	Rent Controller	 and  modified	the  eviction  order
passed by him restricting it to the servant's quarters only.
     In regard	to the	first ground, the respondent submits
that the  fact that the landlord was aware of the use of the
hall by	 the trust  and his  acceptance of  the	 cheques  on
behalf of  the trust  prove that the trust had been accepted
as the tenant in respect of the hall. In this connection the
respondent relies on the appellant's letter dated 26.11.1978
to the respondent, in which the landlord specifically refers
to the	fact that  five of  the	 dishonoured  cheques  being
returned by him "belong to the trust". The appellant, on the
other hand,  submits that  acceptance of  two cheques  alone
cannot lead  to the  conclusion that  a separate tenancy had
been created  in respect of the hall between Balkunj and the
petitioner. The	 appellant further relies on the two letters
dated  5.8.1977	  and  15.1.1978   written  by	him  to	 the
respondent categorically  denying the  tenancy on  behalf of
Balkunj. He  further submits  that the	finding of  the Rent
Controller  that   there  was  only  a	single	tenancy	 was
essentially  a	finding	 of  fact,  based  on  material	 and
circumstances, with  which the	High Court  should not	have
interfered.
     In regard	to the	second ground  the respondent  urges
that the intended use of the hall by the appellant as office
and library could not amount to a residential requirement.
     Allowing the appeal this Court,
^
     HELD: (1)	It is  no doubt	 true that the rent has been
paid by two cheques since November 1976 but the mere payment
of rent	 by two	 cheques, in the circumstances of this case,
cannot mean  that there were two tenancies. The landlord was
entitled to  a rent of Rs.600p.m. and so long as he got this
amount it was immaterial for him whether the amount was paid
in a  lump sum	or by one cheque or more than one cheque and
who the	 makers of  the cheques	 were. It  is not unusual to
come across  cases where  a tenant  pays the  rent not	by a
cheque drawn  by himself but by a cheque drawn by some other
concern in  which he  has an  interest such as a partnership
concern, a  limited company  etc. It  is also  true that the
landlord might	have been  aware that  certain activities of
Balkunj were being carried on in the hall. But this can only
mean that the landlord permitted the tenant to use a portion
of the	premises for  running the  activities of  the trust.
Even  assuming	 that  these   two  facts  might  have	been
sufficient to  draw any	 such inference as is suggested, the
two letters of the landlord, dated 5.8.77 and 15.1.78
1060
place  the   matter  beyond  all  doubt.  The  landlord	 had
categorically asserted	in these  letters that	he  did	 not
recognize Balkunj as his tenant. [1063G-H; 1064A-E]
     (2) The  finding of  the Rent Controller that there was
only a single tenancy was essentially a finding of fact with
which the  High Court  should not  have	 interfered.  Though
under <a href="/doc/828425/" id="a_7">Section  25(B)(8)</a> of  the Delhi  Rent Control  Act the
powers of  the High  Court are	somewhat wider	than similar
powers of  revision under section 115 of the Civil Procedure
Code, it  is well  established by  a series  of decisions of
this Court that the power of revision under the Rent Control
Act does not entitle the High Court to enter into the merits
of the	factual controversies  between the  parties  and  to
reverse findings of fact in this regard. [1064F-H; 1065A]
     (3) Any  professional man of standing would necessarily
have to	 set apart  a portion  of his  residence as a study,
office or  library and	the premises  do not cease to be his
residence because  of that.  In ascertaining  the bona	fide
need of	 residence, in the case of a lawyer, the fact that a
room has  to be	 used as an office cannot be a consideration
extraneous to  the scope  and content  of clause(e)  of	 the
proviso to<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_8"> s. 14(1)</a>. It may be that in a case where a lawyer
seeks to  evict a  tenant on  the  ground  that	 the  entire
premises sought	 to be	got vacated are solely needed by him
for use	 as his	 office and library, his requirement may not
satisfy the  requirements of  clause(e) of the proviso to<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_9"> s.
14(1)</a>. [1066A-B; 1065F-G]

     The Judgment of the Court was delivered by
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">1061</span>
     RANGANATHAN, J. The appellant is an advocate. He is the
owner of  premises No. H-2/6 Model Town, Delhi. He let out a
part of	 this premises	comprising a  set of rooms above the
garage (which  may be  briefly	referred  to  as  'servants'
quarters') and a hall on the ground floor of the building to
the respondent.	 The letting  was oral and on a monthly rent
of Rs.600  (exclusive of electricity and water charges) from
July 1976.
</p><p id="p_5">     2. In  January 1980,  the landlord	 filed	an  eviction
petition under	proviso (e)  to <a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_13">section	 14(1)</a> of  the Delhi
Rent Control  Act. He  claimed that  he needed	the premises
bona fide  for	the  personal  residential  requirements  of
himself and  the members of his family. His case was that he
was having his office at Chandni Chowk on a first floor but,
as he  had been advised by the doctor not to climb upstairs,
he desired  to move  the office	 and library  to the  ground
floor hall of the premises in question. He also claimed that
the servants'  quarters were  required for  the use  of	 his
servants and their families.
</p><p id="p_6">     3. The  petition was  resisted by	the respondent	on a
number of grounds. We are, however, concerned here only with
two of	the grounds  put forward  by the  tenant. His  first
submission was	that though  the premises had initially been
taken only  for the residential use of himself, subsequently
two separate  tenancies	 had  been  created  in	 respect  of
premises in  dispute. He claimed that he was the tenant only
of the	servants' quarters  and that  the hall or the ground
floor had  been let  out to  Bal Kunj  (a society registered
under the  <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_14">Societies Registration Act</a>, 1860) of which he was
the Secretary.	It was	pointed out  that from November 1986
onwards, the  petitioner was  being paid  two sums, a sum of
Rs.250 by the respondent and another sum of Rs.350 per month
by the	respondent on behalf of Bal Kunj. It was, therefore,
contended that	the petition  as filed was not maintainable.
The second  plea  taken	 by  the  respondent  was  that	 the
intended use  of the  ground floor hall as the office of the
petitioner-lawyer constituted a non-residential use and was,
therefore, outside the purview of proviso (e) to<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_15"> s. 14(1)</a>.
</p><p id="p_7">     4. The  Rent Controller rejected the contentions of the
tenant. He  held that  there had  been a single tenancy. The
premises had  been let	out by	the  landlord  only  to	 the
respondent, Prabhu Chaudhury, on a rent of Rs.600 per month.
On the	second aspect,	the claim  of the  landlord that  he
required the  entire premises  for use	by himself  and	 his
servants and that the ground floor was needed for setting up
his office  and library	 was held  by the Rent Controller to
fall within the scope of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">1062</span>
the  relevant  statutory  provision.  The  Rent	 Controller,
therefore,  directed   eviction	 as   prayed  for   by	 the
petitioner.
</p><p id="p_8">     5. The above order had been passed under the provisions
of <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_16">section  25B</a> of  the Delhi Rent Control Act. The landlord
having succeeded  in his eviction petition, the tenant filed
a revision  petition before  the Delhi High Court under sub-
section (8) of that section. The learned Judge who heard the
petition reversed  the findings	 of the	 Rent Controller. He
held that  the landlord	 would be  entitled  to	 be  put  in
possession only	 of the	 servants'  quarters  and  that	 the
petitioner could not claim the use of the hall on the ground
floor. In  the result, therefore, the learned Judge modified
the order  passed by  the Rent Controller. He restricted the
eviction  order	 granted  by  the  Rent	 Controller  to	 the
servants' quarters.  We may mention here that, in compliance
with the  order of  the learned	 Judge, the  respondent	 has
since  vacated	 and  delivered	 vacant	 possession  of	 the
servants' quarters  to the  landlord. The controversy before
us is restricted to the hall on the ground floor.
</p><p id="p_9">     6. The first question that arises for our consideration
is whether  the High  Court was	 right in holding that there
were two separate tenancies, one in respect of the servants'
quarters and  the other in respect of the hall on the ground
floor. The  position is this. There was oral evidence let in
by the petitioner to show that the premises had been let out
to the respondent in July 1976 at Rs.600 p.m. It appears the
respondent started paying two separate amounts of Rs.250 and
Rs.350 since  November 1976. It also appears that the former
amount was paid by the respondent and the letter by means of
cheques in the name of the trust. It also seems to be common
ground that  the  respondent  was  occupying  the  servants'
quarters and  the Bal  Kunj was	 occupying the	hall on	 the
ground floor  though it	 is not	 clear at what point of time
this happened.	Counsel for  the respondent  relies on these
circumstances. He  wants to use the fact that the petitioner
who was	 also occupying	 a hall on the ground floor adjacent
to the	hall occupied  by the  trust clearly  must have been
aware of  the use  of the  hall to submit that the trust had
been accepted  as a  tenant in respect of the hall at Rs.350
p.m. He	 also relies  on  a  fact-which	 he  says  the	Rent
Controller completely  missed-that in 1978, when a number of
cheques given to the landlord had been returned dishonoured,
the landlord  wrote a  letter dated 26.11.1978 to the tenant
in which  he specifically  referred to the fact that five of
the cheques  "belong to Balkunj." It is submitted that these
facts clearly  put the	matter beyond all doubt that, though
initially the premises had been taken only by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">1063</span>
respondent, it	had subsequently  been	converted  into	 two
tenancies. Learned  counsel for	 the landlord  on the  other
hand submitted	that the question whether there was a single
tenancy or  two tenancies is essentially a question of fact.
The   Rent    Controller,   after   appreciating   all	 the
circumstances, had  come to  the conclusion that there was a
single tenancy.	 There	was  clear  evidence  to  show	that
initially, in  July 1976,  the	landlord  had  let  out	 the
premises only  to the  respondent  for	a  monthly  rent  of
Rs.600. It  is true  that subsequently,	 after a few months,
the tenant  paid the rent by way of two cheques-one drawn by
himself and  the other	drawn on  behalf  of  Balkunj.	But,
learned	 counsel   submits,  relying   on  the	decision  in
<a href="/doc/349194/" id="a_17">Sheodhari Rai v. Suraj Prasad Singh</a>, AIR 1954 S.C. 758, this
alone cannot  lead to the conclusion that a separate tenancy
had been  created in respect of the hall between Balkunj and
the petitioner.	 Learned counsel  also pointed	out that the
Rent Controller	 had referred to two important documents, AW
8/18 and  AW 8/20. These were two letters dated 5.8.1977 and
15.1.1978.  In	 these	two   letters	the   landlord	 had
specifically and  categorically denied the tenancy on behalf
of Balkunj.  What had  happened was  that the  respondent on
behalf of Balkunj had written to the landlord making certain
claims for  repairs etc.  in respect of the hall occupied by
Balkunj. Immediately  the landlord wrote back saying that he
had nothing to do with Balkunj, that the tenancy was only in
favour of  the respondent,  and that  he did  not  recognise
Balkunj	 as   his  tenant.   These  two	  letters   remained
unanswered. Learned  counsel for  the  landlord,  therefore,
submitted  that	 there	was  ample  material  and  clinching
evidence  before   the	Rent   Controller  to  come  to	 the
conclusion that	 there was  a single  tenancy and  that	 was
between	 Prabhu	  Chowdhary  and   the	landlord  and  that,
therefore,  there   was	 no  question  of  there  being	 two
tenancies as held by the High Court.
</p><p id="p_10">     7. We are inclined to agree with this submission of the
landlord. The  initial tenancy	was only  an  oral  tenancy.
Nevertheless there  were two  witnesses who deposed that the
original tenancy  agreement was	 only between the petitioner
and the	 respondent. At	 that time, admittedly, there was no
question of  Balkunj being  the tenant	in  respect  of	 any
portion of  the premises.  All that  the respondent  says is
that subsequently  cheques were	 being issued in the name of
Balkunj also  and that	this must  be taken  to lead  to  an
inference that	the petitioner	had accepted  Balkunj as its
tenant. It  is very difficult to accept this argument. It is
no doubt  true that  the rent  has been	 paid by two cheques
since November	1976 but  the mere  payment of	rent by	 two
cheques, in the circumstances of this case, cannot mean that
there were  two tenancies.  The landlord  was entitled	to a
rent of Rs.600 p.m. and so
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">1064</span>
long as	 he got	 this amount,  it  was	immaterial  for	 him
whether the  amount was	 paid in a lump sum or by one cheque
or more	 than one  cheque and  who the makers of the cheques
were. It  is not unusual to come across cases where a tenant
pays the  rent not  by a  cheque drawn	by himself  but by a
cheque drawn  by some  other concern  in  which	 he  has  an
interest such  as a partnership concern a limited company or
other entity  in which	he is  interested. So, the mere fact
that for  some reason  the respondent  chose not  to issue a
single cheque  for the	rent of	 Rs.600 but that he gave two
separate cheques,  one for  Rs.250 drawn  by himself and one
for Rs.350  drawn in  the name	of Balkunj cannot lead to an
irresistible conclusion	 that the  tenancy  was	 created  in
favour of  Balkunj with the concurrence of the landlord. The
letter dated 26.11.78, far from "clinching" the respondent's
claim, as  held by  the High  Court, does  not in  our	view
improve the tenant's case at all. It only evidences the fact
that the  landlord was	receiving the  cheques issued in the
name  of   the	trust	in  discharge  of  the	respondent's
obligation to  pay the	rent of	 Rs.600 p.m. It is also true
that, since  the landlord  was also  occupying a part of the
ground floor premises, he might have been aware that certain
activities of Balkunj were being carried on in the hall. But
this can only mean that the landlord permitted the tenant to
use a  portion of  the premises	 let  out  for	running	 the
activities of  the trust.  Even assuming  that, standing  by
themselves these  two facts  might have	 been sufficient  to
draw any  such inference as is suggested, the two letters of
5.8.77 and  15.1.78 place  the matter  beyond all doubt. The
landlord categorically	asserted in  these letters  that  he
does not  recognize Balkunj  as	 his  tenant  and  that	 the
respondent alone was his tenant. There was no reply to these
letters from  the respondent.  In these	 circumstances there
can be	no doubt  at all  that the premises had been let out
only to	 the respondent	 by the	 petitioner and that Balkunj
cannot be  considered to  be a tenant of the premises or any
portion thereof.
</p><p id="p_11">     8. The  finding of	 the Rent  Controller that there was
only a	single tenancy	was essentially	 a finding  of	fact
based on  the material	and circumstances  to which  we have
adverted and  we are  also inclined to accept the conclusion
of the	Rent Controller	 as the	 correct one.  We also agree
with the landlord that this is a finding with which the High
Court should  not  have	 interfered.  Though  under  <a href="/doc/828425/" id="a_18">Section
25(B)(8)</a> of  the Delhi	Rent Control  Act the  powers of the
High  Court  are  somewhat  wider  than	 similar  powers  of
revision under	section 115  of the Civil Procedure Code, it
is well	 established by	 a series of decisions of this Court
that the  power of revision under the Rent Control Acts does
not entitle  the High  Court to enter into the merits of the
factual con
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">1065</span>
troversies between  the parties	 and to	 reverse findings of
fact in	 this regard.  It is sufficient, in this context, to
refer to the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1378557/" id="a_19">Helper Girdharbhai v.
Saiyed Mohmad</a>,	[1987] 3  SCC 538 which was reviewed earlier
decisions. The	decision in  <a href="/doc/459568/" id="a_20">Sushila Devi v. Avinash Chandra
Jain</a>,  [1987]	2  S.C.C.  219	to  which  counsel  for	 the
respondent referred, lays down no different principle.
</p><p id="p_12">     9. So  far as  the second	point is  concerned, learned
counsel for the respondent relied upon two decisions of this
Court in  Mohanlal v.  Kondi, [1979]  3	 S.C.R.	 12  and  in
Subramania Mudaliar v. Kolapur Traders, [1981] 4 SCC 511. In
the former,  it was  held that the profession of a lawyer is
"business" within  the meaning	of S.  10(3)(a)(iii) of	 the
Andhra Pradesh	Building (Lease,  Rent &amp;  Eviction)  Control
Act, 1960.  The latter is a decision to a like effect. These
decisions are not of much help in the context of the present
case and  of the  provisions of clause (e) of the proviso to
s. 14(1) of the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_21">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>. Here the landlord is
seeking to  recover possession	of a  residential  premises.
There is,  as we  have already	held, a	 single	 tenancy  in
favour of  the respondent  for a residential purpose. Though
learned counsel	 for the  respondent invited us to say that,
so far	as the	hall was  concerned, the premises were being
used by a trust and, hence for a non-residential purpose, we
cannot permit  him to  raise this  plea. Such a plea was not
taken before  the High	Court. Against the order of the High
Court,	the  respondent	 had  also  filed  a  special  leave
petition to  this Court	 which has  been  dismissed.  It  is
therefore not  open to	the respondent	to urge	 this  point
before us.  The only  point taken  before the High Court was
that the  petitioner could not get relief because the use of
the hall  by a	lawyer as  his office  and library could not
amount to  a residential  requirement. We  shall, therefore,
confine ourselves to this question.
</p><p id="p_13">     10. In  our opinion,  the contention  of the respondent
cannot be  accepted in the extreme form in which it is urged
here. It may be that in a case where a lawyer seeks to evict
a tenant on the ground that the entire premises sought to be
got vacated  are solely	 needed by him for use as his office
and  library,	his  requirement   may	 not   satisfy	 the
requirements of	 clause (e)  of the proviso to<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_22"> s. 14(1)</a>. But
this is	 quite different from saying that where the premises
are sought to be got vacated for use as a residence and, the
landlord being	a lawyer  desires to  use  a  part  of	such
residence as a study, office or library, such use would be a
non-residential use.  Any professional man of standing would
necessarily have to set apart a portion of his residence for
such purposes  and the	premises do  not  cease	 to  be	 his
residence because
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">1066</span>
of that.  in the present case, the petitioner seeks eviction
of  the	  suit	premises   for	his  bona  fide	 residential
requirement and	 the use  of the  hall as  an office is only
incidental to  such a  requirement. In ascertaining the bona
fide need  of residence,  in the  case of a lawyer, the fact
that a	room has  to be	 used  as  an  office  cannot  be  a
consideration extraneous  to the scope and content of clause
</p><p id="p_14">(e) of the proviso to<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_23"> s. 14(1)</a>.
</p><p id="p_15">     11. To  test  our	conclusion,  we	 may  see  what	 the
position would	be in  the converse case. If, in the present
case, the  petitioner had  stated that	he required the hall
because he  had no  living room in the premises which he was
occupying as  the only	room there  was being, or had to be,
used by	 him as	 an office, the petitioner's claim could not
have been  rejected, for  he would then have needed the hall
clearly as part of his residential requirement. The decision
in Khanna  v. Batra,  [1966] 2	D.L.T. 306 illustrates this.
There, an  advocate, had asked for eviction of a tenant from
the first floor as the ground floor premises occupied by him
were not  sufficient for his needs for purposes of residence
and office.  The Rent  Control Tribunal	 held that since the
appellant  intended  to	 convert  the  existing	 residential
accommodation in  his possession  into an office and library
for the	 use of	 his clerk  and clients, such a user was not
permissible in	law. Reversing	this conclusion,  Grover,  J
observed:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">	  "It seems to me that the Rent Control Tribunal was
	  clearly in  error in	thinking that merely because
	  the appellant	 wanted to  use the accommodation in
	  his possession for professional purposes, he could
	  not claim  benefit of	 the provision	contained in
	  clause (e)  of the proviso to<a href="/doc/367290/" id="a_24"> s. 14(1)</a> of the Act.
	  It was  this error  which led to the conclusion at
	  which the  Rent Control Tribunal arrived upholding
	  the decision	of  the	 Controller  on	 the  second
	  point, namely	 the requirement of the appellant on
	  personal grounds.  I cannot  therefore, accede  to
	  the submission  of the  learned  counsel  for	 the
	  respondent that the finding of the Rent Controller
	  Tribunal with	 regard	 to  the  personal  need  or
	  requirement was  one of  fact and thus immune from
	  challenge in the second appeal."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">     12. Should	 the position  is different  in	 this  case?
</blockquote><p id="p_16">Merely because	the petitioner	has  come  forward  with  an
honest plea  that he  intends to use a part of his residence
as an office, should a different result follow, particularly
in a case like this where ill-health compels him to have his
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">1067</span>
office at  home? Should the result depend on the jugglery of
pleadings or  the substance  of the  matter?  We  think	 the
substance should  prevail. In  our opinion, where a landlord
applies for  the possession of his residential premises, his
bona fide  requirement of  the premises	 for his residential
purposes will  not stand  vitiated merely because he intends
to use a portion of the premises for purposes of his office,
library or study.
</p><p id="p_17">     13. We  are, therefore,  of opinion that the High Court
should not  have interfered  with the  findings of  the Rent
Controller on  this point  as well. This is no doubt a mixed
question of fact and law but, for the reasons given earlier,
we are	inclined to  agree with	 the conclusion	 of the Rent
Controller.
</p><p id="p_18">     14. In  the result,  we hold that the High Court was in
error in  granting relief  to the petitioner only in respect
of the	servants' quarters  and in  declining to  grant	 the
petitioner relief  in respect  of the  hall.  We  allow	 the
appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore
the order  of the  Rent Controller  that the  petitioner  is
entitled  to  the  possession  of  the	entire	premises  in
question. There will, however, be no order as to costs.
