</p><p id="p_10">3.   The prosecution case against the petitioner is founded

on the information divulged, inter-alia, by Nitin Mohindra and

Pankaj Trivedi - that the petitioner had recommended names of

five candidates to facilitate their selection on the post of Forest

Guards     by        resorting          to       unfair        means             in   the

examination conducted by M.P. Professional Examination

Board      (hereinafter             referred           to          as       „VYAPAM

examination‟) and thus the petitioner committed alleged offence
                                                       W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  8</span>

being party to the conspiracy along with other co-accused. The

petitioner has prayed for quashing of FIR qua him. The grounds

stated in the writ petition, inter-alia, are that if a person bonafide

believing that the candidate who has applied for the job has

adequate fitness for that job and there is nothing in his character

and antecedent to disqualify him recommends his name for

consideration, that by itself will not constitute commission of

any offence much less a cognizable offence. Further, no FIR

could have been registered against the petitioner without a

preliminary enquiry for ascertaining the genuineness of the

information and whether it amounts to commission of

cognizable offence. That was mandatory as has been held by the

Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Lalita

Kumari Vs. Government of U.P. and others 1. The second

ground urged in the writ petition, is that, the Special

Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the High Court for

monitoring the investigation of VYAPAM examination scam

crimes was aware of the material submitted by a responsible

leader of a long standing and Member of Rajya Sabha Shri

Digvijay Singh along with his signed affidavit - mentioning that


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">1</span>
    2014 (2) SCC 1
                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                9</span>

the excel sheet to which reference has been made in the FIR has

been forged by alteration and the name of Governor has been

substituted in place of the Chief Minister. That information

ought to have been verified before registration of FIR. At the

same time, however, it is conceded by the petitioner that the said

material pertained to selection of Teachers and not Forest

Guards, which is the subject matter of the impugned FIR. The

third ground urged in the writ petition, is that, the FIR does not

disclose that the informant had personal knowledge of the

factum of Governor having made any recommendation nor the

informant has mentioned that the Governor had communicated

with him in that behalf. On the other hand, the allegations in the

FIR refer to some intermediary and the statement made by

unknown and undisclosed intermediary. That cannot be used to

implicate the Governor of the State. The next ground urged is

that the Governor is a highly respected statesman who is now

more than 87 years old having unblemished record in various

capacities including being Member of Parliament and Chief

Minister of State of Uttar Pradesh. It is then contended that the

petitioner has been suffering from serious health problems and

was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for sometime before
                                                         W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                      10</span>

being discharged and is under constant supervision of Doctors

and medication. It is also contended that the order passed by this

Court        in        suo-moto   proceedings   being   Writ   Petition

No.6385/2014 (in which investigation by STF of VYAPAM

Scam Crimes is being monitored by the High Court), on

20.02.2015, was being misinterpreted to mean that sanction is

accorded to STF to proceed against the petitioner (Governor).

For that, the said order needs to be clarified and/or partially

revoked as it has been passed without giving opportunity to the

petitioner, ex debito justitiae, keeping in mind the legal principle

expounded in A.R.Antulay Vs. R.S.Nayak and another2 and

Ruppa Hurra Vs. Ashok Hurra3. Further, the petitioner‟s right

to a fair trial is being violated thereby his right under <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_15">Article 21</a>

of the Constitution of India has been abridged. It is then urged

that the petitioner has not communicated orally or in writing, to

anyone, muchless recommended any candidate whatsoever for

any job concerning examination conducted by VYAPAM. It is

then contended that the accused Nitin Mohindra is in custody

since 18th July, 2013. During the interrogation he must have

concocted a false theory. That fake theory is being used to name
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">2</span>
    (1988) 2 SCC 602
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">3</span>
    (2002) 4 SCC 388
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">                                 11</span>

the petitioner as one of the offender. Further, the Investigating

Agency has misused the provision of <a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_16">Section 162</a> of Cr.P.C. by

recording statements of co-accused whilst in custody. As the FIR

is based on such statements though formally signed by a Police

Officer, it is the product of the information given by the

co-accused. The person who made such false disclosure should

have signed the FIR as informant and for which reason it must

be declared that no use can be made of that document (impugned

FIR) to proceed against the petitioner being the Governor of the

State. It is next urged in the writ petition that the impugned FIR

is a public document and after its registration is required to be

reported to the Court having jurisdiction to try the case. As a

result, the registration of FIR against the petitioner during his

term of office, by itself, results in infringement of constitutional

immunity extended to the Governor under <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_17">Article 361 (2)</a> of the

Constitution of India. It is next contended that the police officer

investigating the crime has not even asked for permission to

meet the petitioner to verify or enquire about the disclosure

made by Nitin Mohindra who is in custody for quite sometime.

According to the petitioner, the disclosure now made by Nitin

Mohindra is questionable because, it has been made whilst in
                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                12</span>

custody of police for a long time. Long delay in disclosure of the

information also necessitated a preliminary enquiry in view of

exposition in Lalita Kumari's case. The next ground urged in

the petition, is that, the petitioner is entitled for complete

immunity against any criminal proceedings in terms of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_18">Article

361 (2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_19">(3)</a> of the Constitution of India. It is then contended

that the FIR as lodged by the STF is false and frivolous and is

based on statements of co-accused who are in custody for more

than 1 ½ years and further that STF (Investigating Agency) is

adopting pick and choose method and acting under political

pressure and not following the procedure prescribed under the

law.
</p>
<p id="p_11">4.     These are the grounds urged in the writ petition for

quashing of the impugned FIR qua the petitioner. The petitioner

has asked for a further declaration that a preliminary enquiry

must be held to find out as to whether the alleged action of the

petitioner is based on (i) some credible evidence and (ii) it

amounts to commission of cognizable offence, for the purpose of

Lalita Kumari's case.
</p>
<p id="p_12">5.     During the oral arguments Shri Ram Jethmalani, learned

Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the
                                                         W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    13</span>

core issue is about the complete constitutional immunity

extended to the incumbent occupying the office of Governor, in

terms of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_20">Article 361</a> of the Constitution of India. Having regard

to the nature of constitutional duties and powers of the Governor,

that can be interfered with only if the constitution permits to do

so. The institution of criminal action against the Governor

cannot be justified on the basis of any legislation made by the

Parliament which inevitably would impede the constitutional

rights and duties to be discharged by the Governor wholly or

partly. He placed emphasis on the observations of Jurist Story in

his commentaries on the Constitution of United States, which

has been quoted with approval by the Supreme Court in the case

of Union Carbide Corporation and others Vs. Union of India

and others4 at page 641, Jurist Story has observed thus :-

</p><p id="p_13">               "There      are....      Incidental   powers,
           belonging to the executive department, which
           are necessarily implied from the nature of the
           functions, which are confided to it. Among
           these, must necessarily be included the power
           to perform them.... The President cannot,
           therefore, be liable to arrest, imprisonment, or
           detention, while he is in the discharge of the
           duties of his office; and for this purpose his
           person must be deemed, in civil cases at least,
           to possess an official inviolability."

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                14</span>

Reliance is also placed on Paragraphs 101, and 170 to 180 of

the same decision.
</p>
<p id="p_15">6.   Having said this, the learned counsel would then submit

that the imperativeness of immunity from arrest of the Governor

has been explicitly ordained by <a href="/doc/1280300/" id="a_21">Article 361 (3) -</a> which must be

protected and preserved because of the nature of duties and

constitutional powers exercised by him. The immunity given

under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_22">Article 361</a> completely eclipses the statutory powers

vested in the police qua the Governor. The police cannot be

allowed to whittle down that privilege and immunity by

resorting to ordinary process under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_23"> the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure. He further submits that the plenitude of expression

„whatsoever‟ used in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_24">Article 361 (2</a>), is very wide. It not only

encompasses the bar of taking cognizance of the criminal

offence by the Court but also registration of FIR against the

Governor by the police, during the term of his office. For, the

First Information Report (FIR) in respect of a cognizable offence

is a criminal proceeding instituted; and considering the mandate

of <a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_25">Section 157</a> of Cr.P.C., the police officer is obliged to

forthwith submit report to the specified Court in that behalf. That

partakes the color of institution of a criminal proceeding in the
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                15</span>

Court. To buttress this submission, reliance has been placed on

the decision of the Full Bench of Kerala High Court in the case

of Albert Vs. State of Kerala5.       It is then argued that the

criminal proceedings in any Court referred to in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_26">Article 361 (2)</a>

of the Constitution must be understood in the context of the

expression „whatsoever‟, which follows the expression „criminal

proceedings‟; and if conjointly read with the legislative scheme

for registration of FIR as stipulated in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_27">Cr.P.C</a>., in respect of

cognizable offence including the immediate mandatory follow

up steps to be taken by the police officer and the concerned

Court before which the report is submitted, it must follow that

the immunity is absolute and complete in that regard. In other

words, it is not limited to the stage of Court taking cognizance of

the offence after filing of the charge-sheet/police report under

<a href="/doc/1187622/" id="a_28">Section 173</a> of the Code but also for registration of FIR against

the Governor during his term of office. Any other interpretation

would be doing violence to the intendment of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_29">Article 361 (2)</a> and

inevitably entail in whittling down the complete immunity from

the institution of criminal proceedings against the Governor

during his term of office. Reliance has been placed on the

decision of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in

the case of Emperor Vs. Johri6. The Division Bench of the

Allahabad High Court has held that making of a false charge to

the police of a cognizable offence entails in institution of

criminal proceedings within the meaning of <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_30">Section 211</a> of I.P.C.

Further, the expression „criminal proceeding‟ also refers to

police investigation as well as to prosecution.

</p><p id="p_16">7.        In substance, the argument is that the purport of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_31">Article 361</a>

of the Constitution is of complete prohibition -              even for

registration of FIR in respect of a cognizable offence against the

Governor during his term of office. Thus, it is prayed that the

FIR registered against the petitioner deserves to be quashed qua

the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_17">8.        It is then submitted that by virtue of the bar stipulated in

Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_32">Article 361</a> and the complete immunity provided to

the Governor during his term of office from arrest or

imprisonment, the Court must issue appropriate writ and also

direct the Investigating Agency not to take any coercive action

of any kind against the petitioner such as by ordering his

appearance at the police station or compulsorily subjecting him

to interrogation in connection with the alleged offence.

</p><p id="p_18">9.       In the context of the relief to quash the FIR, it is submitted

that in any case, the present FIR does not reveal any facts which

would constitute commission of offence by the petitioner in

particular, with reference to the sections (offences) mentioned

therein. In that, no facts are stated as to what accused No.10, the

present petitioner, had done or illegally omitted to do except

being named as one of the 101 accused cited therein. Reliance is

placed on the celebrated decision in the case of State of

Haryana and Ors Vs. Bhajanlal and others7, wherein the

Court ruled that FIR can be quashed if the allegations made in

the FIR even if believed to be true do not prima facie constitute

or make out a case against the accused or where the allegations

made in the FIR even if proved to be true do not disclose a

cognizable offence.             It is submitted that the petitioner had

allegedly recommended five candidates amongst the other

candidates named by the co-accused.                   That by itself is not

enough to constitute the alleged offence. Further, that evidence

is       wholly       inadmissible     being    hit     by        <a href="/doc/494844/" id="a_33">Sections   25</a>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                 18</span>

<a href="/doc/523607/" id="a_35">Section 162</a> of the Cr.P.C. The statement of co-accused can

never be proved against another co-accused in a Court of law;

and, therefore, in law, it cannot be made the basis of any

accusation against the petitioner. It is also submitted that the FIR

is based on information revealed from Computer Disc seized by

the police. That material cannot be used unless it is disclosed to

the petitioner. Reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme

Court in the case of Additional District Magistrate, Jabalpur

Vs. S.S. Shukla8 in particular, paragraph 415, in support of the

argument that the Court cannot use any evidence not disclosed to

the accused. It is also contended that the Investigating Agency

(STF) itself was not fully convinced about the truthfulness and

veracity of the excel sheets prepared by accused No.2 as is

referred to in the FIR. For, several persons named/mentioned as

middlemen in the said excel sheets have not been named as

accused in the FIR, for reasons best known to the Investigating

Agency. The FIR does not disclose the circumstances in which

accused No.1 and accused No.2 came in police custody on

24.02.2015 for recording of their statements. For, they were in

judicial custody in connection with other crimes of the same

type. Notably, complainant (informant) Baghel, is a police

officer. He has merely referred to the statements of co-accused

in the FIR, without disclosing as to why those statements have

been recorded by him after lapse of more than 1 ½ years whilst

the accused Nos. 1 and 2 were in custody. The FIR does not

explain the delay in recording those statements, which,

inevitably, is a case of inexplicable delay in registration of FIR.

That, there is variance between the factual position disclosed by

accused Nitin Mohindra and another accused Pankaj Trivedi.

Taking their statements as it is, there is nothing to indicate that

the Governor had interacted directly with Nitin Mohindra. He

further submits that the requirement of <a href="/doc/1034470/" id="a_36">Section 154</a> of the Code

is that, there must be informant "to give" information and which

in turn is recorded by the police officer. The Police officer who

recorded the statements of Nitin Mohindra and Pankaj Trivedi or

for that matter any other police officer could not become

informant himself. Moreover, the statements of co-accused

recorded by the police during the course of investigation of some

other crime cannot be treated as information given but as having

been extracted from the co-accused whilst in police custody. It is

then contended that with reference to the description
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015

„Rajbhawan‟, the Investigating Agency has named O.S.D. of the

Governor as accused. In absence of any further evidence, it is

not possible to attribute involvement of the petitioner (Governor)

in commission of the alleged offence. The entry in the excel-

sheets, according to the petitioner, is a cover for somebody who

can be linked on credible and admissible evidence.

</p><p id="p_19">10. In substance, it is contended that the impugned FIR is

founded on the inadmissible statements of accused No.1 and 2

dated 24.02.2015. Accordingly, the FIR qua the petitioner

deserves to be quashed and that the dignity of the office of

Governor must be maintained by directing restraint from any

coercive action.
</p>
<p id="p_20">11.   Although Mr. Jethmalani has prayed for quashing of FIR

qua the petitioner but at the same time he submits on instructions

of the petitioner that the petitioner does not want to impede the

investigation of the crime and that he will extend full

cooperation for investigation of the alleged crime as may be

necessary. The petitioner will ensure that all necessary

information requisitioned by the Investigating Officer within his

control will be furnished and clear instructions in that behalf to

all the officials in his office will be issued. If, in the course of

would provide that information to the Investigating Officer,

provided the concerned police officer must observe proper

protocol so as not to undermine the dignity of the office of the

Governor. Besides the oral arguments, Shri Jethmalani tendered

written submissions as per the liberty given to him, after

conclusion of the arguments.

<p id="p_21">12. The petition has been resisted by the respondent/State. Shri

Hyaderabad per Khan Bahadur C.B. Tarapurwala, General

Power of Attorney Vs. The State through the District

institution of FIR in police station cannot be equated with

criminal proceedings in any Court and so understood the

not       attracted.    In   other   words,   registration   of    FIR

duties of the Governor or purporting to have been done by the

Governor in exercise and performance of his constitutional

powers and duties. According to him, institution/registration of

provisions of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_38">Article 361 (2)</a> are not applicable. The learned

Advocate General, however, has not filed any written

submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_26">14. Shri Vikram Singh, counsel appearing for the Attorney

General/Union of India has filed written submissions even

before opening his oral argument. According to the learned

counsel, the well established rules of interpretation require that

the meaning and intention of the framers of the Constitution - be

it Parliament or a Constituent Assembly - must be ascertained

from the language of that Constitution itself with the motives of

those who framed it. He submits that the expression „criminal

proceedings‟ and the word „institute‟ mentioned in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_39">Article 361

(2)</a> are not defined in <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_40">Cr.P.C</a>. The meaning of those words,

therefore, must be understood as are understood in common

parlance. He has relied on the meaning of these words given in
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015

Black‟s Law Dictionary (6th edn 1990 at Page 374). The criminal

proceeding means a proceeding which lies under the law of

procedure in a criminal court and which is in accordance with

some requirement of, or is performed under some power

conferred by, the relevant procedural provisions. It means some

steps taken before a Court against person or persons charged

with violation of the criminal law. Further, if the investigation

referred to in Chapter XIV of the <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_41">Cr.P.C</a>. is a proceeding

it necessarily follows that it is a criminal proceeding; and the

very fact that expression „criminal proceedings‟ in <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_42">Section 211</a>

of the I.P.C. is not qualified by the word „judicial‟ or by anything

else, goes to show that it "is" a proceeding before a Court of law

or other Tribunal. It is wide enough to include a proceeding

under the said<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_43"> Chapter of the Criminal Procedure Code</a>.

It is submitted that criminal law is set in motion by

giving information to the police about the commission of

cognizable offence and the police are bound to investigate that

accusation and file report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_44">Section 173</a> of the

„institute‟ as occurring in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_45">Article 361 (2)</a> of the Constitution,

reliance has been placed on the decision in In re The Vexatious

Karnataka High Court in the case of Dr. Smt. Mangala Sridhar

Vs. the Karnataka Governor Secretriate Office and others15

wherein suspension order passed against the petitioner - who

was a member of the Karnataka Public Service Commission,

primarily in the context of the purport of <a href="/doc/1871788/" id="a_48">Article 317</a> of the

Constitution. He also placed reliance on the decision of the

on the Head of a State - be it President or Governor - in terms of

terms of Clause - (2) and Clause - (3) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_51">Article 361</a> will be

relevant. We, therefore, deem it apposite to reproduce the same

which reads thus :-

<p id="p_31">18. It is well established position that a special approach must

be adopted for the interpretation and construction of the

provisions in the Constitution to determine the meaning of its

parts in keeping with its broad and basic purposes and

objectives. For, the nature of a Constitution of a Soveriegn

Republic as observed by the Supreme Court in the case of State
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015

of Karnataka Vs. Union of India and another18, is meant to

endure and stand the test of time, the strains and stresses of

changing circumstances, to govern the exercise of all

Governmental powers, continuously, and to determine the

destiny of a nation could be said to require a special approach so

that judicial intervention does not unduly thwart the march of the

nation towards the goals it has set before itself. The Court went

on to observe that the dynamic needs of the nation, which a

Constitution must fulfill, leave no room for merely pedantic

hairsplitting play with words or semantic quibblings. The Court,

however, cautioned that in doing so under the guise of a judicial

power, which certainly extends to even making the Constitution,

in the sense that they may supplement it in those parts of it

where the letter of the Constitution is silent or may leave room

for its development by either ordinary legislation or judicial

interpretation, can actually nullify, defeat, or distort the

reasonably clear meaning of any part of the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_32">19. In the case of Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and others

Vs. State of U.P. And others19, the Supreme Court observed that

the the courts are not free to stretch or to pervert the language of

an enactment in the interests of any legal or constitutional

theory. It went on to observe that Constitutional adjudication is

not strengthened by such an attempt but it must seek to declare

the law but it must not try to give meaning on the theory of what

the law should be, but it must so look upon a Constitution that it

is a living and organic thing and must adapt itself to the

changing situations and pattern in which it has to be interpreted.

The Court further added that "each general word would be held

to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly

and       reasonably    be   comprehended".   The   provision     of

Constitution must be interpreted as an organic document in the

light of the experience gathered.

<p id="p_33">20. In the case of <a href="/doc/745161/" id="a_52">R.C. Poudyal v. Union of India</a> and

others20, in paragraph 79, the Supreme Court observed that the

interpretation of constitutional document, "words are but the

framework of concept and concepts may change more than

words themselves". It is further observed that the significance of

the change of the concepts themselves is vital and the

constitutional issues are not solved by a mere appeal to the

meaning of the words without an acceptance of the line of their


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">20</span>
     AIR 1993 SC 1804
                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015

growth. Further, 'the intention of a Constitution is rather to

outline the principles than to engrave details'.

</p><p id="p_34">21. Keeping these cardinal principles in mind, we may

endeavour to give meaning to the words found in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_53">Article 361 (2)</a>

in particular, which are not otherwise, defined either in the

Constitution or the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_54"> of Criminal Procedure Code</a>,

namely, "criminal proceedings‟‟, "whatsoever" and "institution,

in any Court".
</p>
<p id="p_35">22. The plain language of Clause - (3) leaves no manner of

doubt that the arrest or imprisonment of the Head of a State

during his term of office pursuant to any process, is

"completely" prohibited. Some discussion, however, has become

necessary in the context of Clause - (2), which envisages that

no "criminal proceedings whatsoever" shall be "instituted" or

continued against the Head of a State "in any Court" during his

term of office.
</p>
<p id="p_36">23. The moot question before us is : whether "registration" of

First Information Report under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_55">Section 154</a> of the Cr.P.C. in

respect of commission of cognizable offences under <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_56">I.P.C</a>. or

other penal laws, against the Governor during his term of office,

by name, is also prohibited within the sweep of this Clause?
</p><p id="p_37">                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                31</span>

</p><p id="p_38">24. Indubitably, First Information Report is registered in the

concerned police station and not in any Court as such. If so

literally understood, the rigours of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_57">Article 361 (2)</a> will not be

attracted. But, registration of FIR on receipt of information

disclosing cognizable offence as a general rule is made

mandatory in terms of <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_58">Section 154</a> of the Cr.P.C., as held by the

Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari's

case (supra). The two fold objective of immediate and

compulsory registration of FIR is to set the criminal process in

motion and is well documented from the very start; preventing

embellishment of relevant matter at a later stage. It is also to

ensure transparency in the criminal justice delivery system and

functioning of police providing for an efficient means to check

power of police as also for judicial oversight for the same. The

Court then went on to observe that the FIR may be of two types

namely - duly signed FIR by the informant to the Police Officer

and second being FIR registered by police itself on any

information received other than by way of an informant.

</p><p id="p_39">25. In the present case, the FIR is of the latter category.

Registration of FIR is for setting the criminal action in motion.

As a concomitant, it must follow that it is the first step towards
                                                      W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                   32</span>

institution of criminal process.
</p>
<p id="p_40">26. Two further questions may have to be dealt with to find an

answer to the contention canvassed by the petitioner. Firstly,

whether    FIR    would    qualify      the   expression   "criminal

proceedings", by itself; and secondly whether "institution of

FIR" in the police station can be "deemed to be criminal

proceedings instituted in any Court". Only whence the protection

and immunity extended in Clause - (2) will be attracted.

</p><p id="p_41">27. For dealing with the former question, we may have to bear

in mind that the expression "criminal proceedings" is neither

defined in the Constitution of India or<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_59"> the Code</a> of Criminal

Procedure, 1973. It is, however, well settled that the expression

"criminal proceedings" is wider than the expression "judicial

proceedings" defined in <a href="/doc/629401/" id="a_60">Section 2</a> (i)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_61"> of the Code</a>. The

expression "judicial proceedings" in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_62"> the Code</a> predicates that it

includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or

may be legally taken on oath. The registration of FIR would

certainly not qualify the definition of "judicial proceedings".

But, as aforesaid, the expression "criminal proceedings", being

wider than the expression "judicial proceedings", must

encompass the act of institution or registration of First
                                                             W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                     33</span>

Information Report by the police officer - which is to set in

motion criminal action.
</p>
<p id="p_42">28. The expression "proceeding" simplicitor and in particular

resorted to by a police officer is mentioned in sub Section (2) of

<a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_63">Section 156</a> of the Code. The term „proceedings‟ has been

defined in the Law Lexicon. The two of them given below bring

out the essential import of the words, has been stated as

follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_7">            (1)   "The word "procedings" ordinarily relates to
       forms of law, to the modes in which judicial transactions
       are conducted."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_8">            (2)   „The term proceedings‟ is a very
       comprehensive term and generally speaking means a
       prescribed course of action for enforcing a legal right
       and hence it necessarily embraces the requisite steps by
       which a judicial action is invoked."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_43">29.   The word „proceeding‟ simplicitor is also used in <a href="/doc/386019/" id="a_64">Section

310</a> of the Code with reference to action to be taken by the

Police. These provisions leave no manner of doubt that

proceeding can be other than enquiry or a trial and including acts

and duties of police or Magistrate to be discharged as per the

provisions in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_65"> the Code</a> being statutory action. This lends support

to the view that we are taking and which is in consonance with

the settled legal position that the act of registration of FIR by the

police officer is no less a "criminal proceedings", which ignites
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                34</span>

the criminal process in respect of any cognizable offence.

</p><p id="p_44">30. Having said this, we may now turn to the second part of the

question posed in para 26 above. For that, we may once again

usefully refer to the dictum of the Apex Court in the case of

Lalita Kumari (supra) which takes the view that the objective

of registration of FIR under <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_66">Section 154</a> is to set the criminal

process in motion. Further, the Officer-in-charge of a police

station by following procedure under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_67">Section 154</a> of the Code,

after registration of FIR in respect of cognizable offence, by

virtue of <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_68">Section 157</a> (1), is obliged to forthwith send a report of

the same to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of

such offence upon a police report. Upon receiving such report as

predicated in <a href="/doc/244234/" id="a_69">Section 159</a> of the Code, the Magistrate can direct

an investigation, or, if he thinks fit, at once proceed, or depute

any Magistrate subordinate to him to proceed, to hold a

preliminary enquiry or otherwise to dispose of, the case in the

manner provided in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_70"> the Code</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_45">31. In addition, <a href="/doc/1687975/" id="a_71">Section 167</a> of the Code empowers the

Magistrate to remand the accused to police custody or judicial

custody as the case may be, even before filing of the report of

police officer on completion of investigation as required under
                                                              W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                     35</span>

<a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_72">Section 173</a> of the Code. Similarly, even before filing of the

police report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_73">Section 173</a> of the Code and taking

cognizance of the crime, the Magistrate is empowered to declare

the person against whom warrant has been issued as an

absconder and publish written proclamation requiring him to

appear as per <a href="/doc/1598801/" id="a_74">Section 82</a> of the Code and to attach the property

of such absconding person as per <a href="/doc/886456/" id="a_75">Section 83</a> of the Code. Failure

of the Magistrate to act upon that report does not make it any

less criminal proceeding instituted before the Court.

</p><p id="p_46">32. The word „institute‟ has not been defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_76"> the Code</a> or the

Constitution. The common parlance meaning of that word can be

traced to definition given in Prems Judicial Dictionary Vol. 1

Page 886 which reads thus :-

</blockquote>
<p id="p_47">33. No doubt mere registration of FIR by the police may not be

institution of proceedings "before any Court", but by

interpretative process, keeping in mind the legislative scheme of

the follow up actions to be taken by the police as also the

Magistrate immediately with the registration of FIR, it clearly

denotes that the FIR is laid before the Magistrate for discharging

statutory duties specified in <a href="/doc/244234/" id="a_82">Section 159</a> of the Code. A priori,

mere registration of FIR under <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_83">Section 154</a> must be deemed to

be criminal proceedings instituted before the Court (Magistrate).

It must, therefore, attract Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_84">Article 361</a> of the

Constitution, being "criminal proceedings whatsoever" instituted
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                37</span>

in the Court. Inasmuch as, consequent to forwarding of FIR to

the Court it is effectively laid before the Magistrate and

resultantly deemed to be instituted in the Court. Viewed thus, in

law, the police is prohibited even from registration of FIR in

respect of cognizable offence against the Head of a State - as

envisaged in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_85">Article 361 (2)</a> of our Constitution.

</p><p id="p_48">34. We are inclined to take this view also because, in law, it is

not permissible for the police officer to merely register the FIR

in respect of the cognizable offence and do nothing more. The

factum of registration of FIR is required to be communicated to

the Magistrate alongwith FIR. Once the FIR is placed before the

Magistrate it partakes the colour of criminal proceedings

instituted in the Court within the meaning of Clause (2) of

<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_86">Article 361.</a> It would have been a different matter if the

provisions such as <a href="/doc/279174/" id="a_87">Section 157</a> and <a href="/doc/244234/" id="a_88">159</a> of the Code were absent.

Because of these provisions, the FIR does not remain in the

police record muchless confidential, but is required to be placed

before the Court contemporaneously so as to enable the Court to

act upon it and issue appropriate directions even before taking

cognizance of the case. Taking any other view would open an

avenue to register malicious and vexatious FIR making out a
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                38</span>

case of commission of cognizable offence against the Head of a

State and thus render the immunity under <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_89">Article 361</a> of the

Constitution redundant and expendable. In the context of the

intent behind extending such immunity to the Head of a State it

is imperative to hold that the police is prohibited from even

registering FIR against the Head of a State during his term of

office because of the bar contained in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_90">Article 361 (2).</a>

</p><p id="p_49">35. Notably, the immunity bestowed on the incumbent in the

office of Governor under <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_91">Article 361 (2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1659104/" id="a_92">(3)</a> is unqualified

and absolute. It is not limited to offences committed in discharge

of official acts as Head of a State, unlike in the matters covered

by <a href="/doc/1340387/" id="a_93">Article 361 (1)</a> or 361 (4). This view is inescapable also

because of the expression "whatsoever" following the expression

"criminal proceedings" in Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_94">Article 361.</a> The sweep

of expression "criminal proceedings" of all types including in

the form of submission of report by a police officer to the

Magistrate empowered to take cognizance, would thus attract

Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_95">Article 361</a> of the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_50">36. Considering the immunity or privilege extended to the

Heads of the State because of their constitutional duties and

powers, this interpretation would be unyielding and inexorable.
</p><p id="p_51">                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                39</span>

Indeed, the privilege in Clause (2) and Clause (3) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_96">Article 361</a>

is confined during the term of office and there would be no such

bar to proceed, soon after the incumbent ceases to hold the office

either by efflux of time or because of resignation or removal.

</p><p id="p_52">37. Although the learned Advocate General had stoutly relied

on the decision of the Hyderabad High Court in the case of

H.E.H. the Nizam Rajpramukh of Hyaderabad per Khan

Bahadur C.B. Tarapurwala, General Power of Attorney

(supra),   that case was to question the order passed by the

District Magistrate directing the Commissioner, City Police, to

make an enquiry in respect of the information received from

private party and submit a report about the alleged offence

against the Governor, being barred by <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_97">Article 361 (2).</a> On a close

scanning of the said decision, it is noticed that the Division

Bench in no unambiguous terms after analyzing host of

decisions of the Courts in India and foreign Courts as also after

undertaking comparative studies of the sweep of immunity and

privilege extended to the Head of a State in other countries,

expounded the rationale underlying the immunity afforded to the

executive Heads. It went on to observe that interpretation of

<a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_98">Article 361 (2)</a> must be such as to be consistent with it and
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                40</span>

further that intendment. In para 38, the Court opined that there is

fine distinction between taking cognizance of an offence and

institution of criminal proceedings. The latter must be looked at

from the point of view of something done to commence such

proceedings. In para 40, it is held that the object of such

provision is not only to prohibit the Heads of the executive from

being exposed to criminal proceedings during their term of

office, "but also to avoid any publicity whatever in relation to

any alleged offence", because it is necessary in the interests of

the State and good government that those persons should as long

as they are holding the office, be kept free from involvement in a

criminal Court. The Court after adverting to the legal precedents

opined that the insertion of the word "whatsoever" makes a great

difference in the interpretation of an exempting clause, and to

enlarge its operation. Indeed, in the later part of the decision in

para 45 while considering the question whether laying of an

information or the issue of search warrant by a Magistrate before

he orders enquiry or investigation may amount to institution of a

criminal proceedings, it opined that the words, "whatsoever"

used with the words "criminal proceedings" in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_99">Article 361 (2</a>),

might enlarge the scope of this immunity - it did not decide that
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                41</span>

question finally having held that the application before the

Magistrate in that case was a complaint.
</p>
<p id="p_53">38. In para 41, the Court then articulated two other questions

for its consideration, namely (1) as the order of the Magistrate to

the police to investigate was passed under sub section (3) of

<a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_100">Section 156</a> of the Code, it is not an act of Court but is of a

purely executive nature; and (2) that an information to a

Magistrate does not amount to institution of criminal

proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_54">39. In para 42, the Court rejected the argument that the order of

the Magistrate to the police to investigate passed under <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_101">Section

156</a> (3)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_102"> of the Code</a> is not an act of the Court but must be

deemed to be an executive order. At the end the Court opined

that every action taken by a Magistrate which is empowered to

take under the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_103"> of the Code</a>, is a criminal proceeding

and such criminal proceedings are instituted when some step is

taken to initiate criminal proceedings or making an enquiry.

</p><p id="p_55">40. In paragraph 45, the Court observed that when an

immunity has been conferred on any person it must be so

construed as to limit it to the person on whom it is conferred and

cannot be extended to others who under the law may be liable.
</p><p id="p_56">                                                   W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                42</span>

Further, though the laying of an information or the issue of

search warrant by a Magistrate before he orders enquiry or

investigation may not strictly speaking amount to institution of

criminal proceedings yet the word "whatsoever" used following

the words "criminal proceedings" in Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_104">Article 361</a>

enlarges the scope of this immunity. In the ultimate analysis the

Court held that the District Magistrate could not have issued the

impugned order being prohibited by <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_105">Article 361 (2)</a> of the

Constitution. We find that the dictum in this decision is more

beneficial to the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_57">41. Even the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of

Jamuna Singh and others (supra) will be of no avail to the

respondents. The said decision is in respect of a petition or

complaint filed before the Magistrate and in particular on the

question when he applies his mind resulting in institution of a

case. That interpretation will have to be understood in the

context of the expression "judicial proceeding" as defined in

<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_106">Cr.P.C</a>. In this case the Supreme Court was called upon to

interprete the meaning of words „institution of case‟. The

Supreme Court held that the said words were not defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_107"> the

Code</a>. The Court then observed that a case can be said to be
                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                43</span>

instituted in a Court only when the "Court takes cognizance" of

the offence alleged therein. However, for considering the sweep

of the expansive words used in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_108">Article 361 (2)</a> of the

Constitution and the intent of the framers of the Constitution for

extending absolute protection to the Head of a State, the

restricted meaning to the words "institution of a case in the

Court" in the context of the procedural provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_109"> the Code</a>

concerning „judicial proceedings‟ will be counter productive and

untenable.
</p>
<p id="p_58">42.   Reliance placed on the decision of the Supreme Court by

the learned Advocate General in the case of R.R.Chari (supra),

in our opinion, is also inapposite. There can be no difficulty in

accepting the argument that "ordinarily" in the case of

cognizable offences the Magistrate takes cognizance when the

police completes its investigation and approaches the Magistrate

for the issuance of the process, whence the Magistrate applies

his mind. This dictum of the Supreme Court is in the context of

provisions of the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_110">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>. That will be of

no avail for interpreting the sweep of words "criminal

proceedings" in Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_111">Article 361</a> of the Constitution

which is much wider than the expression "judicial proceedings"
</p><p id="p_59">                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                44</span>

defined in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_112"> the Code</a> coupled with the restricted scope of <a href="/doc/12704/" id="a_113">Section

197</a> of the Code regarding prohibition to take cognizance of the

offence in absence of a lawful sanction of the Government in

that behalf.
</p>
<p id="p_60">43. The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of

H.N.Rishbud and another (supra) also does not take the matter

any further for the respondents. That is an authority on the steps

involved in the investigation of a cognizable offence. The Court

has noted five steps in the investigation as per the scheme<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_114"> of the

Code</a>. It is no more possible to contend that registration of FIR

by the police officer is not a proceeding for setting in motion the

criminal process/action, after the decision of the Constitution

Bench of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari's case (supra).

</p><p id="p_61">44. Even in the case of <a href="/doc/412326/" id="a_115">Devarapalli Lakshminarayana

Reddy and others Vs. V.Narayana Reddy</a> and others21 the

Court was called upon to examine the meaning of expression

„taking cognizance of offence‟ in respect of a private compliant.

None of these decisions except the decision of the Division

Bench of Hyderabad High Court is nearest to the point in issue.

</p><p id="p_62">45. Turning to the Supreme Court decision in the case of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">21</span>
     AIR 1976 SC 1672
                                                   W.P. No.3346/2015

Babubhai Vs. State of Gujarat and others22 pressed into

service by the counsel appearing for the Union of India, in para

20, the Court noted that registration of FIR under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_116">Section 154</a> of

Cr.P.C. is a very important document. It is the first information

of a cognizable offence recorded by the officer in charge of the

police station. It sets the machinery of criminal law in motion

and marks the commencement of the investigation which ends

with the formation of an opinion under <a href="/doc/481610/" id="a_117">Section 169</a> and <a href="/doc/1367808/" id="a_118">170</a>

Cr.P.C., as the case may be, and forwarding of a police report

under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_119">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. This decision restates the legal

position that the registration of FIR in respect of cognizable

offence is to set the criminal process in motion and is the first

step in that regard. Consequent to registration of FIR, however,

as the Magistrate is expected to take follow up action and is

empowered to proceed in the manner predicated in <a href="/doc/244234/" id="a_120">Section 159</a>

of the Code, upon receipt of the report from the police officer

which is required to be forwarded by the police officer

contemporaneously under <a href="/doc/1965344/" id="a_121">Section 157</a> (1)<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_122"> of the Code</a>, it must

partake the colour of a criminal proceeding instituted before the

Court for the purpose of attracting prohibition stipulated in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">22</span>
     (2010) 12 SCC 254
                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015

<a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_123">Article 361 (2</a>), if it is against the Head of a State by name

during his term of office.
</p>
<p id="p_63">46. Taking any other view would result in negating the

immunity and absolute prohibition envisaged in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_124">Article 361 (2)</a>

for insulating the Head of a State from any possible exposure to

malicious publicity of his involvement in any offence instituted

during his term of office. We cannot be oblivious about the

contemporary situation of presence of any number of self styled

investigative journalists indulging in analysis of matters in

public domain - commonly known as trial by media - as soon as

any criminal action is registered, before the commencement of

the trial and even before collection of evidence by the police, in

disregard of person‟s reputation by creating a widespread

perception of guilt or innocence before, or after a verdict in a

Court of law. A priori, to hold that FIR is registered by the

police officer and, therefore, is not a criminal proceeding

instituted before the Court within the meaning of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_125">Article 361 (2)</a>

inspite of sufficient indication in the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_126"> of the Code</a>

about the statutory duties of the Magistrate upon receipt of such

information, would be a pedantic approach.
</p>
<p id="p_64">47. The purposive interpretation of the expansive words
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                 47</span>

"criminal proceedings whatsoever" conjointly read with

"instituted in any Court", is imperative to uphold the spirit of

<a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_127">Article 361</a> in particular Clauses (2) and (3) thereof and to

subserve and further the intent of the framers of our Constitution

of providing "absolute protection" to the Head of a State during

his term of office. This approach is necessary keeping in mind

that there is bound to be some time gap between the placing of

the report before the Magistrate after its registration by the

Police.
</p>
<p id="p_65">48. Indubitably, the efficacy of the legal provisions and the

legislative scheme cannot be decided on the basis of happening

or non happening of the event of placing the FIR before the

Magistrate soon after it is registered by the police or for that

matter Magistrate not taking any immediate action thereon.

Whereas, the interpretation of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_128">Article 361 (2)</a> must be on the

assumption that as soon as the FIR is registered by the police, in

law, it is transmitted to and laid before the Magistrate

contemporaneously. That partakes the colour of institution of

criminal proceedings whatsoever before the Court for the

purposes of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_129">Article 361 (2).</a> Thus, it is essential to hold that with

the registration of FIR under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_130">Section 154</a> of the Code, it is
                                                     W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                 48</span>

deemed to be a criminal proceeding instituted before the Court.

This interpretation will obviate any possible argument that until

the report is received by the Magistrate it does not assume the

character of criminal proceeding instituted before the Court; and

taking advantage of that anomaly, justify publicity of the matter

so reported to the police against the Head of a State - which

must be eschewed. We are of the opinion that only this purposive

interpretation will further the spirit of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_131">Article 361 (2)</a> of the

Constitution which intrinsically guarantees absolute protection

from any malicious campaign or publicity against the Head of a

State, so as not to undermine the solemnity of that office. This

view is inevitable because the protection bestowed on the Head

of a State by Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_132">Article 361</a>, in that sense is wider than

the express prohibition stipulated in clauses (1) and (4) of the

same Article in respect of specified matters referred to therein -

limited to the acts done or purporting to be done in exercise and

performance of the powers and duties of his office or personal

capacity to provide an official inviolability.

</p><p id="p_66">49. Mr. Jethmalani, rightly drew analogy from the dictum in

Paragraph 101 in the case of Union Carbide Corporation

(supra) wherein it is observed that the President cannot be liable
                                                                  W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                          49</span>

to arrest, imprisonment, or detention, while he in the discharge

of the duties of his office; and for this purpose his person must

be deemed, in civil cases, at least, to possess an official

inviolability. In this decision, the Supreme Court not only

adverted to the observations of Jurist Story in his commentaries

on the Constitution of United States, as has been reproduced in

the earlier part of this judgment, but also referred to the source

of immunity given to the Head of a State, principle underlying

whereof must be read as integral part of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_133">Article 361 (2).</a>

Reference has been made to the decision of the Supreme Court

of United States in a case concerning immunity from civil

liability [Richard Nixon v. Ernest Fitzgerald23] which reads

thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_15">                 ".....This Court necessarily also has weighed
            concerns of public policy especially as illuminated by
            our history and the structure of our government....."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                 ".... In the case of the President the inquiries into
            history and policy, though mandated independently by
            our cases, tend to converge. Because the Presidency did
            not exist through most of the development of common
            law, any historical analysis must draw its evidence
            primarily from our constitutional heritage and structure.
            Historical inquiry thus merges almost at its inception
            with the kind of „public policy‟ analysis appropriately
            undertaken by a federal court. This inquiry involves
            policies and principles that may be considered implicit
            in the nature of the President‟s office in a system
            structured to achieve effective government under a

<p id="p_67">50. We may usefully refer to the circumspection and a word of

„caution‟ expressed in the decision of Lalita Kumari's case

(supra), that even though as a rule, on receipt of information

disclosing cognizable offence, the police is obliged to register

FIR under <a href="/doc/1980578/" id="a_134">Section 154</a> of the Code but would be justified in not

doing so, in certain exceptional cases before verification. After

verification in such cases, the police has discretion not to register

the FIR merely because the information given discloses

commission of cognizable offence. This circumspection is

expected to be observed in respect of high officials who

otherwise can be prosecuted after taking prior sanction of the

competent Authority. In the case of the Head of a State, however,

the protection must be held to be absolute - as it is not dependent

on any prior sanction. Therefore, applying the principle

underlying the dictum of the Supreme Court, when information

disclosing involvement of any Head of a State is given or
                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                51</span>

received, it would be the bounden duty of the police to ensure

that no FIR is registered against the Head of a State during his

term of office.
</p>
<p id="p_68">51. The Full Bench of Kerala High Court in the case of Albert

(supra) has held that giving information to the police about the

commission of cognizable offence amounts to initiation of

criminal proceeding. Our attention was also invited to the

exposition in the case of Emperor (supra). Even the Allahabad

High Court while interpreting <a href="/doc/172919/" id="a_135">Section 211</a> of I.P.C. opined that if

a man who set the criminal law in motion by making a false

charge to the police of a cognizable offence institutes criminal

proceedings within the meaning of that provision. It was thus

rightly argued that approach of purposive construction of the

expansive expression „whatsoever‟ and the expression „criminal

proceedings instituted in any Court‟ found in <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_136">Article 361</a> must be

adopted to uphold the intendment of and the purpose underlying

the absolute protection given to the Head of a State. This

argument commends to us.
</p>
<p id="p_69">52. Learned counsel for the Union of India, however, had

placed reliance on the decision of King‟s Bench Division in In

re The Vexatious Actions, 1896 (supra). In that decision, the
                                                    W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                52</span>

Court was called upon to examine the meaning of words „legal

proceedings‟ in the concerned Act. Considering the legislative

scheme of the said enactment, the Court opined that expression

„legal proceedings‟ do not include „criminal proceedings‟.

However, as already observed by us earlier, the expression

„criminal proceedings‟ found in <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_137">Article 361</a> is very wide when

tested in the light of expression „proceedings‟ simplicitor in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_138"> the

Criminal Procedure Code</a> to include even actions of the police as

also the Magistrate on receipt of the report from the police

officer and before taking cognizance upon submission of police

report under <a href="/doc/1412034/" id="a_139">Section 173</a> of the Code. In our opinion, therefore,

the abovesaid decision will be of no avail.
</p>
<p id="p_70">53. The decision of the learned Single Judge of the Karnataka

High Court in the case of Dr. Smt. Mangala Sridhar (supra)

relied by the learned counsel for the Union of India, in our

opinion, is also inapposite. In that case, the order of suspension

passed by the Governor of the State of Karnataka in exercise of

powers conferred under Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/1871788/" id="a_140">Article 317</a> of the

Constitution was the subject matter of challenge. The

observations made by the High Court in the context of that

challenge will be of no avail to interprete the sweep of Article
                                                   W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_72">                                 53</span>

361 and in particular Clauses (2) and (3) thereof, which are

markedly distinct. As is noticed, the immunity extended to the

Head of a State in terms of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_141">Article 361 (2)</a> is absolute on

fulfillment of the conditions specified therein, inter-alia the

proceedings must be criminal proceedings instituted in any

Court. <a href="/doc/1280300/" id="a_142">Article 361 (3)</a> predicates absolute prohibition of issuing

process of arrest or imprisonment of the Head of a State by any

Court during his term of office. The moot question examined in

that decision was whether the power to be exercised by the

Governor was discretionary in nature and not based on the aid

and advice of the Council of Ministers and that the exercise of

discretion is not justiciable.
</p>
<p id="p_71">54. Even the decision in the case of Dr. S.C.Barat and

another (supra) of the Division Bench of this Court will be of no

avail to the respondents for the same reason. For, the issue

before the Court was in the context of the provision in <a href="/doc/375524/" id="a_143">Section

11</a> (2) of Jabalpur University Act, 1956. The Court was called

upon to examine whether the committee consitituted under that

provision is merely advisory and it is not open to the Chancellor

to ignore its recommendation. This is noticed from the final

decision in the same case reported in AIR 1962 MP 180. In
                                                  W.P. No.3346/2015
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                               54</span>

the decision relied upon, (AIR 1962 MP 73), the Court

articulated the main argument for determination while

considering the preliminary objection in the context of the

argument of the scope and extent of immunity extended to the

acts done by Governor in his public capacity other than that as

Governor. The Court tested that argument in the context of

Clause (1) and Clause (4) of <a href="/doc/1470888/" id="a_144">Article 361.</a> The observations made

in the context of those clauses will be of no avail as those

clauses posit entirely distinct situation, unlike the absolute

protection granted in respect of institution of criminal

proceedings whatsoever in any Court under <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_145">Article 361 (2)</a> and

from arrest or imprisonment under <a href="/doc/1280300/" id="a_146">Article 361 (3)</a> during the

term of office as Governor. Indeed, while dealing with the

decision in the case of H.E.H. Nizam (supra), in paragraph 9 of

the judgment for deciding the preliminary objection, reported in

AIR 1962 MP 73, the Division Bench of this Court has observed

that the view taken in that decision in the Nizam‟s case

(Hyderabad High Court - supra), is not correct. That observation

must be understood as having distinguished the judgment of the

Division Bench in Nizam's case (supra) which had dealt with

the sweep of <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_147">Article 361 (2)</a> and <a href="/doc/1280300/" id="a_148">Article 361 (3)</a> of the

Constitution - as not applicable to <a href="/doc/1340387/" id="a_149">Article 361 (1)</a> or (4). In the

context of the provisions in the <a href="/doc/890608/" id="a_150">University Act</a>, the Court held

that when an act confers power on the Governor not qua

Governor but in a different capacity held by him by virtue of his

office as Governor, the powers and duties so conferred are not

the powers and duties of the office of the Governor. Suffice it to

observe that this decision will not come in our way in answering

the matter in issue in the present case in the context of absolute

protection guaranteed in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_151">Article 361 (2)</a> of the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_72">55. Having held that even registration of FIR against the Head

of a State during his term of office is prohibited, the petition

should succeed on that count alone. We may also dispel the

misreading of the order passed by the Division Bench of this

Court in W.P.No.6385/2014 dated 20.02.2015. That order, in no

way, directs STF to register the FIR against the petitioner. It

merely records that the SIT is free to issue directions to STF to

proceed against the high officials in accordance with law. Thus

understood, it is open to the petitioner to challenge the action of

STF of having registered FIR against him on legal grounds as

may be available in law.

<p id="p_73">56. We would now revert to the other argument advanced for
                                                               W.P. No.3346/2015

quashing of the impugned FIR qua the petitioner - being infirm

on different counts and also because of non-disclosure of any

material fact constituting commission of cognizable offence by

the petitioner and having been recorded on the basis of

information given by co-accused which is inadmissible in law.

For that, we may usefully refer to the broad contours to be borne

in mind for quashing the FIR in exercise of extraordinary power

under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_152">Article 226</a> of the Constitution or the inherent power

under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_153">Section 482</a> of the Code. In para 108 and 109 in the

and others Vs. Tapan Kumar Singh24 in paragraph 20

observed thus :-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">                  "It is well settled that a First Information Report is
            not an encyclopedia, which must disclose all facts and
            details relating to the offence reported. An informant
            may lodge a report about the commission of an offence
            though he may not know the name of the victim or his
            assailant. He may not even know how the occurrence
            took place. A first informant need not necessarily be an
            eye witness so as to be able to disclose in great details
            all aspects of the offence committed. What is of
            significance is that the information given must disclose
            the commission of a cognizable offence and the
            information so lodged must provide a basis for the
            police officer to suspect the commission of a cognizable
            offence. At this stage it is enough if the police officer on
            the basis of the information given suspects the
            commission of a cognizable offence, and not that he
            must be convinced or satisfied that a cognizable offence
            has been committed. If he has reasons to suspect, on the
            basis of information received, that a cognizable offence
            may have been committed, he is bound to record the
            information and conduct an investigation. At this stage it
            is also not necessary for him to satisfy himself about the
            truthfulness of the information. It is only after a
            complete investigation that he may be able to report on
            the truthfulness or otherwise of the information.
            Similarly, even if the information does not furnish all the
            details, he must find out those details in the course of
            investigation and collect all the necessary evidence. The
            information given disclosing the commission of a
            cognizable offence only sets in motion the investigative
            machinery, with a view to collect all necessary evidence,
            and thereafter to take action in accordance with law. The
            true test is whether the information furnished provides a
            reason to suspect the commission of an offence, which
            the concerned police officer is empowered under <a href="/doc/1291024/" id="a_163">Section
            156</a> of the Code to investigate. If it does, he has no
            option but to record the information and proceed to
            investigate the case either himself or depute any other
            competent officer to conduct the investigation. The
            question as to whether the report is true, whether it
            discloses full details regarding the manner of
            occurrence, whether the accused is named, and whether
            there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations are
            all matters which are alien to the consideration of the

            question whether the report discloses the commission of
            a cognizable offence. Even if the information does not
            give full details regarding these matters, the
            investigating officer is not absolved of his duty to
            investigate the case and discover the true facts, if he
            can".

       words, the First Information Report cannot be used with
       regard to the testimony of other witnesses who depose in
       respect of incident. It is equally well settled that the

<p id="p_74">However, we do not wish to dilate any further on the other issues

<p id="p_75">60. Inasmuch as, for the view we have taken, while dealing

with the primary question of extent of immunity and privilege

extended to the Head of a State, during his term of office, which

answers the jurisdictional fact, we proceed to quash the

impugned FIR qua the petitioner on that count alone, with liberty

to the police to proceed in accordance with law, after the

petitioner ceases to be the Governor. For, the immunity and

privilege is only during the term of office. At the same time the

immunity and privilege extended to the Governor will not impair

or whittle down the powers of the police to investigate the

criminal case registered against other accused who cannot claim

such privilege and in the process, record statement of the

petitioner, if required. We say so because the immunity in <a href="/doc/1227857/" id="a_172">Article

361 (2)</a> or 361 (3) does not extend to recording of statement of

the Head of a State by the police in connection with

investigation of a crime, if it is so essential. The police, however,

must take all salutary precautions and observe circumspection

while recording statement of the petitioner in the course of

investigation, so that the majesty of the office of the Governor of

the State is not undermined in any manner.

</p><p id="p_77">61.    The petitioner through counsel has assured that he would extend

complete cooperation in such investigation, but the police must eschew

from resorting to coercive action of any kind against the petitioner,

such as ordering his appearance in the police station or "compulsory"

subjecting him to any interrogation. In our opinion, during the

investigation, if any verification of facts are required to be done from

the petitioner, the Head of the investigating team (ADGP) must

accompany the Investigating Officer, so as to ensure that due care and

diligence is observed to uphold the majesty of the office of the

Governor and it is not undermined in any manner.

other person found to be involved in the commission of the alleged

offence in accordance with law and with further liberty to proceed
