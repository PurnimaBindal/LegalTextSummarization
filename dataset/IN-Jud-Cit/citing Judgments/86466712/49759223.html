<p id="p_1">                             PREFACE:
</p>
<p id="p_2">                             1.1.Internet has created a new class of literates. Anyone who uses

                      internet sparingly, knows nothing about it, despite formal education

                      becomes a semi illiterate or literate. World over, there is a rapid escalation

                      of internet users with a particular reference to our country. It has indeed

                      become inseparable in the lives of the people as one of absolute necessity.
</p>


<p id="p_3">                             1.2.An information has to be obtained by crawling. The web is like

                      an exhaustive library. To get an information, a software known as 'web

                      crawler' is used to discover the webpages.
</p>


<p id="p_4">                             1.3.'Google' has earned a reputation of one of the best search

                      engines worldwide facilitating a primary platform for the advertisement of

                      goods and services. It has not only started its advertisement business but

                      also 'Ad Words' programe.

                                                                      442, 443, 445, 446, 448 &amp; 449 of 2020

                             1.4.The functioning of an AdWord Programme and the key words

                      are best expressed through the words of google itself.
</p>
<p id="p_6">                              “(iv)The AdWords program allows an advertiser to create and run
                              these advertisements through a simple process..         A advertiser,
                              using the AdWords program creates a sponsored link, will specify
                              the headline, the address of the web page to which the headline
                              links, and the advertising text, within certain limits set by Google.
</p><p id="p_7">                              (v)”Keywords” are those words, phrases, sentences, etc., that might
                              trigger certain sponsored results       or advertisements, if they
                              correspond to certain terms selected by the advertiser to trigger an
                              Advertisement. The terms or expressions selected by an advertiser
                              trigger advertisements are known as “Keywords”. For example, a
                              “search term” could be “Trains from Muymbai to New Delhi”
                              which is typed by the user on the Google Website in the search
                              query box.    The advertiser can select the Keywords “Mumbai
                              Delhi Trains” which is based on the search terms and for which the
                              advertiser would like his advertisement to be shown.
</p><p id="p_8">                                     It is submitted that the Plaintiff has used the expressions
                              'AdWords' and 'Keywords' interchangeably. To summarise, it is
                              respectfully submitted that the term 'AdWords' is the name of the
                              advertising program provided and managed by Defendant No.5 and
                              that the expression 'Keywords' refers to the terms or phrases used
                              at the backend as a trigger to display ads that meet the specific
                              criteria for the display of an ad in response to a search query
                              entered by a user. These are therefore distinct terms and cannot be
                              used interchangeably.”

                             1.5.The following is the working mechanism.
                             “(ii) It is important to appreciate that when a user enters a search
                             query (search terms) for searching particular information on the
                             Google Website, the Google Wesite conducts a search of the
                             existing material available on the third party websites as indexed
                             by (which predominantly relate to data and content hosted by third
                             parties on their websites) in an automated manner through its
                             search algorithm and displays the links to the websites and other
                             information of such search that correspond to the query entered by
                             the user. The results that are generated are referred to as “Organic
                             Results” or “Natural results”. The order in which the natural or
                             organic results are ranked and indexed are based on multiple
                             factors, chief amongst them being relevance of the respective
                             websites to the search term entered by the Internet user. The
                             search engine operator does not claim any remuneration for
                             displaying those results.”.....................
</p><p id="p_9">                             (iii)When such search results are displayed on a page, certain
                             advertisements also appear at the top or bottom of the page
                             (previously they also appeared on the right hand side of the search
                             page), clearly distinguished from the search results by various
                             indicators that included a line along with a label “Sponsored
                             Links” or 'Ads' in a yellow or green background. Currently all
                             advertisements are distinguished by a yellow or green coloured
                             label with the word 'Ad' displayed in it.”

                             1.6.Thus, “Google” has formulated its own mechanism and policy.
</p>
<p id="p_10">                      Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SMO)

                      are the two primary methods of running business in online business

                      platform. Both these methods use Keywords as their tool. Using maximum

                      number of keywords is necessary to optimise web searches and to attain

                      maximum profit. This has been programmed accordingly by the 'Google'.
</p>


<p id="p_11">                             1.7.There are three primary players involved in the entire process.
</p>
<p id="p_12">                      One is the search engine viz., 'Google'. The second is the advertisers,

                      who bid for the “AdWords” and the third, the consumer/user. The website

                      owners bid on the keywords/Adwords to get a strategic placement in the

                      only registered the mark “BharatMatrimony” but also various other names

                      by combining the language along with the word “Matrimony” apart from the

                      in C.S.No.832 of 2009. The learned single Judge(as he then was) through

                              “32. The learned Single Judge in his order, in paragraph 148,
                              has stated that in spite of leaving a space in between the two
                              words, it certainly provides a likelihood of confusion. However,
                              the learned Judge found that the respondents 2 to 4, are also
                              dealing in the same services i.e. matrimony services as that of
                              the appellant would be left with no other choice to advertise
                              their services, in case if the use of the combination of the above
                              word is prohibited. The learned Judge also held that the grant of
                              an order of injunction would lead to the consequence of
                              reducing the choice of words available to competitors, to a very
                              few and resulting in the appellant's monopolising the English
                              word 'Matrimony'. In this connection, the respondents have not
                              pleaded with regard to alternative synonym for the words
                              'Tamil', 'Malayalam', 'Telugu', 'Matrimony' etc. In the absence of
                              any pleading with regard to the same, we are not agreeing with
                              the finding of the learned single Judge that by preventing the use
                              of the words would leave the respondents 2 to 4 with a very
                              limited choice of words.”

                                    would mean the use of the words in the title and text of the
                                    advertisement. In paragraph 9 of the counter, the first
                                    respondent has reiterated its commitment that they would
                                    adhere to the present business policy and also indicated that
                                    its current adwords policy does not permit the use of any
                                    trademarked term in the ad text, i.e., the title and text of the
                                    advertisement. Therefore, it is clear from the order dated
                                    07.10.2009, by recording the undertaking given by the first
                                    respondent, the injunction was vacated. The arrangement

                                    dismissal of these applications shall not be construed to
                                    mean that the first respondent (Google) may henceforth

                                    by them. As already stated we are of the considered view
                                    that the appellant has established their case with regard to

                                    appellants are entitled for injunction. So far as the

<p id="p_37">                              2.8.On the bidding made to the AdWords as was done earlier, few

                      of the defendants in the first suit among others got their placements. This

                      triggered the filing of the second suit notwithstanding the pendency of the

                      earlier one having a specific direction to expedite the trial. To be noted,

                      'Google' has not been arrayed as a party defendant nor any attempt made

                      to file another injunction application in the pending suit. In the present suit

                      also, the same issue has been raised though the defence taken by the

                      defendants is rather exhaustive.

                              as to whether the infringing mark is identical or deceptively
                              similar to the registered trade mark in relation to the goods or
                              services. <a href="/doc/1377106/" id="a_16">Section 29(1)</a> places on part the word “identical
                              with deceptive similarity”. Hence a distinction has to be made
                              between a mere “similarity” and a deceptive one.

                              of the Act gives importance to two words. They are, “identity”
                              and “similarity”. Though they have to be seen in the context
                              of the provision by giving a natural and a reasonable
                              interpretation, the word    “identity” is placed at a higher
                              pedestal than similarity. It becomes closer to the infringing
                              mark than similarity. It denotes a mark goods or service of a
                              same kind in appearance, character or quantity, without being
                              identical. It is more to do with resemblance of one trade mark
                              to another. However, both cannot be the same and hence,
                              there would be certain independent factors attached to each of
                              them. Thus, there involves some degree of difference between

                              mark and identity of the goods and services.

                              would occur when such acts are likely to cause confusion on
                              the part of the public or which is an act associated with the
                              registered trade marks. Therefore, the basis is likelihood of
                              causing confusion from the point of view of the public in
                              general. Hence, no actual confusion is necessary and it is
                              relatable to an end user.      Similarly, with reference to the
                              association with the registered mark also what is sufficient is
                              the likelihood. Therefore, if one reads all the provisions
                              together, then intention of the legislature is very clear that is to
                              protect the registered mark holder even in case of latter as
                              what is sufficient is only likelihood. Coming to sub section 3
                              of Section 29(2) of the Act, it creates a statutory presumption
                              in view of sub <a href="/doc/117176/" id="a_22">section 2(c)</a> onwards a likelihood of causing
                              confusion on the part of the public. Now this is
                              because the word “identity” has been given more weightage

                              be pressed into service only when there exists a reputation of

                              proceeds to state that the usage of the mark is without “due

                              specifies that an infringement would occur when an unregistered

                              would show that <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_41">Section 29</a> of the Act is subjected to it. Therefore,
                              <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_42">Section 30</a> of the Act is an overriding provision to <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_43">Section 29</a> of the

                              The records would show that the word "METOPROLAL" is a
                              chemical component. It is "publici juris". There are number of
                              registered Proprietors having the prefix "METO". The learned
                              single Judge has also noted the said fact.       Now all of them are
                              identified   with the common name, in view of the chemical
                              component. Hence, it is not as if the respondent has infringed the
                              said word "METO". It is already in the public domain, even much
                              prior to the application of the appellant. Applying the said facts
                              when we read <a href="/doc/84096/" id="a_47">Section 29</a> of the Act, we can safely come to the
                              conclusion that the limits on effect of the registered trade mark
                              under <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_48">Section 30</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, would apply with
                              all force. Therefore, the exclusive right claimed by the appellant in
                              pursuant to the registration would no longer be available, in view of
                              the fact that the word 'METO" is already "publici juris", thereby,

                      of <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_59">Section 30</a> of the Act. To put it differently, <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_60">Section 31</a> does not exclude

                      <a href="/doc/1881111/" id="a_61">Section 30</a>. The power of the Civil Court is plenary in nature. It is involved

                      in an adjudicative process both in the interlocutory stage and the final

                      stage. Therefore, what is applicable at the final stage has to be made

                      expected to hold always that a registered trade mark is valid. One cannot

                      confuse a statutory presumption of prima facie validation with an

                              similarity with the registered mark, the requisite

                              Cases 683).         The following passage of the said
                              judgment is apposite.
</p><p id="p_78">                                 31.1. Traditionally, passing off in common law is considered to
                                 be a right for protection of goodwill in the business against
                                 misrepresentation caused in the course of trade and for
                                 prevention of resultant damage on account of the said
                                 misrepresentation. The three ingredients of passing off are
                                 goodwill, misrepresentation and damage. These ingredients are
                                 considered to be classical trinity under the law of passing off as
                                 per the speech of Lord Oliver laid down in the case of Reckitt
                                 &amp;     Colman        Products      Ltd.     v.     Borden      Inc
                                 MANU/UKHL/0012/1990 : (1990) 1 AllE.R. 873 which is
                                 more popularly known as "Jif Lemon" case wherein the Lord
                                 Oliver reduced the five guidelines laid out by Lord Diplock in
                                 Erven Warnink v. Townend &amp; Sons Ltd. [1979) AC 731, 742
                                 (HL)] (the "Advocate Case") to three elements: (1) Goodwill
                                 owned by a trader, (2) Misrepresentation and (3) Damage to
                                 goodwill. Thus, the passing off action is essentially an action
                                 in deceit where the common law rule is that no person is

                                 business is of that of another. This Court has given its
                                 imprimatur to the above principle in the case of <a href="/doc/125822018/" id="a_74">Laxmikant V.

                              the mark name in the business. The use of the mark/carrying on
                              business under the name confers the rights in favour of the
                              person and generates goodwill in the market. Accordingly, the
                              latter user of the mark/name or in the business cannot
                              misrepresent his business as that of business of the prior right
                              holder. That is t he reason why essentially the prior user is


                              considered to be superior than that of any other rights.
                              Consequently, the examination of rights in common law which
                              are based on goodwill, misrepresentation and damage are
                              independent to that of registered rights. The mere fact that both
                              prior user and subsequent user are registered proprietors are
                              irrelevant for the purposes of examining who generated the
                              goodwill first in the market and whether the latter user is
                              causing misrepresentation in the course of trade and damaging
                              the goodwill and reputation of the prior right holder/former
                              user. That is the additional reasoning that the statutory rights
                              must pave the way for common law rights of passing off.
</p><p id="p_79">                              32. Thirdly, it is also recognized principle in common law
                              jurisdiction that passing off right is broader remedy than that of
                              infringement. This is due to the reason that the passing off
                              doctrine operates on the general principle that no person is
                              entitled to represent his or her business as business of other
                              person. The said action in deceit is maintainable for diverse
                              reasons other than that of registered rights which are allocated
                              rights under Recent Civil Reports the Act. The authorities of

                              recognizes the principle that where trademark action fails,
                              passing off action may still succeed on the same evidence. This
                              has been explained by the learned Author by observing the

                               infringement of a trade mark for various reasons and may yet
                               show that by imitating the mark claimed as a trademark, or
                               otherwise, the Defendant has done what is calculated to pass
                               off his goods as those of the claimant. A claim in "passing off'
                               has generally been added as a second string to actions for
                               infringement, and has on occasion succeeded where the claim
                               for infringement has failed"

                              been explained by the learned Author as under:--
                                15-034 "Subject to possibly one qualification, nothing in the
                                <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_76">Trade Marks Act</a> 1994 affects a trader's right against another
                                in an action for passing off. It is, therefore, no bar to an action
                                for passing off that the trade name, get up or any other of the
                                badges identified with the claimant's business, which are
                                alleged to have been copies or imitated by the Defendant,
                                might have been, but are not registered as, trade marks, even
                                though the evidence is wholly addressed to what may be a
                                mark capable of registration. Again, it is no defense to passing
                                off that the Defendant's mark is registered. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_77">The Act</a> offers

                                  imposes no penalty upon those who do not. It is equally no
                                  bar to an action for passing off that the false representation
                                  relied upon is an imitation of a trade mark that is incapable of
                                  registration. A passing off action can even lie against a
                                  registered proprietor of the mark sued upon. The fact that a
                                  claimant is using a mark registered by another party (or even
                                  the Defendant) does not of itself prevent goodwill being
                                  generated by the use of the mark, or prevent such a claimant
                                  from relying on such goodwill in an action against the
                                  registered proprietor. Such unregistered marks are frequently
                                  referred to as "common law trade marks".

                              the reason that it involves deceit and confusion. For
                              the aforesaid purpose, a mere likelihood would be
                              sufficient. Likewise, a right against passing off can be

                              memory. Incidentally, it can also be seen from the

                                apply? An action for passing off. as the phrase "passing
                                off itself suggests, is to restrain the defendant from
                                passing off its goods or services to the public as that of
                                the plaintiff's. It is an action not only to preserve the
                                reputation of the plaintiff but also to safeguard the
                                public. The defendant must have sold its goods or
                                offered its service in a manner which has deceived or
                                would be likely to deceive the public into thinking that
                                the defendant's goods or services are the plaintiff's. The
                                action is normally available to the owner of a distinctive

                              succeed. The question is, as has been aptly put, who gets
                              these first? It is not essential for the plaintiff to prove
                              long user to establish reputation in a passing off action.
                              It would depend upon the volume of sales and extent of
                              advertisement.
</p><p id="p_85">                              13. The second element that must be established by a
                              plaintiff in a passing off action is misrepresentation by
                              the defendant to the public. The word misrepresentation
                              does not mean that the plaintiff has to prove any
                              malafide intention on the part of the defendant.
                              Of course, if the misrepresentation is intentional, it
                              might lead to an inference that the reputation of the
                              plaintiff is such that it is worth the defendant's while to
                              cash in on it. An innocent misrepresentation would be
                              relevant only on the question of the ultimate relief which
                              would be granted to plaintiff. What has to be established
                              is the likelihood of confusion in the minds of the public,
                              (the word "public" being understood to mean actual or
                              potential customers or users) that the goods or services
                              offered by the defendant are the goods or the services of
                              the plaintiff. In assessing the likelihood of such
                              confusion the courts must allow for the "imperfect

                              admittedly adopted the mark after the appellant. The
                              appellant is the prior user and has the right to debar the

                                  confusion with possible injury to the public and
                                  consequential loss to the appellant. The similarity in the
                                  name may lead an unwary user of the internet of average
                                  intelligence and imperfect recollection to assume a
                                  business connection between the two. Such user may,
                                  while trying to access the information or services

                                  disappointed with the result. Documents have been filed
                                  by the respondent directed at establishing that the
                                  appellant name Sify was similar to other domain names
                                  such as Scifinet, Scifi.com etc. The exercise has been
                                  undertaken by the respondent presumably to show that
                                  the word 'Sify' is not an original word and that several
                                  marks which were phonetically similar to the appellants'
                                  trade name are already registered. We are not prepared
                                  to deny the appellant's claim merely on the aforesaid
                                  basis. For one, none of the alleged previous registrants
                                  are before us. For another, the word 'sci- fi is an

                                  dissimilar to the word Sify. (See Collins Dictionary of the

                              would satisfy the test of likelihood of confusion and deceit.

                              shape, get up, label, package and the colour scheme. If

                              eye, the consequence will have to flow. In such a case,
                              the onus is on the respondent to give a plausible
                              explanation to justify its adoption. This onus will become
                              more pronounced when the applicants are the market
                              leader   and       prior   user.     When       we      take     about
                              distinctiveness,     it includes that of the products as a
                              whole as well as a single one.              In other words, the
                              commonality governing the products along with the
                              distinctiveness     of a   single     product are        factors     for
                              consideration against a violator. Ultimately, the Court
                              has to sit in the arm chair of an end user and decide. So
                              is the case with distinctiveness. The substantial volume
                              of sale is a primary indicator of the distinctiveness of a
                              product. However, these factors will have to be seen on
                              the facts of each case.

                              discriminating does not rule out the element of confusion if the
                              trade marks/trade names/corporate names of two companies are
                              identical or if the similarity between them is profound. In
                              several cases it has been held that initial confusion is likely to
                              arise even amongst sophisticated and knowledgeable purchasers
                              under a mistaken belief that the two companies using the same
                              corporate name, trading name or style are inter-related. It is the

                              franchising, etc. It is this class of buyers who are likely to think
                              that there is some sort of association between the products of
                              two different companies when they come across common or
                              similar trade names or corporate names or trading styles used by
                              them. The sophistication of a buyer is no guarantee against
                              likely confusion. In some cases, however, it is also possible that
                              such a purchaser after having been misled into an initial interest
                              in a product manufactured by an imitator discovers his folly, but
                              this initial interest being based on confusion and deception can

                              practice, or that the decision to purchase involves such careful

</p><p id="p_97">                                 “15.This question has been considered by different High
                                 Courts and this court in umpteen cases from time to time. On
                                 analysis of the principles laid down in the decisions, certain
                                 recognised parameters relating to the matter have emerged.
                                 Without intending to be exhaustive some of the principles
                                 which are accepted as well settled may be stated, thus, that
                                 whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion arising
                                 is a matter for decision by the court, and no witness is entitled
                                 to say whether the mark is likely to deceive or to cause
                                 confusion; that all factors which are likely to create or allay
                                 deception or confusion must be considered in combination; that
                                 broadly speaking, factors creating confusion would be, for
                                 example, the nature of the market itself, the class of customers,
                                 the extent of the reputation, the trade channels, the existence of
                                 any connection in course of trade, and others.”
                              7.9. Thus, while dealing with the case of passing off,
                              the Court may not be concerned with the trade mark
                              of the parties, but the similarity involving the get up
                              of the goods as held by the Apex Court in RUSTON

                              relevant factors. The concept of novelty          has to be
                              seen in the context of each case.
</p><p id="p_100">                              11.2. There are two facets of passing off, which we
                              are concerned with in this case.        One is a “product
                              passing off” and another is “initial interest confusion”.
                              We are concerned with the products of the applicants
                              and the respondent. In these two cases, it is not, as if
                              the general principles will have to be given a go-by.
                              Therefore, it could have relevancy while dealing with the
                              facts of this case. When we deal with “product passing
                              off”, we are required to consider the two products of the
                              parties concerned. These two products will have to be
                              seen with respect to the same-ness, similarity or
                              identity, as the case may be. However, in a case of a
                              contravention of a registration granted already, its
                              effect, will also have to be seen through the common
                              law as well.   While dealing with the product passing off,
                              the concept     of prior user would certainly apply.
                              However, the element of long user may not be strictly
                              necessary in all cases. For example, a newly introduced
                              product may attract the attention of huge customers by
                              its quality and uniqueness. In such a case, the question
                              of period of time loses its significance.       An injunction
                              for passing off does not lie automatically. For example,
                              the defendant succeeds through one of its defence
                              under <a href="/doc/1171934/" id="a_86">Section 19</a> of the Act, such as a prior publication

                              having been made by the plaintiff over a design for
                              which a protection is sought for through the Court. To
                              put it differently, when a design comes under the public
                              domain, it cannot be said that any subsequent user
                              would be violating the common law remedy by its
                              usage. In such a case, the other factors like intention,
                              deceit, likelihood of confusion, apart from damage to
                              reputation, would come. There is a difference between
                              deceit and likelihood of confusion. A “deceit” is one out
                              of intention. But a likelihood of confusion may not be
                              with such intention. Considering the same, it has been
                              held     by     Lord       Denning       in     PARKER         KNOLL

                              the following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                     "Secondly, 'to deceive' is one thing. To 'cause confusion' is
                                     another. The difference in this: When you deceive a man,
                                     you tell him a lie. You make a false representation to him
                                     and thereby cause him to believe a thing to be true which is
                                     false. You may not do it knowingly, or intentionally, but still
                                     you do it, and so you deceive him. But you may cause
                                     confusion without telling him a lie at all, and without
                                     making any false representation to him. You may indeed tell
                                     him the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, but
                                     still you may cause confusion in his mind, not by any fault of
                                     yours, but because he has not the knowledge or ability to
                                     distinguish it from the other pieces of truth known to him or
                                     because he may not even take the trouble to do so."

                              These two principles are well known. A party will have to plead and

                      establish the existence of res-judicata and issue estoppel. However, there

                      is no need for a separate suit when parties act in contravention of the

                      issues decided. Such a plea cannot be raised in a piecemeal manner by

                      leaving out the joint tortfeasor, who was the principal defendant in the

                      earlier suit. However, an issue decided not on a conscious consideration

                      of relevant materials cannot be termed as a binding one. The principles

                      also would not act against the defendants, who were not parties to the

                      earlier proceedings. In the subsequent proceedings, if the Court comes to

                      the conclusion after considering the relevant materials in favour of some

                      of the defendants, who were not parties in the earlier one, then the other

                      defendants, notwithstanding the fact they were parties earlier, would also

                      get the benefit. This may be so, especially, when the ultimate relief was

                      declined in favour of the plaintiff even in the first proceeding.

                      degree of protection would follow. These categories may overlap each

                      other because of the difference in usage over a period of time. The word

                      generic encompasses a whole group of things. Thus, it is not specified, it

                      is a genus, in which, a product is a specie. A generic word can also be

                      descriptive though they are not interchangeable all the time. When a mark

                      is generic, the chance of protection to the holder is very less compared to

                      descriptive. However, in a case where a generic term becomes descriptive,

                      its impact would not get diluted. Certainly, in both the cases, the onus is

                      heavily on the plaintiff who relies upon the mark.

<p id="p_110">                              13.2.When a trade mark is a product of imagination, thought and

                      perspective, it becomes suggestive. Whereas, it becomes descriptive when

                      it conveys the idea of the ingredients, qualities and characteristics of the

                      goods. Thus, when it becomes suggestive as against descriptive, there is

                      no need for any proof of secondary meaning. The validity of the mark

                      would come at naught where suggestion ends and description begins.

<p id="p_111">                      The terms 'arbitrary' and 'fanciful' are also borne out of such imagination

                      though there is no element of suggestion involved. It is the out and out

                      creation of the mark holder. In this connection, we would like to quote the

<p id="p_112">                              “10. Generic and Descriptive:-
</p><p id="p_113">                                     The words generic and descriptive are not inter-
                              changeable. “Generic” would mean general and it encompasses
                              a whole group of things. To put it otherwise, it is not specific.
                              Therefore, the generic name is genes, which has different species.
                              The word “bird” is a genes and the words “eagle”, “crow” are
                              species. Once a word becomes generic, it looses its exclusivity
                              qua a registered trade mark.      This is not a general principle
                              though there are cases in which protection would still be
                              available. When once a word becomes generic, the burden is
                              much higher on the plaintiff to convince the Court for a
                              prohibitory order on the strength of his registered mark. It is
                              much more onerous when the defendant is in some other
                              business.   However, there is a difference between the usage of
                              generic work, which are having direct connection with the
                              product as against the other goods. For example, if the word
                              “Rose” is used involving in a trade dealing with the Roses, then
                              there is a direct connection. In such a case, it may be difficult for
                              the plaintiff being a registered mark holder to success on that
                              score alone de horse other factors. The reason being, the plaintiff
                              might prevent the whole world from using the said name by a
                              sheer act of registration. When once we understand the general
                              principle that a registration is to protect the trade, the protection
                              given would lead to prohibit the others to use a generic word

                               adopting the nature or quality of goods cannot generally be
                               accepted. It is also contrary to the intention of the enactment.
                               On the contrary, if the word “rose” is used in a software business,
                               then it would become a fanciful or arbitrary application. It is for
                               the reason that though the word is generic, the protection comes
                               for the particular business and it is the business that is identified
                               with the name and not otherwise. Therefore, such fanciful or
                               arbitrary words are entitled for protection as a general principle.”

                                  of trademark law, which, although they should be familiar,
                                  tend to become lost in a welter of adjectives.
                                  The cases, and in some instances the Lanham Act, identify four
                                  different categories of terms with respect to trademark
                                  protection. Arrayed in an ascending order which roughly
                                  reflects their eligibility to trademark status and the degree of
                                  protection accorded, these classes are (1) generic, (2)
                                  descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or fanciful. The
                                  lines of demarcation, however, are not always bright.
                                  Moreover, the difficulties are compounded because a term that
                                  is in one category for a particular product may be in quite a
                                  different one for another,6 because a term may shift from one
                                  category to another in light of differences in usage through
                                  time,7 because a term may have one meaning to one group of

                              may be put to different uses with respect to a single product.9
                              In various ways, all of these complications are involved in the
                              instant case.
</p><p id="p_115">                                     A generic term is one that refers, or has come to be
                              understood as referring, to the genus of which the particular
                              product is a species. At common law neither those terms which
                              were generic nor those which were merely descriptive could
                              become valid trademarks, see Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co.

                              see, p. ---- infra, the Lanham Act makes an important
                              exception with respect to those merely descriptive terms which
                              have acquired secondary meaning, see § 2(f), 15 U.S.C. §
                              1052(f), it offers no such exception for generic marks. <a href="/doc/1017213/" id="a_88">The Act</a>

                              The term which is descriptive but not generic11 stands on a
                              better basis. Although § 2(e) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §
                              1052, forbids the registration of a mark which, when applied to
                              the goods of the applicant, is "merely descriptive," § 2(f)
                              removes a considerable part of the sting by providing that
                              "except as expressly excluded in paragraphs (a)-(d) of this
                              section, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the registration of
                              a mark used by the applicant which has become distinctive of
                              the applicant's goods in commerce" and that the Commissioner
                              may accept, as prima facie evidence that the mark has become
                              distinctive, proof of substantially exclusive and continuous use
                              of the mark applied to the applicant's goods for five years
                              preceding the application. As indicated in the cases cited in the
                              discussion of the unregistrability of generic terms, "common
                              descriptive name," as used in §§ 14(c) and 15(4), refers to
                              generic terms applied to products and not to terms that are
                              "merely descriptive." In the former case any claim to an
                              exclusive right must be denied since this in effect would confer
                              a monopoly not only of the mark but of the product by
                              rendering a competitor unable effectively to name what it was
                              endeavoring to sell. In the latter case the law strikes the
                              balance, with respect to registration, between the hardships to
                              a competitor in hampering the use of an appropriate word and
                              those to the owner who, having invested money and energy to
                              endow a word with the good will adhering to his enterprise,

                              The category of "suggestive" marks was spawned by the felt
                              need to accord protection to marks that were neither exactly
                              descriptive on the one hand nor truly fanciful on the other a
                              need that was particularly acute because of the bar in the
                              Trademark Act of 1905, 33 Stat. 724, 726, (with an
                              exceedingly limited exception noted above) on the registration
                              of merely descriptive marks regardless of proof of secondary
                              meaning. See Orange Crush Co. v. California Crushed Fruit

                              the category the courts have had great difficulty in defining it.
                              Judge Learned Hand made the not very helpful statement:
                              It is quite impossible to get any rule out of the cases beyond
                              this: That the validity of the mark ends where suggestion ends
                              and description begins.

                                 the undesirability of preventing an entrant from using a

                                 trademark is a suggestive word since, as Judge Lumbard wrote,
                                 259 F.2d at 317:
</p><p id="p_120">                                 The English language has a wealth of synonyms and related

                                 and slogans as they are needed.
</p><p id="p_121">                                 If a term is suggestive, it is entitled to registration without
                                 proof of secondary meaning. Moreover, as held in the Season-
                                 All case, the decision of the Patent Office to register a mark
                                 without requiring proof of secondary meaning affords a
                                 rebuttable presumption that the mark is suggestive or arbitrary
                                 or fanciful rather than merely descriptive.
                                 It need hardly be added that fanciful or arbitrary terms enjoy
                                 all the rights accorded to suggestive terms as marks without
                                 the need of debating whether the term is "merely descriptive"

                                      equitable principles. On the above concurrent findings,
                                      the weight of equity at this stage is in favour of the
                                      plaintiffs and against the defendants. It has also to be
                                      borne in mind that a mark in the form of a word which
                                      is not a derivative of the product, points to the source
                                      of the product. The mark/name `WHIRLPOOL' is
                                      associated for long, much prior to the defendants'
                                      application in 1986 with the Whirlpool Corporation,
                                      Plaintiff 1. In view of the prior user of the mark by
                                      Plaintiff 1 and its trans-border reputation extending to
                                      India, the trade mark `WHIRLPOOL' gives an
                                      indication of the origin of the goods as emanating from
                                      or relating to the Whirlpool Corporation, Plaintiff 1.
                                      The High Court has recorded its satisfaction that use of
                                      the `WHIRLPOOL' mark by the defendants indicates
                                      prima facie an intention to pass off the defendants'
                                      washing machines as those of the plaintiffs or at least
                                      the likelihood of the buyers being confused or misled

                      the learned single Judge has not considered the scope of <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_99">Section 31</a> of the

                      Trade Marks Act, 1999. The findings rendered both by the learned single

                      Judge on the earlier occasion and the Division Bench have not been

                      understood in the correct perspective. The aforesaid findings would

                      operate on the principle of res judicata and issue of estoppel. There is no

                      need to rearray Google India Private Limited as party defendant. It has

                      stated that it has not violated the law. A contempt action has also been

                      initiated against it. There is an element of initial interest confusion that

                      would arise in the case. The appellant has been forced to bid and pay the

                      higher costs for its own trademark due to the defendants bidding for the

                      same.     The appellant is the prior user having substantial reputation.

                      submits that the trademark registered is both generic and descriptive. A

                      mere registration per se may not give legal right. Sections 17, 28 and 29 of

                      the Trademarks Act are subject to limitations. <a href="/doc/519703/" id="a_107">Section 31</a> of the Act cannot

                                                                442, 443, 445, 446, 448 &amp; 449 of 2020

                      get over the limitations. Neither any issue of estoppel involved nor res

                      judicata would arise. We are dealing with the case where the users are

                      tech-savvy. Even in the typed set of papers filed by the appellant in page

                      Nos.161 and 167, it is only its name which comes first either by using its

                      trade mark or the generic and descriptive names. Ultimately, the consumer

                      will have to get into the website of the defendants. What the appellant

                      challenges is the policy of the Google and the appellant at best could have

                      filed applications in the pending suit. The injunction applications in the

                      earlier round of litigation were dismissed. The order of the Apex Court has

                      not been violated. If that is the case, the remedy open to the appellant is to

                      file contempt. One has to see the case from the view of the working

                      mechanism of 'Google', interest of the consumer and the nature of

                      competition leading to a situation of monopoly being exercised. The

                      defendants' names come below the appellant's. One of the defendants

                      does not even use all the name of the appellant's mark as alleged. The suit

                      is not maintainable by leaving out the main tortfeasor. A mere registration

                      per se will not give absolute monopoly to the appellant. In support of their

                      contentions, the learned Senior Counsel has made reliance upon the

                      following decisions.

                      viz., Google India Private Limited. There is no reason as to why such

                      entity is left out deliberately, especially, when it had taken a specific plea

                      that it is following the law correctly. If a contempt petition is stated to

                      be filed against Google, then, it is not open to the appellant to contend to

                      the contrary that it is not a necessary party. If some of the defendants,

                      who were parties to the earlier suit, continue to violate the orders passed,

                      the remedy lies elsewhere. Thus, we are in respectful agreement with the

                      order of the learned single Judge in this regard. The consumer is Tech-
</p>


<p id="p_181">                      savvy. He knows the importance of 'AdWord' and the search terms. We

                      cannot get into the mind of the consumer and expect him to use different

                      search terms.    Obviously, the consumer is expected to use such term,

                      which he is familiar with.      Such a familiarity is with respect to the

                      language, religion, caste/community, the place and the subject. 'Google'

                      has founded its own policy, which we have noted already. The program is

                      such, it is bound to create more options by search engine optimization

                      and search engine marketing. These are part and parcel of the online

                      business platform. The key words are nothing but tools. In creating the

                      optimization while facilitating the marketing, the idea is to have a common

                      platform for the identical products or service. Whether that policy is right

                      or wrong is certainly a matter for consideration in the earlier suit. The

                      orders passed in the earlier suit did not enure to the          benefit    of the

                      appellant. Perhaps, that is exactly the reason why the present suit has

                      been filed. It is nothing but an extension of the earlier suit with few new

                      defendants. Perhaps, the appellant could have sought for appropriate

                      relief in the first suit as subsequent events can also be taken note of

                      when they happened pending the suit. Unfortunately, this has not been

                      done so and that too, without the presence of the primary actor viz.,

                      'Google'. This is nothing but an attempt to set at naught its policy in it

                      absence.

                      any distinctiveness involved.
</p>


<p id="p_183">                              18.3.In the case on hand, the appellant has conveniently registered

                      all similar names spanning across the entire country. This may be a

                      business prudence. It certainly will not give a distinct advantage when the

                      defendants seek to use them in a different way. Here is a case where the

                      defendants did not seek to use the trade mark of the appellant per se.
</p>
<p id="p_184">                      Rather they want to get into the platform from which the consumer can

                      choose the respective website. The grievance of the appellant that it has

                      been forced to make       more demand by the 'Adwords' chosen by the

                      defendants cannot be countenanced, particularly, in the business                  of

                      Google Private India Limited.    There is no need for it to pay the amount

                      when there is no challenge made to the policy adopted by it. Similarly in

                      the website of some of the defendants, the words 'Tamil Matrimony' and

                      similar words in nature have been shown. But one has to see the content

                      of it. They only facilitate the consumer about the nature of the service

                      offered. Here again, it differs from case to case. After all, a consumer is

<p id="p_185">                              18.4.We may also note that all the parties are doing the same

                      business. In fact, one of the defendants is doing a voluntary service either

                      by using 'AdWord' or trade mark of the appellant. Its name alone comes

                      first. The documents filed by the appellant would indicate the abovesaid

                      factum. That is the reason why the learned Senior Counsel appearing for

                      the appellant fairly modified the prayer sought for.

<p id="p_186">                              18.5.We do not find any 'infringement' or 'passing off' involved.
</p>
<p id="p_187">                      Once we hold that the trade mark used by the appellant is generic and

                      descriptive in nature, the entire scenario changes. The ingredients of



                      'passing off' is also not made out. Certainly, the appellant seeks to have

                      a monopoly throughout the country by mere registration of the trade

                      marks. Ultimately, one has to see from the perspective of the consumer

                      as well.    Granting an order of injunction would amount to set aside the

                      very policy that is being adopted by 'Google'. There is no initial interest

                      doing. In fact, as a competitor, the procedure adopted would only help

                      the appellant, if one agrees with it that it has established its reputation

                      and thus, become the forerunner and the market leader.

<p id="p_188">                              18.6.We do not find any likelihood of confusion involved. A user is

                      consciously expected     to go into the website of the party either the

                      appellant or the defendants. Therefore, at that point of time, he makes

                      the decision consciously.   If the contention of the appellant is accepted,

                      the search results shall contain only the appellant's website alone. It is

                      certainly contrary to the established functioning of the internet.

<p id="p_189">                              18.7.One cannot expect the consumer to use only the particular

                      words as 'AdWords'. After all, the word 'Matrimony' is a most common

                      word in the field of marriage. Even before the advent of internet, the

                      newspapers used to carry matrimony columns. When the general public

                      understand the words in a particular way, a different meaning must be

                      secondary meaning especially when the nature of trade and business is in

                      tune     with the natural meaning of the word.         The word Tamil which

                      depicts the language gives a certain identity. A combination of these two

                      words is one of absolute necessity to cull out the information required. As

                      stated, this is the very essence of search engine optimization and

                      marketing.

<p id="p_190">                               18.8.The learned single Judge has considered the matter in

                      extenso. Accordingly, he came to the correct conclusion after assessing

                      the materials placed before him. We do not find any acceptable reason

                      to differ with the views expressed especially in the light of the judgments

                      referred above on the scope of the Appellate Court in reassessing the

                      materials and findings rendered by the Court of first instance.

                      injunction against the defendants, who were arrayed as such earlier and

                      now. Ultimately, even on the earlier occasion, the relief sought for has

                      available in the case. We do not think that the appellant is entitled to

                      succeed based upon the findings rendered by the Division Bench on the

                      earlier occasion.

                      defendants. Even against the earlier defendants, who were also parties to

                      the present suit, the appellant's remedy lies in the previous suit. Even on

                      merit, we do not find anything adverse in favour of the defendants to the

                      extent of entitling the appellant in getting the interim order. After all,
