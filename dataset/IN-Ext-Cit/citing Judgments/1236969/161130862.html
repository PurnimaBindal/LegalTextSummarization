Marks for the recordal of its name as the subsequent proprietor of
the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the electric water heaters

had issued Legal Proceedings Certificate on 26th September, 1997

relation to the aforesaid goods. A copy of the said Legal Proceeding
Certificate in relation to the said Trade Mark Registration has been

became due for renewal on 14th September, 2002, the plaintiff being
not aware of the same for reasons beyond his control, could not take
the necessary steps for the renewal of the said mark within the
prescribed time. However, on coming to know about the same, the
plaintiff immediately filed Form TM-13 for the renewal of the said
mark but the same was disallowed by the Registrar vide order dated
15th September, 2004 as time barred. A copy of the said order has

extensively advertised the aforesaid mark in relation to the above
mentioned goods which in turn have come to be associated
exclusively      with   the   plaintiff.   Copies   of   the      newspaper
advertisements issued by the plaintiff-Company have been exhibited
as Mark H (colly).
</p>
<p id="p_43">32.    It is alleged that the trademark "JOHNSON" insofar as it
relates to electric water heaters (excluding instant type geysers)
belongs only to plaintiff and no one else. The disputes between M/s
Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd., M/s Blumac Electricals India and Sh.
Vinod Kumar Jain or his business entities are not in any way related
to the subject matter of the present suit which relates only to
electric water heaters (excluding the instant type geysers).

<p id="p_44">33.    It is submitted that an Assignment Deed dated 1st April, 1999
for the mark "JOHNSON" bearing Registration No. 197997 B in Class
9, 319955 in class 11 and 195359 in class 21 and also various
pending applications at that time pertaining to the mark "JOHNSON"
in various classes namely 398343 in class 7, 319954, 398341 and

<p id="p_45"> 34.    Both M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and Sh. Vinod Kumar
Jain, (proprietor of defendant No.4) in his individual capacity till 12th
March, 1999 were part of the joint family business of the Jain family
comprising of four families headed by four brothers, namely, Sh.
Muni Lal Jain, Sh. Satish Kumar Jain, Sh. Subhash Chand Jain and
Sh. Vinod Kumar Jain. However, due to certain differences and
disputes among the respective four families, a Memorandum of
Partition was entered into between four brothers on 12th March,
1999 which was to serve as the basis of the final family settlement.
All the four brothers were signatories to the said Memorandum of
Partition.
</p>
<p id="p_46">35.    It is stated by the plaintiff that the Assignment Deed dated 1 st
April, 1999 was the result of and in consonance with the terms set
out in the aforementioned Memorandum of Partition dated 12th
March, 1999. However, the same did not relate to the trademark
"JOHNSON" in relation to the products in question inasmuch as the
rights of M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. in the said mark in relation
to the said products had ceased to exist by Assignment Deed dated
9th March, 1994 between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and M/s
Vidyut Udyog (which was taken over by the plaintiff-Company vide
Agreement dated 2nd April, 1997, along with all its assets and
liabilities). Insofar as the present case is concerned, it only deals
with the trademark "JOHNSON" in relation to electric water heaters
(excluding instant type water geysers), for which the plaintiff is the
registered proprietor and exclusive owner. It is stated by PW-1 that
the disputes pending qua the said Memorandum of Partition and the
cases involving M/s Blumac Electricals India are not being explained

 by him as they are subject matter of other cases pending before this
Court.
</p>
<p id="p_47">36.    Even the Trade Mark Application No. 398342 in Class 11 under
which the defendant No.4 is claiming rights qua electric geysers was
abandoned by the said defendant long ago. Thus, no rights
whatsoever can be claimed by the defendant No.4 on the basis of
the same. The original letter dated 9th July, 1999, issued by
Trademark Registry stating that the said mark has not been
renewed, has been exhibited as Ex.PW-1/12.
</p>
<p id="p_48">37.    The present case only deals with the trademark "JOHNSON" in
relation to electric water heaters (excluding instant type geysers) for
which the plaintiff is the registered proprietor and exclusive owner.
The original pamphlet, price list, guarantee card etc. issued by the
plaintiff have been exhibited as Ex.PW-1/13.
</p>
<p id="p_49">38.    The alleged exclusive License/Permitted User Agreement dated
27th May, 2006 entered into between defendant Nos.3 and 4 does
not relate to the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to electric water
heaters (excluding the instant type geysers) inasmuch as vide the
Deed     of   Assignment   dated   9th   March,   1994,   the   trademark
"JOHNSON" in relation to electric storage type water heaters
(excluding the instant geysers) was assigned by M/s Classic
Equipments Pvt. Ltd. in favour of M/s Vidyut Udyog which was taken
over by the plaintiff-Company by the Agreement dated 2nd April,
1997 along with all its assets and liabilities. The Assignment Deed
dated 1st April, 1999 entered into between the M/s Classic
Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and defendant No.4 did not relate to the
trademark "JOHNSON" in relation to the products mentioned
hereinabove.

<p id="p_50"> 39.    It is stated by the plaintiff that the plaintiff is the registered
owner of the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the products mentioned
hereinabove. The use of the mark "JOHNSON" by the defendants in
relation to the said goods results in the infringement of the
registered trademark which exclusively vests in the plaintiff. The use
of the mark "JOHNSON" by the defendants in relation to the
aforesaid goods also results in passing off their goods as those of the
plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_51">40.    The original pamphlet issued by defendant No.4 has been
exhibited as Ex.P-16. Also a copy of the invoice raised by the
defendant No.1 on defendant No.3 for JOHNSON water heaters has
been placed on record and has been exhibited as Ex.P-17. Copies of
the invoices raised by defendant No.5 for JOHNSON water heaters
have been exhibited as Ex.P-18. Further, the original photograph of
the carton of JOHNSON water geyser indicating defendant No.1 as
its manufacturer which stands admitted by defendant No.4 and not
marked.      The original carton of JOHNSON water geyser indicating
defendant No.2 as its manufacturer and defendant No.3 as its
marketer and also the licensed user of defendant No.4 which stands
admitted by the defendant No.4 has been exhibited as Ex.P-19.
</p>
<p id="p_52">41.    It is submitted that the use by the defendants of the mark
"JOHNSON" in relation to electric water heaters (excluding the
instant type geysers) is completely illegal and unlawful. The
defendants do not have any right in law to use the mark "JOHNSON"
in relation to the aforesaid goods. The sole endeavour of the
defendants is to encash and ride upon the goodwill and reputation
earned by the plaintiff in the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the
abovementioned       goods   and   on   account   of   the     defendant's

 irresponsible manner of conducting its business, the plaintiff has
suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable damage to its
reputation,     business   and   goodwill   unless   the   defendants        are
restrained by an order of injunction to be passed by this Court. The
plaintiff has suffered huge losses by virtue of the said illegal use of
the impugned mark by the defendants. Thus, the plaintiff has also
been seeking for relief of damages against the defendants and for
the purpose of computing the same, the plaintiff has relied upon the
sales figure as given by defendant No.4. The defendant No.4 in its
written statement is claiming to be using the impugned mark
"JOHNSON" since the year 1999. A copy of the sales turnover as
filed by the defendant No.4 has been exhibited as Ex.PW-1/14.
</p>
<p id="p_53">42.    The plaintiff is claiming for damages to the tune of Rs.
35,42,504.67/- as well as punitive damages in view of the malafide
and dishonest adoption and use of the impugned mark apart from
seeking relief of passing off and permanent injunction in its favour.
</p>
<p id="p_54">43.    The written statement on behalf of the defendant No.4 has
been filed, wherein, inter alia, the following main defences are
raised:-
</p>
<p id="p_55">(i)    The plaintiff has claimed on the basis of the alleged Deed of
       Assignment dated 9th March, 1994, which itself is a fraudulent
       and doctored document. A comparison of the said documents
       filed by the plaintiff and photocopy filed by the defendant No.4
       would show the manipulation committed by the plaintiff. In the
       original, the document was signed on behalf of one M/s Jain
       Associates. In the original, there has been no cutting in the
       page. Not only that, the plaintiff on the basis of this doctored
       document, procured the split Trade Mark registrations and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                           Page 19 of 54</span>
         orders from the Trade Mark Office. The entire proceedings
        before the Trade Mark office and the present suit proceedings
        are fraud and stands vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_56">(ii)    Assuming the said Assignment to be valid, it is submitted by
        the defendant No.4 that the aforesaid Assignment dated 9th
        March, 1994 to M/s Vidyut Udyog was only in relation to
        "electric storage type water heaters (excluding the instant type
        geysers)". On the other hand, the alleged rights given by M/s
        Vidyut Udyog to the plaintiff as per the plaintiff's own
        pleadings pertain to "Electric water heaters (excluding the
        instant type geysers)". There is a difference between these
        two kinds of goods. The first type pertains to "Hammams"
        while the second type pertain to "Heating Elements" like
        immersion rods etc. Thus, neither M/s Vidyut Udyog had rights
        in these heating elements nor could he have assigned the
        same. The hammams in which it allegedly had rights have not
        been assigned. In either case, the plaintiff has no rights at all.
</p>
<p id="p_57">(iii)   Even assuming that the plaintiff's claimed goods i.e., "electric
        water heaters (excluding the instant type geysers)" are same
        as "electric storage type water heaters (excluding the instant
        type geysers)" even then both these goods do not include
        heating elements like immersion rods etc.. These products in
        the trade, market and consumer parlance and in local
        language are commonly referred to as a "hammam" or "boiling
        chamber" and were so understood by the parties and in
        reference to which they are so traded and bought. The
        hammam is a product which consists of a portable drum and is
        kept on the floor and is not mounted on the wall.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                           Page 20 of 54</span>
<p id="p_58"> (iv)     This product viz. hammam is different from geysers which are
         mounted, fixed and stationed on the walls. The term 'instant
         type geysers' refers to fixed or portable type geysers which are
         however not hammams. In a hammam, water is stored and
         then heated. While in a geyser water flows in from one inlet,
         then passes through an element and then flows out from
         another.
</p>
<p id="p_59">(v)      These two set of products viz. hammams and geysers are
         different in their engineering, mode of use, the functions they
         perform, the prices involved etc., and are considered as
         different products in the market, trade and consumer parlance.
</p>
<p id="p_60">(vi)     Under the alleged Assignment to the plaintiff, only hammams
         were assigned and not geysers. The expression "(excluding the
         instant type geysers)" was so incorporated in the plaintiff's
         alleged     assignment   as   to   limit   and   highlight   that      its
         assignment was intended only for hammams as they were
         portable while instant type geysers could be both portable and
         fixed and thus, a reference was so made to highlight and
         clarify that the plaintiff's claimed goods were only restricted to
         portable hammam.

the defendants' goods as per Deed of Assignment dated 1st April,

<blockquote id="blockquote_7">                     Sh. Amit Jain was one of the Director in the plaintiff-
            Company in the year 1999 when the Deed of Assignment

<p id="p_68">47.    The plaintiff was aware of the defendants' said rights and use
from the year 1999 till date and has stood by it. The defendants
have grown and prospered under the plaintiff's very nose who has
never objected to the defendants' said use. It is only now that the
plaintiff has preferred the present suit and that too on vague, false
and frivolous allegations. As it is apparent from the said allegations,
the plaintiff appears to be well aware of the Form TM-24 proceedings
between the defendant No.4 and M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd as
also the two suit proceedings between the defendant No.4 and M/s
Blumac Electricals India. In these proceedings, the said defendant
had pleaded its rights and use and even placed documentary
evidence coupled with the fact that the parties are well known to
each other.
</p>
<p id="p_69">48.    The plaintiff has suppressed its knowledge and/or deemed
knowledge of the defendants' use since the year 1999. The plaintiff
has made a false statement with regard to cause of action. The fact
is that the defendants' has been in its said goods and business since
the year 1999. The plaintiff has deliberately made false statements


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                        Page 25 of 54</span>
 to the effect that the Deed of Assignment dated 1st April, 1999 of the
defendant No.4 had been stayed by this Court vide order dated 18th
March, 2008 in WP(C) No. 2157/2008.
</p>
<p id="p_70">49.    Thus, the plaintiff's suit is barred by the principles of limitation
taken from the year 1999 when the defendant had received the
Assignment dated 1st April, 1999. The said Assignment was well
within the knowledge of the plaintiff having regard inter alia to the
nature of the family business involved and the Directors and the
witnesses involved as also the defendants' use of the said trademark
"JOHNSON" continuously since then in the course of trade in relation
to their goods.
</p>
<p id="p_71">50.    The plaintiff had filed the replication wherein it has denied all
the pleas raised by the defendant No.4 in its written statement. It
has been stated as under:-
</p>
<p id="p_72">   a) The plaintiff denies the allegation that the assignment and
   documents are fraudulent and doctored. It is stated that Sh. Muni
   Lal Jain, one of the Directors of the plaintiff-Company and also
   one of the Directors of M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. has
   deposed in his affidavit dated 6th June, 2008 that on 9th March,
   1994 apart from the Assignment Deed entered into between M/s
   Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. wherein the trademark "JOHNSON"
   was assigned to M/s Vidyut Udyog in relation to electric storage
   type water heaters (excluding the instant type geysers) covered
   under Registration No. 19799-B in class 11. There was another
   Assignment        deed   entered   into   between   the   M/s     Classic
   Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Jain Associates vide which M/s
   Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. assigned the trademark "JOHNSON"
   in relation to electric coil stoves, electric hot plates and electrical

    cooking ranges covered under Registration No. 319955 in class 11
   in favour of one M/s Jain Associates. It is further stated in his
   affidavit that both these Assignment Deeds mentioned above and
   also various other Assignment Deeds were drafted and prepared
   by M/s Delhi Registration Service. He has further stated that after
   having received the original Assignment Deeds entered into
   between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd and M/s Vidyut Udyog
   and M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd and M/s Jain Associates dated
   9th March, 1994 from M/s Delhi Registration Service along with the
   copies thereof, the same were duly signed and witnessed in his
   presence. One such duly signed and witnessed copy of each
   Assignment Deed was retained by M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd
   for official records and the original deeds were handed over to M/s
   Delhi Registration Service for taking further actions so as to give
   effect to these assignments in the Trade Marks Registry. He
   further stated that subsequently it was discovered that the name
   of assignee on last page of both the said assignment deeds was
   typed as 'For Jain Associates through its partner Sh. Muni Lal
   Jain', whereas one of the said Assignments in effect related to M/s
   Vidyut Udyog. This error was duly communicated to M/s Delhi
   Registration Service and necessary corrections were made in the
   copies of the said deeds retained by M/s Classic Equipments Pvt.
   Ltd for official records. He has also stated that both these
   Assignment Deeds dated 9th March, 1994 were duly submitted to
   the Trade Mark Registry by M/s Delhi Registration Service and
   vide letter dated 24th January, 1995, M/s Classic Equipments Pvt.
   Ltd was informed by M/s Delhi Registration Service that the said
   assignments have been allowed by the Trade Mark Registry vide



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                      Page 27 of 54</span>
    Order No.PR/985 dated 20th January, 1995. Accordingly, the
   question of forging or fabricating the original Assignment Deed
   entered into between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd and M/s
   Vidyut Udyog dated 9th March, 1994 and obtaining the split Trade
   Mark Registrations and orders from the Trade Mark Registry on
   the basis of the same does not even arise as the original deed as
   well the copies thereof were duly signed and witnessed in the
   presence of Sh. Muni Lal Jain after which the original deed was
   sent to M/s Delhi Registration Service for taking further actions in
   order to give effect to the said assignment. The above facts
   establish that all the Assignments were well within the knowledge
   of the same Trade Mark Agents who were earlier acting on behalf
   of the entire Jain family and are now representing defendant No.4.
</p>
<p id="p_73">   b) With regard to the second contention that the expression
   "Electric storage type water heaters (excluding instant type
   geysers)" has been used in the Assignment Deed dated 9th March,
   1994 entered into between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd and
   M/s Vidyut Udyog, is in fact hammam which is different from
   "Electric water heaters (excluding instant type geysers)" in which
   the plaintiff has no rights, it is submitted by the plaintiff that the
   defendant No.4 in fact has concocted this entire story and is trying
   to create an artificial distinction between Electric storage type
   water heaters (excluding instant type geysers) and Electric water
   heaters (excluding instant type geysers) and is in turn terming the
   former as "Hammams" with a view to mislead this Court. Further,
   in para 4 of the written statement, an attempt has been made to
   portray before this Court and to cast an impression that the
   expression "Electric Water Heater/Geyser" is confined and limited



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                         Page 28 of 54</span>
    only to the instant type heaters/geysers. As it has been stated
   earlier, Electric Water Heaters/Geysers for the purposes of the
   present suit can broadly be classified in two categories, i.e. the
   instant type and excluding instant type or storage type. While the
   former is the one wherein the water is not required to be stored,
   in fact it gets heated instantly as and when it enters the
   heater/geyser and passes through the heating element before it
   exits the heater/geyser, the latter is the one wherein the water
   first gets stored and then gets heated. The fact that there is no
   distinction between the two expressions, namely Electric storage
   type water heaters (excluding instant type geysers) and Electric
   water heaters (excluding instant type geysers) is evident from the
   Form TM-16 dated 18th January,1995 that was filed on behalf of
   M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd by M/s Delhi Registration Service,
   wherein a request was made to read the expression Electric
   storage type water heaters (excluding instant type geysers) that
   was used in the Assignment Deed dated 9th March, 1994 entered
   into between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd and M/s Vidyut
   Udyog, as Electric water heaters (excluding instant type geysers).
   It is submitted that had there been any difference whatsoever
   between the aforementioned two expressions as alleged, the
   difference in wording in the Form TM-16 would not have occurred.
   The said two terms are in fact used and understood as being
   synonymous to each other. Be that as it may, it is submitted that,
   the nomenclature used by the defendant No.4 for its Geysers is
   also "Electric Storage Geyser". This is evident from page 49 of
   defendant's documents read with Page 26 of the said documents.
   The geyser in the defendant's brochure at page 26, bears the IS



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                      Page 29 of 54</span>
    No. 2082 which also finds a mention at Pg 49 in relation to
   "Electric Storage Geyser". This being the case, one fails to
   understand as to by what stretch of imagination and on what basis
   the defendant No.4 is terming "Electric storage type water
   heaters" that has been used in the Assignment Deed dated 9th
   March, 1994 entered into between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd
   and M/s Vidyut Udyog, as "Hammams" and distinguishing the
   same from Electric water heaters.
</p><p id="p_74">   c)   With regard to the submissions of the defendant No.4 in its
   written statement that the defendant No.4 had itself acquired
   rights in Trade Mark Application No. 398342 in class 11 qua
   Electric geysers by virtue of the Assignment Deed dated 1st April,
   1999 entered into between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd and
   defendant No. 4, it is submitted by the plaintiff that the present
   case only deals with the trademark "JOHNSON" in relation to
   electric water heaters (excluding instant type geysers), for which
   the plaintiff is the registered proprietor and exclusive owner. The
   aforesaid Assignment Deed did not relate to the trademark
   "JOHNSON" in relation to the products in question inasmuch as the
   rights of M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. in the said mark in
   relation to the said products had ceased to exist vide Assignment
   Deed dated 9th March, 1994 between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt.
   Ltd. and M/s Vidyut Udyog which was taken over by the plaintiff-
   company vide Agreement dated 2nd April, 1997 along with all its
   assets and liabilities. In fact, pursuant to the aforementioned
   Assignment; M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. made an application
   to the Trademark Registry vide Form TM-36 dated 17th May, 1995
   through M/s Delhi Registration Service for striking out the goods



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                      Page 30 of 54</span>
    i.e. Water Heaters (Electric) (excluding the instant type geysers)
   from the category of goods under their Registered Trademark No.
   197998 B in Class 11. Accordingly, the defendant No. 4 cannot
   claim    any      statutory/common    law     rights   in    the   trademark
   "JOHNSON" in relation to electric water heaters (excluding instant
   type geysers). Be that as it may, it is submitted that even the
   Trade Mark Application No. 398342 in class 11 under which the
   defendant No.4 is claiming rights qua electric geysers, was
   abandoned by the said defendant long ago. Accordingly, no rights
   whatsoever can be claimed by the said defendant on the basis of
   the same.
</p><p id="p_75">   d) The      plaintiff   had   also   denied     that   the     plaintiff       has
   concealed/suppressed the knowledge of defendant No. 4. It is
   submitted that the plaintiff, in fact, has set out the entire
   background of the joint family business of Jain family, the
   Memorandum of Partition dated 12th March, 1999, the Deed of
   Assignment dated 1st April, 1999 and also the various legal
   disputes between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd., M/s Blumac
   Electricals India and Sh. Vinod Kumar Jain or his business entities
   (defendant No. 4 being one of them) that are pending adjudication
   before this Court in para 17 to 20 of the plaint. It is denied by the
   plaintiff that the present suit has been with any vengeance to the
   legal disputes between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt Ltd., M/s
   Blumac Electricals India and Sh. Vinod Kumar Jain (proprietor of
   defendant No.4-Company) or it is a shadow of M/s Classic
   Equipments Pvt Ltd. and M/s Blumac Electricals India and the
   same has been filed to settle scores and open up another front
   against the defendant No.4. It is submitted that all these



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                                Page 31 of 54</span>
    allegations are totally misplaced, misconceived and nothing but an
   exaggerated misconception of the defendant No.4. The said
   defendant having specifically and voluntarily agreed to the
   partition of the mark as stated in the plaint cannot now violate the
   said settlement both in letter and spirit. Insofar as the plaintiff is
   concerned, its business primarily depends on this particular
   product and hence, if the defendants use the same brand for the
   same product and sell in the market, it would completely erode
   the distinctiveness of the brand qua the plaintiff and would also
   completely wipe out its market as well.
</p><p id="p_76">   e) It is also denied that the plaintiff has deliberately manipulated
   the array of defendants as the defendant Nos.1 and 2 are engaged
   in the manufacturing of the electric water heaters (excluding the
   instant type geysers) under the mark "JOHNSON" which are being
   marketed by defendant Nos. 3 and 4. Defendant No. 5 is one of
   the distributors of defendant No. 3 who claims to be the licensed
   user of the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the aforesaid goods by
   virtue of an alleged exclusive License/Permitted User Agreement
   dated 27th May, 2006 executed in its favour by defendant No. 4.
   In view of the same, to say that the plaintiff has deliberately
   manipulated       the   array   of   defendants   is   nothing    but      an
   exaggerated misconception of the defendant. The very fact that
   the defendants have not filed any agreement to this effect on
   record itself speaks volumes of their conduct which is violative of
   all the statutory and common law rights vesting in favour of the
   plaintiff in respect of the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to water
   heaters (electric) (excluding the instant type geysers) and is
   causing grave injury/losses to the plaintiff whose running business

    is being severely impaired. The defendants have no right in law or
   equity     over   the      mark   "JOHNSON"     in   relation    to       the
   aforementioned goods. It is further submitted that the exclusive
   License/Permitted User Agreement dated 27th May, 2006 entered
   into between defendants Nos.3 and 4 does not even relate to the
   mark "JOHNSON" in relation to electric water heaters, far less
   electric water heaters (excluding the instant type geysers).
</p>
<p id="p_77">   f)   It is submitted that the Assignment Deed dated 1st April, 1999
   entered into between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd and
   defendant No. 4 does not relate to the trademark "JOHNSON" in
   relation to the products in question inasmuch as the rights of M/s
   Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. in the said mark in relation to the
   said products had ceased to exist vide Assignment Deed dated 9th
   March, 1994 between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and M/s
   Vidyut Udyog which was taken over by the plaintiff-Company vide
   Agreement dated 2nd April, 1997 along with all its assets and
   liabilities. Accordingly, the defendant No. 4 cannot claim any
   statutory/common law rights in the trademark "JOHNSON" in
   relation to electric water heaters excluding instant type geysers.
</p>
<p id="p_78">   g) It       is    denied      that   the      plaintiff-Company           has
   concealed/suppressed the knowledge of defendant No. 4 as
   alleged. In fact, the plaintiff has set out the entire background of
   the joint family business of Jain family, the Memorandum of
   Partition dated 12th March, 1999, the Deed of Assignment dated
   1st April, 1999 and also the various legal disputes between M/s

    further denied that the plaintiff has manipulated the cause of
   action as alleged. It is further denied that the plaintiff has
   misrepresented about the scope and extent of its alleged rights
   and has suppressed the defendant's rights and claims.
</p>
<p id="p_79">   h) It is also denied that the defendants have any right in law to
   use the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the goods in question. The
   defendants have no right in law or equity over the mark
   "JOHNSON" in relation to the aforementioned goods and are liable
   to be injuncted from using the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to
   water heaters (electric) (excluding the instant type geysers) in
   any manner whatsoever. The plaintiff has every right to protect its
   coveted intellectual property and the rights therein, and the same
   cannot be infringed/violated by the defendants with impunity who
   do not have any right in law to use the mark "JOHNSON" in
   relation to the aforesaid goods i.e. water heaters (electric)
   (excluding the instant type geysers). It is denied that the plaintiff
   has concealed the factum, cause and effect of the Form TM-16
   dated 18th January, 1995 as alleged. The very purpose of filing the
   said Form TM -16 was merely to change the nomenclature of the
   goods and not to alter the specification/character/nature of the
   goods so assigned to M/s Vidyut Udyog vide Assignment Deed
   dated 9th March, 1994 as has been sought to be portrayed by
   defendant No. 4. It is reiterated that Sh. Vinod Kumar Jain, being

   four families headed by four brothers, namely, Sh. Muni Lal Jain,
   Sh. Satish Kumar Jain, Sh. Subhash Chand Jain, and Sh. Vinod

    Delhi Registration Service were very much aware of the factum of
   the said Form TM-16 since its inception. The said Form TM-16 was
   drafted and prepared by M/s Delhi Registration Service. Further, it
   was M/s Delhi Registration Service only who had sent the said
   form to the Registrar of Trademarks.
</p>
<p id="p_80">   i)   It is denied by the plaintiff in its replication that the present
   suit is barred by limitation. It is further denied that the plaintiff
   had the knowledge about the defendant's use of the impugned
   mark in relation to the products in issue since 1999 as alleged.
</p>
<p id="p_81">   j)   It is submitted that the plaintiff being the registered owner of
   the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the products mentioned
   hereinabove, the use of the mark "JOHNSON" by the defendants in
   relation to the said goods results in the infringement of the
   registered trademark, which exclusively vests in the plaintiff. The
   use of the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the aforesaid goods also
   results in passing off of the defendants' goods as that of the
   plaintiff. The use by the defendants of the mark "JOHNSON" in
   relation to water heaters (electric) (excluding the instant type
   geysers) is completely illegal and unlawful. The defendants do not
   have any right in law to use the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to
   the aforesaid goods. The sole endeavour of the defendants is to
   encash and ride upon the goodwill and reputation earned by the
   plaintiff in the mark JOHNSON in relation to the abovementioned
   goods.

<p id="p_127">54.    I shall now discuss the matter issues wise. Issues No.1 to 3
are connected with each other, thus the same are taken up together

</p><p id="p_128">55.    Mr. Bansal, learned counsel for the defendants in support of
his submission has referred the pleadings, documents as well as the
answers given by the PW-1 in his cross-examination to the question
Nos. 18, 19, 65, 44-46, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 97, 102. He submits that
PW-1 has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that water
boilers are covered by both the Registrations i.e. 197998 and
319955. The water boilers can heat upto 100 degrees and generate
steam, and the water heaters (storage type) will not heat upto the
boiling point, consequently generating steam because there is a
thermostat along with the cut off device provided in it. The
Assignment dated 9th March, 1994 between M/s Classic Equipments
Pvt. Ltd and M/s Vidyut Udyog was by splitting the category of water
boilers and goods assigned were water boilers "being technically
known as water boilers". In the water heaters, thermostat and cut
off devices are fitted and therefore in the said water heaters,
temperature cannot rise beyond a particular level thus the steam will
not be generated. The electric water heaters (storage type) cannot
boil water and generate steam. The Deed of Assignment dated 1st
April, 1999 was witnessed by the plaintiff's witness himself and has
identified his own signatures at Point 'A'. The various disputes
pending between defendant No.4 and M/s Classic Equipments Pvt.

<p id="p_129"> Ltd. and M/s Blumac Electricals India and Deed of Assignment dated
1st April, 1999 are not relevant for the present proceedings.
</p>
<p id="p_130">56.     In his examination and cross examination, DW-1 has not
denied the factual position that when M/s Classic Equipments Pvt.
Ltd. became the proprietor of the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the
goods in question on 2nd April, 1992, there were two Assignment
Deeds executed by M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. wherein one
Deed of Assignment had assigned the trademark "JOHNSON" in
relation to electric storage type water heaters (excluding the instant
type geysers) covered under Registration No.197998-B in class 11 in
favour of one M/s Vidyut Udyog and another Deed of Assignment
had assigned the trademark "JOHNSON" in relation to electric coil
stoves, electric hot plates and electrical cooking ranges covered
under Registration No. 319955 in class 11 in favour of one M/s Jain
Associates. The Trade Mark Registry vide their order PR/985 dated
20th January, 1995 allowed both the assignments dated 9th March,
1994.
</p>
<p id="p_131">57.     Consequently, the Registered Trade Mark No. 197998 B got
split up into 197998 B in Class 11 and 197998 B (Spl.) and the
Registered Trademark No. 319955           got split up into 319955 and
319955 (Spl.).
</p>
<p id="p_132">58.     In view of the said split, the item "Water boiler" which was
covered under both the applications i.e. 197998 B and 319955 got
bifurcated into "Water Heaters (electric) (excluding the instant type
geysers)" and "Water Heaters (instant type geysers)". While the
former went to M/s. Vidyut Udyog under Registration No. 197998 B
(which was subsequently taken over by the plaintiff), the latter
remained      with   M/s   Classic   Equipments   Pvt.   Ltd.     under         the

 Registration No. 319955. M/s Delhi Registration Service vide letter
dated 24th January, 1995 informed M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd.
about the order dated 20th January, 1995 whereby both the
Assignment Deeds dated 9th March, 1994 were allowed by the Trade
Mark Registry.

<p id="p_133">59.    Subsequent to the order PR/985, the requisite Form TM-24
and Form TM-36 were filed by M/s Vidyut Udyog pertaining to the
Assignment Deed dated 9th March, 1994 in its favour and the said
order was reaffirmed by the Trade Mark Registry vide its order PR-25
dated 14th February, 1997. As far as the further split in the mark
319955 in the aforementioned order is concerned, the same was
done because of an Assignment Deed entered on the same date i.e.
9th March, 1994 between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and M/s
Jain Associates pertaining to Electric Coil stoves, electric hot plates
and electric cooking ranges. The most important fact of the matter is
that the Trade Marks Attorney who were handling the matters on
behalf of both the parties, are same. The relevant date is the date of
assignment. On that date and for reasonable time, one has to see
the conduct of the parties and how they have understood and
perceived the written documents. Once the document is a written
document, and is duly signed, different inference cannot be drawn
and thus, the same has to be read as it is.
</p>
<p id="p_134">60.    Either at the time of assignment or within the reasonable time,
the defendant No.4 or its assignee never protested or raised any
objection that one of the descriptions of goods i.e. water boilers was
retained by M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. or it has at any time
come to the share of the defendant. It appears that later on when
the defendant No.4 felt aggrieved; it started raising the objection


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                       Page 42 of 54</span>
 that the two sets of goods i.e. water boilers and electric storage of
type water heaters are different items. Even the Assignment Deeds
were silent in this regard. The second mark i.e. 319955 assigned to
defendant No.4 was the associated mark with the earlier registered
mark.
</p>
<p id="p_135">61.     The defendant No.4 is now trying to create the artificial
distinction between electric storage type water heaters (excluding
instant type geysers) and electric water heaters (excluding instant
type geysers) and is in turn terming the former as "Hammams". But
they are used and understood as being synonymous in common
market parlance.
</p>
<p id="p_136">62.     It is evident from the print out of the screen shot taken from
the website www.indiamart.com and also the printout filed by the
defendant No.4 from the same website demonstrates the same
electric water heaters/geysers. For the purpose of the present suit, it
can broadly be classified in two categories i.e. the instant type and
excluding instant type. While the former is the one in which the
water is not required to be stored, in fact it gets heated instantly as
and when it enters the heater/geyser and passes through the
heating element before it exits the geyser/heater, the latter is the
one wherein the water first gets stored and then gets heated.
</p>
<p id="p_137">63.     The expression "excluding instant type" itself connotes the said
product is "storage type".
</p>
<p id="p_138">64.     The nomenclature used by the defendant No.4 for their
product is also "Electric Storage Geyser" who is in fact using the
expression      "geyser"   and   "heater"   interchangeably.   Even        the
nomenclature used in ISI Specification i.e. IS 2082 filed by the said



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                         Page 43 of 54</span>
 defendant No.4 for the product in question is stationary storage type
electric water heaters.
</p>
<p id="p_139">65.    There is no distinction between the two expressions as evident
from Form TM-16 dated 18th January, 1995 that was filed on behalf
of M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. by M/s Delhi Registration
Service, wherein a request was made to read the expression electric
storage type water heaters (excluding instant type geysers) that was
used in the Assignment Deed dated 9th March, 1994 entered into
between M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Vidyut Udyog as
"Electric water heaters (excluding instant type geysers)"
</p>
<p id="p_140">66.    It is stated that had there been any difference whatsoever
between the aforementioned two expressions as alleged, the
difference in wording in the FormTM-16 would not have occurred.
</p>
<p id="p_141">67.    The defendant No.4 without any valid reasons is trying to
create confusion about another assignment as the present suit is not
even remotely connected with the Assignment dated 1st April, 1999
entered     into     between   M/s   Classic   Equipments   Pvt.   Ltd.       and
defendant No.4 and/or other legal proceedings between M/s Classic
Equipments Pvt. Ltd., M/s Blumac Electricals India and Sh. Vinod
Kumar Jain. The Deed of Assignment dated 1st April, 1999 did not
even mention the trademark "JOHNSON" in relation to the product in
question inasmuch as the rights of M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd.
are concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_142">68.    Subsequent to the Deed of Assignment dated 9th March 1994
between M/s Classis Equipments Pvt. Ltd. and M/s Vidyut Udyog
made an application to the Trade Mark Registry vide Form TM-36
dated 17th May, 1995 through Delhi Registration Service for striking



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                            Page 44 of 54</span>
 out the goods i.e. water heaters (electric) (excluding the instant type
geysers)     from    the   category   of   goods    under    their   registered
trademark No. 197998 B in class 11.
</p>
<p id="p_143">69.    With regard to Trade Mark Application No. 398342 in class 11
under which the defendant No.4 is claiming rights qua electric
geysers has been abandoned by the said defendant. The details of
the same have been filed by the plaintiff in the replication in CS(OS)
No.166/2004 which has been annexed as Annexure C.
</p>
<p id="p_144">70.    The     Application   No.319955     was     to   be   associated     with
Application No. 197998 B. Both these applications contained the
item "water boiler". Subsequent to the two Assignment Deeds dated
9th March, 1994, these two applications were split by order No.
PR/985 dated 20th January, 1995 passed by the Trade Mark Registry
and hence, "water boiler" got split into storage type geysers and
instant type geysers. Accordingly, in Assignment Deed dated 1st
April, 1999, M/s Classic Equipments Pvt. Ltd. could have assigned
instant type geysers to defendant No.4. The defendant cannot take
shield under PR/414 dated 26th September, 1997 which has been
passed on the basis of an incorrect statement.
</p>
<p id="p_145">71.    It is the settled principle that the assignor cannot possibly
transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee. Reliance is
placed on <a href="/doc/1236969/" id="a_1">Thukral Mechanical Works v. P.M. Diesel Pvt. Ltd</a>.
(2009) 2 SCC 768. Even <a href="/doc/1519162/" id="a_2">Section 44</a> of the Act reads as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_18">      "44. Assignability and transmissibility or associated
      trade marks.--Associated trade marks shall be assignable
      and transmissible only as a whole and not separately, but,
      subject to the provisions of this Act, they shall, for all other
      purposes, be deemed to have been registered as separate
      trade marks."
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                              Page 45 of 54</span>
<p id="p_146"> 72.    Thus, it is clear that in relation to the Trade Mark Registration
No. 319955, the said trademark was associated with trademark
197998. Further, <a href="/doc/559180/" id="a_3">Section 44</a> of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 mandates
that the associated trademarks have to be assigned as a whole and
not separately. Thus, in the present case, since the trademarks No.
197998 and 319955 are associated, by virtue of the Deed of
Assignment dated 9th March, 1994, they were assigned together,
which resulted in orders being PR/985 and PR/25 being issued by the
Trade Mark Registry. With regard to the Trade Mark Application No.
398342, it is the plaintiff's submission that the trademark No.
398342 was abandoned and the same was confirmed by the letter
dated 9th July, 1999 issued by the Trade Marks Registry.
</p>
<p id="p_147">73.    The real fact is that the defendant No.4 has no rights in the
mark "JOHNSON" inasmuch as it relates to the electric water heaters
(excluding instant type geysers) and is further corroborated by the
fact that the said defendant had on 2nd March, 2009 filed a fresh
Trade Mark Application bearing No. 1791284 under class 11 for the
stationary storage type electric water heaters amongst other items.
</p>
<p id="p_148">74.    Admittedly, the defendant No.4 was aware of the assignment
made in favour of M/s Vidyut Udyog by M/s Classic Equipments Pvt.
Ltd. in 1994 and the said defendant was also aware of the takeover
of M/s Vidyut Udyog by the plaintiff on 2nd April, 1997 inasmuch as
the said defendant was one of the Directors in the plaintiff-Company
at that point of time. The said defendant had resigned from the
directorship of the plaintiff-Company on 1st October, 1997. Even
after the assignment in favour of the said defendant dated 1 st April,
1999 by which the said defendant is claiming rights for the goods in




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">CS(OS) No.816/2008                                        Page 46 of 54</span>
 question, the said defendant did not take any action against the
plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_149">75.    Pertaining     to   the   issue   No.4,    regarding       the   delay       and
acquiescence, it is the admitted position that the defendant No.4
enjoys rights for the mark "JOHNSON" for various other electric
appliances.     The   sporadic    instances      of   the   use    of   the     mark
"JOHNSON" by the defendant No.4 in relation to the product in
question never came to the knowledge of the plaintiff till December,
2006. Even the advertisement placed by the defendant No.4
pertaining to the product in question is of 2007.
</p>
<p id="p_150">76.    The defendant No.4 has admitted that there are several parties
which are manufacturing "storage type water heaters" for the said
defendant and the defendant No. 4 is being paid royalty for the
same by the defendant No.3 (licensed manufacturer) in India.
</p>
<p id="p_151">77.    In evidence, the defendant No.4 has not been able to bring
any additional evidence or witness to prove that the Assignment
Deeds in question were not properly documented and their terms are
not applicable. One can understand that by virtue of assignment, the
defendant No.4 may have lost the description of goods i.e. electric
geysers however, once the assignment is complete, the documents
cannot be treated as invalid document. The terms are to be read in a
simple manner.
</p>
<p id="p_152">78.    This Court vide order dated 25th March, 2010 granted
injunction to the plaintiff and imposed a cost of Rs.1 lakh on the
defendant No.4. The said order was challenged by the defendant
No.4 in FAO (OS) 461/2010 which has also been dismissed by this
Court vide judgment dated 8th February, 2011. The review petition

 149/2011 preferred by the defendant No.4 against the said order
dated 8th February, 2011 has been dismissed on 23rd March, 2011.
Even the Supreme Court was not inclined to interfere with the said
order dated 8th February, 2011 and dismissed the SLP(C) No.16615-
16/2011 vide its order dated 5th August, 2011.
</p>
<p id="p_153">79.    As far as the issue No.1 is concerned, the Legal Proceeding
Certificate    showing   the   name   of   plaintiff   as   the     subsequent
proprietor has been filed as Mark E. The defendant No.4 has denied
the fact that the said registration is entered in the name of the
plaintiff. On the face of the record, the plaintiff has been able to
discharge the burden of issue No.1. Thus, the same is decided
accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_154">80.    With regard to issue No.2, the defendant No.4 has failed to
discharge its burden, and the same is decided against the defendant
No.4. Issue No.3 is pertaining to infringement. As already held that
the plaintiff is the proprietor of the trademark in relation to goods in
question, the same description of items cannot be permitted to
defendant No.4 otherwise, it would amount to infringement and
passing off. Thus, the plaintiff succeeds in issue No.3 which is
decided against the defendants.
</p>
<p id="p_155">81.    Now, with regard to question of delay, defendants submit that
they have been using the mark in question since the year 2006 and
the present suit was filed after eight years and the plaintiff had the
knowledge about the use, thus there is delay in bringing an action.
Hence, the plaintiff is not entitled to discretionary relief of injunction.
There is no clinching, cogent and clear evidence available on record
to show that the plaintiff was definitely aware about such user.

            bringing action is not sufficient to defeat grant of
            injunction in such cases. The grant of injunction also
            becomes necessary if it prima facie appears that the

            A delay in the matter of seeking an injunction may be
            aground for refusing an injunction in certain

            goods bearing the infringing mark or spurious goods
            would continue to be sold in the market. After a
            number of years when the case is finally disposed of,
            after trial, and the plaintiff succeeds and gets a
            permanent injunction then, possibly, the plaintiff may
            also be compensated by his being awarded damages
            or an account of profits. In that sense the non-grant
            of the interim injunction would not, ultimately,
            prejudice the plaintiff for he may be compensated
            with payment of money but during this period when
            the defendant is allowed to continue to infringe the
            intellectual property it is the consumer or the
            purchaser who alone suffers and who ultimately

            the menace of manufacture, production and sale of
            spurious goods and the blatant violation of intellectual
            property it will be proper for the Court to take into
            consideration the interest of the general public. In
            this regard reference may usefully be made to the
            following observations of McCarthy at page 346, para

<blockquote id="blockquote_22">                     "Some Courts also consider the necessity of

                     infringement cases, "third parties" means the
                     buying public. If the equities are closely
                     balanced, the right of the public not to be

             consistent in holding that if the defendant acts
            fraudulently with the knowledge that he is violating
            the plaintiff s rights then in that case, even if there is
            an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in
            taking action against the defendant, the relief of
            injunction is not denied. The defense of laces or
            inordinate delay is a defense in equity. Inequity both
            the parties mud's come to the Court with clean
            hands. An equitable defense can be put up by a party
            who has acted fairly and honestly. A person who is
            guilty of violating the law or infringing or usurping
            somebody else's right cannot clarify the continued
            misuse of the usurped right. It was observed by
            Romer, J. in the matter of an application brought be
            J. R. Parkington and Co. Ld., (1946) 63 RPC 171 at
            page 181 that "in my judgment, the circumstances
            which attend the adoption of a trade mark in the first
            instance are of considerable importance when one
            comes to consider whether the use of that mark has
            or has not been a honest user. If the user in its
            inception was tainted it would be difficult in most
            cases to purify it subsequently". It was further noted
            by the learned Judge in that case that he could not
            regard the discreditable origin of the user as cleansed
            by the subsequent history. In other words, the
            equitable relief will be afforded only to that party who
            is not guilty of a fraud and whose conduct shows that,
            there had been, on his part, an honest concurrent
            user of the mark in question. If a party, for no
            apparent or a valid reason, adopts, with or without
            modifications, a mark belonging to another, whether
            registered or not, it will be difficult for that party to
            avoid an order of injunction because the Court may
            rightly assume that such adoption of the mark by the
            party was noting honest one. The Court would be
            justified in concluding that the defendant, in such an
            action, wanted to cash in on the plaintiffs name and
            reputation and that was the sole, primary or the real
            motive of the defendant adopting such a mark. Even
            if, in such a case, there may be an inordinate delay
            on the part of the plaintiff in bringing a suit for
            injunction, the application of the plaintiff for an

             interim injunction cannot be dismissed on the ground
            that the defendant has been using the mark for a
            number of years. Dealing with this aspect Harry D.

            when a person passes off his goods as those of
            another he commits the act of such deceit. Similarly
            whenever and wherever a person commits breach of
            a registered trade mark of another he commits a
            recurring act of breach or infringement of such trade
            mark giving a recurring and fresh cause of action at
            each time of such infringement to the party
            aggrieved. It is difficult to agree how in such a case
            when in historical past earlier suit was disposed of as
            technically not maintainable in absence of proper
            relief, for all times to come in future defendant of
            such a suit should be armed with a license to go on
            committing fresh acts of infringement and passing off
            with impunity without being subjected to any legal
            action against such future acts."

<p id="p_162"> 83.    No party can be allowed to use the identical mark in any style
whatsoever. The defendant No.4 has no rights in respect of it with
respect to electric water heaters (excluding instant type geysers).
The exclusive License/Permitted User Agreement dated 27th May,
2006 entered into between defendant Nos.3 and 4 does not even
relate to the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to electric water heaters,
(excluding the instant type geysers). The defendants have no right
over the mark "JOHNSON" in relation to the electric water heaters
(excluding the instant type geysers).

<p id="p_163">84.    Even if there is any delay, the same is not taken in an action
of infringement of trademark as referred above. In trademarks
matter, every sale gives a fresh cause of action, the cause of action
is of recurring nature. Even otherwise the plaintiff is able to explain
the same and this Court is satisfied with the explanation given.

against the defendant.

<p id="p_165">86.    As issues No.1 to 4 are decided in favour of the plaintiff, the
issue No.5 is also decided against the defendants in view of the
findings arrived at in deciding the issues No. 1 to 4 as there was
cause of action in favour of the plaintiff at the time of filing of the
suit. No cogent reason has been assigned by defendant No.4 that
the suit lacks cause of action. The said issue is accordingly decided
against the defendant No.4 who has failed to discharge its burden.

<p id="p_166">87.    With regard to issue No.6, the plaintiff has not been able to
prove the damages strictly as per the law. Even otherwise, the

 exercise its discretion to impose punitive damages in the nature of
relations. The said issue is decided accordingly.
</p>
<p id="p_167">88.    Issue No.7 is about relief. For the reasons mentioned above,
the plaintiff is entitled for decree of permanent injunction in its
favour and against the defendants in terms of prayers (a) &amp; (c) of
the plaint. So far as prayer (b) is concerned, no relief is granted,
however, the plaintiff is entitled for actual costs and counsel's fee.
