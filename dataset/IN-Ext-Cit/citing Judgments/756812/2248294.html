              before the Court, which were not so stated before SDM, with only
              purpose to falsely implicate the accused persons.
         viii.PWs have given contradictory statement regarding dates since
              when deceased and Shivank started residing separately.
         ix. The records were manipulated by IO in connivance with PW-1
              regarding handing over of written statements and bank statements.
              The deceased had family background of depression because her
              parents i.e. PW-1 and PW-2 both had been treated for the problem
              of depression and depression is one of the reasons to commit
              suicide.

              and good conduct of Shivank towards his in-laws. The SMS sent by
              deceased to PW-3 soon before her death do not talk about any kind
              of cruelty related to dowry demand or any other demand. On the
              other hand, DW-1 proved the statement of bank account of
              deceased and accused Shivank, which show that both of them used
              to transfer money to each other's account and that accused Shivank
              had paid for purchases made by deceased using her HSBC credit
              card and other articles. Accused Shivank Jain himself entered into
              witness-box to state these facts on oath.

</p><p id="p_73">    33. I have carefully gone through the record and case-laws. I would refer to
         relevant ratio of case-law, if so required, in my findings.
         Findings :-
</p>
<p id="p_74">    34. In the present case, prosecution has based its charges on the
         allegations of demand for dowry and cruelty upon deceased due to
         non-fulfillment of such demand. The star witnesses of prosecution are
         the family members of deceased from her parent's side. PW-1, PW-2,
         PW-3, PW-6 and PW-18 are the witnesses, who have been produced
         by prosecution to prove the allegations of demand for dowry and
         cruelty upon deceased.
</p>
<p id="p_75">    35. As far as allegations of cruelty are concerned, same are based upon
         alleged information given by deceased to PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3.
         However, by virtue of <a href="/doc/1959734/" id="a_43">Section 32</a> of Evidence Act, they are admissible
         in evidence.
</p>
<p id="p_76">    36. The term dowry has been defined in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_44">Section 2</a> of Dowry Prohibition Act
         and the same has been explained by Supreme Court in S. Gopal
         Reddy Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1996 SC 2184, in the
         following terms
                    "property or valuable security so as to constitute dowry
                    withing the meaning of the Act must, therefore, be given or
                    demanded as consideration for the marriage."
</p>
<p id="p_77">    37. Therefore, the term 'consideration' assumes importance because if any
         article is not given or demanded as a consideration for the marriage,

         then it would not be covered within definition of dowry.
</p><p id="p_78">    38. <a href="/doc/756812/" id="a_45">In Appasaheb &amp; Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, 2007 (1) Crimes 110
         (SC), Supreme Court has held as under :-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_11">                    "9. In view of the aforesaid definition of the word "dowry"
                    any property or valuable security should be given or
                    agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before
                    or any time after the marriage and in connection with the
                    marriage of the said parties. Therefore, the giving or
                    taking of property or valuable security must have some
                    connection with the marriage of the parties and a
                    correlation between the giving or taking of property or
                    valuable security with the marriage of the parties is
                    essential. Being a penal provision it has to be strictly
                    construed. Dowry is a fairly well known social custom or
                    practice in India. It is well settled principle of interpretation
                    of Statute that if the Act is passed with reference to a
                    particular trade, business or transaction and words are
                    used which everybody conversant with that trade,
                    business or transaction knows or understands to have a
                    particular meaning in it, then the words are to be
                    construed as having that particular meaning. A demand
                    for money on account of some financial stringency or for
                    meeting some urgent domestic expenses or for
                    purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for
                    dowry as the said word is normally understood. The
                    evidence adduced by the prosecution does not, therefore,
                    show that any demand for "dowry" as defined in <a href="/doc/1249134/" id="a_46">Section 2</a>
                    of the Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants
                    as what was allegedly asked for was some money for
                    meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure.
                    Since an essential ingredient of <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_47">Section 304-B</a> IPC viz.
                    Demand for dowry is not established the conviction of the
                    appellants cannot be sustained."

         dowry by any of the accused persons from them. The only allegation
         was made that deceased Anshu after marriage complained that her
         husband (Shivank) used to beat her and used to demand dowry etc.
         They made further allegations that parents-in-law and brother-in-law
         also used to torture her.
</p>
<p id="p_80">    40. PW-1 and PW-2 did not refer to a single instance of demand of dowry
         or cruelty in their initial statements. Though, later on, after passage of
         some time they made elaborative statement before IO and thereafter
         before the Court. Had there been actual instances of demand made by
         accused persons before and after social marriage taken place on
         12.12.2009, then in the normal course of action, these witnesses must
         would have mentioned at least some of such instances before SDM
         and IO at the initial stage itself.
</p>
<p id="p_81">    41. There is much possibility of making elaborate allegations later on out of
         vengeance, as an after thought story, after due deliberation with all
         family members. The elder son-in-law of PW-1 and PW-2 is an
         advocate and they had means to get idea as to what kind of allegations
         are required to be made to implicate all accused in a criminal case.
</p>
<p id="p_82">    42. In view of such possibility being there, it is very necessary for this Court
         to seek corroboration of all such facts, which have been testified before
         the Court in order to make allegations of demand of dowry and cruelty.
</p>
<p id="p_83">    43. The evidence of inimical relatives of deceased has to be evaluated
         carefully as observed by Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/664488/" id="a_49">Sunil Kumar v. State of

         taken on superdari by him vide superdarinama Ex.PW-1/I and
         Ex.PW-1/J. Accused Shivank left Zen car at the house of PW-1, a day
         prior to death of Anshu (deceased). In his cross-examination, he
         admitted that he saw injury on the back of dead body but did not tell
         anything to police or doctor. He again said that he told this fact to
         police at the time of receiving dead body (Not probable for a father to
         see naked back of her daughter's dead body. Nowhere stated
         earlier. An example of making all sorts of improvements.) He
         admitted the suggestions that accused Shivank paid the dues of credit
         card of Anshu (deceased), but deposed that he took Rs.5000/- from
         PW-3, Rs.3000/- from Swati and Rs.5000/- from him in cash, in order to
         make such deposit. (Why should he take such amount to deposit in
         the account of Anshu. Anshu could have taken from PW-1 and
         others. If Shivank was greedy then why he would deposit amount
         in the account of Anshu, he would use it for himself or deposit in
         his account.) PW-1 paid in cash to Shivank for telebills, computer bills,
         gas bills and others (Not probable and no proof. Rather appears to
         be example of artificial allegations to implicate.) PW-1 further
         admitted in his cross-examination that house hold articles viz. washing
         machine, fridge, mixi were purchased through credit card of Anshu, but
         was not aware if dues of credit card were cleared by Shivank.
         (contradictory to his claim that such articles were demanded as
         dowry and he fulfilled such demand.) He further admitted the
         suggestion that he did not pay for credit card of Anshu. Articles seized

         instance. (Were all articles belonging to PW-1, so as to clam their
         release on superdari?). He admitted that his elder son-in-law was a
         lawyer. (possibility of getting well crafted statement to allege, as
         to satisfy the ingredients of offences.) He was not acquainted with
         Jain family prior to January, 2009. However, his elder daughter Kavita
         (PW-3) was married on 20 or 21.05.2008 and marriage card
         Ex.PW-1/DF-9 was given to Jain family. He deposed that this card may
         be having handwriting of deceased (Anshu). PW-1 denied knowledge
         that Jain family attended marriage of Kavita. PW-1 admitted the
         suggestion that list of dowry articles PW-1/P-10 did not have the date
         and amount of Rs.40,000/- allegedly given on 23.09.2009 was not
         mentioned. (List itself is doubtful as it might be prepared as an
         after thought list. Omission of Rs.40,000/- as dowry demanded by
         accused P.K. Jain, shows that such allegation was added
         probably after going through all records of withdrawal from
         account, to support the allegation). (PW-1 recorded purpose of
         withdrawal of Rs.40,000/-, in the leaf of cheque book, but did not
         produce the same.) PW-1 had given Tata Indigo car to PW-3 in her
         marriage and he loved both daughters. (Thus, he must would have
         liked to gift a car to Anshu as well. No Dowry.) Anshu (deceased)

         persons mean all, how is it possible? Apparently to drag all, such
         generalized allegations were made.) She further deposed that on
         23.09.2009, they demanded payment on the pretext of urgent work
         (not as consideration for marriage). She refused to tell expenditure
         in the marriage of PW-3 and said that Rs.10-12 lac were spent in
         Anshu's marriage. (No proof of income or source of money.
         Refusal to answer about PW-3 shows that she did not come to
         depose fairly, but was in aggressive set of mind to speak as per
         her own wish.) Later on, she denied that Rs.15-20 lac were spent in
         the marriage of PW-3 (Though PW-1 said so.) She further alleged that
         on 12.12.2009, during rituals of marriage, accused P.K. Jain demanded
         Rs.5 lac from Dr. Ram Babu Singh (PW-6) and she talked about it with
         family members. But, PW-2 refused to disclose the name of such family
         members. (Why should not P.K. Jain demand from PW-1 instead of
         Dr. Ram Babu Singh. No sense to suppress such demand from
         PW-1, PW-1 did not tell such facts.).

         10,000/- but PW-3 had Rs.5000/- and she gave it to her at her office.
         (No proof of visit to her office. PW-1 and PW-2 said Rs.5000/-
         given to Shivank.) Remaining Rs.5000/- was taken on 09.01.2010 by
         Shivank from Swati. (No proof. Swati did not appear as witness.) In
         2007 Shivank opened a bank account in the name of Anshu at Kotak
         Securities and got his name as nominee. (Contradicts assertion of
         PW-1 and PW-2 that they did not know Jains prior to January,
         2009 or Anshu did not have relation with Shivank since long.) She
         further deposed that list of stridhan Ex.PW-1/P-10 was prepared by her
         after death of Anshu, on the basis of documents such as receipts and
         memory. The demand of Rs.5 lac was made in evening of the day of
         marriage and before Fera. This demand was made in tent outside her
         house and all the family members and relatives were present viz.
         parents, Tauji and Fufaji. The quarrel over this issue continued for one
         hour. (PW-1 did not talk about such demand made in his presence.
         PW-2 deposed that accused P.K. Jain demanded Rs.5 lac from
         PW-6 and she talked about this with family members. Thus,
         apparently contradictory situation appears on record.) She
         claimed that he received call on 17.01.2010 from bank for verification
         of loan applied by Anshu, and she disclosed this fact before SDM and
         police. However, it was not so disclosed in her statement dated

         that neither she gave Rs.5,000/- to Shivank nor Swati gave Rs.5,000/-
         to Shivank in her presence. (She alleged that Shivank got opened
         an account in Kotak Security in the name of Anshu, without even
         knowing the type of such account or other information. There is
         no proof that Shivank had withdrawn Rs.3 lac from account of

         contradictory to factual matrix presented by PW-2, PW-3 and
         PW-6.) Anshu came after 2-3 days and he was also present at the

         of Rs.5 lac and they had threatened for dire consequences. On
         31.12.2009, he had given retirement party and Shivank and Anshu also

         being patient of depression. In the argument, it was pointed out that a
         sting operation had taken place to show that documents were prepared
         in IHBAS even without treatment of any patient. A CD of such sting
         operation was also referred to by the complainant. However, a duly
         proved document cannot be substituted with unsubstantiated story of
         sting operation. In the examination of PW-10, PW-11 and PW-22 no
         such material/inconsistency has been extracted by the prosecution,
         which could cast any doubt over the record, which were produced by
         PW-17. I have already mentioned that the records produced by PW-17
         were not challenged by either prosecution or defence. Hence, there is
         no reason for me to disbelieve such piece of evidence.

         thereafter SI Mukesh prepared scaled site plan. Thus, police/IO was
         well aware of keys of this premises, still in the recovery proceedings
         they show that lock was broken and a duplicate key was prepared, as
         no one had keys with them. IO had shown recovery of dowry articles at
         the instance of accused, though he had admittedly visited this property
         with Shivank on 26.01.2010 itself, hence, there was no discovery of

         with his parents-in-law i.e. PW-1 and PW-2. If accused persons
         including Shivank were harassing her after 12.12.2009 and if Anshu

</pre><p id="p_99">    57.Another aspect of this case is that as per PW-1 and PW-2, the talk of
         marriage had taken place in February 2009 and it is admitted fact that
         a court marriage took place on 18.05.2009. If accused persons had an
         inclination to demand dowry in this marriage as consideration for this
         marriage, then accused Pramod and Sushma would have made such
         demand at initial stage of talk itself i.e. in February 2009. However,
         there is no allegation that they made such demand in February 2009 or
         prior to court marriage in May 2009. PW-1 and PW-2 deposed that
         accused persons told them not to disclose court marriage of Shivank
         and Anshu to anyone. However, I do not find such statement to be
         probable and true, because it is well established on the record that it
         was a love marriage and Shivank and Anshu knew each other for quiet
         some time. (If registration of marriage was done only for clubbing
         the salary of deceased with Salary of accused's family, then
         where is any such record obtained by IO to show that P.K. Jain
         had shown a particular income clubbing salary of Anshu.) PW-1
         and PW-2 tried to impress that they did not know anyone in Jain family
         but same is belied by acknowledgment of PW-3 that there had been
         long affair between the two within their knowledge and Shivank
         attended her marriage as well. Hence, accused Pramod and Sushma
         did not gain anything by keeping the court marriage as secret. In that
         situation, they could not have expected anything as consideration of
         this marriage, after court marriage taking place in May 2009. All of
         sudden, making demands for dowry since 23.09.2009 by accused
         Pramod and later on by all accused, does not sound to be a probable

         and natural course of action. Normally, in love marriage parents while
         agreeing for such relationship, know that they are not in position to
         make any demand as consideration for marriage, for simple reason
         that their son appears to be more interested in bonding of marriage
         rather than any demand for materialistic article.
</p><p id="p_100">    58. In this case, PW-1 and PW-2 deposed as if they spent Rs.10 to 12 lac
         in the social marriage taken place on 12.12.2009. PW-1 boasted that
         he fulfilled all demands of accused Pramod Jain. He went on to say
         that accused Pramod demanded Zen Estilo Car, double door fridge,
         LCD TV, automatic washing machine, almirah, sofa, double bed and
         some jewelery etc. However, in his cross-examination, he admitted that
         these articles were purchased through credit card of Anshu and
         Shivank paid the dues of her credit card.
</p><p id="p_101">    59. Thus, it is well apparent that the allegations of demand for various
         articles were artificial, which were never fulfilled by PW-1. Rather
         uncontroverted testimony of DW-2 that he paid for credit card of
         deceased Anshu, shows that the article shown as dowry articles were
         actually purchased by this couple and financial burden of the same was
         borne by Shivank. The list of dowry articles with sign of PW-1 shows
         that PW-1 claimed all articles (valuable) to be dowry articles, though
         they were not.

         visit their house in relation to some urgent work. PW-2 said that Anshu
         came at 05:30/06:00 AM. However, on that day Anshu is shown to have
         entered her office at 06:00 AM. The exact distance between GTB
         Enclave and Okhla Phase-III is not established on the record, still by
         virtue of being resident of Delhi, one can say that they are far apart and
         it does not appear probable that having visited her parents at GTB
         Enclave and having talk with them at around 05:30 AM, Anshu could
         reach and enter her office at Okhla Phase-III at 06:00 AM. Even
         otherwise, it does not make any sense that before going to her office,
         Anshu would personally visit her parent's house to give a message,
         which could have been given through telephonic talk as well.
</p><p id="p_103">    61.DW-4 produced an official record from his department i.e. attendance
         register for 23.09.2009 and case diary of case bearing no.
         CB-124/2009, PS Indirapuram. According to this record, accused P.K.
         Jain was not present in Delhi on 23.09.2009. The prosecution
         challenged these records on the grounds that the attendance register
         was not signed by accused in the presence of this witness, nor it bears
         attesting signature of the Section Officer. The case diaries were also
         not prepared by accused P.K. Jain in the presence of this witness.
         However, the prosecution did not raise any such plea which could raise
         any doubt in respect of genuineness of official record. It is not
         necessary that the witness who produced the official record would be
         also witness to the execution and preparation of such record. If there is
         no challenge to the fact that such record did exist in the department,
         then the court cannot ignore the official records merely on the grounds

         that they were not prepared in the presence of concerned witness. It is
         difficult to assume that such record would be prepared on a date out of
         some manipulative conspiracy, when this case had not even come into
         existence. It is duty of the prosecution to prove the allegations beyond
         reasonable doubt and the defence is not burdened with such duty. The
         defence discharges its onus by simply raising an element of doubt into
         the case of the prosecution. In my considered opinion, the record
         produced by DW-1 discharges such onus of defence to raise a doubt
         over the version of prosecution regarding presence of accused Pramod
         Kumar Jain in Delhi, in order to make demand of an amount and in
         order to receive the same from PW-1 on 23.09.2009.

         statement under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_57">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. of PW-6. PW-6 had denied

         examination that this number belonged to grand daughter of his elder
         brother, namely Ms. Sapna. Later on, he gave description of Ms. Sapna
         as his niece, which shows that this witness did not mind changing his
         versions. Even otherwise, if this number was not being used by this
         witness, then it did not make any sense for him to mention this number
         before IO during his examination under <a href="/doc/447673/" id="a_58">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. Rather
         furnishing this number to IO prima facie shows that this number was

         worth consideration that witness did not come forward with statement

         regarding any other mobile number, to say that he had been using a
         different mobile number. Therefore, once again a dent is created in the
         version of this witness as well as credibility of allegations made by this
         witness because the CDR of this number shows that on 18.01.2010,
         this number was being used in U.P. In that situation, this witness cannot
         be assumed to be present in Delhi. Once again, I would reiterate that it
         was duty of the prosecution to establish all facts relied upon, in order to
         make an allegation against the accused, beyond reasonable doubts.

         would show that he did not have so much money to spend Rs.10-12 lac

         duty of prosecution to establish that PW-1 had such source of finance
         to meet expenses of social marriage along with demands made by
         accused Pramod. PW-1 paid for Car and withdrew cash amount on

         withdrawn by PW-1 from 08.04.2009 to 25.01.2010 from account
         number 350. Similarly, amount of Rs. 1,62,400/- was withdrawn by
         PW-1 in his own name in the period from 02.04.2009 to 25.01.2010
         from account no.823. The other withdrawals and payment during
         aforesaid period are apparently meant for some other purposes.
</p><p id="p_108">    66.Now, it has to be seen that whether the amounts, claimed by PW-1 and
         PW-2 to be paid to accused persons on different dates either on
         account of demand made by accused persons or on account of
         purchases made by accused persons on the expenses of PW-1, could
         be reasonably expected to have been made. PW-1 claimed that he
         paid Rs.40,000/- to P.K. Jain on 23.09.2009, Rs.2 lac to T.R. Sawhni
         Motors on 10.11.2009 and Rs.1,64,000/- to T.R. Sawhni Motors, Rs.
         74,000/- to Shivank and Anshu on 08.11.2009, Rs.1,50,000/- to P.K.
         Jain on 06.12.2009 and Rs.93,000/- on next date i.e. probably on
         07.12.2009, Rs.28050/- and Rs.24250/- after two days to the accused
         persons. Thus, PW-1 allegedly paid Rs.7,73,300/- including the
         consideration amount of new Zen Car. If the amount paid for new car is
         deducted, then an amount of Rs.4,09,300/- was paid in cash to the
         accused persons. It has to be seen that a total amount of Rs.6,37,400/-
         was withdrawn by PW-1 from his two accounts in the period starting
         from 08.04.2009. Obviously, he would be incurring his own expenses
         and expenses of his family in such a long period. He must have incurrd
         expenses of marriage and other ceremonies. In that situation, it does
         not seem to be probable that so much of cash amount was paid by
         PW-1 to the accused persons.</p><pre id="pre_8">

</pre><p id="p_109">    67.Therefore, once again I find that the allegations of demand and
         payments made in pursuance of same, are not convincingly established
         on the record. Rather, I find that PW-1 and his family members have
         wrongly claimed the articles lying in the tenanted premises of accused
         Shivank as dowry articles. These articles were taken by PW-1 on
         superdari, however, after death of Anshu, it would be her husband
         Shivank as rightful claimant of all these articles, which were seized
         from D-121, GTB Enclave, Delhi and handed over to PW-1.
</p><p id="p_110">    68. Even the Zen Car, which was though purchased by PW-1, cannot be
         claimed back by him because it was purchased in the name of Anshu
         and after death of Anshu, all her belongings and other properties in her
         name would be inherited by her husband i.e. Shivank.
         Conclusions :-
</p><p id="p_111">    69. Thus, on the basis of my forgoing discussion, I find that it is not proved
         on the record that any article was demanded by accused persons in
         consideration to marriage nor is it proved that PW-1 was coerced to
         deliver any property to the accused persons in consideration to the
         marriage. Therefore, the charge under <a href="/doc/751411/" id="a_59">Section 3</a>/<a href="/doc/1023340/" id="a_60">4</a> of Dowry Prohibition
         Act fails.
</p><p id="p_112">    70.The charge was also framed against accused Sushma Jain for offence
         under <a href="/doc/988620/" id="a_61">Section 406</a> IPC, however, I find that the prosecution evidence is
         totally silent in respect of all ingredients required to be proved in
         support of such charge. It was duty of the prosecution to prove the
         articles belonging to the deceased Anshu were entrusted by her to
         Sushma Jain. It was also required to be proved that Sushma Jain

         converted those articles to her own use in dishonest manner. However,
         the evidence of prosecution itself shows that the alleged dowry articles,
         which have been concluded by me not to be dowry articles, were
         seized from the tenanted premises of the deceased. Seizure memo
         shows that even the jewelleries, which were seized by the police, were
         lying in the tenanted premises, where deceased had been residing
         prior to her death. Most importantly, it is not the case of prosecution
         that they recovered any article from the possession of accused
         Sushma Jain, if it was converted by her and which belonged to
         deceased. In these circumstances, this charge against accused
         Sushma Jain fails.
</p><p id="p_113">    71.I also find that prosecution has failed to prove any instance of cruelty
         i.e. the alleged instance of beating or other kind of harassment to the
         deceased Anshu. The allegations made by PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-6
         and PW-18 are not free of suspicion. In absence of strong proof, there
         cannot be any assumption that there was cruelty related with demand
         of dowry or any unlawful demand. Such assumption is even otherwise,
         not possible to be raised because there was no demand for dowry. In
         these circumstances, charge for offence under <a href="/doc/653797/" id="a_62">Section 304-B</a> IPC fails.
</p><p id="p_114">    72.It is only a formality to be declared that prosecution did not bring any
         evidence to even give rise to suspicion of a case of offence under
         <a href="/doc/1560742/" id="a_63">Section 302</a> IPC.
</p><p id="p_115">    73.I also find that the prosecution has not proved the case under <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_64">Section
         498-A</a> IPC as well, because it is not established on the record that any
         of the accused persons willfully conducted in such manner, which was

         likely to drive deceased Anshu to commit suicide or to cause any other
         injury to herself. The cruelty, which is required to be committed to
         attract <a href="/doc/538436/" id="a_65">Section 498-A</a> IPC has been explained by Delhi High Court in
         the case of Sanjeev (supra). In the present case, such cruelty is not
         proved nor any other kind of harassment has been proved, which could
         be related to any unlawful demand for any property.
