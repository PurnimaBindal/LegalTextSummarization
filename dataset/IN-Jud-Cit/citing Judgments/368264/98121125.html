<p id="p_3">   3.     As per the plaintiff, company Modi Mundi Pharma Pvt. Ltd., was

   established in the year 1990 and is engaged in the manufacturing,

    development and marketing of high quality pharmaceutical formulations.

   The plaintiff is the proprietor of trademark bearing CONTIN and also

   obtained its registration under No. 518594 in Class 5 in its favour on 19 th

   October, 1989 in respect of pharmaceutical preparations. The plaintiff is

   also the proprietor of other trademarks in the series containing CONTIN

   as   a    common     feature   including    CONTINUS,        DILCONTIN,

   NITROCONTIN,           INDICONTIN,         ARCONTIN,          BUCONTIN,

   CORNUCONTIN, DIUCONTIN-K, FECONTIN-F etc.                       The word

   CONTIN is the common feature of these trademarks which can be

   identified as CONTIN family/series of trademarks. The plaintiff has

   filed a list of trademarks that form the family of CONTIN trademarks

   belonging to the plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_4">   4.       The plaintiff avers that it has widely advertised its products

   under the CONTIN family/series of trademarks and also distributed

   literature among the medical preparation. The plaintiff submits the break

   up of its sales turnover in respect of the products bearing the trademark

   CONTIN as the suffix and/or prefix and also its annual advertisement

   expenses which amount Rs. 8396 lac and Rs. 712 lac respectively for the

   year 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_5">   5.       The plaintiff by virtue of long, continuous and extensive user of

   the trademark bearing CONTIN as the suffix and/or prefix through India

   alleged to acquire tremendous goodwill and reputation in the market.

   Therefore, the plaintiff claims to be entitled to the exclusive use of the

   CONTIN       family/series of marks with respect to the pharmaceutical

   products.    It is alleged that the use of the trademark CONTIN

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">CS (OS) No. 2354/2007                                             Page 3 of 8</span>
    independently or as a suffix and/or prefix by any third party would

   amount to infringement of trademark registration No. 518594 in class 5.

</p><p id="p_6">   6.      The plaintiff alleges that in the month of April, 2007

   representatives of the plaintiff came across a pharmaceutical product

   bearing the name NEUROCONTIN-800 that was being manufactured

   and marketed by the defendants. As per the plaintiff, the defendant no. 1

   is operating as Matrix Formulations, 23, N.B. Complex, Vikroli East,

   Mumbai and defendant no. 2 is operating as M/s. Essel Pharma N.H. 22,

   Kather Bypass, Solan, Himachal Pradesh.
</p>
<p id="p_7">   7.      Realising the use of the trademark CONTIN by the defendants, a

   legal notice was sent by the plaintiff to the defendants on 12 th April,

   2007 to cease and desist from using the trademark CONTIN on its

   product name of NEUROCONTIN-800.
</p>
<p id="p_8">   8.      The plaintiff avers that the use of the word CONTIN by the

   defendants in their name NEUROCONTIN-800 amount to infringement

   of trademark registration number 518594 in class 5 which is registered in

   favour of the plaintiff. Further, the use of the trademark CONTIN by the

   defendants in their name NEUROCONTIN-800 would lead the

   consumer, being a person name of reasonable intelligence and imperfect

   recollection, to believe that the same is associated with the large range of

   pharmaceutical products being manufactured and marketed by the

   plaintiff which bear the trademark CONTIN either as their suffix and/or

   prefix and that it forms part of the plaintiff's family of marks. The

   plaintiff contends that the conduct of the defendants leads to passing off

   their products as that of the plaintiff and amounts to riding upon the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS (OS) No. 2354/2007                                             Page 4 of 8</span>
    goodwill and reputation earned by the plaintiff in the CONTIN

   family/series of marks. It will also cause confusion and deception in the

   minds of the general public about a connection or affiliation of the

   defendants' products with that of the plaintiff's product.

</p><p id="p_9">   9.      The plaintiff has produced the evidence by way of affidavit of

   Mr. Rajiv Bahl, duly constituted attorney of the plaintiff company. In his

   affidavit, Mr. Bahl has reaffirmed the statements made in the plaint.

   Copy of the Registration Certificate for the trademark CONTIN bearing

   registration No. 518594 along with renewal certificate was proved as Ex.

   PW-1/5.     The plaintiff has also filed copies of the Registration

   Certificate of the trademarks in favour of the plaintiff containing the

   CONTIN family/series which are exhibited collectively as Ex. PW1/8.

   The sample invoices of the products sold under the CONTIN

   family/series of marks by the plaintiff since the year 1993 and the

   statements showing the sales and advertisement figures of the plaintiff

   company are proved as Ex. PW1/9 and Ex. PW1/10 respectively. The

   plaintiff has established the invoice showing the purchase of the

   defendants' products by Ex. PW1/13.
</p>
<p id="p_10">   10.     Copy of the legal notice sent to the defendants was also proved

   on record as Ex. PW-1/14. The letter sent by defendant no. 2 on 20 th

   December, 2007 in reply to the letter of the plaintiff was marked as Ex.

   PW-1/16. In this letter the defendant no. 2 affirmed the plaintiff that it

   will not produce any batch after the present batch of NEUROCONTIN-

   800 and will discontinue this brand strictly.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS (OS) No. 2354/2007                                           Page 5 of 8</span>
</p><p id="p_12">    11.    I have heard learned counsel for the plaintiff and have also gone

   through the relevant pleadings and documents on record. It is clear that

   the plaintiff since 1990 has been manufacturing pharmaceutical

   formulations and acquired tremendous reputation in the medical trade

   and also amongst the public at large through large scale advertisement

   campaign and extensive sale. The registered trademark CONTIN has

   become a distinctive mark in the market within the meaning of Section 9

   of the Trademarks Act, 1999.
</p>
<p id="p_13">   12.    It is also established by the plaintiff that the use of the mark

   CONTIN by the defendants would cause confusion and deception in the

   mind of the general public which will cause irreparable damage to the

   goodwill of the plaintiff company.
</p>
<p id="p_14">   13.    The defendant no. 2 vide its letter dated 20 th December, 2007

   exhibited as Ex. PW-1/16 admitted that they have been using the mark

   NEUROCONTIN-800 and will discontinue its use. Furthermore, the

   plaintiff has also been able to demonstrate that the defendant no. 1 is

   engaged in the sale of NEUROCONTIN-800 by filing the invoice

   showing the purchase of defendant's product and its present carton and

   packaging bearing the trademark NEUROCONTIN-800.

</p><p id="p_15">   14.    The learned counsel for the plaintiff relied upon the case of

   Cadilla Health Care Ltd. V. Cadila Pharmaceutical Ltd. AIR 2001

   SC 1952 and <a href="/doc/1299452/" id="a_2">Laxmikant V. Patel V. Chetanbhat Shah &amp; Anr</a>. AIR

   2002 SC 275.
</p>
<p id="p_16">   15.    In my view in the above circumstances, the continuous use of

   trademark NEUROCONTIN-800 by the defendants would tarnish,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">CS (OS) No. 2354/2007                                          Page 6 of 8</span>
    degrade or dilute the distinctive trademark of the plaintiff and its

   reputation. It is likely to deceive or cause confusion in the minds of the

   general public as the trademark of the defendant resembles that of the

   plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_17">   16.      In the case of <a href="/doc/368264/" id="a_3">Amritdhara Pharmacy vs. Satyadeo Gupta</a>;

   AIR 1963 SC 449, it was held that the question whether a trade name is

   likely to deceive or cause confusion by its resemblance to another mark

   already registered is a matter of first impression and one for decision in

   each case and has to be decided by taking an overall view of all the

   circumstances. The standard of comparison to be adopted in judging the

   resemblance is from the point of view of a man of average intelligence

   and imperfect recollection. It was held further that the two names as a

   whole should be considered for comparison and not merely the

   component words thereof separately.
</p>
<p id="p_18">   17.      The acts of the defendants also amounts to passing off as

   representation by the defendants by the name NEUROCONTIN-800 in

   the course of trade to prospective customers might lead to the belief that

   the products of its manufacture belong to or are associated with the

   plaintiff. As a result, the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs claimed in para

   22(a) and (b) of the plaint.
</p>
<p id="p_19">   18.      As regards the question of damages, the plaintiff has claimed

   damages of Rs. 20,05,000/- as the estimated loss for sales as also the loss

   of reputation and goodwill owning to the illegal activities of the

   defendants.    But the same have not been proved by the plaintiff,

   therefore, the said relief cannot be granted.

</p><p id="p_21">    19.     Since the evidence of the plaintiff has gone unrebutted and

   of the plaintiff is thus decreed in terms of prayer made in para 22(a), (b)

   and (c) of the plaint. The plaintiff is also entitled to costs. The suit is
