S. RAVINDRA BHAT, J.
</p>
<p id="p_7">1.      I have had the benefit of reading the detailed and elaborate reasoning of

my learned brother judge, Dipankar Datta, J. While I concur with the

conclusions and relief granted to the appellant, I wish to record a few

observations, by way of abundant caution, on the larger question of reservations

in promotions for any class of citizens other than those covered by <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_1">Article 16(4-

A)</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_8">
</p><p id="p_9">I.      HISTORY OF RESERVATIONS IN PROMOTIONS
</p><p id="p_10">2.      The question of reservations in promotions has a chequered history. In

General Manager, S. Rly. v. Rangachari1, a constitution bench in a 3:2 decision

held that reservations in promotions were permissible. They were not merely

restricted to initial appointments, but also selected posts subsequently. 2 This was

a decision rendered during the era when this court’s understanding of Articles

15(4) and 16(4) was that such provisions were exceptions to the rule under

Articles 15(1) and 16(1). However, this interpretation underwent a change 3, as

elucidated in State of Kerala v N.M. Thomas4, wherein K.K. Mathew, J. opined:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">          “If equality of opportunity guaranteed under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_2">Article 16 (1)</a> means effective
          material equality, then <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_3">Article 16 (4)</a> is not an exception to <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_4">Article 16 (1).</a> It
          is only an emphatic way of putting the extent to which equality of
          opportunity could be carried viz., even up to the point of making
          reservation”.5

In Indra Sawhney v Union of India6, a nine-judge constitution bench, equipped

with this interpretation, revisited the question of reservations in promotions.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_12">Question No. 7 was unambiguously cast: “Whether <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_5">Article 16</a> permits

reservations being provided in the matter of promotions?” Eight out of nine

justices considered the issue, and held that the view expressed in Rangachari

(supra) was erroneous, and that reservations in promotions were impermissible

under <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_6">Article 16.</a>

          consequence of holding that reservation can be provided even in the matter
          of promotion. While it is certainly just to say that a handicap should be
          given to backward class of citizens at the stage of initial appointment, it
          would be a serious and unacceptable inroad into the rule of equality of
          opportunity to say that such a handicap should be provided at every stage of
          promotion throughout their career. That would mean creation of a
          permanent separate category apart from the mainstream — a vertical
          division of the administrative apparatus. The members of reserved

    categories need not have to compete with others but only among themselves.
    There would be no will to work, compete and excel among them. Whether
    they work or not, they tend to think, their promotion is assured. This in turn
    is bound to generate a feeling of despondence and ‘heart-burning’ among
    open competition members. All this is bound to affect the efficiency of
    administration. Putting the members of backward classes on a fast-track
    would necessarily result in leap-frogging and the deleterious effects of
    “leap-frogging” need no illustration at our hands. At the initial stage of
    recruitment reservation can be made in favour of backward class of citizens
    but once they enter the service, efficiency of administration demands that
    these members too compete with others and earn promotion like all others;
    no further distinction can be made thereafter with reference to their “birth-
    mark”, as one of the learned Judges of this Court has said in another
    connection. They are expected to operate on equal footing with others.
    Crutches cannot be provided throughout one&#x27;s career. That would not be in
    the interest of efficiency of administration nor in the larger interest of the
    nation. It is wrong to think that by holding so, we are confining the
    backward class of citizens to the lowest cadres. It is well-known that direct
    recruitment takes place at several higher levels of administration and not
    merely at the level of Class IV and Class III. Direct recruitment is provided
    even at the level of All India Services. Direct recruitment is provided at the
    level of District Judges, to give an example nearer home. It may also be
    noted that during the debates in the Constituent Assembly, none referred to
    reservation in promotions; it does not appear to have been within their
    contemplation.

</p><p id="p_18">    831. We must also make it clear that it would not be impermissible for the
    State to extend concessions and relaxations to members of reserved
    categories in the matter of promotion without compromising the efficiency
    of the administration. The relaxation concerned in Thomas [(1976) 2 SCC
    310, 380 : 1976 SCC (L&amp;S) 227 : (1976) 1 SCR 906] and the concessions
    namely carrying forward of vacancies and provisions for in-service
    coaching/training in Karamchari Sangh [(1981) 1 SCC 246, 289 : 1981
    SCC (L&amp;S) 50 : (1981) 2 SCR 185, 234] are instances of such concessions
    and relaxations. However, it would not be permissible to prescribe lower
    qualifying marks or a lesser level of evaluation for the members of reserved
    categories since that would compromise the efficiency of administration. We
    reiterate that while it may be permissible to prescribe a reasonably lesser
    qualifying marks or evaluation for the OBCs, SCs and STs — consistent
    with the efficiency of administration and the nature of duties attaching to
    the office concerned — in the matter of direct recruitment, such a course
    would not be permissible in the matter of promotions for the reasons
    recorded hereinabove.”

    this Court to which I was a party has taken a view that once candidates
    even from reserved communities are allocated and appointed to a Service
    based on their ranks and performance and brought under the one and same
    stream of category, then they too have to be treated on par with all other
    selected candidates and there cannot be any question of preferential
    treatment at that stage on the ground that they belong to reserved
    community though they may be entitled for all other statutory benefits such
    as the relaxation of age, the reservation etc. Reservation referred to in that
    context is referable to the reservation at the initial stage or the entry point
    as could be gathered from that judgment.”

    “376. The reservation permissible under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_12">Article 16(4)</a> can only be “in
    favour of any backward class of citizens” and not for individuals. <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_13">Article
    16(1)</a> guarantees a right to an individual citizen whereas <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_14">Article 16(4)</a>
    permits protective discrimination in favour of a class. It is, therefore,
    mandatory that the opportunity to compete for the reserve posts has to be
    given to a class and not to the individuals. When direct recruitment to a
    service is made the ‘backward class’ as a whole is given an opportunity to
    be considered for the reserve posts. Every member of the said class has a
    right to compete. But that is not true of the process of promotion. The
    backward class as a collectivity is nowhere in the picture; only the
    individuals, who have already entered the service against reserve posts, are
    considered. In the higher echelons of State services — cadre strength being
    small — there may be very few or even a single ‘backward class’ candidate
    to be considered for promotion to the reserve post. An individual citizen&#x27;s

   right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_15">Article 16(1)</a> can only be curtailed by providing
   reservations for a ‘backward class’ and not for backward individuals. The
   promotional posts are not offered to the backward class. Only the
   individuals are benefited. The object, context and the plain language of
   <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_16">Article 16(4)</a> make it clear that the job reservation can be done only in the
   direct recruitment and not when the higher posts are filled by way of
   promotion.”

e. PB Sawant, J

   “540. However, if it becomes necessary to answer the question, it will have
   to be held that the reservations both under Articles 16(1) and 16(4) should
   be confined only to initial appointments. Except in the decision
   in Rangachari [(1962) 2 SCR 586 : AIR 1962 SC 36] there was no other
   occasion for this Court to deliberate upon this question. In that decision, the
   Constitution Bench by a majority of three took the view that the reservations
   under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_17">Article 16(4)</a> would also extend to the promotions on the ground that
   Articles 16(1) and 16(2) are intended to give effect to Articles 14 and 15(1).
</blockquote><p id="p_19">   Hence <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_18">Article 16(1)</a> should be construed in a broad and general, and not
   pedantic and technical way. So construed, “matters relating to
   employment” cannot mean merely matters prior to the act of appointment
   nor can ‘appointment to any office’ mean merely the initial appointment but
   must also include all matters relating to the employment, that are either
   incidental to such employment or form part of its terms and conditions, and
   also include promotion to a selection post. The Court further observed that:
   (SCR headnote p. 587)
   “Although <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_19">Article 16(4</a>), which in substance is an exception to Articles
   16(1) and 16(2) and should, therefore, be strictly construed, the court
   cannot in construing it overlook the extreme solicitude shown by the
   Constitution for the advancement of socially and educationally backward
   classes of citizens.The scope of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_20">Article 16(4</a>), though not as extensive as that
   of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_21">Article 16(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_22">(2</a>), — and some of the matters relating to employment
   such as salary, increment, gratuity, pension and the age of superannuation,
   must fall outside its non-obstante clause, there can be no doubt that it must
   include appointments and posts in the services. To put a narrower
   construction on the word ‘posts’ would be to defeat the object and the
   underlying policy. <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_23">Article 16(4</a>), therefore, authorises the State to provide
   for the reservation of appointments as well as selection posts.”

                               *****************

</p><p id="p_20">   543. It has been pointed out earlier that the reservations of the backward
   classes under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_24">Article 16(4)</a> have to be made consistently with the
   maintenance of the efficiency of administration. It is foolhardy to ignore the
   consequences to the administration when juniors supersede seniors
   although the seniors are as much or even more competent than the juniors.
   When reservations are kept in promotion, the inevitable consequence is the
   phenomenon of juniors, however low in the seniority list, stealing a march
   over their seniors to the promotional post. When further reservations are
   kept at every promotional level, the juniors not only steal march over their
   seniors in the same grade but also over their superiors at more than one
   higher level. This has been witnessed and is being witnessed frequently
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                           6</span>

    wherever reservations are kept in promotions. It is naive to expect that in
    such circumstances those who are superseded, (and they are many) can
    work with equanimity and with the same devotion to and interest in work as
    they did before. Men are not saints. The inevitable result, in all fields of
    administration, of this phenomenon is the natural resentment, heart-
    burning, frustration, lack of interest in work and indifference to the duties,
    disrespect to the superiors, dishonour of the authority and an atmosphere of
    constant bickerings and hostility in the administration. When, further, the
    erstwhile subordinate becomes the present superior, the vitiation of the
    atmosphere has only to be imagined. This has admittedly a deleterious effect
    on the entire administration.
</p>
<p id="p_21">    544. It is not only the efficiency of those who are thus superseded which
    deteriorates on account of such promotions, but those superseding have
    also no incentive to put in their best in work. Since they know that in any
    case they would be promoted in their reserved quota, they have no
    motivation to work hard. Being assured of the promotion from the
    beginning, their attitude towards their duties and their colleagues and
    superiors is also coloured by this complex. On that account also the
    efficiency of administration is jeopardised.
</p>
<p id="p_22">    545. With respect, neither the majority nor the minority in the Constitution
    Bench has noticed this aspect of the reservations in promotions. The later
    decisions which followed Rangachari [(1962) 2 SCR 586 : AIR 1962 SC 36]
    were also not called upon to and hence have not considered this vital
    aspect. The efficiency to which the majority has referred is with respect to
    the qualifications of those who would be promoted in the reserved quota.”

f. Sahai, J

    “622. But, inadequacy of representation is creative of jurisdiction only. It is
    not measure of backwardness. That is why less rigorous test or lesser marks
    and competition amongst the class of unequals at the point of entry has
    been approved both by this Court and American courts. But a student
    admitted to a medical or engineering college is further not granted
    relaxation in passing the examinations. In fact this has been explained as a
    valid basis in American decisions furnishing justification for racial
    admissions on lower percentage. Rationale appears to be that everyone
    irrespective of the source of entry being subjected to same test neither
    efficiency is effected nor the equality is disturbed. After entry in service the
    class is one, that of employees. If the social scar of backwardness is carried
    even thereafter, the entire object of equalisation stands frustrated. No
    further classification amongst employees would be justified as is not done
    amongst students.
</p>
<p id="p_23">    623. Constitutional, legal or moral basis for protective discrimination is
    redressing identifiable backward class for historical injustice. That is they
    are today, what they would not have been but for the victimisation.
    Remedying this and to balance the unfair advantage gained by others is the
    constitutional responsibility. But once the advantaged and disadvantaged,
    the so-called forward and backward, enter into the same stream then the

past injustice stands removed. And the length of service, the seniority in
cadre of one group, to be specific the forward group, is not as a result of
any historical injustice or undue advantage earned by his forefather or
discrimination against the backward class, but because of the years of
service that are put by an employee, in his individual capacity. This
entitlement cannot be curtailed by bringing in again the concept of
victimisation.
</p>
<p id="p_24">624. Equality either as propagated by theorists or as applied by courts
seeks to remove inequality by “parity of treatment under parity of
condition” [(1976) 2 SCC 310, 380 : 1976 SCC (L&amp;S) 227 : (1976) 1 SCR
906] . But once in “order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them
differently” [57 L Ed 2d 750 : 438 US 265 (1978)] has been done and
advantaged and disadvantaged are made equal and are brought in one class
or group then any further benefit extended for promotion on the inequality
existing prior to be brought in the group would be treating equals
unequally. It would not be eradicating the effects of past discrimination but
perpetuating it.
</p>
<p id="p_25">625. Constitutional sanction is to reserve for backward class of persons.
That is class or group interest has been preferred over individual. But
promotion from a class or group of employees is not promoting a group or
class but an individual. It is one against other. No forward class versus
backward class or majority against minority. It would, thus, be contrary to
the Constitution. Brother Kuldip Singh, for good and sound reasons has
rightly opined, that, Rangachari [(1962) 2 SCR 586 : AIR 1962 SC 36]
cannot be held to be laying down good law.”

</p><p id="p_26">627. Is it possible to reserve under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_25">Article 16(1)?</a> Detailed reasons have
been given earlier, against any reservation under cover of doctrine of
reasonable classification. Eradication of poverty which “is not to be exalted
or praised, but is an evil thing which must be fought and stamped out”
[ Jawaharlal Nehru, quoted from Dorothy, Norman (Ed.) Nehru] is one of
the ideals set out in the Preamble of the Constitution as it postulates to
achieve economic justice and exhorts the State under <a href="/doc/982915/" id="a_26">Article 38(2)</a> to
“minimise the inequality of income”. All the same, can the State for this
purpose reserve posts for the economically backwards in service. Right to
equal protection of laws or equality before law in ‘benefits, and burdens’ by
operation of law, equally amongst equals and unequally amongst unequals
is firmly rooted in the concept of equality developed by courts in this
country and in America. But any reservation or affirmative action on
economic criteria or wealth discrimination cannot be upheld under doctrine
of reasonable classification. Reservation for backward class seeks to
achieve the social purpose of sharing in services which had been
monopolised by few of the forward classes. To bridge the gap, thus created,
the affirmative actions have been upheld as the social and educational
difference between the two classes furnished reasonable basis for
classification. Same cannot be said for rich and poor. Indigence cannot be a
rational basis for classification for public employment.”

</p><p id="p_27">4.    It is thus discernible that in Indra Sawhney (supra), this court ruled that

reservations under <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_27">Article 16</a> for backward classes of citizens were limited only

to initial appointments, and did not extend to promotions. The rationale for such

a conclusion was that reservations in promotions would have a deleterious effect

on the efficiency of services: firstly, they would stifle the spirit to work amongst

the reserved candidates, and would amount to creation of a permanent separate

category. Secondly, such reservations would generate a feeling of despondence

and heartburn among general category candidates. Thirdly, reservations in

promotions would violate the rule of equality.
</p>
<p id="p_28">5.    To negate the declaration of the court in Indra Sawhney (supra),

Parliament introduced an amendment to <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_28">Article 16</a> of the Constitution, by

inserting clause (4-A) by the 77th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1995.

Clause (4-A) reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       “Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision
       for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in
       the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the
       Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately
       represented in the services under the State.”


      Additionally, the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the 77 th

Constitutional Amendment Act, 1995, reads as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">       “The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have been enjoying the
       facility of reservation in promotion since 1955. The Supreme Court in its
       judgment dated 16th November, 1992 in the case of <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_29">Indra Sawhney v. Union
       of India</a>, however, observed that reservation of appointments or posts under
       <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_30">Article 16(4)</a> is confined to initial appointment and cannot extend to
       reservation in the matter of promotion. This ruling of the Supreme Court
       will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the
       Scheduled Tribes. Since their representation in services in the States have

          not reached the required level, it is necessary to continue the existing
          dispensation of providing reservation in promotion in the case of the
          Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. In view of the commitment
          of the Government to protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the
          Scheduled Tribes, the government has decided to continue the existing
          policy of reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the
          Scheduled Tribes. To carry out this it is necessary to amend <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_31">Article
          16</a> of the Constitution by inserting a new clause (4-A) in the said article to
          provide for reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the
          Scheduled Tribes.”


      Thus, reservations in promotions were extended to members of the

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes alone.

</p><p id="p_35">         which is under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_38">Article 16(1)</a> of the Constitution. In fact, this Court in the
         said pronouncement has used the example of 3% reservation in favour of
         persons with disabilities while dealing with the rule of 50% ceiling. Para
         812 of the judgment clearly brings out that after selection and appointment
         of candidates under reservation for persons with disabilities they will be
         placed in the respective rosters of reserved category or open category
         respectively on the basis of the category to which they belong and, thus, the
         reservation for persons with disabilities per se has nothing to do with the
         ceiling of 50%. Para 812 is reproduced as follows : (SCC pp. 735-36)
               “812. … all reservations are not of the same nature. There are
               two types of reservations, which may, for the sake of
               convenience, be referred to as ‘vertical reservations’ and
               ‘horizontal reservations’. The reservations in favour of the
               Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Other
               Backward Classes [under <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_39">Article 16(4)]</a> may be called vertical
               reservations whereas reservations in favour of physically
               handicapped [under clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_40">Article 16]</a> can be referred to
               as horizontal reservations. Horizontal reservations cut across
               the vertical reservations—what is called interlocking
               reservations. To be more precise, suppose 3% of the vacancies
               are reserved in favour of physically handicapped persons; this
               would be a reservation relatable to clause (1) of <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_41">Article 16.</a> The
               persons selected against this quota will be placed in the
               appropriate category; if he belongs to SC category he will be
               placed in that quota by making necessary adjustments;
               similarly, if he belongs to open competition (OC) category, he
               will be placed in that category by making necessary
               adjustments. Even after providing for these horizontal
               reservations, the percentage of reservations in favour of
               backward class of citizens remains—and should remain—the
               same.””


     This judgment did not discuss reservations in ‘promotions’, but confined its

pronouncement to initial appointments only.

<p id="p_36">7.      <a href="/doc/190245590/" id="a_42">Rajeev Kumar Gupta v. Union of India</a> 9 authoritatively dealt with the

question of reservations in promotions for persons with disabilities. The two-

          “21. The principle laid down in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_44">Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of
          India</a>, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&amp;S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC
          385] is applicable only when the State seeks to give preferential treatment
          in the matter of employment under the State to certain classes of citizens
          identified to be a backward class. <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_45">Article 16(4)</a> does not disable the State
          from providing differential treatment (reservations) to other classes of

          deserve such treatment. However, for creating such preferential treatment
          under law, consistent with the mandate of <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_49">Article 16(1</a>), the State cannot
          choose any one of the factors such as caste, religion, etc. mentioned in

          physical disability and not any of the criteria forbidden under <a href="/doc/250697/" id="a_51">Article 16(1).</a>
          Therefore, the rule of no reservation in promotions as laid down in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_52">Indra

          fine and designed balance between requirements of administration and the
          imperative to provide greater opportunities to PWD. Therefore, as detailed
          in the first part of our analysis, the identification exercise under Section 32
          is crucial. Once a post is identified, it means that a PWD is fully capable of
          discharging the functions associated with the identified post. Once found to
          be so capable, reservation under Section 33 to an extent of not less than
          three per cent must follow. Once the post is identified, it must be reserved
          for PWD irrespective of the mode of recruitment adopted by the State for

</p><p id="p_43">          21. On a plea of the learned Amicus Curiae, which we unhesitatingly
          accept, there can be little doubt that it was never the intention of the
          legislature that the provisions of Section 32 would be used as a tool to
          frustrate the benefits of reservation under Section 33. In fact, identification
          of posts for purposes of reservation had to take place immediately after the
11 <a href="/doc/12823358/" id="a_65">State of Kerala v. Leesamma Joseph</a>, (2021) 9 SCC 208.

         tactics adopted by most of the Government authorities in truly
         implementing the intent. It thus shows that sometimes it is easier to bring a
         legislation into force but far more difficult to change the social mindset
         which would endeavour to find ways and means to defeat the intent of the
         Act enacted and Section 32 was a classic example of the same. <a href="/doc/148357190/" id="a_66">In Union of
         India v. Ravi Prakash Gupta [Union of India</a> v. Ravi Prakash Gupta, (2010)
         7 SCC 626 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&amp;S) 448] also, this Court mandated the
         identification of posts for purposes of reservation. Thus, what is required is
         identification of posts in every establishment until exempted under proviso
         to Section 33. No doubt the identification of the posts was a prerequisite to
         appointment, but then the appointment cannot be frustrated by refusing to
         comply with the prerequisite. This view was affirmed by a larger Bench of
         three Judges in <a href="/doc/178530295/" id="a_67">Union of India v. National Federation of the Blind [Union

III.    ANALYSIS

</p><p id="p_45">10.     At the outset, it is imperative to observe that the 1995 Act did not contain

a provision for reservations in ‘promotions’ for persons with disabilities

appointees, unlike its successor enactment, the Rights of Persons with

Disabilities Act, 2016 (“2016 Act”),12 which enabled the State to do the same.

Section 33 of the 1995 Act only provided for 3% reservation for posts identified

under Section 32, with 1% each for persons suffering from (i) blindness or low

vision; (ii) hearing impairment; and (iii) locomotor disability or cerebral palsy.

There is no mention of this extending to promotions. In the absence of such

statutory power, its inclusion in the extant provisions by this court is not beyond

doubt. It cannot be said that the manner in which such reservations have been

granted in promotions – even if horizontally – as a matter of right, is not

contrary to the express prohibition of the same by the nine judges in Indra



12 “34. Reservation. – [***] Provided that the reservation in promotion shall be in accordance with such
instructions as are issued by the appropriate Government from time to time”.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                                    14</span>

Sawhney (supra). I therefore hold serious reservation in its interpretation

otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_46">11.     While Indra Sawhney (supra) no doubt pertained to vertical reservations

for backward classes of citizens, this understanding of horizontal reservations

infact seeded from this very judgment.13 It cannot be said that its operative

portion on reservations in promotions is inapplicable to other classes of citizens

on that front alone. Such an exercise of distinguishing its application misses the

crux of its reasoning – that while provision of reservations in initial

appointments furthers the mandate of substantive equality, its application to

promotions militates against the same mandate. It was not the intention of

<a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_68">Article 16</a> of the Constitution to compromise on administrative inefficiency by

culling the spirit of competition-after all, positions gained by promotions taper

higher up. To ear-mark a certain portion to one class of citizens, and not others,

who may have also gained initial appointments on the strength of such

horizontality (such as women, retired / ex-servicemen, etc.) is not

constitutionally protected – the only exception to reservations in promotions is

SC / ST appointees, as provided under                         <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_69">Article 16(4A).</a>

</p><p id="p_47">12.     Additionally, horizontal reservations, unlike their vertical counterparts,

are not rigid, but have a fluidity to them, as observed in this court’s

pronouncement in <a href="/doc/27820739/" id="a_70">Saurav Yadav v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>.14 A candidate eligible

for horizontal reservation is not confined to their vertical category. Migrations

are permissible to allow the best candidates to emerge from this interlocking
13 See, para 812 of Indra Sawhney (supra).
</p><p id="p_48">14 Saurav Yadav v State of Uttar Pradesh, (2021) 4 SCC 542.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                                    15</span>

framework of reservations. However, such a mechanism is unworkable in

promotions, where vertical and horizontal qualifiers are absent (barring those

for SC/ST candidates). The (then) 3% reservation set aside for persons with

disabilities candidates no longer remains horizontal, but is implemented

vertically. While the 2016 Act enables the State to work out this mechanism,

such is conspicuously absent in the 1995 Act.
</p>
<p id="p_49">13.     This also leads to differential treatment of candidates belonging to the

same backward class as recognized by <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_71">Article 16(4)</a> of the Constitution. An

OBC candidate who is also a person with disabilities, will be given preference

over a non-persons with disabilities OBC candidate in promotions, which is

impermissible. Additionally, on a reading of T. Devadasan and N.M. Thomas

(supra), it is relevant to note that while reservations for backward classes are to

be carried forward, the 2016 Act permits carrying forward of horizontal

reservations for persons with disabilities candidates for a maximum period of

two years. However, the amendment to the Constitution recognizes that ‘carry

forward’ vacancies can exceed the 50% limit in promotional vacancies. This

amendment [inserting <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_72">Article 16(4-B)]</a> was upheld by this court in M. Nagaraj v

Union of India.15

</p><p id="p_50">14.     The laudable intent behind a provision such as Section 33 of the 1995

Act, and Section 34 of the 2016 Act, is undeniable. That persons with

disabilities need to be accommodated, in public service, is a given. At the same

time, this reasonable accommodation ought not to open gates for demands by

15 M. Nagaraj v Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 212.

DIPANKAR DATTA, J.

THE CHALLENGE:

</pre><p id="p_55">1.    Reserve Bank of India (hereafter ‘RBI’, for short) and the Union

of India (hereafter ‘GoI’ for short) are in appeal, by special leave,

mounting challenge to the judgment and order dated 16 th June, 2014

passed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay on Writ Petition

No.2753 of 2006 presented before it by the common first respondent

(hereafter ‘Mr. Nair’, for short).

FACTS:
</p>
<p id="p_57">2.    The facts leading to these appeals reflect the grim struggle of

Mr. Nair, a person having ‘Post-Polio Paralysis of Limbs’ with 50%

disability to secure promotion to the post of Assistant Manager in

the RBI by claiming benefit envisaged by the Persons with

Disabilities   (Equal Opportunity, Protection of Rights     and   Full

Participation) Act, 1995 (hereafter ‘the PwD Act, 1995’) as well as

various office memoranda issued from time to time by the

Department of Personnel and Training (hereafter ‘DoPT’, for short) of

the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, GoI, and

circulars issued by the RBI.
</p>
<p id="p_58">3.    Mr. Nair, joined the services of the RBI, on 27 th September,

1990 as Coin/Note Examiner, Grade–II/Clerk on a vacancy reserved

for a person with disability. In due course of time, Mr. Nair

participated in the All India Merit Test for the Panel Year 2003,

conducted sometime between 26th April and 3rd July, 2004 by the

RBI, for securing his promotion to a Class–I post. The standards fixed

for qualifying in the examination were the same for general

candidates as well as persons with disabilities. Apart from fulfilling

other conditions, Mr. Nair was required to obtain 95 (ninety-five)

marks to qualify for promotion. Results were declared on 19 th

October, 2004. Having obtained 92 (ninety-two) marks, he fell short

of the qualifying marks by only 3 (three) marks. Notwithstanding
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                    3</span>


fulfillment of other eligibility criteria for promotion, Mr. Nair was not

considered for promotion owing to such shortfall. Since circulars

issued by the GoI contemplated condonation of short fall to the

extent of 5 (five) marks for SC/ST candidates, Mr. Nair submitted a

representation dated 18th December, 2004 seeking grant of benefit

of relaxation as available to him “on par with SC/ST category

candidates” and also requested to include his name in the panel of

selected candidates. By a reply dated 25th May, 2005, the RBI

informed Mr. Nair that there is no provision for extending grace

marks to persons with disabilities in promotional examinations.

Immediately on the next day, Mr. Nair submitted a further

representation and while inviting attention to circular dated 5th July,

2000 (extending reservation to physically handicapped persons in

promotions up to S.O. Grade ‘A’ in the general side where not much

of moving from the seat is involved) and the Master Circular dated

19th October, 2004 (hereafter ‘Master Circular’, for short) on the

subject of ‘Reservation in Recruitment and Promotions in Bank’ for

persons with disabilities, both issued by the RBI, sought remedial

action. This was followed by a spate of representations which,

however, proved abortive.
</p>
<p id="p_59">4.   The pursuit to have the shortfall in marks condoned not having

been favourably considered by the RBI, thereby resulting in his non-

promotion to the post of Assistant Manager Grade - I, drove Mr. Nair
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                        4</span>


to knock the doors of the High Court by instituting a writ petition

seeking, inter alia, the following relief: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_17">        “a) This Hon’ble Court be pleased to call for the records of the
       case and after perusing the same be pleased to issue a writ of
       mandamus or a writ in the nature of mandamus or any other writ
       order or direction, directing Respondents to provide relaxation of
       conditions and/or providing grace marks to the candidate with
       disabilities for the purpose of placing the disabled candidates in
       the zone of consideration in All India Merit Test for the Panel Year
       2003 in the Respondents&#x27; establishment and further be pleased to
       direct the Respondents to place the Petitioner in the panel of
       selected candidates for promotion in All India Merit Test for the
       Panel Year 2003 conducted by the Respondents in the year 2004
       and be pleased to direct the Respondents to consider the
       candidature of the Petitioner for promotion to Grade A in the
       Physically Handicapped Employees category.
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_18">       b) The Respondents be ordered to implement the 3% Reservation
       in promotion for the persons with disability in toto to all the posts
       identified by the Respondents under Circular Nos.49 and 18 dated
       05.07.2000 and 19.10.2004 respectively.”



</blockquote><p id="p_60">5.    The writ petition was contested by the RBI by filing a counter

affidavit dated 8th February, 2008. Referring to Office Memorandum

(hereafter ‘OM’, for short) dated 29th December, 2005 on the subject

of “Reservation for the Persons with Disabilities” which consolidated

all existing instructions in line with the PwD Act, 1995 and clarified

certain issues including procedural matters, it was contended that

for persons with disabilities 3 (three) per cent of vacancies in case of

direct recruitment to Groups ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ have to be reserved;

and (three) per cent of the vacancies in case of promotions, only to

identified Groups ‘C’ and ‘D’ posts in which the element of direct

recruitment, if any, does not exceed 75 (seventy-five) per cent, have
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                         5</span>


to be reserved. Further, it was contended by referring to a

clarification provided by the GoI, contained in OM dated 25 th

October, 2002, that “(T)here is no reservation for the persons with

disabilities when promotions are made to Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’

posts”. Insofar as circular dated 5 th July, 2000 of the RBI is

concerned, it was pleaded that instructions contained therein were

withheld and not given effect. Finally, reference was made to

paragraph 22 of the OM dated 29 th December, 2005 providing as

follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      “If sufficient number of persons with disabilities are not available on the
      basis of the general standard to fill all the vacancies reserved for them,
      candidates belonging to this category may be selected on relaxed
      standard to fill up the remaining vacancies reserved for them provided
      they are not found unfit for such post or posts. Thus, to the extent the
      number of vacancies reserved for persons with disabilities cannot be filled
      on the basis of general standards, candidates belonging to this category
      may be taken by relaxing the standards to make up the deficiency in the
      reserved quota subject to the fitness of these candidates for appointment
      to the post/posts in question.”




</blockquote><p id="p_61">6.    The Division Bench of the High Court was referred to its

coordinate    Bench     decision    in       National   Confederation        for

<a href="/doc/116512778/" id="a_73">Development of Disabled &amp; Anr. vs. Union of India &amp; Ors</a>. 1,

in connection with the affairs of the State but are not members of

the State Civil services, as per their entitlements, retrospectively

from 1996 and to comply with the said provisions hereafter. The

decision in <a href="/doc/1454707/" id="a_74">Govt. of India &amp; Anr. vs. Ravi Prakash Gupta &amp; Anr</a>.2

was also referred, where this Court dealt with the question of

reservation in the matter of appointment to All India Service and

while confirming the decision under challenge held that reservation

was applicable to posts in Groups ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’. Attention of

the Division Bench was also invited to the decision in <a href="/doc/178530295/" id="a_75">Union of

India vs. National Federation of the Blind3</a>, where this Court

was of the view that “the computation of reservation for persons

with disabilities has to be computed in case of Group A, B, C and D

posts in an identical manner, viz. computing 3% reservation on total

number of vacancies in the cadre strength, which is the intention of

the legislature”. The Division Bench read the decision as laying

down the law that reservation has to be computed with reference to

total number of vacancies in the cadre strength and, therefore, no

distinction can be made between the posts to be filled in by direct

recruitment and by promotion. It was, accordingly, held that the

“total number of vacancies in the cadre strength would include the

vacancies to be filled in by nomination and vacancies to be filled in

by promotion”. Certain directions were issued by this Court in

December, 2013 by the DoPT modifying paragraph 6 of OM dated

29th December, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_62">7.   On consideration of the said decision and the modification so

made by the OM dated 3rd December, 2013, the High Court in

National Confederation for Development of Disabled (supra)

was of the view that the respondents would have to give benefits of

reservation to persons with disabilities in the matter of promotion to

posts in the Indian Administrative Service by applying OM dated 29 th

December, 2005 and the subsequent office memorandum consistent

with the aforesaid decision of this Court, with effect from the date of

issuance of OM dated 29th December, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_63">8.   Significantly, the decision in National Confederation for

Development of Disabled (supra) was the subject matter of

challenge at the instance of the GoI in a special leave petition, which

was dismissed on 12th September, 2014. A review petition was

thereafter filed by the GoI, which was also dismissed by an order

dated 5th December, 2014, on merits. Another special leave petition

that was carried by the GoI to this Court from the order dismissing

the review petition stood dismissed on 27 th February, 2015. Thus,

insofar as the GoI is concerned, the judgment and order dated 4 th

December, 2013 in National Confederation for Development of

Disabled (supra) attained finality.

</p><p id="p_65">9.   Upon consideration of the pleadings of the parties, the PwD

Act, 1995, OM dated 29th December, 2005 and OM dated 3 rd

December, 2013 issued by the DoPT as well as the decisions that

were referred to it, the High Court in the impugned judgment and

order held as follows: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">      “9. In view of the above discussion, we have no hesitation in
      holding that modification made by para 5 of the OM dated 3
      December 2013 to para 14 of the OM dated 29 December 2005
      will apply with effect from 29 December 2005 and therefore
      the respondent-Reserve Bank of India shall apply reservation
      for persons with disabilities on the basis of total number of
      vacancies appearing in direct recruitment quota as well as in
      promotion quota in Group &#x27;A&#x27; and Group &#x27;B&#x27; posts respectively

</blockquote><p id="p_66">10. It appears that while allowing the writ petition of Mr. Nair, the

Division Bench of the High Court followed the earlier view expressed

by its coordinate Bench.

</p><p id="p_68">11. Mr. Nair had applied for a review 4 of the judgment and order

dated 16th June, 2014 on the ground that the High Court had erred in

not clarifying the position on grace marks and in not addressing his

claim of qualification/seniority from the date of eligibility. When the

same was taken up for consideration on 31 st October, 2014, the High

Court was informed of issuance of notice by this Court on the

petition for special leave to appeal filed by the RBI. In view thereof,

without examining the merits of the review petition, the same was

disposed of by the High Court with liberty to Mr. Nair to seek revival

after disposal of the proceedings before this Court.

BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE LAW:
</p>
<p id="p_69">12.      Much water has flown under the bridge since the impugned

judgment dated 16th June, 2014 was rendered by the High Court. On

the legislative front, the Parliament enacted the Rights of Persons

with Disabilities Act, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the PwD Act,

2016’)    repealing   the   PwD   Act,   1995.   On   the   judicial   side,

pronouncements in <a href="/doc/190245590/" id="a_76">Rajiv Kumar Gupta and Ors. vs. Union of

India</a> and Ors.5, <a href="/doc/169994579/" id="a_77">Siddaraju vs. State of Karnataka and ors</a>. 6,

and <a href="/doc/638235/" id="a_78">State of Kerala and Ors. vs. Leesamma Joseph</a> 7 have seen

the light of the day. The executive, in its turn, has complied with the

directions contained in an order dated 28 th September, 2021 of this

Court8 arising out of Siddaraju (supra) resulting in issuance of OM

dated 17th May, 2022 by the DoPT. These are undoubtedly

developments subsequent to the impugned judgment; but since

they could have a bearing on the merits of Mr. Nair’s claim that he

has unjustly been deprived of promotion to the post of Assistant

Manager, the same cannot be kept out of our consideration. Indeed,

after OM dated 17th May, 2022 was issued, the RBI has also issued a

circular dated December 8, 2022 conveying its decision to reserve

16 (sixteen) vacancies for persons with disabilities out of 600 (six

hundred) vacancies on the post of Assistant Manager Grade - ‘A’, to

be filled up by a departmental examination scheduled on 10 th

December, 2022.
</p>
<p id="p_70">13. The law relating to grant of equal opportunities, protection of

rights, and full participation of persons with disabilities was codified

by the PwD Act, 1995. Chapter VI of the PwD Act, 1995, titled

‘EMPLOYMENT’, containing sections 32 to 41, inter alia, mandated

identification of posts which could be reserved for persons with

disabilities for appointment, the extent of reservation and the

procedure to be followed in the matter of recruitment. Significantly,

Chapter VI did not contain any express provision mandating an

‘employer’ or an ‘establishment’ as defined in clauses (j) and (k) of

section 2, respectively, to reserve any percentage of posts for

8 M.A. 2171/2020 in Civil Appeal No.1567/2017
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                   11</span>


promotion to persons with disabilities serving in the feeder cadre.

However, Chapter VIII titled ‘NON-DISCRIMINATION’ in sub-section

(2) of section 47 ordained that no promotion shall be denied to a

person merely on the ground of his disability. Sections 44 to 47,

under Chapter VIII, envisaged that persons with disabilities should

not face any discrimination in any of the fields specified therein, with

section   47   particularly    dealing   with   non-discrimination    in

Government employment. It is true that sub-section (2) of section 47

does   not   contain   any    mandate    requiring   the   employer   or

establishment to make reservation in promotional posts; on the

contrary, it is a command to the employer or establishment that

merely because an employee is suffering from a disability, as

defined in section 2(i) of the PwD Act, 1995, he is not to be denied

promotion.
</p>
<p id="p_71">14. However, it is noticed that even before the PwD Act, 1995 was

enacted, OM dated 20th November, 1989 had been issued by the

DoPT whereby, reservations promotions (i) within Group ‘D’, (ii) from

Group ‘D’ to Group ‘C’ and (iii) within Group ‘C’ to the three

categories of ‘physically handicapped persons’, viz. the visually

handicapped, the hearing handicapped and the orthopedically

handicapped, were permissible. It was, however, clarified that each

of the three categories of physically handicapped persons would be

allowed reservation at 1 (one) per cent each and that applicability of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                  12</span>


the reservation would be limited to promotions being made to those

posts that are identified as being capable of being filled/held by the

appropriate category of physically handicapped.

</p><p id="p_72">15. During the period intervening the advent of the PwD Act, 1995

and issuance of OM dated 29th December, 2005, the DoPT went on

to issue Office Memoranda dated 18th February, 1997, 16th January,

1998 and 25th October, 2022. We need not consider the said office

memoranda in any great detail except referring to the common

thread running through them, i.e., the DoPT sought to carve out the

benefit of reservation in promotion for persons with disabilities even

though whether there was an explicit legislative mandate to that

effect was indeed a grey area for some. Notwithstanding the same,

having regard to the objects that the PwD Act, 1995 intended to

achieve by providing equal opportunity, protection of rights and full

participation to the persons with disabilities and viewed in the light

of difficulties and inconveniences faced by them, the initiative of the

DoPT to provide for reservation in promotion for them on at least

Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ posts was indeed a step in the right

direction.
</p>
<p id="p_73">16. Be that as it may, mere absence of an express mandate in

Chapter VI of the PwD Act, 1995 requiring reservation in promotion

for persons with disabilities could not have been construed as not

obliging the appropriate Government not to keep reserved vacancies
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                     13</span>


on promotional posts for those answering clauses (i) to (iii) of

section 33. Though the language used in section 33 could admit of a

little bit of confusion, the crucial words there are “shall appoint in

every establishment”. Paraphrased, it implies that while the

appropriate     Government      is   making        appointment      in   every

establishment, it ought to reserve a minimum of 3 (three) per cent

vacancies for persons or class of persons with disability, of which 1

(one) per cent each shall be reserved for those persons with

disabilities of the nature mentioned in the clauses therein, i.e., (i)

blindness or low vision, (ii) hearing impairment, and (iii) locomotor

disability or cerebral palsy, and that appointments shall be made on

the posts identified for each such disability as in the said clauses.

The proviso which permits exemption is not relevant in the present

case; hence, its effect is not considered. It is, therefore, the

statutory    duty   enjoined   by section 33         that   there   must be

appointment of persons with disabilities in every establishment

which ought not to be less than 3 (three) per cent but a minimum of

1 (one) percent of vacancies, available on identified posts for each

disability, has to be reserved. The confusion, to our mind, might

have stemmed from the narrow interpretation of the word “appoint”,

without     realizing   that   “promotion”    is    also    included     within

“appointment”. The term “appointment” is quite broad and includes

appointment by ‘direct recruitment’ as well as appointment by way
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                    14</span>


of ‘promotion’. Prior to Rajiv Kumar Gupta (supra), there was no

authoritative pronouncement on the aspect of reservation in

promotion. The interpretation of section 33 of the PwD Act, 1995

made by Rajiv Kumar Gupta (supra) finds its resonance in

Siddaraju (supra).
</p>
<p id="p_74">17. We have noticed that the PwD Act, 2016 expressly makes

available benefits of reservation to promotional posts for persons

with disabilities in that the first proviso to section 34 ordains that

reservation   in   promotion   shall     be   in   accordance   with   such

instructions as are issued by the appropriate Government from time

to time.   Law within the meaning of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_79">Article 141</a> of the Constitution

of India having been declared by Siddaraju (supra) and the GoI

having implemented the order of this Court dated 28 th September,

2021 noted above and issued OM dated 17 th May, 2022, the same

constitutes “instructions” as contemplated by the first proviso to

section 34 of the PwD Act, 2016. Such instructions contemplate

reservation in promotion to posts in Group – ‘A’ in the lowest grade.

</p><p id="p_75">18. When the provisions of the PwD Act, 1995 and the PwD Act,

2016 in relation to reservation in promotion for persons with

disabilities are contrasted, it is clear as crystal that what was implicit

in the former has been made explicit by the latter.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                  15</span><p id="p_76">


</p><p id="p_77">19. This is the broad overview of the position of law, as it stands

today, in regard to reservation in promotion for persons with

disabilities.
</p>
<p id="p_78">


ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE RBI:
</p>
<p id="p_79">20. Appearing in support of the appeal presented by the RBI, Mr.

Jaideep Gupta, learned senior counsel, contended that the High

Court erred in making the directions it did. According to him, the

circulars issued by the RBI restricted promotion of physically

handicapped persons only to Group ‘C’ posts and within Group ‘D’

posts, and did not permit reservation in promotion in Group ‘A’

posts. That apart, OM dated 29th December, 2005 relied on by Mr.

Nair did not extend any benefit of the nature claimed by Mr. Nair

despite its modification by OM dated 3rd December, 2013. Thus, from

whichever angle one looks at the circulars, resolving Mr. Nair’s

grievance by considering him fit for promotion from the date of

issuance of OM dated 29th December, 2005, as directed by the High

Court, was not called for. He also contended that after the GoI issued

OM dated 17th May, 2022, the RBI has also issued the circular dated

8th December, 2022, whereby requisite vacancies in Group ‘A’ posts

have also been reserved for promotion of persons with disabilities.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                      16</span>


This circular dated 8th December, 2022 contemplates promotion of

persons     with    disabilities   upon     qualifying   in   a   departmental

examination.
</p>
<p id="p_80">21. Though Mr. Gupta did not dispute that benefit of condonation

of shortfall in marks was available for SC/ST candidates, he

submitted that the concession could not have been extended to

persons with disabilities like Mr. Nair in the absence of any policy

decision for reserving vacancies in Group – ‘A’ posts for persons like

him; hence, Mr. Nair could not have claimed any benefit flowing

therefrom.
</p>
<p id="p_81">22. Referring to an “Additional Affidavit” dated 19th January, 2023

filed on behalf of the RBI, Mr. Gupta contended that vide circular

dated 21st September, 2022, a departmental examination for

promotion of Class III employees to the post of Assistant Manager

Grade ‘A’ was scheduled on 10 th December, 2022 and willingness

therefor was invited by 30th September, 2022; however, Mr. Nair

chose not to participate in such examination. Mr. Nair, it was

contended, having not offered his candidature, the RBI was disabled

to assess his performance for promotion. Mr. Gupta, thus, urged that

Mr. Nair having let go the opportunity, cannot be heard to complain;

however, if Mr. Nair wishes to participate in the promotional

exercise,    when     conducted     next,    the   RBI   shall    consider   his

candidature in terms of the extant provisions.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                   17</span><p id="p_82">


</p><p id="p_83">23. Mr. Gupta, thus, prayed that the appeal of the RBI could be

disposed of recording his aforesaid statement.
</p>
<p id="p_84">


ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE GoI:
</p>
<p id="p_85">24. Ms.      Madhavi   Divan, learned   Additional Solicitor General

appearing for the GoI, placed OM dated 17 th May, 2022 and

contended that pursuant to orders of this Court made from time to

time and in particular after the order dated 28 th September, 2021

(supra), instructions have been issued to make available reservation

in promotion for persons with disabilities from posts in Group ‘B’ to

the lowest rung in Group ‘A’, however, with the rider that reservation

in promotion shall be applicable in the cadres in which the element

of direct recruitment, if any, does not exceed 75%. She further

submitted that since there was no specific post identified for

promotional appointment in Group ‘A’ when Mr. Nair participated in

the process and also that the shortfall in marks could be condoned

only in respect of SC/ST candidates, coupled with the fact that Mr.

Nair elected to stay away from the recent promotional process, the

directions   made in the     impugned     judgment and order that

paragraph 14 of OM dated 29th December, 2005, since modified by

OM dated 8th December, 2013, should be applied with retrospective

effect, do not call for being sustained. Accordingly, she too joined Mr.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                 18</span>


Gupta in urging that the appeal of the GoI be disposed of granting

liberty to Mr. Nair to participate in the fresh process, whenever

conducted.
</p>
<p id="p_86">25. In the midst of her argument, Ms. Divan was on the verge of

expressing certain reservations about the law expounded by this

Court in Siddaraju (supra). However, the decision having become

final and the DoPT also having acted in terms thereof, we did not

consider it appropriate to permit her advance any further argument

in that regard.
</p>
<p id="p_87">ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF MR. NAIR:
</p>
<p id="p_88">26. Representing Mr. Nair, learned counsel Mr. K. Mohan invited our

attention to the various circulars/office memoranda issued from time

to time and the relevant decisions of this Court as well as the High

Court in matters relating to reservation of certain vacancies on

promotional posts for persons with disabilities. Relying thereon, he

contended that Mr. Nair has been given a raw deal.
</p>
<p id="p_89">27. OM dated 18th February, 1997 and corrigendum dated 16 th

January, 1998 were placed by Mr. Mohan. According to him, a

conjoint reading thereof would leave none in doubt that the existing

policy of reservation for SCs/STs, including for the “physically

handicapped” in promotion in all groups is applicable to all grades

and services where the extent of direct recruitment does not exceed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                   19</span>


75 (seventy-five) per cent; and that the “existing policy of

reservation” would obviously include the provision for grace marks

for SCs/STs.
</p>
<p id="p_90">28. Referring to the counter affidavit of Mr. Nair filed in connection

with   these   appeals,   Mr.   Mohan   invited   our   attention   to   a

communication dated 18th October, 2006 issued by the Banking

Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, GoI

addressed to, inter alia, the Chief General Manager, RBI on the

subject of “Concession and relaxation to persons with disabilities at

par with SCs/STs irrespective of their vertical categories”. It was

shown that on a reference received from the Commissioner of

Disabilities on the subject, it had been decided to extend concession

in examination fee and relaxation in minimum percentage of marks

to persons with disabilities at par with SCs/STs with the nationalized

banks. An order of this Court dated 19 th March, 2002 in <a href="/doc/1915524/" id="a_80">A.I.

Confederation of the Blind vs. Union of India &amp; Anr</a>.9 was also

referred endorsing the stand of the GoI to bring parity amongst all

the persons with disabilities irrespective of their vertical categories.

A request was, accordingly, made to the addressees including the

RBI to note the instructions for appropriate action.

</p><p id="p_91">29. Heavily relying thereon, Mr. Mohan argued that the refusal of

the RBI to treat persons with disabilities at par with SC/ST category

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">9 W.P.(C) No.115/1998</span>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                   20</span>


of candidates and to award grace marks as are made available to

the latter, despite the existence of the circular dated 5 th July, 2000,

the Master Circular and the communication dated 18 th October,

2006, amounts not only to deprivation of the rights of “Equal

Opportunity, Protection and Full Participation” guaranteed by the

provisions of the PwD Act, 1995 but also to invidious discrimination

hit by <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_81">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_92">30. Inviting our pointed attention to the decision in Leesamma

Joseph (supra), Mr. Mohan contended that this Court declined to

interfere with the order of the Kerala High Court under challenge

which reversed the decision of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal

and upheld not only the respondent’s claim for promotion, though

the initial entry of the respondent was on compassionate ground and

not on a post reserved for persons with disabilities, but did not

disturb the financial benefits received by the respondent. He also

contended that this Court even after not interfering with the

impugned order examined the issue as to whether persons with

disabilities could claim a right of promotion under the PwD Act,

1995, as such issue were likely to arise in other matters of similar

nature, and answered it in the affirmative.
</p>
<p id="p_93">31. Mr. Mohan also invited our attention to an order dated 20 th

February, 2020 recorded on these appeals. Such order noticed the

submission advanced by him on behalf of Mr. Nair that “the rights in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                   21</span>


favour of disabled persons flow directly from the provisions of the

Act and the source of right is not the O.M. but the provisions of the

Act themselves; and as such the O.M. in any case can not limit the

applicability of the protection under the provisions of the Act”. Mr.

Mohan reiterated such submission before us and submitted that the

directions given by the High Court in the impugned judgment and

order do not call for any interference.
</p>
<p id="p_94">PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THIS COURT:
</p>
<p id="p_95">32. Having heard the parties on 19th January, 2023, we had

granted special leave to appeal and reserved judgment. In course of

hearing, Mr. Gupta had sought for leave to file a “Further Affidavit”,

which we orally permitted. Such an affidavit having been tendered

on 30th January, 2023, we permitted Mr. Mohan to look into its

contents and on a prayer made on behalf of Mr. Nair, we even

permitted filing of a reply by an order dated 31 st January, 2023.

Pursuant thereto, a “Common Affidavit-in-Reply” dated 7 th February,

2023 has been filed by Mr. Nair and taken on record.
</p>
<p id="p_96">ADDITIONAL AFFIDAVITS OF THE RBI:
</p>
<p id="p_97">33. We have read the additional affidavits filed by the RBI and Mr.

Nair after judgment on these appeals was reserved. The points that

the RBI urged in the counter affidavit filed before the High Court

have been reiterated, which we have noticed above. That apart,
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                  22</span>


perusal of paragraphs 3-7 of the ‘Additional Affidavit’ dated 19 th

January, 2023 and 10-13 of the ‘Further Affidavit’ dated 30 th January,

2023 of the RBI reveal reference to issuance of instructions on

‘Reservation in promotion’ under section 34 of the PwD Act, 2016 by

the GoI in pursuance of the directions contained in the order dated

28th September, 2021 (supra) and further that the RBI has adopted

the same for itself vide its circular dated 08 th December, 2022; that

considering the above instructions, in relation to the examinations

conducted for Panel Year 2022 vide circular dated 8 th December,

2022, 16 (sixteen) vacancies were reserved for persons with

disabilities and though the last date for expression of willingness to

participate in the same was 30th September, 2022, Mr. Nair did not

participate; and also that the qualification for Asst. Manager Grade

‘A’ post has undergone changes and the Memorandum of Settlement

(MoS) between the RBI and the Employee’s Association has been

implemented vide revised qualification criteria w.e.f. 2013.

QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED BY THE APPELLANTS:
</p>
<p id="p_98">34. We have noticed that in the appeals, the RBI and the GoI have

each raised 3 (three) questions of law which they claim are

substantial questions. In essence, the questions are common but

obviously differently worded and not in the same sequence. To put

the matter in the proper perspective, the appellants essentially have

sought for answers in the negative to the following questions:
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                  23</span>


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">     (i)   Whether the modification made by paragraph 5 of the

     Office Memorandum dated 3rd December, 2013 to paragraph

     14 of the Office Memorandum dated 29 th December, 2005 is to

     be applied retrospectively with effect from 29th December,

     2005?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">     (ii) Whether the High Court was justified in holding that the RBI

     has to apply reservation in promotion for persons with

     disabilities in respect of Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ posts?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">     And

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">     (iii) Whether the High Court is justified in holding that the

     decision in National Confederation of Development of

     Disabled (supra) is applicable to the present case?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_99">ANALYSIS AND DECISION:
</p>
<p id="p_100">35. Regard being had to the narrative of facts leading to

presentation of these appeals, the rival contentions advanced at the

Bar on behalf of the parties and in the light of exposition of law by

this Court in the decisions referred to above in regard to rights of

persons with disabilities in employment under the appropriate

Government or in an establishment qua matters of promotion, we

are of the considered opinion that the aforesaid 3 (three) questions

have been rendered purely academic. We may briefly give our

reasons therefor.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">                                        24</span><p id="p_101">


</p><p id="p_102">36. The decision in Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra) considered the

legality of the impugned Office Memoranda dated 18 th February,

1997 and 29th December, 2005, issued by the DoPT, denying to

employees of Prasar Bharati, having disabilities, of the statutory

benefit of 3 (three) per cent reservation in identified posts falling in

Groups ‘A’ and ‘B’. Contention raised by the respondents based on

the Constitution Bench decision in <a href="/doc/1363234/" id="a_82">Indra Sawhney vs. Union of

India10</a>, that there cannot be reservation in promotions to identified

posts of Groups ‘A’ and ‘B’, was overruled by observing that such

ruling arose in the context of reservations in favour of backward

classes of citizens falling within the sweep of <a href="/doc/68038/" id="a_83">Article 16(4)</a> of the

Constitution. Ultimately, it was held in paragraphs 24 and 25 as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_103">   “24. A combined reading of Sections 32 and 33 of the 1995 Act explicates a
   fine and designed balance between requirements of administration and the
   imperative to provide greater opportunities to PWD. Therefore, as detailed in
   the first part of our analysis, the identification exercise under Section 32 is
   crucial. Once a post is identified, it means that a PWD is fully capable of
   discharging the functions associated with the identified post. Once found to
   be so capable, reservation under Section 33 to an extent of not less than
   three per cent must follow. Once the post is identified, it must be reserved for
   PWD irrespective of the mode of recruitment adopted by the State for filling
   up of the said post.
</p><p id="p_104">   25. In the light of the preceding analysis, we declare the impugned
   memoranda as illegal and inconsistent with the 1995 Act. We further direct
   the Government to extend three per cent reservation to PWD in all identified
   posts in Group A and Group B, irrespective of the mode of filling up of such
   posts. This writ petition is accordingly allowed.”




10 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                  25</span>


</p><p id="p_105">37. The view expressed in Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra) was

doubted by a coordinate Bench of this Court. Opining that

preferential treatment to persons with disabilities could cover

reservation in appointment but not reservation in promotion, the

said Bench in its order dated 3 rd February, 2017 was of the view that

the contention needs to be considered by a larger Bench.

</p><p id="p_106">38. Siddaraju (supra) is the larger Bench decision which has held

that the decision in Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra) cannot be faulted

when it stated that Indra Sawhney (supra) dealt with a different

problem and cannot be followed.
</p>
<p id="p_107">39. Leesamma Joseph (supra), which is the latest in the line of

decisions on the same point, has reached similar conclusion albeit

premised on a different reasoning.
</p>
<p id="p_108">40. There is, therefore, no dearth of authority for the proposition

that the PwD Act, 1995 not only mandated reservation in

appointment but also contemplated reservation in promotion.

</p><p id="p_109">41. Incidentally, we have also assigned our own reason as to why

any perception and understanding of section 33 of the PwD Act,

1995 not contemplating reservation in promotion is erroneous and

fallacious.
</p>
<p id="p_110">42. Bearing in mind what has been laid down by this Court in the

cited decisions and the view taken by us (supra), our specific
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                   26</span>


answers to the 3 (three) questions urged by the appellants are

these. OM dated 29th December, 2005 having been set aside in

Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra), the first question does not survive

consideration as to whether modification of paragraph 14 of the

same, brought about by OM dated 8 th December, 2013, would apply

retrospectively. Furthermore, Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra) having

directed the GoI to extend 3 (three) per cent reservation to the

persons with disabilities in all identified posts in Group ‘A’ and Group

‘B’, irrespective of the mode of filling up of such posts (emphasis

ours), and the larger Bench in Siddaraju (supra) having given its

stamp of approval to such decision, the second question also stands

squarely answered against the appellants. Finally, the question as to

whether the High Court was right in relying upon National

Confederation of Development of Disabled (supra) is no longer

res integra having regard to the multiple decisions of this Court on

the point affirming the position that reservation in employment

contemplated in section 33 of the PwD Act, 1995 covers all posts

identified for each of the 3 (three) kinds of disability mentioned

therein and is not restricted to Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ posts. We

share the view taken therein.
</p>
<p id="p_111">43. Having held thus and in the changed circumstances, we are

tasked to decide two other questions, viz.:
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                   27</span><p id="p_112">


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_28">     (a) whether the RBI by failing to consider Mr. Nair for

     promotion, a right guaranteed by <a href="/doc/211089/" id="a_84">Article 16</a> of the Constitution,

     on application of relaxed standards committed an illegality?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">     and

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_30">     (b) provided the answer to the aforesaid question is in the

     affirmative, to what extent relief can legitimately be extended

     to Mr. Nair?
</blockquote>
<p id="p_113">44. Our answers to the aforesaid questions should be prefaced by

a brief reference to the supreme law of the land. The resolve in the

Preamble to the Constitution and the provisions in Part IV thereof,

are considered relevant. Our preambular promise is to secure ‘social

justice’ to all. The Directive Principles of State Policy, though not

enforceable, are declared in <a href="/doc/76375/" id="a_85">Article 37</a> to be “fundamental in the

governance of the country” and the State has a duty to apply these

principles in making laws. The immediately next article commands

the State to strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing

and protecting, as effectively as it may, a social order in which

justice ~ social, economic and political ~ shall inform all the

institutions of the national life and endeavor to eliminate inequalities

in status, facilities and opportunities. <a href="/doc/1975922/" id="a_86">Article 41</a> requires the State,

within the limits of its economic capacity and development, to make

effective provision for securing the right to work, inter alia, in cases
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                    28</span>


of disablement. In the society we live in, which is indeed class-

ridden, ‘social justice’ should mean justice to the weaker and poorer

section of the society, particularly when the people of the nation

have resolved in the Preamble to secure ‘equality of status and

opportunity’. The underlying idea is that securing justice to the

weaker and the poorer section could make them equal with the rest

of the society. In a case where the weaker section is involved in a

combat with the stronger section and the scales are even, to rise to

the challenge for securing ‘social justice’, the Courts of law ought to

lean in favour of the former so that justice is ensured. If persons with

disabilities are denied the rights and privileges conferred by law of

equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation, inter

alia, in the field of public employment, the disservice to such

persons would inevitably be grave causing erosion of constitutional

idealism and respect for human rights apart from extreme mental

agony and pain of the deprived. Where such situations emerge, the

courts should not remain mute and dumb. No court, far less this

Court,     should   condone   the        breaches   and   violations   by

employers/establishments arising out of treading of the illegal path

by them.
</p>
<p id="p_114">45. It is noted that the version of the RBI before the High Court

was that there is no provision for reservation in promotional posts in

Grade - ‘A’ for persons with disabilities; hence, benefit of promotion
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_47">                                  29</span>


on a reserved vacancy could not be granted to Mr. Nair. This was

indeed the ostensible reason for which the relaxed standards of

assessment available for SC/ST candidates was not extended to

persons with disabilities, a fortiori, to Mr. Nair. In other words, Mr.

Nair’s claim for promotion on a reserved vacancy for persons with

disabilities, upon application of relaxed standards, could not have

been considered in the absence of any identified Group ‘A’ post.

That the appropriate Government must make available reservation

in the matter of appointment of persons with disabilities in identified

posts of Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’ had been conclusively and

authoritatively decided by this Court in Ravi Prakash Gupta

(supra) and National Federation of the Blind (supra) by the time

the impugned judgment and order was rendered. That being the

position, no valid contention could have been advanced that

reservation for persons     with disabilities   is   not available for

appointment on Group – ‘A’ posts. What remained was whether

reservation for persons with disabilities is available for promotional

appointment on Group – ‘A’ posts. That issue has also been given a

quietus by Rajiv Kumar Gupta (supra), Siddaraju (supra) and

Leesamma Joseph (supra). The two big impediments in the path of

Mr. Nair, thus, stand removed by reason of a pragmatic and

reasonable interpretation of the PwD Act, 1995 by this Court.
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                  30</span>


</p><p id="p_115">46. It cannot, however, be gainsaid that when Mr. Nair had

participated in the Panel Year 2003 examination, no decision had

been rendered by this Court that reservation in promotion is

permissible in respect of Group ‘A’ posts. It is equally true that this

Court while interpreting sections 32 and 33 of the PwD Act, 1995 did

not declare the law laid down by it to have prospective application. It

is a principle, well-settled in law, that the interpretation of a

provision of law relates back to the date of the law itself. This is

essentially for the reason that the duty of the Court is not to

legislate but to interpret the law. However, such principle is subject

to the exception that this Court may, in a given case, declare that its

interpretation would have effect prospectively. That is not the

express intention of this Court in any of the decisions referred to

above. This being the position in law, we have no doubt that Mr. Nair

did have a statutorily conferred right all through to claim that

reservation in promotional appointment in Group ‘A’ posts is

ingrained in the PwD Act, 1995.
</p>
<p id="p_116">47. Thus held, the remaining impediment is with regard to

condonation of shortfall of marks at par with the relaxed standards

applicable to SC/ST candidates. We now proceed to examine

whether the RBI was justified in not condoning the shortfall of 3

(three) marks pertaining to the 2003 examination taken by Mr. Nair

to enable him secure promotion.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                  31</span><p id="p_117">


</p><p id="p_118">48. We have noted from the communication dated 18 th October,

2006 issued by the Banking Division, Department of Economic

Affairs, Ministry of Finance, GoI that the same surfaced as a follow-

up step to comply with this Court’s order dated 19 th March, 2002 in

A.I. Confederation of the Blind (supra). Even otherwise, to reach

out to persons with disabilities and grant them the facilities and

benefits that the PwD Act, 1995 envisaged, it was rather harsh to

apply standards which are applicable to general candidates to Mr.

Nair while he competed with such general candidates for securing

his promotion. RBI, as a model employer, ought to have taken an

informed decision in this regard commensurate with the aspirations

of persons with disabilities.
</p>
<p id="p_119">49. We did not hear any serious argument from Mr. Gupta or Ms.

Divan, and rightly so, that persons with disabilities are not entitled

to be judged by the same relaxed standards that are applied to

assess candidature of SC/ST candidates.
</p>
<p id="p_120">50. In such circumstances, the omission or failure of the RBI in

condoning the shortfall in marks coupled with the neglect to identify

a Group ‘A’ post suitable for reservation to accommodate Mr. Nair on

promotion appears to us to be indefensible.
</p>
<p id="p_121">51. Question (a) is answered accordingly.
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                   32</span><p id="p_122">


</p><p id="p_123">52. In   considering    question   (b),   concededly   there   was   no

authoritative pronouncement of this Court interpreting the PwD Act,

1995, making available reservation in promotional appointments for

persons with disabilities in Group ‘A’ posts, when Mr. Nair took the

examination for promotion to the post of Assistant Manager,

Grade – I in 2004. The first time it came to be so declared was when

the decision in Rajeev Kumar Gupta (supra) was pronounced.

Should the RBI, in the circumstances, be directed to relax the

standard of assessment and grant promotion to Mr. Nair with

retrospective effect?
</p>
<p id="p_124">53. The answer to this question would necessitate looking back at

the operative directions contained in the order under challenge.

What the High Court said has been quoted above. It is noteworthy

that the High Court did not mandatorily direct grant of promotion to

Mr. Nair. The High Court’s judgment, unintendedly, was confined to

application of reservation policy. The High Court did not declare that

Mr. Nair should also be entitled to condonation of shortfall in marks

with reference to the Panel Examination 2003. Insofar as other

qualifying requirements under the relevant rules are concerned, the

High Court clarified that it may not be understood to have expressed

any opinion on the question of Mr. Nair satisfying such requirements.

Given such contours of the order, it was open to the RBI to consider

Mr. Nair for promotion and pass appropriate order either granting or
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                  33</span>


denying him promotion in accordance with the prevailing exposition

of law. Instead of complying with the order, the RBI carried the

judgment and order to this Court on 12 th September, 2014. GoI also

followed suit. It was Mr. Nair who rushed to the High Court with a

review petition within the period of limitation, whereupon his rights

have been kept open noticing pendency of the petition for special

leave of the RBI. Given such a situation, it seems that the RBI has on

its own invited the uncomfortable position in which it finds itself

now. The decisions of this Court rendered during the pendency of

these appeals have to be considered and applied, notwithstanding

the fact that the same were not available when the High Court

decided Mr. Nair’s writ petition finally. RBI might not have faced this

conundrum had the order of the High Court been complied with on

time.
</p>
<p id="p_125">54. In any event, should the RBI and GoI be worse off for

approaching this Court, given the fact that after his participation in

the 2003 examination Mr. Nair has elected to stay away from further

examinations on the pretext of pendency of proceedings before the

High Court as well as this Court, and suffer the impact of the

decisions of this Court post the impugned judgment and order? Or,

should the appeals be dismissed leaving it open to the RBI to comply

with the order of the High Court? In our view, dismissal without any

observation has the potential of generating further unnecessary
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                  34</span>


litigation. At the same time, though Mr. Nair did not file any cross-

appeal, he had applied for review and has been conferred the liberty

to revive the review petition after disposal of proceedings by this

Court.
</p>
<p id="p_126">55. Having regard to the materials on record before us and for

answering question (b), it is considered appropriate to invoke <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_87">Article

142</a> of the Constitution “for doing complete justice” in the cause.

</p><p id="p_127">56. We direct RBI to grant notional promotion to Mr. Nair on the

post of Assistant Manager Grade – ‘A’, to be effective from the date

of presentation of the writ petition before the High Court, i.e., 27 th

September, 2006 and actual promotion from 15 th September, 2014,

i.e., the last date for compliance of the order of the High Court. This

exercise must be completed within a period of 2 (two) months from

date. The monetary benefits accruing to Mr. Nair with effect from

15th September, 2014 shall be computed and released by 4 (four)

months from date.
</p>
<p id="p_128">57. Since Mr. Nair has a couple of years for his retirement on

superannuation, it is needless to observe that in computing his

retiral benefits due regard shall be given to his promotion, as

directed above, with effect from 27th September, 2006.

</p><p id="p_129">58. The appeals stand disposed of on the above terms. Parties

shall bear their own costs.</p><pre id="pre_3">
