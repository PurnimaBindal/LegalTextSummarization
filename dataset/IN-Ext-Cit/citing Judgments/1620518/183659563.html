GITA MITTAL, J

</p><p id="p_8">1.   This writ petition primarily seeks enforcement of guidelines

framed by the respondent no. 1 for dispensation of financial

assistance as well as recognition of National level Sports Federations

('NSFs' hereafter) contending that they are applicable and binding.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">                                  1</span>
 A grievance is made that the respondent no. 2 herein - the Indian

Hockey Federation ('IHF' hereafter) has been recognised and

granted financial assistance under such guidelines and is bound to

comply with the same and that it has failed to abide by the same.

</p><p id="p_9">2.   The writ petitioner has claimed that he is a member of the

Jammu &amp; Kashmir Hockey Association and was authorised to

represent the Association at the respondent no. 2. On 29th January,

2002, the petitioner was elected as the Senior Vice President of the

respondent no. 2 for the first time and his term of four years was

expiring on 28th January, 2006. The petitioner has claimed that he

was vitally interested and concerned with the manner in which the

affairs of the Indian Hockey Federation were conducted.

</p><p id="p_10">3.   Sh. K.P.S. Gill - respondent no. 3 was elected President of the

respondent no. 2 in 1994 and he has continued to hold the post of

President in all elections ever since and as such he was a President

of the respondent no. 2 - Indian Hockey Federation for a period of

more than 11 years.
</p>
<p id="p_11">     Mr. K. Jothikumaran, Honorary Secretary General - respondent

no. 4 is also stated to be holding the post for three consecutive terms

since 1994.
</p>
<p id="p_12">4.     The petitioner made allegations of mismanagement and

violation of the terms of the Government guidelines and filed the writ

petition for the reason that the respondent no. 1 had failed to take

any action thereon.      A further grievance was made that the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">                                   2</span>
 respondents were not abiding by the terms of the constitution of the

respondent no. 2 and were perpetuating to convene an Annual

General Meeting for the year 2003-04 on 30th January, 2005 without

circulating the relevant documents. A complaint dated 21st January,

2005 had been lodged in this behalf.           Dissatisfied with the

communications received, the petitioner protested by a letter dated

29th January, 2005 and again on 30th January, 2005 complaining the

meeting of the violations of the constitution of the respondent no. 2.

As his grievances were still not addressed, the petitioner made a

complaint on 17th February, 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_13">     Further grievances with regard to the manner in which minutes

have been recorded were not addressed by the respondents.

</p><p id="p_14">5.   The petition is necessitated as the petitioner is aggrieved by the

failure of the respondent no. 1 to take action on the representations

dated 21st January, 17th February and 4th March, 2005 of the

petitioner pointing out alleged irregularities in the affairs of

respondent no. 2 on the part of respondent nos. 2 to 4 which inter

alia include the following :-

         payments for over 3 years and on the other side
         there are people who are done payment
         immediately. If it is so, then the petitioner would
         like to have an age wise list of parties who have to
         take payment from IHF till 31.3.2004."</blockquote><p id="p_15">



</p><p id="p_16">     These grievances have been noticed here only for the purpose

of elucidating the nature of violations which were being complained

of and inquiry sought by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_17">6.   In addition to the above, the petitioner has asserted that clause

3.5 in the Guidelines for Assistance to National Sports Federations

prohibits the office bearer from participating in an election after

more than two continuous terms and that the respondent nos. 3 and

4 are blatantly violating the same. The writ petitioner has, therefore,

prayed for the following reliefs :-
</p>
<p id="p_18">             "(a) Issue a writ of certiorari or any other writ

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">                                      4</span>
 of direction in nature thereof calling the records of
the respondent no. 1 pertaining to the grant of
financial assistance to respondent no. 2 for last ten
years for ascertaining the manner in which the funds
granted by the Union of India have been utilised by
the respondent no. 2.
</p><p id="p_19">(b) Issue a writ of mandamus or any other direction
in the nature thereof against the Union of India
directing that in the event of any unsatisfactory
explanation by respondent nos. 2-4 with regard to the
utilisation of the funds provided by the Government of
India, to take appropriate steps towards securing
financial discipline and for initiation of the process of
de-recognition of respondent no. 2 as the National
Sport Federation for the sport of hockey.
</p><p id="p_20">(c) Issue a writ of certiorari, quo warranto or any
other writ or direction in the nature thereof calling for
the records of respondent no. 2 and thereafter
quashing the election of respondent no. 3 and 4 as the
President and Hony. Secretary General respectively
being contrary to the rules dated 14.08.2001 framed
by the Government of India.
</p><p id="p_21">(d) Issue a writ of certiorari or any other writ or
direction in the nature thereof holding clause 8 of the
constitution of respondent no. 2 to be ultra vires,
illegal in the event it is contended by respondents 2-4
that any person can continue for perpetuity as the
President or Hony. Secretary General of respondent
no. 2 and that clause 8 of the Constitution of
respondent no. 2 is not subject to the prohibition
imposed by the Government of India rules dated
14.08.2001 prohibiting continuation as such for a
period of more than 8 years.
</p><p id="p_22">(e) Issue an appropriate writ of prohibition or
direction in the nature thereof restraining the
respondent no. 3 and 4 from either continuing as the
President and Hony. Secretary General of respondent
no. 2 or from contesting the elections for the post of
President    and    Honorary     Secretary    General
respectively for the fourth consecutive term in
contravention to the Revised Guidelines for Assistance
to National Sports Federation dated 14.08.2001.
</p><p id="p_23">(f)  Issue a writ of prohibition or any other direction
in the nature thereof restraining respondents no. 2-4
to conduct the elections to the post of Senior Vice
President before 28.01.2006.
</p><p id="p_24">(g)   Issue an appropriate order writ or directions to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">                           5</span>
           the respondents to furnish the information that has
          been sought for by the petitioner from time to time
          through various communications including the last
          communication dated 21.01.2005 and 17.02.2005.
</p><p id="p_25">          (h) Pass any other orders which this Hon'ble Court
          deems fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of
          the case."
</p>
<p id="p_26">
</p><p id="p_27">7.      The respondents appeared and have opposed the writ petition

on all material facts relating to the merits of the complaints. There

is vehement denial of all allegations of mismanagement and financial

irregularities by the respondent nos. 2 to 4. In view of the discussion

in the later part of the judgment, I am not dwelling at the point wise

response of the respondents at this stage.           The various legal

objections to the maintainability of the writ petition by respondent

nos. 2 to 4 assailing the very existence of the clause in the

guidelines; legislative competence of the Union Government to

legislate with regard to the subject of sports and hence power to

issue     executive   instructions;   bindingness   of   the   guidelines;

competence of this court to issue a writ of mandamus to enforce non-

statutory guidelines and entitlement to any relief of the petitioner

have been challenged.
</p>
<p id="p_28">        The respondent no. 1 has not joined issue with the objections

raised by the respondents.
</p>
<p id="p_29">8.      Alongwith the writ petition, the petitioner has filed CM No.

5616/2005 praying for an interim direction to the respondents to

hold any future Annual General Meeting in accordance with the

applicable rules and regulations. A further prohibition was sought



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">                                      6</span>
 restraining the respondent nos. 3 and 4 from participating in the

election process of the respondent no. 2 otherwise than in

accordance with the guidelines dated 14th August, 2001 and inter

alia, a prayer was made not to hold any election to the post of Senior

Vice President till 28th January, 2006. As the hearing in the matter

was protracted and could not be completed by the parties, by an

order passed on 20th May, 2005, it was directed that the respondent

nos. 2 to 4 may proceed with the Annual General Meeting which was

proposed to be held on 23rd May, 2005.    However, in case elections

were not held, the result thereof shall not be declared and be kept in

sealed cover.
</p>
<p id="p_30">9.    Each objection taken by the respondents is of tremendous

importance so far as the issue of sports is concerned.       For this

reason, the same are dealt with hereafter in the seriatum in which

the factual context would require them to be considered.

</p><p id="p_31">10.   Sports has traditionally been considered an integral and

inseparable part of education. Measures in respect thereof fell to the

jurisdiction of the Department of Education under the Ministry of

Education &amp; Social Welfare of the Government of India under the

Allocation of Business Rules framed by the Legislature in exercise of

powers under the Constitution of India. From as far back as in 1975,

the Government was deeply concerned with the growing criticism in

Parliament, Press and otherwise of the low standard of sports and

games and had so stated in the circular no. F.11-4/74-SPI dated the

20th September, 1975.       It was also noted that the primary


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                  7</span>
 responsibility for the development and management of sports and

games   in    the   country   especially   as   the   necessary   base   for

competence in competitions overseas, rests with the Indian Olympic

Association/National/Sports Federations/Associations. As the efforts

of these organisations had fallen short of the country's expectations,

leading to widespread public concern, issues of necessary remedial

action were raised. The Government was concerned with the inability

to raise standards to international levels. It was also aware that the

various national organisations dealing with sports and games had

autonomous functioning.         In this circular the Government had

clearly expressed that it had no desire to interfere either with the

internal working or the autonomy of these organisations. However

consistent with its obligations, it was felt that the Government had to

lay down certain norms with reference to which the Government's

assistance and its instrumentality should, on occasions, be made

available to the Indian Olympic Association/the National Sports

Federations/National Sports Associations.
</p>
<p id="p_32">      In this background, the Government of India had considered

the matter carefully in consultation with the All India Council of

Sport and therefore decided that in the interest of promotion of

sports and games, the government's financial and other assistance

shall be extended only to those national organisations dealing with

sports and games which fulfilled certain conditions laid down in its

guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_33">11.   It is noteworthy that these guidelines were finalised on a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                     8</span>
 careful and prolonged consideration in inter-ministerial consultation

and with all those concerned and were titled as "Improvement of

Standard of Sports and Games in the country - Conditions For

Financial         and   Other    Assistance    to   National    Sports

Federation/Associations etc.".
</p>
<p id="p_34">12.   The Indian Olympic Association          had participated in the

consideration and even requested for time to bring the constitution

of the Indian Olympic Association and concerned National Sports

Federations in line with the guidelines framed by the Government.

The same is apparent from a reading of clause 4, 5 and 6 of the

communication dated 20th September, 1975 of the Government of

India which read thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">      "4. The guidelines, as enumerated above, have been finalised
      after careful consideration of the points raised by the Indian
      Olympic Association, National Sports Federation/Associations,
      consequent on issue of this Ministry's earlier letter No. F.11-
      4/74-YSS 1(2) dated 9th April, 1974, and on the basis of the
      advice of the All India Council of Sports. The views expressed
      by these organisations have been accommodated to the fullest
      extent possible, consistent with the purpose for which the
      guidelines are prescribed.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_9">      5.    However, at the request of the IOA, Government have
      agreed, as a special case to give time to the IOA and the
      concerned National Sports Federations to change their
      respective constitutions, finalise fresh elections where
      necessary and take all other consequential action to fully and
      finally implement the guidelines before the dates indicated
      below :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_10">            (i)     National Sports Federations/Associations 1.12.1975
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_11">            (ii)    Indian Olympic Association 31.1.1976
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_12">      6.   The IOA/National Sports Federations/Associations are now
      requested to confirm immediately, but not later than
      15.10.1975, that the guidelines as stipulated in this letter, are
      acceptable to them, and that necessary action to implement the
      "Guidelines" has been initiated. Details of the arrangements

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                     9</span>
       made with regard to the amendment of the constitutions and
      holding of fresh elections may also please be intimated."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_35">13.   The guidelines and conditions were circulated by the Ministry

of Education &amp; Social Welfare on 20th September, 1975 to all

Presidents/Secretaries of the Indian Olympic Association; and the

President's/Secretary's   of   all   national   sports   federations   and

associations. These guidelines inter alia stipulated that in order to be

eligible for financial and other assistance, the national organisation

was required to fulfil the following conditions :-

 "(i). An office bearer of a National Federation/Association may
 hold office as such for one term of 4 years, and may be eligible
 for re-election for a like term or period.
</p><p id="p_36"> (ii). No such office bearer shall hold office consecutively for
 more than two terms or 8 years:"
</p>
<p id="p_37">
</p><p id="p_38">      The expression 'office bearer' was defined in explanation 1 as

the President; Secretary; the Secretary General or any other

corresponding office and the treasurer. Clause (i) of explanation 2

declared that no person who had already held these offices in the

National Federation/Association consecutively for two terms or 8

years shall be eligible to seek re-election to any of the said offices or

Vice-President or Treasurer till the expiry of a period of at least four

years from the date on which he last vacated his office.

</p><p id="p_39">      The clause with regard to the tenure restriction of the named

office bearer was in operation right from 1975 when the Government

made the guidelines applicable for the purposes of recognition and



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                     10</span>
 assistance from it were concerned.
</p>
<p id="p_40">14.   With the passage of time, several national sports federations

came into existence for the development of specific games/sports

disciplines. In achieving their objectives, the Government of India

actively supported these federations. The existing guidelines for

assisting such national sports federations had been reviewed and

revised based on the experience for preparation of the Asian Games,

1994; Olympic Games, 1996. Recommendations of the committees

set up for promotion of sports were also taken into consideration. It

appears that some revision of the guidelines was given effect to from

10th July, 1997.
</p>
<p id="p_41">15.   These revised guidelines were circulated as an order of the

Government of India with the letter dated 14th August, 2001 which

records that the revision was further to the revised guidelines

circulated by the Ministry with its letter dated 16th July, 1997. It was

pointed out that the guidelines stood amended upon consideration of

suggestions received from the Indian Olympic Association and the

National Sports Federations with the approval of the Ministry of

Finance, Department of Expenditure. The Government order clearly

stated that the amended provisions would come into force with

immediate effect.    So far as the term of the office bearer was

concerned, there was no amendment to the prescription made in the

guidelines circulated with the approval of the Department of

Expenditure, Ministry of Finance. The Government order clearly



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">                                   11</span>
 stated that the amended provisions would come into force with

immediate effect.
</p>
<p id="p_42">16.     The petitioner has urged that the revised guidelines satisfied

all requirements of the manner in which a Government order is to be

made and circulated as prescripted in <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_1">Article 166</a> of the Constitution

of India and became binding and applicable. It has been submitted

that the disbursement of grants and assistance was effected in terms

of these guidelines to the various National Sports Federations

including the respondent no. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_43">17.    Though the respondents have tried to urge that the guidelines

originally were formulated during the period of emergency in the

year 1975, but from perusal of the guidelines issued on 20th

September, 1975, it is evident that they were under contemplation

and consideration from 1974.      The period which was taken before

the issuance of the guidelines in September, 1975 was occupied in

consideration of the suggestions from the various agencies and the

fact that a state of emergency had been declared in June, 1975

would    not   influence   adjudication   on   the   bindingness   of   the

guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_44">18.    The Government recognised sports and games as an essential

ingredient of the human resource development.           The amendments

were made keeping in view the discussions held by the Government

with    the    Indian   Olympic   Association    and    National   Sports

Federations, which marked an important departure from the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">                                    12</span>
 approach followed in the past. Amongst others, the revision provided

for an emphasis on professionalising and upgrading administrative

and financial management of federations; detailed guidelines for

preparation of long term development plans; tripartite agreements

between the National Sports Federations, the department and the

Sports Authority of India; defined criterion for priority categorisation

for Government assistance; a discipline specific project approach for

processing cases for financial assistance; development of systems to

handle players' grievances inter alia were provided for.

</p><p id="p_45">      The amendments were necessary to streamline the procedure

for effective coordination amongst various agencies involved in

promotion of sports and to extend required infrastructure, training

and other facilities to the sports persons for achieving excellence in

the international events in the coming years.
</p>
<p id="p_46">19.   It is noteworthy that these guidelines incorporated innovation

also as 'the flow of funds to federations would also include a

substantial portion of the events of other major schemes of the

department apart from grants to National Federations'.              The

perspective of the guidelines was stated in clause 1.4 which was to

help federations achieve financial self sufficiency over a period of

time thereby reducing their dependence on Government.

</p><p id="p_47">20.   In view of the long submissions addressed by the respondents

      priorities, and to detail the procedures to be followed by the
      Federations, to avail of Government sponsorship and
      assistance.

<p id="p_48">21.    In clause IV, the respondent no. 1 had indicated that it would

prioritise     sports   disciplines   for   special   focus   and    work   out

differential patterns of assistance based on their status and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">                                       14</span>
 performance. The priority category included such sports which are

included in the Olympic, Commonwealth and Asian Games or such

other sports for which internationally recognised tournaments are

held in which at least 20 countries participated subject to fulfilment

of certain conditions.
</p>
<p id="p_49">      So far as hockey is concerned, both men and women hockey is

included at serial no. 8 and 9 of the priority sports discipline.

</p><p id="p_50">22.   With a view to codify the requirements for granting recognition

at the discretion of the Government to the national level federations

the Government has included Guidelines for Recognition of National

Sports Federations' and Annexure II to the Guidelines. Clause 2.2

thereto states that recognition shall mean recognition of the

leadership of the federation in the development of a particular sport

in the country.
</p>
<p id="p_51">23.   The amended guidelines also contain a tenure clause for office

bearers which reads as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">       "3.5. Tenure of the Office-bearers:- The tenure of
       office-bearers shall be in accordance with the
       Government Orders issued under letter No. 11-4/74-
       SP.I dated 20th September, 1975 (copy placed at
       Annexure-XI). As per above Orders, Office-bearers of
       NSI's may hold office for one term of four years and
       may be eligible for re-election for a like term or period
       provided the office bearers have secured not less than
       2/3 votes of the members. However, no such office-
       bearers shall hold office consecutively for more than
       two terms or eight years."</blockquote><p id="p_52">

</p><p id="p_53">      Clause 3.10 states that 'at the national level, there will be only

one recognised federation for each discipline of sport'. This clause



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">                                    15</span>
 creates a monopolistic status for the national sports federation which

is recognised under the guidelines.              Only the duly recognised

national sports federation would be entitled to financial grants as

admissible under the guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_54">          Clause 3.17 mandates that the federation must be autonomous

and resist all pressures of any kind whatsoever, whether of a

political, religious, racial or economic nature.

</p><p id="p_55">24.       While laying down these conditions, the Government clearly

declared the reasons for the same and stated as follows :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">      "      5.1 xxxx. The intention is further to ensure that NSFs

      maintain certain basic standards, norms and procedures with

      regard to their internal functioning, which conform to the high

      International Federation, and which are also in complete

      consonance with the principles laid down in the Olympic

      Charter    or   in   the   constitution    of    the   Indian   Olympic

      Association."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_56">25.       While laying down the manner in which the federation seeking

recognition would have to apply, the respondent no. 1 had stated

thus:-
</p>
<pre id="pre_2">           "5.2 II    While      considering   the       proposals     for

           following:
                The current legal status of the Organisation

</p>
<p id="p_60">

</p><p id="p_61">26.   In clause 5.3, the Ministry reserved the right to suspend or

withdraw the recognition of the National Sports Federation in the

event of a serious irregularities being detected in their internal

functioning. The procedure and consequences of suspension and de-

recognition were also indicated as an annexure 3 to the guidelines.

</p><p id="p_62">27.   Clause 5.1 states that recognition of a federation shall not be a

matter of right and shall be purely at the discretion of the

Government of India which may grant recognition subject to such

terms and conditions as it deems fit. The Government has retained

the power to withdraw recognition which would disentitle the

federation from consideration of any proposal till the cause of the

suspension or withdrawal of the recognition is settled to the

satisfaction of the Government of India.
</p>
<p id="p_63">28.   Condition IV in clause 6.1 prescribes that in order to be eligible

for financial assistance and sponsorship, the organisation must

maintain their recognised status with the department. Clause 6.2

stated that the National Sports Federation would be eligible for

assistance under these guidelines immediately after recognition. The

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                    17</span>
 funds to the National Sports Federation would flow as grants or from

other schemes of the department for the purposes of the training

requirements; purchase of equipment; participation in tournaments

abroad       hosting   and   holding    tournaments     in   India   including

international tournaments and for administrative support.              Priority

category sports were entitled to financial assistance for coaches as

well as sports personnel; travelling expenses of players, residence,

board, lodging, training etc; assistance for purchase of sports

equipments; full assistance for participation in international events

as the Olympic, World, Asian, Commonwealth, SAF and Afro Asian

Championships/Games or mandatorily required international pre-

qualifying tournaments for these championships. Allowances for

board and lodging etc were also provided as additional assistance

detailed in the guidelines for other events including national level

championships, their organisation etc is also prescripted under these

guidelines.
</p>
<p id="p_64">29.   Other aspects of the guidelines are provided in clause IX and

include clubbing and dove trailing of schemes of the Sports Authority

of India and the Ministry which have a direct bearing on the

promotion and development of sports in the country for which

tripartite     agreements     may      be    signed   between    the    Sports

Federations, the Ministry and the Sports Authority of India.

</p><p id="p_65">      The guidelines in para 10 also provided the selection of sports

persons for participation in major international events.



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                        18</span>
</p><p id="p_66"> 30.   In Clause 10.1 of the Guidelines, it is stated that the National

Sports Federations are primarily responsible for judicious selection

of the sports persons for participation in major international events

based on merit and with the objective of enhancing national prestige

and bringing glory to the country. It is observed that the best sports

persons/team has to be chosen for representing the country.       The

Government has recognised that its intervention be minimised but in

recognition of the need to be associated+, instead of nominees of the

Government or Sports Authority of India, the guidelines now

stipulated that the Selection Committee would be constituted by the

Federation comprising of the President, National Coach and eminent

sports persons.    The Government intervention was restricted to

appointing an observer for each discipline who would be associated

with all activities of the National Federation. The national coach

under clause 10.5 is required to be selected by a committee with the

president of the concerned NSF as its chairman; the Director

General, Sports Authority of India; executive director (Teams); one

international (preferably an Arjun Awardee or an international medal

winner) to be nominated by a Government nominee of the Indian

Olympic Association as its members. The coach would be shortlisted

from a panel prepared by the Sports Authority of India. The national

coach would be appointed by the Sports Authority of India after a

careful consideration of the name recommended by the Selection

Committee.

 a society registered under the Societies Registration enactment.

</p><p id="p_68">31.   A preliminary an objection has been raised that the

petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_3">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India seeking

issuance of a writ against the respondent no. 2/Indian Hockey

Federation is not maintainable on the ground that it is a

society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_4">Societies Registration Act</a>.

</p><p id="p_69">32.   The very issue urged in the present writ petition arose before

the Division Bench of this court in the pronouncement reported at

114 (2004) DLT 323 <a href="/doc/730954/" id="a_5">Rahul Mehra &amp; Anr. vs. UOI &amp; Ors. An</a>

objection to the maintainability of the petition against the Board of

Control for Cricket of India (a society registered under the Tamil

Nadu Societies Registration Act) was taken. The court observed that

the Government having entered into fields of commerce, industry

and business and private bodies taking up public functions and

duties, the distinction between public law and private law based on

the public or private character of the institution as a result of the

overlap, is no longer clearcut or water tight and law is necessarily

required to remain alive to these dynamics and has to be moulded

keeping in view the changes and developments in society.

</p><p id="p_70">33.   Placing reliance on important judicial precedents of the Apex

Court wherein a similar question had been raised, the Division Bench

has culled down the applicable principles with utmost clarity which

deserve to be considered in extenso and read thus :

</p><p id="p_71">        "9. <a href="/doc/1728255/" id="a_6">In Anadi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee Vandas

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                 20</span>
 Rudani</a>: (1989) 2 SCC 691, the Supreme Court
succinctly put this issue beyond the pale of
controversy in the following words :-
</p><p id="p_72">''20. The term ''authority'' used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_7">Article 226</a>, in the
context, must receive a liberal meaning unlike the
term in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_8">Article 12.</a> <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_9">Article 12</a> is relevant only for the
purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights under
<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_10">Article 32.</a> <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_11">Article 226</a> confers power on the High
Courts to issue writs for enforcement of the
fundamental rights as well as non-fundamental rights.
The words ''any person or authority'' used in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_12">Article
226</a> are, therefore, not to be confined only to statutory
authorities and instrumentalities of the State. They
may cover any other person or body performing public
duty. The form of the body concerned is not very much
relevant. What is relevant is the nature of the duty
imposed on the body. The duty must be judged in the
light of positive obligation with by the person or
authority to the affected party. No matter by what
means the duty is imposed, if a positive obligation
exists, mandamus cannot be denied.''

(underlining added)
The decision in Andi Mukta (supra) was further
explained in <a href="/doc/1620518/" id="a_13">Vst Industries Ltd. v. Vst Industries
Workers' Union</a>: (2001) 1 SCC 298 where the Supreme
Court observed as follows [at page 306] :-
</p><p id="p_73">''In Anadi Mukta case this Court examined the various
aspects and the distinction between an authority and a
person and after analysis of the decisions referred in
that regard came to the conclusion that it is only in the
circumstances when the authority or the person
performs a public function or discharges a public duty
that <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_14">Article 226</a> of the Constitution can be invoked.''

And, then in <a href="/doc/1703259/" id="a_15">G. Bassi Reddy v. International Crops
Research Institute</a>:(2003) 4 SCC 225 the Supreme
Court held:-
</p><p id="p_74">''28. A writ under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_16">Article 226</a> can lie against a
''person'' if it is a statutory body or performs a public
function or discharges a public or statutory duty

<a href="/doc/1620518/" id="a_19">VST Industries Ltd. v. Workers' Union</a>)...... Although, it
is not easy to define what a public function or public
duty is, it can reasonably be said that such functions
are similar to or closely related to those performable
by the State in its sovereign capacity.''

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                          21</span>
         Ultimately, in <a href="/doc/123551693/" id="a_20">Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas</a>:
        (2003) 10 SCC 733:
</p><p id="p_75">        ''From the decisions referred to above, the position
        that emerges is that a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_21">Article 226</a>
        of the Constitution of India may be maintainable
        against (i) the State (Government); (ii) an authority;
</p><p id="p_76">        (iii) a statutory body; (iv) an instrumentality or agency
        of the State; (v) a company which is financed and
        owned by the State; (vi) a private body run
        substantially on State funding; (vii) a private body
        discharging public duty or positive obligation of public
        nature; and (viii) a person or a body under liability to
        discharge any function under any statute, to compel it
        to perform such a statutory function.''

        (underlining added)"
</p><p id="p_77">34.   On a consideration of these binding principles, the Division

Bench laid down the applicable test thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">        "8. Governments have ventured into the private arena
        and private bodies, likewise, have undertaken public
        duties or public functions. There is a degree of overlap
        and the distinction is no longer clear-cut or
        watertight. The law must be alive to these dynamics.
        Accordingly, the question of maintainability of a writ
        petition must not be addressed from the standpoint of
        amenability. Everybody is amenable to the jurisdiction
        of the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_22">article 226.</a> However, Courts
        have exercised restraint and they exercise these
        powers only in cases which involve public law.
        therefore, the ''litmus'' test for invoking the writ
        jurisdiction is whether the act complained of is in the
        discharge of a public duty or a public function. It
        matters little as to who discharges the public duty or
        performs the public function. And so too, the source of
        the power to discharge or perform such duty or
        function. Whether the person is empowered by statute
        or some governmental order or whether such person
        arrogates to himself the power to perform a public
        function or discharge a public duty, is of no
        consequence. What is to be seen is whether there is an
        infraction in the discharge of such duty or function. If
        there is, the High Court has power to correct it by
        issuing an order, direction or writ to any person.
        Funding is also not an issue. A privately funded




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">                                  22</span>
         private organisation but discharging a public duty
        would still be within the ''net'' of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_23">article 226."</a>
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_26">                                       (Emphasis supplied)

      It is these principles which would guide adjudication of the

issue before this court.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_78">35.   The wider ambit of the jurisdiction of the High Court in exercise

of its extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_24">Article 226</a> of the Constitution

of India as compared to the scope of a writ petition before the

Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_25">Article 32</a> needs no elaboration.

</p><p id="p_79">36.   A question arose before the Apex Court in the judgment

reported at JT 2005 (2) SC 8 <a href="/doc/404603/" id="a_26">Zee Telefilms Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. UOI

&amp; Ors</a>. as to whether the Board of Control for cricket of India

('Board' hereafter) was not a 'state' within the meaning of <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_27">article 12</a>

of the Constitution of India.
</p>
<p id="p_80">      In para 30 of the pronouncement, the majority view was

expressed that it cannot be denied that the BCCI does discharge

some duties like the selection of an Indian cricket team, controlling

the activities of the players and others involved in the game of

cricket which activities can be said to be akin to 'public duties' or

'state functions'.   The position that the BCCI was exercising public

functions and was performing a public duty was accepted. It was,

however, held that the BCCI was in the nature of a private body

exercising public functions and performing public duties and that by

itself did not suffice to make such a body a state for the purposes of

<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_28">article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and for this reason, a writ

petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_29">article 32</a> of the Constitution would not lie to the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                  23</span>
 Supreme Court.          However, if there was any violation of any

constitutional or statutory obligation or rights of other citizen,           an

aggrieved party can seek remedy under the ordinary course of law or

by way of a writ petition under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_30">article 226</a> of the Constitution before

the high courts.
</p>
<p id="p_81">37.   The petitioners have urged at length that in any case no writ

could be issued against the Indian Hockey Federation for the reason

that it is not performing any statutory functions.

</p><p id="p_82">38.   Both the     majority   and    minority    views     in   Zee    Telefilms

concluded that judicial review against action of the BCCI would lie.

The divergence came in the remedy. There was no divergence on

the view that judicial review over the action of the national level

sports body could be exercised by the high courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_31">Article 226</a>

of the Constitution of India.       While the minority held that a writ

petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_32">Article 32</a> before the Apex Court would also be

maintainable, the majority judgment that an aggrieved party may not

have relief by way of a petition under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_33">article 32</a> before the Supreme

Court but can always seek remedy under the ordinary course of law

and also under the Constitution by way of a writ petition under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_34">Article 226.</a>
</p>
<p id="p_83">39.   The   evolution   of jurisprudence        on   the   issue      in several

international pronouncements would guide consideration of this

objection. These have been relied upon in the minority judgment in

Zee Telefilms. It has been considered that when a public function is

delegated by a state to a board (Ref : Brentfood Academy vs.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                     24</span>
 Tennesee Secondary School Athletic Association. 531 US 288;

Pennsylvania vs. Board of Directors of City Trust of Philadephia 353

US 230, 331; I L Ed 2d        792; 77 S Ct 806 (1957); or when such

function is in terms of Governmental policies, or when the

Government is entwised in the management or control of such board;

a nominally private entity has been treated as a state actor (Ref :

Wests vs. Atkins at 56, 101 L Ed 2d 40; Edmonson vs. Leeseville

Concrete Co 500 US 614, 627 &amp; 628). It was further held that the

character of a legal entity is determined neither by its expressly

private characterisation in statutory law nor by the failure of the law

to    acknowledge   the   entities   in    separability   from   recognised

government officials or agencies.
</p>
<p id="p_84">40.    The powers of the High Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_35">Article 226</a> are plenary

and it is constitutionally empowered to issue directions, orders or

writs to 'any person' for the enforcement of a fundamental right and

'for any other purpose'.      However, as a rule of prudence and

convenience, the courts have avoided interference in matters

involving disputed questions of law or where alternate remedies for

dispute resolution are available.         The courts have also restrained

their hands where the dispute raised is of a purely private nature

without any 'public law' element. However just as state activity has

not remained confined to the narrow issues of governance; private

enterprises are also not confined to areas of private activity and

there is a tremendous interplay between private players and activity

of public nature, with or without direct Government intervention or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">                                     25</span>
 involvement.

<p id="p_85">41.   Increasingly courts are giving an expanded definition to the

rights     of    citizens.   In    the      judgment        reported    at

<a href="/doc/539407/" id="a_36">MANU/SC/0246/1995 Secretary, Ministry of Information                    &amp;

Broadcasting,        Government   of     India   &amp;   Ors.    vs.   Cricket

Association of Bengal &amp; Ors</a>., the Apex Court was concerned with

an issue as to the rights under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_37">Art. 19(1)(a)</a> in the context of the

right to telecast a sporting event and held that when a telecaster

desires to telecast a sporting event, it was held that it would

incorrect to say that the free speech element is absent from this

right.   Sports is a form of expressive conduct. The right to freedom

of speech and expression under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_38">article 19 (1) (a)</a> also includes the

right to educate, to inform, to entertain and also the right to be

educated, informed and entertained.
</p>
<p id="p_86">42.   There are, however, limitations on the extent of judicial review

and the parameters in respect thereof were also laid down by the

Division Bench of this court in <a href="/doc/730954/" id="a_39">Rahul Mehra &amp; Anr. vs. UOI &amp; Ors.

The</a> delineation of the applicable principles of law laid down by the

Bench applies on all fours to the issues raised before this court which

reads as follows:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_27">         "15.   The    petitioner  reiterated   the    following
         observations of the learned single Judge in Ajay Jadeja
         (supra), adopting the same as his submissions:-</blockquote><p id="p_87">
</p><p id="p_88">         ''When the Government stands by and lets a body like
         BCCI assume the prerogative of being a sole
         representative of India for cricket by permitting BCCI
         to choose the team for India for appearance in events
         like the World Cup, then it necessarily imbues BCCI
         with the public functions at least in or far as the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">                                   26</span>
 selection of the team to represent India and India's
representation in International Cricket fora and
regulation of Cricket in India is concerned. Thus the
monopoly status of the respondent No. 2 is evident. It
is also clear that such monopoly status is indisputably
state recognized as evident from the later of Ministry
of Culture, Youth Affairs an Sports dated 22nd
December 2000 and indeed by acquiescence of the
Government, can be considered state conferred.
Similarly the plea of the BCCI that it does not own or
lease the stadia is of no consequence as the stadia are
owned and leased by its members and it is not
disputed that all international matches are played in
such stadia. Similarly membership of BCCI of the
International Cricket Conference (ICC) cannot ipso
facto imply that it is not amenable to writ jurisdiction.
In fact BCCI represented India on this own showing
and depending upon the nature of the action
impugned, would be amenable to writ jurisdiction.''

We agree. BCCI, like everyone else, is amenable to
writ jurisdiction. However, not every action of BCCI
would be subject to the scrutiny of judicial review.
Only those actions which fall within the ambit of public
law would call for any direction, order or writ under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_40">article 226.</a> Disputes or acts in the sphere of pure
private law having no traces of public law would not be
the subject matter of writs, directions or order to be
issued under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_41">article 226.</a>
</p><p id="p_89">17. At the cost of repetition, we may state that the
whole ''amenability'' issue is misplaced. A body, public
or private, cannot be categorised as ''amenable'' or
''not amenable'' to writ jurisdiction. The ''function''
test is the correct one to test maintainability. If a
public duty or public function is involved, any body,
public or private, qua that duty or function, and
limited to that, would be subject to judicial scrutiny
under the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of article
</p><p id="p_90">226. The BCCI which is the smile repository of
everything cricket in India has attained this ''giant''
stature through its organisation, skill, the craze for
the game in India and last but not the least by the
tacit approval of the Government. Its objects are the
functions and duties it has arrogated to itself. Many of
these are in the nature of public duties and functions.
Others may be in the field of private law such as
private contracts, internal rules not affecting the
public at large etc.,. therefore, BCCI cannot be said to
be beyond the sweep of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_42">article 226</a> in all eventualities

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">                           27</span>
         for all times to come. That is the certificate that BCCI
        wants from this court. We are afraid, we cannot grant
        that. Consequently, this petition cannot be thrown out
        on the maintainability issue.
</p><p id="p_91">        This does not necessarily mean that the petitioners
        would be entitled to the orders, directions or writs
        that they seek. That will have to be examined on
        merits."

<p id="p_92">
</p><p id="p_93">43.   There is no dispute that the Indian Hockey Federation

represents the nation at the international bodies in matters relating

to hockey. In 483 US 522 : 1997 L.Ed. 2d 427 San Francisco Arts &amp;

Athletics,   Inc.   vs.   United   States   Olympic    Committee    and

International Olympic Committee, it was stated by Brennan, J that

the United States Olympic Committee performs a distinctive

traditional government function representing the nation to the

International Olympic Committee.
</p>
<p id="p_94">      The same can be said of the Indian Hockey Federation and its

office bearers who represent the country and the board at

international forums.
</p>
<p id="p_95">44.   As per the bye laws and constitution of Indian Hockey

Federation placed on record.       Its address is the 'National Stadium,

New Delhi'.     Clause 2 governing the jurisdiction states that the

jurisdiction of the Federation shall extend over the whole of the

Indian union. Under clause 3 of the Memorandum as ell as Rules &amp;

Regulations of IHF - the respondent no. 2, its objects are inter alia

'to promote, encourage and develop the game of hockey in the Indian

union; to maintain general control of the game of hockey in the

Indian union and to keep it on the highest level of amateurism in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">                                    28</span>
 sports; to coordinate inter member activities in all possible ways

involving   holding of inter member tournaments and national

championships tournaments; to encourage the formation of state,

regional and other associations for the control of the game in such

territory as may be assigned to them; to select teams to represent

India; to promote, control and finance visits of such teams abroad; to

control and regulate the terms and visits of any hockey team for the

Union of India going abroad; to promote control, if necessary, to

finance the visits to India of foreign teams' amongst other functions.'

      In the definition clause, a 'member' is defined as any state or

regional body or a unit of a National character affiliated as a member

of the federation. Its membership under clause 3 is confined to the

controlling body for hockey in any state within the Indian union and

anybody or a unit of a national character to which the federation in

its discretion may grant affiliation'.
</p>
<p id="p_96">      As per the Memorandum placed on record by the petitioner, it

had   thirty   three   member     associations   which   includes   state

associations, Railway &amp; Services Sports Control Boards.

</p><p id="p_97">45.   So far as the BCCI was concerned, it was found that it received

no financial assistance from the State and that the Government does

not exercise any control over BCCI and non-statutory body. It had

also not received recognition under the guidelines from the

Government.     For this reason, an argument was raised before the

court that it is a non-statutory body and no public duties were

imposed upon it by statute but that it was a society in the nature of a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                    29</span>
 'private club'.
</p>
<p id="p_98">      In Rahul Mehra (supra) the Division Bench rejected this

argument as untenable holding that attention to the source of power

is misplaced and that "the error arose in viewing the classical

prerogative writs of, inter alia, certiorari, mandamus and prohibition

in the traditional sense as being used only against the government or

public authorities."
</p>
<p id="p_99">46.   The Division Bench compared the extensive powers conferred

on the High Courts under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_43">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, vis

a vis the traditional limited scope of judicial review under English

Law and held thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_28">       "13. The BCCI has a monopoly over organized cricket
       in India. Every youngster, maybe an aspiring Rahul
       Dravid or an Irfan Pathan, who dreams to play cricket
       for his State or zone or India cannot do so without the
       permission and approval of the BCCI. We must not
       forget that cricket, is no longer what it used to be. It
       is not just a sport which people dressed in white
       flannels and rolled up shirt-sleeves enjoyed on lazy
       summer's afternoons in England between sips of tea
       and munches of scones. It is no longer the reserve of
       the nawabs, the maharajas, the brown sahibs and the
       rich who had the time and the inclination. It now
       permeates all levels of society. To many it presents
       itself as an opportunity to a better livelihood. Cases
       abound in India, where cricket has brought financial
       succour to persons and their families who were
       otherwise doomed to lead lives enslaved in poverty.
       Cricket is regarded as a profession, an avocation.
       Many in India, play cricket not just for the love of the
       game but for to heir own survival. The BCCI performs
       the vital public duty and function of providing this
       opportunity. It has an elaborate network and is a
       massive organisation controlling every aspect of
       cricket in India. Dr Singhvi, the learned senior counsel
       who appealed on behalf of BCCI, submitted that no
       part of the capital of BCCI is held by the Government;
       no financial assistance of the State is enjoyed by it;

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                  30</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_29">           the Government does not exercise any control over it;
          BCCI is a non-statutory body; no public duty is
          imposed upon it by statute; it is a society, nothing but
          a ''private club'' and as such issuance of a writ against
          it would be completely beyond the scope of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_44">article 226</a>
          of the Constitution of India. This argument is
          untenable in the light of the discussion above.
          Attention to the source of the power is misplaced.
          Perhaps, the error arises in viewing the classical
          prerogative writs of, inter alia, certiorari, mandamus
          and prohibition in the traditional sense as being used
          only against the government or public authorities.
          English law is struggling to break out of this tradition
          and the scope of judicial review, while it is expanding
          is doing so ever so slowly and lags behind even Scots
          law18. In India, we have no such difficulty as the
          framers of our Constitution have unshackled us from
          the traditional fetters and have given us <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_45">Article 226</a>
          which is much wider because it contemplates the
          issuance of ''directions, orders or writs, including
          writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus,
          prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of
          them, for the enforcement of any of the rights
          conferred by Part III and for any other purpose'' to
          ''any person or authority, including in appropriate
          cases, any Government''. The fact that the
          Government has no financial stake in or control over
          BCCI is, therefore, not relevant. We are not examining
          the issue as to whether BCCI falls within the meaning
          of ''State'' as defined in <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_46">article 12.</a> And, we need not,
          because the word ''State'' does not appear in <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_47">article
          226</a> at all! We are examining the question of issuance
          of orders, directions or writs to ''any person''.
          Assuming that the BCCI is merely a ''private club'',
          even then a writ could be issued to it provided, of
          course, it was for remedying an infraction of a public
          duty or Public function."

<p id="p_100">47.   Just as the BCCI controlling the game of cricket in India, it is

not disputed that the Indian Hockey Federation controls the game of

hockey in the country at all levels whether it be the sub-junior,

junior,    senior   level   players    or    the   state,   zonal,   national   or

international tournaments.            Its members are the state hockey



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                        31</span>
 associations and boards of government departments as railways and

services also controlling the game in their services all over the

country etc. The Indian Hockey Federation has been recognised as a

national sports federation.   Akin to the control of the BCCI over

cricket players, the Indian Hockey Federation exercises complete

control over team selection and appointment of referees and umpires

organisations of the several hockey events. The Indian Hockey

Federation also imparts coaching and is required to be concerned

with the welfare of the hockey players. It has access to the national

sports coaches as well as sports facilities generated, developed and

maintained by the Government of India. At international forums and

sports events, the team selected by the Indian Hockey Federation is

known as the Indian team, wears the Indian colours and carries the

National Flag.   The team selected by it as representing India is so

recognised by not only this country but against the international

opponents.
</p>
<p id="p_101">48.   The Indian Hockey Federation regulates the sport of hockey for

the entire country.   The Federation represents India in international

bodies,   agencies,   associations        and   forums;   appoints   India's

representative thereto and maintains control and regulation over

coaches, umpires, players and managers etc. There can be no denial

that the respondent no. 2 is performing public functions.

</p><p id="p_102">49.   The submission on behalf of the respondents also fails to

consider the wide powers conferred under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_48">article 226</a> of the

Constitution of India noted hereinabove. Furthermore, this objection


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                     32</span>
 to the maintainability of the writ petition on the ground that the

Indian Hockey Federation was a private registered body is contrary

to the well settled legal principles and is held to be legally untenable.

Legislative competence of the Union of India for framing laws

for   regulating     sports   at   the     Inter-state,    National     and

International level.
</p>
<p id="p_103">50.   Placing reliance on entry 33 of list II of the 7th Schedule of the

Constitution of India, the respondents including the Union of India

have submitted that the parliament has no power to make laws on

the subject of sports. It has further been urged that in view of the

mandate of <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_49">article 73</a>, the executive power of the union extends to

the subject matter on which the parliament alone is competent to

make law.     It is consequently urged that the parliament does not

have the legislative competence to frame any law on the subject

matter of sports as the same is covered as Entry 33 under the List II

which is within the legislative competence of the state and further

that the Union of India has also no power to issue any executive

instructions or guidelines which would regulate or control sports in

view of <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_50">article 73</a> of the Constitution. The respondents rely on the

pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at (1996) 3 SCC 709

<a href="/doc/1732220/" id="a_51">State of A.P. &amp; Ors. vs Mcdowell &amp; Co. &amp; Ors</a>. in support of this

submission.     It   is   contended    that   the   doctrine   of   occupied

fields/repugnancy has to be applied only to the entries in the list III

of the Seventh Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_104">51.   It has been submitted at length by Mr. V.P. Singh, learned

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                      33</span>
 senior counsel for the Indian Olympic Association and by Dr. A.M.

Singhvi, learned senior counsel representing respondent nos. 2 to 4

that the respondent no. 2 as well as other national sports federations

are registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_52">Societies Registration Act</a> or under various

state legislations on the subject which alone would have the

jurisdiction to regulate such sports activities which are regulated by

these federations and associations.
</p>
<p id="p_105">52.   The basic framework for distribution of legislative power

between the Union and the States and the foundation for a federal

set up for the nation was set out in the Government of India Act,

1915 and 1935. Even though this distribution has not been adopted

verbatim in the Constitution but the basic scheme remains the same.

</p><p id="p_106">53.   The rules of constitutional interpretation have been laid down

thus by the learned H.M. Seervai in the Constitutional Law of India

in para 2.12 of the Fourth Edition thus :-
</p>
<p id="p_107">       "2.12            The golden rule of interpretation is
       that words should be read in their ordinary, natural
       and grammatical meaning subject to the rider that in
       construing words in a Constitution conferring
       legislative power the most liberal construction should
       be put upon the words so that they may have effect in
       their widest amplitude. But this rider is subject to
       certain exceptions. Thus a restricted meaning may be
       given to words in order to prevent a conflict between
       two exclusive jurisdictions........A restricted meaning
       may have to be given by considering the language of
       the conflicting provisions together and, if necessary, by
       modifying the language of the one in the light of the
       other. In some cases such light might be thrown by the
       legislative history of one, or both, the powers."

      The principles of contemporanea expositio ('contemporaneous

exposition') have also been applied as a tool for interpretation of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">                                   34</span>
 statutes to construction of earlier statutes.

</p><p id="p_108">54.   In the instant case, a question as to distribution of legislative

powers between the Union and the States has been raised.         Apart

from the objection by respondent nos. 2 to 4, interestingly it is the

stand of the Central Government as well that it does not have

legislative competence on the subject of sports.

</p><p id="p_109">55.   The extent of legislative powers and its distribution between

the Union of India and the legislature of a state is provided under

<a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_53">article 245</a> of the Constitution of India which mandates that the

parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory

of India and the legislature of a state may make laws for the whole or

any part of the state.
</p>
<p id="p_110">56.   The distribution of the subject matter of laws between those

made by the parliament and those by the legislature of state is

provided by <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_54">article 246</a> of the Constitution of India.   The parliament

has thereby the exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of

the matters enumerated in list I in the 7th Schedule which is referred

to as the Union List. So far as the matters enumerated in the list

referred to as the Concurrent List III in the 7th Schedule of the

Constitution is concerned, the parliament, and, subject to clause (1),

the legislature of any state has the power to make laws with respect

to any of the matters enumerated in this List. The legislature of any

state has the exclusive power to make laws for such state or any part

thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in list II of the

7th Schedule of the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_111">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">                                    35</span>
</p><p id="p_112">       By virtue of clause 4 of <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_55">article 246</a>, the parliament is further

empowered to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of

the territory of India not included in a state notwithstanding that

such matter is a matter enumerated in the state list.

</p><p id="p_113">57.   The power of the parliament under <a href="/doc/671198/" id="a_56">article 246 (1)</a> is supreme

whereas the power of the State legislature in respect of laws under

list II is subject to power exercised by parliament in respect of laws

under list I.    However, it has been repeatedly held that while

interpretating   central   laws   and   state   laws,   a    harmonious

construction is to be adopted and repugnancy should be avoided.

</p><p id="p_114">58.   An issue as to the rule of construction in respect of items in the

Federal and Provincial legislative lists had arisen before the Federal

Court in the judgment reported at AIR 1941 Federal Court 47

A.L.S.P.P.L. Subrahmanyan Chettiar vs. Muttuswami Goundan

and the Advocate General Madras (intervenor).               The question

which was raised was as to whether the Madras Agriculturists Relief

Act (4 of 1938) was a legislation with respect to matters in List I or

List II in Schedule 7 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and it was

challenged that the same was ultravires of the provincial legislature

as it encroached upon the subject matter of the entries in list I. The

court was called upon to construe the principles which would govern

interpretation of the conferment of legislative power by the lists.

The court observed that it was impossible to deny that the <a href="/doc/1443301/" id="a_57">State Act</a>

encroached upon the field covered by instruments which were the

subject matter of List I and that it was open to the provincial


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">                                   36</span>
 legislature expressly to exclude such instruments from the operation

of the Act under consideration but that had not been done. For this

reason, it was held that there was an apparent overlapping and no

clearcut demarcation was discernible with regard to the extent of the

trespass on the Federal legislative field. So as to avoid the obvious

conflict,   Gwyer   C.J.   had   referred   to   different    principles   of

interpretation.       Advancing      the    principles       of   'restricted

interpretation', it was observed that the principle of interpretation

which was applied in 1939 F C R 18 at pp 74, 75 and 87 was that it

should certainly be the earnest endeavour of the court to avoid a

conflict between two apparently competing entries, as too liberal an

interpretation given to both of them might create a clash. "As far as

possible, an undefined term should not be given such a wide scope as

to include a particular provision." If a subject comes within a special

and specific provision, and can only by defining and enlarging the

meaning of the words be brought within the scope of the general,

then the special provision should be considered to be exclusive of the

other. But, of course, where such a restricted interpretation is not

possible, overlapping may be inevitable.
</p>
<p id="p_115">      Furthermore, the learned Judge adverted to the principle of

exception which have been relied upon by other judges in other

pronouncements with which he did not agree in view of the

provisions of the Government of India Act.               Gwyer C.J. while

considering the reliance of the Advocate General of India on the

residual power of the Federal Government under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_58">section 104</a> of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                    37</span>
 Government of India Act had held that resort to that residuary power

should be the very last refuge. It was further stated that it is only

when all the categories in the three lists are absolutely exhausted

that one can think of falling back upon a non-descript.

</p><p id="p_116">59.    A similar issue relating to the legislative competence of the

Federal legislature and Provincial legislature under the two lists in

the Government of India Act, 1935 fell for consideration before the

Federal Court in the judgment at AIR 1939 FC 1 titled "In the

matter of the Central Provinces &amp; Berar Sales of Motor Spirit

&amp; Lubricants Taxation Act, 1938.
</p>
<p id="p_117">       On the aspect of principles guiding interpretation of legislative

powers of the Federal &amp; Provincial legislatures, Jayakar, J. referred

to    cases   of   conflict   between    the   jurisdiction   and   legislative

competence of the Parliament of the Dominion and the provinces

jurisdiction. After a detailed consideration of the Privy Council on

this issue, the learned Judge set out earlier valuable principles for

interpretation. Those which guide the questions raised before this

court deserve to be considered in extenso and read thus :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">        "(1) That the provisions of an Act like [the Government
        of India Act, 1935, should not be cut down by a narrow
        and technical construction, but, considering the
        magnitude of the subjects with which it purports to
        deal in very few words, should be given a large and
        liberal interpretation, so that the Central Government,
        to a great extent, Attorney-General for Canada v.
        Attorney-General for Ontario (1937) 24 A I R P C 89
        but within certain fixed limits, may be mistress in her
        own house, as the Provinces, to a great extent, but
        again within certain fixed limits, are mistresses in
        theirs: see (1930) A.C. 12436 at pp. 136 and 137.

        (3) Where there is an absolute jurisdiction vested in a
        Legislature, the laws promulgated by it must take
        effect according to the proper construction of the
        language in which they are expressed. But where the
        law-making authority is of a limited or qualified
        character, obviously it may be necessary to examine,
        with some strictness, the substance of the legislation,
        for the purpose of determining what it is that the
        Legislature is really doing: Attorney-General for

        (5) In the interpretation of a completely self governing
        constitution founded upon a written organic
        instrument (such as the Government of India Act of
        1935) if the text is explicit, the text is conclusive, alike
        in what it directs and what it forbids. When the text is
        ambiguous, as, for example, when the words
        establishing two mutually exclusive jurisdictions are
        wide enough to bring a particular power within either,
        recourse must be had to the context and scheme of the
        Act: Att.-Gen. for Ontario v. Att.-Gen. for Canada
        (1912) A.C. 571,at page 583."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_118">60.    The principles of interpretation of the items in the Lists laid

down by the Federal Court were relied upon by the Apex Court in

(2002) 4 SCC 275 <a href="/doc/522930/" id="a_59">UOI vs. Delhi High</a> Court Bar Association &amp;

Ors. The court stated the law in the following terms :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">      ".. As pointed out by Gwyer C.J. in The United Provinces v.
      Atiqa Begum [1940] F.C.R. 110 at page 134 none of the
      items in the Lists is to be read in a narrow or restricted
      sense and that each general word should be held to extend
      to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and
      reasonably be said to be comprehended in it. It is, therefore,
      clear-and it is acknowledged by Chief Justice Chagla-that in
      construing an entry in a List conferring legislative powers
      the widest possible construction according to their ordinary
      meaning must be put upon the words used therein. The
      cardinal rule of interpretation, however, is that words


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                     39</span>
       should be read in their ordinary, natural and grammatical
      meaning subject to this rider that in construing words in a
      constitutional enactment conferring legislative power the
      most liberal construction should be put upon the words so
      that the same may have effect in their widest amplitude."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_34">                                                 (Emphasis added)



       It needs no further elaboration that legislative heads of power

should be read and understood in their widest amplitude and sense.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_119">The same appearing elsewhere in the constitution may be required to

be construed as limited by the context and in the light of the words

preceding and following that phrase.         However so far as the

expression appears as a legislative head of power in the lists, the

same cannot be given a restricted meaning (Ref : AIR 1965 Madras

11 In Re. N.V. Natarajan &amp; Anr.)

</p><p id="p_120">61.    A question requiring determination as to whether a particular

law is relating to a particular subject mentioned in one list or

another, requires the court to take recourse to the doctrine of pith

and substance which requires ascertaining the true character of the

legislation. The enactment as a whole is required to be examined as

well as its main objects and regard has to be added to the scope and

effect of its provisions. The inquiry is to ascertain as to whether the

enactment in question is genuinely referrable to the field of

legislation allotted to the state under the constitutional scheme (Ref :

(2005) 1 SCC 394 E.V. Chenniah vs. State of A.P. &amp; Ors.).

</p><p id="p_121">62.    The principles on which this doctrine evolved and the manner

of its application are best stated by the Privy Council in its


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                   40</span>
 pronouncement reported as AIR 1947 PC 60 <a href="/doc/806261/" id="a_60">Prafulla vs. Bank of

Commerce</a> wherein the court stated that :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">     "33.     Similarly, any item in the Concurrent List if dealt
     with by the Federal Legislature is outside the power of the
     Provinces and it is only the matters specifically mentioned
     in list II over which the province has complete jurisdiction,
     although so long as any item in the Concurrent list has not
     been dealt with by the Federal Legislature the provincial
     legislature is binding.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_36">        33.    In their lordship' opinion this argument should not
            prevail. To take such a view is to simplify unduly the
            task of distinguishing between the powers of divided
            jurisdictions. It is not possible to make so clean a cut
            between the powers of the various legislatures: they
            are bound to overlap from time to time.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_37">        34. Moreover, the British Parliament when enacting the
            <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_61">Indian Constitution Act</a> had a long experience of the
            working of the British North America Act and the
            Australian Commonwealth Act and must have known
            that it is not in practice possible to ensure that the
            powers entrusted       to the several legislatures will
            never overlap. As Sir Maurice Gwyer C.J. Said in
            1940.FC.R.188'(supra) at P.201:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">                   "It must inevitably happen from time to time that
              legislation though purporting to deal with a subject in
              one list, touches also upon a subject in another list,
              and the different provisions of the enactment maybe
              so closely interwined that blind adherence to a strictly
              verbal interpretation would result in a large number
              of statutes being declared invalid because the
              legislature enacting them may appear to have
              legislated in a forbidden sphere. Hence the rule
              which has been evolved by the Judicial Committee,
              whereby the impugned statute is examined to
              ascertain its pith and substance or its true nature and
              character for the purpose of determining whether it is
              legislation with respect to matters in this list or in
              that."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">        35.      Their Lordships agree that this passage correctly
              describes the grounds upon which the rule is founded,
              and that it applies to Indian as well as to Dominion
              legislation. No doubt experience of past difficulties
              has made the provisions of th <a href="/doc/261195/" id="a_62">Indian Act</a> more exact in
              some particulars and the existence of the concurrent


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">                                     41</span>
             list has made it easier to distinguish between those
            matters which are essential in determining to which
            list particular provisions should be attributed and
            those which are merely incidental.               But the
            overlapping of subject-matter is not avoided by
            substituting three lists for two or even by arranging
            for a hierarchy of jurisdictions.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_40">        36.      Subjects must still overlap and where they do the
            question must be asked what in pith and substance is
            the effect of the enactment of which complaint is
            made and in what list is its true nature and character
            to be found. If these questions could not be asked,
            much beneficent legislation would be shifted at birth,
            and many of the subjects entrusted to provincial
            legislation could never effectively be dealt with.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_41">        37.         (3) Thirdly, the extent of the invasion by the
            provinces into subjects enumerated in the Federal list
            has to be considered. No doubt it is an important
            matter, not, as their Lordships think, because the
            validity of an Act can be determined by discriminating
            between degrees of invasion, but for the purpose of
            determining what is the pith and substance of the
            impugned act. Its provisions may advance so far into
            Federal territory as to show that its true nature is not
            concerned with Provincial matters, but the question is
            not, has it trespassed more or less, but is the trespass,
            whatever it be, such as to show that the pith and
            substance of the impugned Act is not money lending
            but promissory notes or banking? Once that question
            is determined the Act falls on one or the other side of
            the line and can be seen as valid or invalid according
            to its true content.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_42">        38.      This view places the precedence accorded to the
            three lists in its proper perspective. No doubt where
            they come in conflict, List I has priority over Lists III
            and II and List III has priority over List II, but, the
            question still remains, priority in what respect? Does
            the priority of the Federal Legislature prevent the
            Provincial Legislature from dealing with any matter
            which may incidentally affect any item in its list or in
            each case has one to consider what the substance of
            an Act is and, whatever its ancillary effect, attribute it
            to the appropriate list according to its true character?
            In their Lordships' opinion the latter is the true view."

       exclusive competence of the Union, it becomes a
       prohibited field for the State Legislatures. The
       concept of occupied filed is relevant in the case of
       laws made with reference to entries in List III. The
       doctrine of covered field has to be applied only to the

<p id="p_122">In other words, to that extent, the power of the state legislature must

</p><p id="p_124">66.   In view of the above discussion, it needs no elaboration that the

state legislatures have no legislative competence to legislate with

regard to any subject outside the territorial boundary of the State.

</p><p id="p_125">67.   The relevant constitutional scheme and entries have to be

tested on these binding principles.
</p>
<p id="p_126">68.   The respondents place reliance on Entry 33 of List II which

reads :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_47">           "33. Theaters and dramatic performances; cinemas
           subject to the provisions of Entry 60 of List I, sports,
           entertainments and amusements."</blockquote><p id="p_127">


</p><p id="p_128">      In terms of entry 33 of list II, the encouragement of sports is a

state function. Entries in the list are to be given their ordinary and

natural meaning. The power to make laws with respect to sports as

per Entry 33 in List II of the State legislature is to be construed as a

power to legislate and regulate sports restricted to the precincts of

the state and ending at its boundaries.        It is amply clear that the

State Government by reason of legislative action, cannot confer on

itself any extra territorial jurisdiction even in relation to sports or the

subjects which form part of entry 33.
</p>
<p id="p_129">

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                      44</span>
</p><p id="p_130"> 69.   It cannot be contended or held that a state government can

control or regulate national teams; inter-state and international

sporting events, national level coaching or international events or

inter-state, national and international sporting relations. The State

Government also cannot issue guidelines on the manner in which the

Central Government is to dispense its largesse including financial

assistance.
</p>
<p id="p_131">70.   It cannot also regulate the manner in which the Central

Government shall grant recognition to a sports association or

federation as a national level body. It cannot be anybody's case that

without such recognition, the association can select a national team.

</p><p id="p_132">71.   Sports at the state level is really a minuscule part of the

enormous activities which it takes under its ambit.            In its larger

multi-faceted, inter state, national and international facets is

undeniably      beyond   the   legislative   competence   of     the   State

Government.
</p>
<p id="p_133">      Sports at these levels has to be held to be an exception to the

general power to legislate conferred on the state legislature by the

Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_134">72.   When Entry 33 of List II is so read, it is clearly evident that the

general and residuary powers in all matters relating to sports at the

national level remain beyond the legislative competence of the State.

Hence the same would be clearly beyond the executive competence

of the State as well.
</p>
<p id="p_135">73.   The important question which is required to be answered is as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                     45</span>
 to the manner in which a subject which for some purposes falls

under the competence of one legislature, and for others beyond it, is

to be treated for legislative purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_136">74.   Sports is not exclusively and explicitly mentioned as a subject

in List I or III.
</p>
<p id="p_137">75.   Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned ASG has submitted at length that

there is no constitutional provision which enables any authority to

legislate or exercise executive control over national level and

international level sports.
</p>
<p id="p_138">76.   The submission on behalf of the respondents fails to consider

the admitted position that the state government does not have the

legislative competence to legislate nor the executive power to issue

executive instructions or guidelines with regard to the regulation

and control sports at the national level. Admittedly other than three

states there is no legislation by either the Parliament or the State

Government to control or regulate sports. There is no legislation at

all on any respect of sports at the national level.   Furthermore no

state government has issued any executive instructions or passed

any administrative orders on this aspect, which is rightly so.

</p><p id="p_139">77.   Sports at the macro level has gone beyond not only the

boundary of the State but much beyond the national boundaries.

Several important issues of expertise and diplomatic relations have

come into play. The consideration of sports at the narrow state level

loses all significance when examined from these aspects.

</p><p id="p_140">78.   In addition to the above, Mr. Arun Jaitley, learned senior


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                   46</span>
 counsel appearing for the petitioners has placed reliance on several

other entries in List I and List III. Reliance is placed on Entry 25 in

List III which reads as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_48">           "25. Education, including technical education,
      medical education and universities, subject to the
      provisions of entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I;
      vocational and technical training of labour."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_141">79.   It is noteworthy that by the Constitution (Eighty Sixth)

amendment, <a href="/doc/237570/" id="a_73">Article 21A</a> conferring the right to education has been

incorporated in Chapter 3 of the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_142">      The role and responsibility of the State so far as education is

concerned has to be given an expanded meaning which would take

within its fold the requirement of encouragement of sports and

provision of all facilities at the national level.

</p><p id="p_143">80.   It has been pointed out that sports has always been considered

as an integral part of education and human resources development

and for this reason it was a complete department under the Ministry

of Human Resource Development.
</p>
<p id="p_144">81.   Any educational programme would be incomplete without

sports being an essential part of the same.          Participation of the

Indian team puts at stake the national reputation. At the same time,

in order to be able to contribute to matters of rules, regulations and

sporting policies, it is essential that national level bodies or their

personnel are involved in international level decision making.

</p><p id="p_145">82.   In exercise of executive functions under <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_74">Article 77</a> of the

 Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961.      Having

regard to the importance given to the aspect of sports, a separate

ministry known as 'the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports' has been

constituted. So far as in Rule 3 setting out the allocation of business

and distribution of subjects is concerned, the same is specified in the

2nd Schedule to the rules and includes all attached and subordinate

offices or other organisations including public sector undertakings

concerned with the subjects. I find that in the 2nd Schedule so far as

the Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports is concerned, the following

subjects are allocated to it :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_49">      "1.Sports Policy

Human Resource Development and now Ministry of Youth Affairs and

Sports an independent ministry.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">                                  48</span>
 may be established as private bodies. However in order to become a

representative body as a national federation representing the

country, it is essential that they be so recognised by the Government.

They would have no authority to enforce any degree of regulation or

control over the various state bodies but for the authority which is

vested on them only by virtue of the recognition granted by the

Government.
</p>
<p id="p_148">85.   It may be desirable that sports federations have autonomy in

areas of the actual conduct of sports. However to represent India as

a nation at international sports meets as well as international fora, it

is an essential part of Government function that scrutiny is effected

by the sporting event or the forum in which participation is

proposed.      The source of the legislative competence of the

Government to do so is derived from entry 10 and 13 of List I which

read thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_62">       "10. Foreign affairs, all matters which bring the Union
       into relation with any foreign country.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_63">       13. Participation      in    international  conferences,
       associations and other bodies and implementing of
       decisions made thereat."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_149">86.   There can be no argument that international sporting events

have been considered an essential part of diplomatic relations of the

nations. Nuances of hostility in political relations, issues of defence,

security concerns of players, objections on account of policies of

discrimination, apartheid and perceived human right violations have

guided nations in decisions to or not to participate in sporting events

in different countries. Political and diplomatic clearance is required


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                   49</span>
 by the Indian teams before participation in the international

tournaments and forums.          No State Government would have the

competence or the jurisdiction to undertake such exercise. This is

clearly the province of the Union Government.
</p>
<p id="p_150">87.   It   was   pointed   out     on    behalf   of   the   petitioners   that

entertainment tax is a state subject which is leviable on sporting

events when considered as part of entertainment.              However when

such an event is proposed, an issue as to whether visas or permission

have to be given or denied to sports persons of a particular country

would squarely fall for consideration before the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs of the Central Government. On issues of security, the matter

may require clearance of the Ministry of the Finance or Ministry of

Home Affairs as well. Issues of foreign exchange to meet expenses

of teams and personnel travelling abroad may involve interaction

with the Ministry of Finance as well.
</p>
<p id="p_151">88.   The Union Government is involved with dispensation of

financial assistance.
</p>
<p id="p_152">      If applied in reverse, certainly no state would have the legal

competence to manage, control or regulate the national level body or

the game or discipline.
</p>
<p id="p_153">89.   From the above discussion, it is apparent that sports, when

construed from the aspect of Entry 33 in List II has to be confined to

sports at the state level alone.
</p>
<p id="p_154">90.   In   (1981)   4   SCC      391     <a href="/doc/528732/" id="a_75">Southern      Pharmaceuticals       &amp;

a given power, "what is relevant is not the consequences of the

enactment on the subject matter or whether it affects it, but

whether, in its pith and substance, it is a law upon the subject matter

in question. The Central and the State Legislations operate on two

different and distinct fields.    The Central Rules, to some extent,

trench upon the field reserved to the State Legislature, but that is

merely incidental to the main purpose, that is, to levy duties of excise

on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol.           Similarly,

some of the impugned provisions may be almost similar to some of

the provisions of the Central Rules, but that that does not imply that

the State Legislature had no competence to enact the provisions."

</p><p id="p_155">91.   The petitioners have placed reliance on a pronouncement of the

Apex Court reported at (2006) 3 SCC 1 <a href="/doc/951273/" id="a_76">BSNL vs. UOI</a>.                  Placing

reliance on an earlier pronouncement reported at (1989) 3 SCC

634 <a href="/doc/810499/" id="a_77">Federation of Hotel &amp; Restaurant Association of India vs.

UOI</a>, the Apex Court held that subjects which in one aspect and for

one purpose fall within the power of a particular legislature, may in

another    aspect   and   for   another   purpose fall    within    another

legislative power. There might be overlapping; but the overlapping

must be in law. For instance, the same transaction may involve two

or more taxable events in its different aspects.         But the fact that

there is overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the

aspects.
</p>
<p id="p_156">92.   The most apt enunciation of the principles which would guide

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_51">                                    51</span>
 adjudication in the instant case is provided in the pronouncement of

the Apex Court reported at (2002) 8 SCC 228 UOI &amp; Ors. Vs.

Shah Goverdhan L. Kabra Teacher's College wherein the court

held thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_64">            "It is further a well-settled principle that entries in
      the different lists should be read together without giving
      a narrow meaning to any of them.              Power of the
      Parliament as well as the State legislature are expressed
      in precise and definite terms. While an entry is to be
      given its widest meaning but it cannot be so interpreted
      as to over-ride another entry or make another entry
      meaningless and in case of an apparent conflict between
      different entries, it is the duty of the court to reconcile
      them.     When it appears to the Court that there is
      apparent overlapping between the two entries the
      doctrine of "pith and substance" has to be applied to find
      out the true nature of a legislation and the entry with
      which it would fall. In case of conflict between entries in
      List I and List II, the same has to be decided by
      application of the principle of "pith and substance". The
      doctrine of "pith and substance" means that if an
      enactment substantially falls within the powers expressly
      conferred by the Constitution upon the legislature which
      enacted it, it cannot be held to be invalid, merely because
      it incidentally encroaches on matters assigned to another
      legislature. When a law is impugned as being ultra-vires
      of the legislative competence, what is required to be
      ascertained is the true character of the legislation. If on
      such an examination it is found that the legislation is in
      substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature
      then it must be held to be valid in its entirety even though
      it might incidentally trench on matters which are beyond
      its competence. In order to examine the true character of
      the enactment, the entire Act, its object and scope and
      effect is required to be gone into. The question of
      invasion into the territory of another legislation is to be
      determined not by degree but by substance. The doctrine
      of "pith and substance" has to be applied not only in
      cases of conflict between the powers of two legislatures
      but in any case where the question arises whether a
      legislation is covered by particular legislative power in
      exercise of which it is purported to be made."

<p id="p_157">93.   The Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports is assigned a budget



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">                                   52</span>
 allocation and the dispensation of financial assistance to the sports

federations is part of such allocation whereby tax payers money is

utilised towards assistance to sports.
</p>
<p id="p_158">94.   The states have not enacted any laws except the State of Uttar

Pradesh which has enacted Uttar Pradesh Sports (Registration,

Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Act, 2005; the State of

Himachal Pradesh which has enacted The Himachal Pradesh Sports

(Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Act, 2005

and the state of Rajasthan which has enacted The Rajasthan Sports

(Registration, Recognition and Regulation of Associations) Act, 2005.

These statutes are restricted to the respective states for their

application.
</p>
<p id="p_159">95.   None of the other state governments have enacted any

legislation under <a href="/doc/829916/" id="a_78">article 33</a> of list II.
</p>
<p id="p_160">96.   My attention is drawn to the pronouncement of the Apex Court

reported at JT 2005 (2) SC 165 Prefessor Yashpal &amp; Anr. vs.

State of Chattisgarh &amp; Ors.           In this case, the Apex Court was

concerned with the validity of The Chhattisgarh Niji Kshetra

Vishwavidyalaya (Sthapana Aur Viniyaman) Adhiniyam, 2002 which

provided for establishment of self financed private universities for

higher education in the stage of Chattisgarh.          The legislative

provisions permitted such universities to affiliate any college or

other institution or to set up more than one campus, with the prior

approval of the State Government, 'off campus centres' which means

a centre of the university established by it outside the main campus


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">                                     53</span>
 'within or outside the state' as well as 'off shore campus' which

meant a campus of the university established by it outside the main

campus (within or outside the 'state') operated and maintained as its

constituent unit.   It was held by the Apex Court       that in view of

<a href="/doc/369702/" id="a_79">article 245(1)</a> of the Constitution, Parliament alone is competent to

make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the

legislature of a state may make laws for the whole or any part of the

state. The impugned Act which specifically made a provision for the

enabling university to have an off-campus centres outside the State

was clearly beyond the legislative competence of the Chhattisgarh

legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_161">97.   Sports with all its hues and colours is one such subject which,

for different purposes would be covered under different entries in

different Lists in the 7th Schedule to the Constitution of India.

</p><p id="p_162">98.   It is undisputed that the resources which are put in the hands

Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports form a considerable part of the

budgetary allocation. There is extensive real estate in the form of

stadias, sports fields and facilities etc which is also under its

jurisdiction which is put to the utilisation of the encouragement and

development of sports. More material is the fact that sports persons

from the country in any state are involved in participating in national

level events as well as international events for which no state

government would have territorial jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_163">99.   In the instant case there is substantial funding for the

functioning of the respondent no. 2 by the government apart from


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                   54</span>
 other assistance rendered which includes the selection of the

national coach; availability of facilities developed by the Sports

Authority of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports;

financial assistance for acquisition of sports goods and materials;

organisation of programmes etc.          There is no dispute before this

court that the State Government does not have the legislative

competence to legislate with regard to any subject at the national

and international level aspects and matters. The power therefore of

the state legislature to frame laws regulating sports under entry 33

of list II is restricted to matters relating to sports within the

boundaries of the 'state'.       Such empowerment certainly cannot

prohibit or denude the parliament from its legislative competence to

regulate sports at the national and international level.

</p><p id="p_164">100.    In   (1974)   2   SCC     531     <a href="/doc/457772/" id="a_80">G.V.   Ramanaiah    vs.   The

Superintendent of Central Jail Rajahmundry &amp; Ors</a>., relied upon

by the respondents the Apex Court reiterated the principle that

under the Constitution, the distribution of executive powers follow,

in substance, the distribution of legislative powers. Subject to the

limitations mentioned in <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_81">Article 73</a> and <a href="/doc/694670/" id="a_82">162</a>, the executive power of

the    Union or the State is co-extensive and co-terminus with its

respective legislative powers.
</p>
<p id="p_165">101. The Union of India has also not enacted any legislation in

exercise of any of the powers conferred on it.          All the decision

making responsibility for national level sports has been consolidated

in the hands of the National Sports Federations.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                    55</span>
</p><p id="p_166"> 102. There is yet another important aspect to this issue.

</p><p id="p_167">103. In view of the submissions being advanced, learned senior

counsel appearing for the respondents were asked as to which

authority, according to them would have the jurisdiction to govern

national and international level sports and relations. The unanimous

answer rings a death knell for Indian sports as the unanimous

submission was that no one would have the jurisdiction and the only

option available in the matter is for the Parliament to effect a

constitutional amendment to make provision and to confer legislative

and executive competence on the government to legislate or to pass

executive orders in respect of this issue.
</p>
<p id="p_168">104. In the light of the above discussion, it is evident that well

settled principles for constitutional interpretation have not been

taken into consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_169">105. The submissions made by learned counsel for the respondents

also attempts to undermine the farsightedness of the Constitution

makers who drafted the various entries in Schedule 7 with great

care.    They anticipated the developments in society, science and

technology and also foresaw that it was humanly impossible to

provide for every conceivable subject which could arise.

</p><p id="p_170">106. While conferring primacy on the Union, the Constitutional

provisions have clearly deleniated the legislative jurisdiction of the

State.    The residuary power to legislate, however, with regard to

subjects which are not enumerated in the concurrent list or the state

list has been conferred on the Parliament by virtue of <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_83">article 248.</a>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                   56</span>
</p><p id="p_171">      Entry 97 of List I gives effect to the power conferred on the

Union under <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_84">Article 248</a> which reads as follows :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_65">         "248.        Residuary powers of legislation.
         (1) Parliament has exclusive power to make any law
         with respect to any matter not enumerated in the
         Concurrent List or State List.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_66">         (2) Such power shall include the power of making

         or list III including any tax not mentioned in either of
         those lists."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_68">     Recourse to this power, however, is restricted.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_172">107. The Constitution of India has been referred to as an organic

and a living document.       It was to avoid any kind of vacuum of

legislation and executive powers that the Constitution makers have

vested the residuary powers in the Parliament.

</p><p id="p_173">108. It has been emphasised by constitutional interpretation that the

entries in the list have to be given the widest possible constructions.

It is only after the entries in the lists have been given broader liberal

interpretation that resort can be taken to the residual power are

absolutely exhausted. If two constructions on the entry in the list are

possible, the one which will avoid resort to the residuary power is

directed to be preferred. (Ref : AIR 1979 SC 1972 (para 6) <a href="/doc/679597/" id="a_85">Shetkhari

Sehkari Sakhar vs. Collector Sangli</a> and AIR 1966 SC 416 Jaora

</p>
<p id="p_174">109. It has been held that by virtue of this residuary power, it was

competent for the Parliament to make a law under its own legislative

while examining the legislative competence of the parliament to

make a law, what is required to be seen is as to whether the subject

matter falls in the State List which the Parliament cannot enter. If

the law does not fall in the State list, Parliament would have the

legislative competence to pass the law by virtue of the residuary

powers under <a href="/doc/1270258/" id="a_98">Article 248</a> read with Entry 97 of the Union List and it

would not be necessary to go into the question as to whether it falls

under any entry in the Union List or the Concurrent List.

</p><p id="p_177">     It was observed by the Chief Justice that "if a <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_99">Central Act</a> is

challenged, as being beyond the legislative competence of the

Parliament, it is enough to enquire if it is a law with respect to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                          58</span>
 matters or taxes enumerated in List II.       If it is not, no further

question arises."
</p>
<p id="p_178">112. So far as the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at

(1996) 3 SCC 709 <a href="/doc/1732220/" id="a_100">State of A.P. vs. Mcdowell &amp; Ors</a>. is

concerned, there can certainly be no dispute with the well settled

principles that the concept of occupied field is relevant in the case of

laws made with reference to entries in the Concurrent List and that,

whenever a piece of legislation is said to be beyond the legislative

competence of a state legislature, what must be done is to find out,

by applying the rule of pith and substance, what would be the true

nature of the legislation and whether it falls within any of the entries

in list II.
</p>
<p id="p_179">113. There can also be no dispute with the principles laid down by

the Apex court in (1994) 3 SCC 1 <a href="/doc/139734870/" id="a_101">S.R. Bommai &amp; Ors. vs UOI &amp;

Ors</a>. and 1981 Supp. SCC 87 <a href="/doc/1294854/" id="a_102">S.P. Gupta vs. President of India

&amp; Ors</a>. relied upon by the respondents. It was held that it is not

permissible for application of the doctrine of cassus, omissus where

the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous as the words

used by the Constitution or the statutes speak for themselves and it

is not the function of the court to add words or expression merely to

suit what the court thinks of the intent of the legislature. However,

in the light of the discussion in the foregoing paragraphs, it is

evident that the instant case is not one of cassus omissus by the

draftsman or the legislation and that there are ample constitutional

provisions laying down the constitutional mandate and empowering

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">                                   59</span>
 the Parliament to legislate.
</p>
<p id="p_180">114. When the sports becomes part of the national or international

level as at the level of selection of sportspersons for representation

of the country; sports activity and exchanges at the national and

international level; the Central Government alone would have the

power and competence to regulate the same.
</p>
<p id="p_181">115. The powers are clear and distinct.      The entries in the Lists

when meaningfully and harmoniously construed, display no conflict

of jurisdiction or overlap.
</p>
<p id="p_182">116. The minority view in Zee Telefilms has considered the law/rule

making power of the National level sports body. It was noticed that

a national level sports federation would be entitled to represent the

nation and regulate the sport in the country. It would have duties to

perform towards players, coaches, umpires, administrators and team

officials. Aspects of ensuring several rules for the sport to prevent

physical injury to all concerned has to be continuously reviewed.

Health, sociability and play are important values to be recognised in

the human.
</p>
<p id="p_183">     International sporting events promote and aim at good relations

in the comity of nations; promote peace and prosperity for the people

even at the domestic level.
</p>
<p id="p_184">     Development of sport at the national level would include

nomination of players for national awards as the Arjuna Award which

are accepted by the Government.
</p>
<p id="p_185">117. This is the position not only with an item like sports. Wealth


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                  60</span>
 tax and other taxation issues; drugs and pharmaceuticals etc also

raise similar issues.   In the instant case, there is no conflict of

jurisdiction created by different entries nor an overlap. One subject

for different aspects and purposes falls under different entries which

are not in the same list.
</p>
<p id="p_186">     I find neither a conflict of jurisdiction nor any overlap with

regard to the jurisdictions of the Parliament and the State

Government to legislate.
</p>
<p id="p_187">118. In this background, so far as the Constitutional vacuum, urged

by the respondents is concerned, the submission is misplaced also

having regard to the vision and farsightedness of the Constitution

makers who empowered the Parliament to legislate in respect of any

subject or matter not enumerated in any of the lists when they vested

and included the residuary power under Entry 97 in List I of the

Seventh Schedule.
</p>
<p id="p_188">119. The department of sports was earlier forming a part of the

Ministry of Human Resource Development till its segregation in

terms of item 6 of the second schedule of the Rules for Allocation of

Business framed in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_103">article 77.</a> The national

sports federations is a specific item at item 6 of the 2nd Schedule of

the Rules for Allocation of Business which falls within the jurisdiction

of the Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports.       It is vested with the

power to recognise a federation or association as a national

federation and also to regulate interaction at the international level.

It performs the essential task of coordinating between the activities


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                   61</span>
 of different states.
</p>
<p id="p_189">120. The submission on behalf of the respondent, therefore, that

sports necessarily is to be confined to a consideration by the State

Government alone under Entry 33 of list II is devoid of legal merit.

</p><p id="p_190">121. In view of the above discussion, the objection raised by the

respondent with regard to the legislative competence of the

Parliament to make laws on the subject of sports is hereby is

rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_191">122. As noticed hereinabove, the executive power of the Union

extends to the matters with respect to which the Parliament has the

power to make laws. It is held that the Union having the legislative

competence would certainly be empowered to issue executive

powers with regard to the sports at the national and international

representation levels.

</p><p id="p_193">123. So far as the functions of the sports body, the role of the

Central Government and various other entries in the Lists in the

Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India are concerned, the

same have been considered at length in the minority judgment in the

case reported at JT 2005 (2) SC 8 <a href="/doc/404603/" id="a_104">Zee Telefilms Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs.

UOI &amp; Ors</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_194">124. For the view that I have taken on the various issues it may not

be necessary to say anything more.       However, a very important

larger question as to the bindingness of the minority view in a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">                                  62</span>
 pronouncement of the Apex Court has been argued at great length.

A writ petition titled <a href="/doc/404603/" id="a_105">Zee Telefilms vs UOI &amp; Ors</a>. was filed in the

Supreme Court of India which was decided by a pronouncement

reported at 2005 (2) SC 8 <a href="/doc/404603/" id="a_106">Zee Telefilms Ltd. vs UOI &amp; Ors. An</a>

objection that the Board of Cricket Control of India (impleaded as a

respondent) was not covered within the definition of 'State' under

<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_107">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and hence a writ petition under

<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_108">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India against it was not maintainable

was taken. By a three Judge majority the objection was sustained

while the two judge minority ruled against the petitioners.        The

minority judgment commented on several aspects which are not

mentioned in the majority judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_195">125. So far as maintainability of writ proceedings against the cricket

board was concerned, the minority view observed that sports has

travelled way beyond a pursuit of a mere hobby or interest.       With

sponsorships of players and sporting events and the absorption with

sports, today it is pursued as a vocation and a profession.     In the

context of the factual matrix that the several players pursue the

game as their profession, it was argued before the Apex Court in JT

2005 (2) SC 8 <a href="/doc/404603/" id="a_109">Zee Telefilms Ltd. &amp; Anr. vs. UOI &amp; Ors</a>. and also

observed in para 143 that the right of the Indian players is

comparable to their constitutional rights contained in <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_110">article 19 (1)</a>

</p><p id="p_196">(g) of the Constitution of India which would include a right to work

and a right to pursue one's occupation.
</p>
<p id="p_197">126. So far as the nature of functions performed by the Board was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">                                  63</span>
 concerned, the minority view in para 144 observed that the action of

the sports board may disable a person from pursuing his vocation

and in that process subject a citizen to hostile discrimination or

impose an embargo which would make or mar a player's carreer.

</p><p id="p_198">     On the issue of availability of judicial review against a Board's

action, it was held that 'If the action of the body/authority impinges

upon the fundamental or other constitutional rights of a citizen or if

the same is ultravires or by reasons thereof, an injury or material

prejudice is caused to its member or a person connected with

cricket, judicial review would lie. Such functions on the part of the

board being public function, any violation or departure or deviation

from abiding by the rules and regulations framed by it would be

subject to judicial review'. This would be so even though the body

may be self regulating.
</p>
<p id="p_199">127. So far as legislative powers are concerned it would be

appropriate and useful to consider the observations on this specific

issue in paras 60, 61 and 63 of the report which read as follows :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_69">       "60. Although we will advert to various rival contentions
       raised at the Bar at some details a little later but suffice
       it to notice at this stage that encouragement of games
       and sports is State function in terms of Entry 33 of List
       II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India
       which reads thus:
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_70">       "33. Theaters and dramatic performances; cinemas
       subject to the provisions of entry 60 of List 1; spoils,
       entertainments and amusements."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_71">       61. The State by reason of a legislative action cannot
       confer on it extra territorial jurisdiction in relation to
       sports, entertainment etc. Education, however, is in
       Concurrent List being Item No. 25 of List III. Sport is
       considered to be a part of Education (within its

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">                                   64</span>
       expanded meaning). Sport has been included in the
      Human Resource Development as a larger part of
      education. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports was
      earlier a department of the Ministry of Human Resource
      Development. Now a separate Ministry of Youth Affairs
      and Sports has come into being, in terms of the
      Allocation of Business Rules.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_72">      Xxx
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">      63. We may notice at this juncture that the Union of
      India in exercise of its executive functions in terms of
      the Allocation of Business Rules framed under <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_111">Article 77</a>
      of the Constitution of India created a separate Ministry
      of Youth Affairs and Sports for the said purpose. One of
      the objects of the Ministry is to work in close
      coordination with national federations that regulate
      sports. Keeping in view the fact that the Union of India
      is required to promote sports throughout India, it, as of
      necessity is required to coordinate between the
      activities of different States and furthermore having
      regard to the International arena, it is only the Union of
      India which can exercise such a power in terms of Entry
      10, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of
      India and it may also be held to have requisite legislative
      competence in terms of Entry 97, List I of the Seventh
      Schedule of the Constitution of India."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_200">128. The respondents would contend that in view of the majority

judgment, the minority view stands overruled and cannot be relied

upon for any purpose. On the other hand it has been pointed out on

behalf of the petitioner that the law laid down by the Apex Court

would be the enunciation of the law by the minority judgment as well

which binds this court.
</p>
<p id="p_201">129. There is no dispute that the majority view did not rule on the

issue with regard to the legislative competence of the parliament

with regard to legislation relating to the subject of sports and only

the minority wrote its opinion thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_202">130. An issue as to the bindingness of the minority judgment had


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">                                  65</span>
 arisen for consideration before the Bombay High Court in AIR 1964

Bombay 170 <a href="/doc/1773486/" id="a_112">Mahendra Bhawanji Thakar vs. S.P. Pande &amp; Anr.

The</a> relevant portion of this judgment in paras 21, 22 and 23 on this

issue reads as follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_74">     "21. No doubt, two of the Judges, of the Full Bench namely,
     Mr. Justice Hidayatullah and Mr. Justice Raghubar Dayal
     specifically found that the provisions of the second proviso
     to <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_113">Section 34(3)</a> did not infringe <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_114">Article 14</a>, but in view of
     the majority decision, they concurred in the final order
     passed in the appeal and allowed the appeal. This decision
     of the Supreme Court of India, therefore, clearly rules out
     any possibility of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_115">Section 34(3)</a> being
     invoked in the present case because that decision is
     absolutely binding upon this Court.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_75">     22. Nevertheless Mr. Natu, appearing on behalf of the
     Department, has contested that position. He has referred
     to the provisions of <a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_116">Article 145(5)</a> read with <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_117">Article 141</a> of
     the Constitution. He has pointed out that even though
     three Judges of the Supreme Court held that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_118">Article 14</a>
     would be attracted and would make the second proviso to
     <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_119">Section 34(3)</a> unconstitutional, they were not the three
     learned Judges on whose decision the appeal was
     ultimately allowed. On the other hand, the appeal was
     allowed upon the decisions of Mr. Justice A. K. Sarkar, Mr.
     Justice Hidayatullah and Mr. Justice Raghubar Dayal. Of
     these three learned Judges Mr. Justice Sarkar alone had
     given it as his opinion that the second proviso was
     unconstitutional. But Mr. Justice Hidayatullah and Mr.
     Justice Raghubar Dayal agreed to allow the appeal of the
     Department because they held that Sub-section (4) of
     <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_120">Section 34</a>, would save the notice in that case. On these
     facts, therefore, Mr. Natu urged that so far as the question
     of the applicability of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_121">Article 14</a> is concerned, of the three
     Judges who agreed that the appeal should be allowed, only
     one was of the view that the proviso was unconstitutional,
     whereas two were of the view that the proviso was not un-
     constitutional. Therefore, in that decision so far as the
     question of the applicability of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_122">Article 14</a> was concerned,
     the majority who allowed the appeal did not hold the
     proviso unconstitutional.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_76">     23. We do not think that we can accede to the contention of
     Mr. Natu having regard to the provisions of <a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_123">Article 145(5)</a>
     read with <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_124">Article 141</a> of the Constitution. <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_125">Article 141</a> says
     that "The law declared by the Supreme Court shall be bind-
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">                                  66</span>
<p id="p_203"> ing on all courts within the territory of India." It is the law
declared by the Supreme Court that binds this Court and
not the judgments. This is made clearer when we consider
<a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_126">Article 145(5).</a> In <a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_127">Article 145(5)</a> the words used are,
"No judgment and no such opinion shall be delivered by the
Supreme Court save with the concurrence of a majority of
the Judges present at the hearing of the case, but nothing
in this clause shall be deemed to prevent a Judge who does
not concur from delivering a dissenting judgment or
opinion."
</p>
<p id="p_204">It is clear from <a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_128">Article 145(5)</a> that a judgment delivered by
the Supreme Court is the one delivered by a majority of the
Judges where there is a difference of opinion, but in that
case the Judge who does not concur also delivers a
judgment albeit a dissenting judgment. <a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_129">Article 145(5)</a>
therefore uses the word 'judgment' both with regard to the
final pronouncement of the Court itself as well as for the
dissenting pronouncement of an individual Judge who does
not concur. There does not appear to be any warrant for
reading the provision of <a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_130">Article 145(5)</a> into the provisions
of <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_131">Article 141</a>, and we do not think that the "law declared"
can be approximated to the judgment delivered by the
Supreme Court. On the other hand, having regard to the
provisions of <a href="/doc/186857/" id="a_132">Article 145(5)</a> that a Judge who does not
concur may also deliver a judgment, it is clear that the law
declared may as well be in a dissenting judgment as in a
majority judgment. The argument, therefore, that the three
Judges whose decision resulted in the allowing of the
appeal in Purshottam's case did not form a majority of
those holding that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_133">Article 14</a> applied to the second proviso
to <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_134">Section 34(3)</a> does not make that the law declared. On
the other hand, as we have already shown three Judges out
of the five who decided Civil Appeal No. 705 of 57:
MANU/SC/0203/1962 had clearly agreed that <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_135">Article 14</a>
applied and the proviso was ultra vires and we think that
for the purposes of this Court that was "the law declared
by the Supreme Court". We hold that "the law declared"
referred to in <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_136">Article 141</a> is the law to be gathered from
any judgment in a case decided by the Supreme Court,
whether it is the judgment of a Judge forming the majority
or of a Judge in a minority and dissenting. The contention
must, therefore, be negatived. In that view, therefore, it is
clear that the Department cannot rely upon the provisions
of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_137">section 34(3)</a> as that proviso has
been by law declared void as infringing <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_138">Article 14</a> of the
Constitution."

      come within the purview of Entry 18 read by itself or in

      law relating to Forests under Entry 19.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_78">      169. No doubt, this contention has been noted by his
      Lordship the Chief justice of the Supreme Court in the

      Legislature had the necessary competence to enact the
      Land Tax Act, 1955.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_79">      170. But Mr. Justice Sarkar, in his dissenting judgment,
      has referred to this aspect and has ultimately held that
      under Entry 49 taxation of land on which a forest stands
      is permissible and legal. Inasmuch as there has been no
      adjudication by the majority on this aspect, I am bound by
      the decision of Mr. Justice Sarkar on this aspect and I
      have to hold that the contention Of the petitioners
      regarding the competency of the legislature to enact the

view of the absence of the requisite notice to the defendant under

relied upon as the law laid down by the Supreme Court by a Division

<p id="p_209">134. Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned Additional Solicitor General has

placed reliance on the pronouncement reported at AIR 1981 Guj 15

<a href="/doc/824925/" id="a_148">Prof. Manubhai D. Shah vs. LIC</a> to urge that a dissenting minority

judgment cannot be relied upon. Reliance was placed on para 12 of

the pronouncement.        I find that the learned Judges have not

considered the principles laid down in the judicial precedents

noticed herein above which contain a detailed consideration as to

what would constitute law laid down by the Apex Court.              In

Manubhai D. Shah (supra), the court merely observed that it is risky

and imprudent for the High Court to rely upon observations made in

a dissenting and minority judgment and consequently they refrained

from making any reference to them less the court was unwittingly

influenced by them.
</p>
<p id="p_210">     In the light of the legal principles laid down in the aforenoticed

judgments. I find myself unable to take this view.

</p><p id="p_211">135. Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for the

respondent nos. 2 to 4 has urged at length and reliance is placed on

para 25.99 of the Constitutional law of India by the noted jurist Mr.

H.M. Seervai on pages 2669-2675 where the learned author has

quoted Lord Denning thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_82">           "We can only accept a line of reasoning which
     supports the actual decision of the House of Lords. By no
     possibility can we accept any reasoning which would show
     the decision itself to be wrong. The second proposition is
     that if we can discover the reasoning on which the majority
     based their decision, then we should accept that as binding
     upon us. The third proposition is that, if we can discover


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">                                  70</span>
      the reasoning on which the minority bases their decision,
     we should reject it. It must be wrong because it led them to
     the wrong result....."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_212">136. A valuable principle has been enunciated above by the learned

jurist. However the issue before this court is substantially different.

The majority view has confined itself to a consideration as to whether

the BCCI would be covered under the definition of 'state' without at

all referring to the issue of legislative competence of the Union of

India on the subject of      sports and hence amenable to the writ

jurisdiction   of   the   Supreme   Court   under   <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_149">Article   32</a>   of   the

Constitution. The views expressed in the minority judgment on this

aspect are not the reasoning on which it has arrived on the

conclusion contrary to the majority view and held that the writ

petition was maintainable.
</p>
<p id="p_213">137. Mr. Arun Jaitley, learned senior counsel for the petitioners has

urged that a comment by a jurist on a proposition in law cannot

supersede the Constitutional scheme, statutory provisions or judicial

precedents.
</p>
<p id="p_214">138. The general observations in the above quoted extract of H.M.

Seervai's Constitutional Law of India did not deal with the specific

question as has arisen before this court. The general observations do

not advance the case of the petitioner inasmuch as the learned

author did not have a situation where it was an admitted position

that the State Government did not have the legislative competence to

deal with the subject at the national level. Furthermore, the majority

opinion in Zee Telefilms does not consider the issue of legislative


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_71">                                    71</span>
 competence or any of the other issue raised on merits.

</p><p id="p_215">139. It has been urged at length that the ratio decidendi of the

decision of the minority led to a wrong result and therefore cannot

bind this court.   This submission is wholly fallacious and legally

incorrect.   A reading of the judgments in Zee Telefilms would show

that both judgments have considered the nature of functions and

duties of the BCCI and by detailed reasons arrived at a similar

conclusion to the effect that the BCCI is performing functions which

are akin to public functions and public duties.     The only area of

disagreement is the issue as to whether the definition of 'state' under

<a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_150">article 12</a> has to take the expanded definition or the narrower view

requires to be adopted.
</p>
<p id="p_216">140. The majority view has laid down that the BCCI being a private

body exercising public functions, it would not be covered under the

definition of state under <a href="/doc/609139/" id="a_151">Article 12</a> and hence a writ petition under

<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_152">article 32</a> of the Constitution against it would not lie. It was however

held by the majority that the remedy to an aggrieved person would

lie under the ordinary law as well as by way of a writ petition under

<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_153">article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.

UOI &amp; Anr</a>. under <a href="/doc/882644/" id="a_159">Article 141</a>, the law laid down by the Supreme

Court is any judgment in a case decided by the Supreme Court

whether it is the judgment of a judge forming the majority or of a

judge in minority and dissenting.        This principle would bind

adjudication, in my view this quotation in the renounced text on

constitutional law cannot in any manner would not enable this court

to take any different view.
</p>
<p id="p_218">142. In any case, even if the respondents contention was to be

accepted that the minority pronouncement would not form a binding

precedent, the majority view has not addressed the issue relating to

the legislative competence of the parliament to legislate on the

subject of sports and has confined itself, to holding that the petition

under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_160">Article 32</a> was not maintainable. In this background, it cannot

be held the minority view on this issue stands overruled.

</p><p id="p_219">143. The contention raised by learned senior counsel for the

respondents can be examined from yet another angle. The majority

ruled that a writ petition before the Supreme Court under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_161">Article 32</a>

would not be competent.       Therefore the court would not have

jurisdiction to decide the questions which arose in the case.

</p><p id="p_220">144. So far as suits are concerned, it has been held that if the court

has no jurisdiction to try the lis, its orders and judgment would be a

nullity and cannot operate as res-judicata in subsequent proceedings.

</p><p id="p_221">     Such question arose before the Apex Court in AIR 1979 SC

1911 <a href="/doc/1379496/" id="a_162">Avtar Singh &amp; Ors. vs. Jagjit Singh &amp; Anr</a>. wherein the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_73">                                  73</span>
 Apex Court has held that if a defendant appears in a case and an

issue as to jurisdiction is raised and the court decides to return the

plaint on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, such decision on the

question of jurisdiction will operate as res judicata in a subsequent

suit although the reasons for its decision may not be so.

</p><p id="p_222">145. In AIR 1940 Privy Council 222 <a href="/doc/1342511/" id="a_163">Upendra Nath Bose vs. Lall

&amp; Ors</a>., it was held by the court that a court which declines

jurisdiction cannot bind the parties by its reasons for declining

jurisdiction : such reasons are not decisions, and are certainly not

decisions by a Court of competent jurisdiction. It would indeed be

strange if on a dispute as to the jurisdiction of a Court to try an

issue, that Court by its reasons for holding that it had no jurisdiction,

could, upon the principle of res judicata, decide and bind the parties

upon the very issue which it was incompetent to try.

</p><p id="p_223">146. When examined from this aspect as well, it cannot be held that

the view of the minority has been overruled and consequently, if not

bind, cannot even guide adjudication. I see no reason or legal basis

whereby this court would stand precluded from taking the same view

as that in the minority judgment in Zee Telefilms (supra).

Whether guidelines dated 14th August, 2001 were merely draft

guidelines or had been kept in abeyance

</p><p id="p_224">147. Before this court, efforts have been made by the respondents to

urge   that   these   guidelines   have   not   been   accepted   by   the

Government and cannot be enforced. The respondent no. 1 on the

one side and the respondent nos. 2 to 4 supported by the Indian

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">                                    74</span>
 Olympic Association on the other have placed a conflicting factual

matrix and diametrically opposite grounds which are mutually

destructive on this submission.
</p>
<p id="p_225">148. The respondents are however unanimous in their submission

that there was resentment to the guidelines. The respondent nos. 2

to 4 have stated that the Government of India had set up a

committee under the chairmanship of Sh. A.K. Pandya, DG, Sports

Authority of India to review the position. The Pandya Committee

submitted     a   report   in   1992   unanimously   recommending     the

scrapping altogether of the provisions limiting the tenure of the

office bearers.
</p>
<p id="p_226">     However, after hearing the views of the Government, Indian

Olympic Association and the National Sports Federations, the

Committee submitted its report in 1995 refraining from expressing

any views. The Government admittedly did not take any decision to

scrap any part of the guidelines was taken.          It is evident thereby

that the tenure prescription as was contained in the original

guidelines continued to bind recognition and grant of financial

assistance.
</p>
<p id="p_227">149. The respondents have submitted that a four member committee

of the Indian Olympic Association also gave formal comments on

16th July, 1997 expressing the view that the tenure stipulation in the

guidelines should be removed. The recommendations by this

committee have also not found favour with the Government of India



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">                                       75</span>
 which has issued the revised guidelines dated 14th August, 2001

continuing the restriction.
</p>
<p id="p_228">150. The respondent no. 4 has filed a counter affidavit stating that

the Indian Olympic Association called for a meeting of its executive

committee on 31st August, 2001 to which it invited Ms. Uma Bharti,

the then Minister of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports. It is stated that in her

address the Minister took note of the opposition by the Indian

Olympic Association and stated that the views of the Federations

must be duly considered and that she had advised the secretary in

the ministry to inform the Indian Olympic Association and the sports

federations that the guidelines issued were only 'draft guidelines'

and the minister would later correspond with the Indian Olympic

Association and the Sports Federations.
</p>
<p id="p_229">151. Based on such a statement attributed to the minister during the

course of an address in a closed door meeting of the executive

committee of the Indian Olympic Association, the respondents have

advanced prolonged submissions that the guidelines dated 14th

August, 2001 were merely 'draft guidelines' which cannot be relied

upon. A copy of the minutes of such meeting has been placed before

this court in support of this submission.
</p>
<p id="p_230">152. This document has been put forward by and is only available

with the Indian Olympic Association. It is an admitted position that

there is no official record of any such minutes with the government.

It bears no official signatures or acknowledgment. There is nothing



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">                                   76</span>
 to support even the so called direction to the Secretary of the

Ministry noticed hereinabove. The statements attributed to the

Minister in the minutes of the alleged meeting on 31st August, 2001

are also not supported in any affidavit of the Government of India on

record.
</p>
<p id="p_231">153. The communication dated 14th August, 2001 issued under the

authority of the Government of India reflects consideration and

concurrence of the other ministry i.e. the Ministry of Finance which

was involved in the dispensation stood taken.
</p>
<p id="p_232">154. There is no answer to the query that if these guidelines were

merely in the nature of a draft which was pending consideration,

what guided the government's decisions for recognition of national

sports federations or financial assistance between 2001 till the date

of filing of the writ petition.
</p>
<p id="p_233">155. It is evident that if the guidelines on 14th August, 2001 were a

draft, then the guidelines dated 14th September, 1975 as revised in

1997 would bind the respondents for grant of recognition and

dispensation of financial assistance. There is no dispute that these

guidelines contained the very tenure clause complained against

before me and therefore, in order to be entitled to recognition and

assistance     from     the       Government,   the   National   Sports

Federation/Association had to fulfil these requirements.

</p><p id="p_234">156. The Government filed a counter affidavit to the writ petition on

16th May, 2005 sworn by Sh. S.K. Sharma, Under Secretary in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_77">                                      77</span>
 ministry. A categorical stand with regard to bindingness of the

guidelines in the affidavit dated 16th May, 2005 filed by it to the

following effect :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_83">               "(1) That Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) is an
         autonomous society registered under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_164">Societies

         Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports as apex national
         level sports federation engaged in promotion of the
         game of Men's Hockey in the country.

         'Assistance to Natinal Sports Federations'(NSFs.)
         (3) that the 'Sports' figures out in the 'State List' of
         the Constitution of India as item no. 33, the Union
         Government has no jurisdiction to frame any law or
         legislative provision on any matter relating to sports.
         These guidelines are only the administrative
         guidelines issued by the Ministry lacking legislative
         backing, required for the strict enforcement of these
         guidelines.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_85">         (4) That there are number of National Sports

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_86">                                       (Emphasis supplied)




     In para 11 of this affidavit, it has been deposed as under:-
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_87">                "The Government supplements the efforts of
          the NSFs includng IHF by providing financial
          asistance for their various activities.       For this
          purpose there exist "Guidelines for Assistance to
          national    Sports    Federations"    containing    the
          provisions    for    recognition    of    the    NSFs,
          suspension/withdrawal of recognition and tenure of
          office bearers of the NSFs etc Since 'Sports' figures
          out in the "State List" of the Constitution of India as
          Item No. 33, the union government does not have
          the mandate to frame rules/legislate on any matter

          related to sports. These guidelines, which have been
         issued by the Government of India, are only the
         administrative guidelines issued by the Ministry
         lacking legislative backing, required for the strict
         enforcement of these guidelines. The only action that
         the Governent of India can take against these
         defaulting National Sports Federations (NSFs) under
         the prevailing circumstances is to stop giving
         financial assistance being provided to them as per
         the guidelines. But the Government, in general,
         refrains from taking such a harsh action, as it would
         adversely affect the interest of Indian sports persons
         having a lot of potential to excel in their respective
         sport."
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_88">                                        (Emphasis supplied)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_89">157. In the course of hearing on 17th May, 2005, Mr. P.P. Malhotra,

learned Additional Solicitor General orally submitted that on perusal

of the Government files relating to the matter in issue, it had been

brought to his notice that the clause relating to the tenure of the

office bearers of two terms of four years each, as mentioned in the

1975 guidelines were ordered to be kept in abeyance by an order

dated 24th August, 2002 passed by Km. Uma Bharti, the then

Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports and practically it is in abeyance

right from the inception and has never been implemented for any

sports association/federation.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_235">158. As such stand had not been taken in the counter affidavit dated

12th May, 2005 filed by the Government, a direction was issued to

the Government to file an additional affidavit in this regard.

</p><p id="p_236">159. The respondent no.1 has filed an additional affidavit of Sh. S.K.

Sharma, Under Secretary in the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports

dated 18th May, 2005 now submitting that a meeting of the Indian


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_79">                                   79</span>
 Olympic Association and various national sports federations was

taken by the concerned minister on 11th October, 2001. Suggestion

25 of the various bodies was that the issue of tenure of the office

bearer may be kept in abeyance, till the working group submitted its

report to the Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports. The Government has

stated that on this suggestion, on the 24th of August, 2002, the

Minister had directed that the 'issue of tenure will be kept in

abeyance and will be considered alongwith the report of the working

group.'

</p><p id="p_237">160. The respondent no.1 has further stated that the working group

constituted under the chairmanship of Sh. Suresh Kalmadi, President

of the Indian Olympic Association submitted its report on 14th June,

2002 recommending scrapping of the guidelines pertaining to the

tenure of office bearers. It is submitted that on this report, the

Minister of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports had recorded as follows :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_90">     "(i) From our experience, the clause limiting the tenure of
     office bearers two terms for four years each as mentioned
     in the 1975 guidelines appears to be impractical and it
     should be scrapped.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_91">     (ii) Conformity to the code of conduct should be made a
     condition for giving financial assistance to the N.S.Fs and
     IOA."</blockquote><p id="p_238">



</p><p id="p_239">     Based on these submissions, it has been urged that the clause

was first kept in abeyance and then it was directed to be scrapped.

</p><p id="p_240">161. It is equally well settled that every noting contained in a

Government file is not a binding and enforceable order of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">                                  80</span>
 competent authority. In the judgment reported at AIR 1963 SC 395

<a href="/doc/98066/" id="a_165">Bachhittar Singh v. The State of Punjab</a>, the Apex Court had

occasion to consider the essential ingredients of an order of the

State Government, the court observed that the business of a state is

a complicated one and has necessarily to be conducted through the

tendency of a large number of officials and authorities.       Merely

writing something on the file does not amount to an order. Before

something amounts to an order of the State Government two things

are necessary. The order has to be expressed in the name of the

Governor as required by clause (1) of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_166">Art. 166</a> and then it has to be

communicated. As already indicated, no formal order modifying the

decision of the Revenue Secretary was ever made. Until such an

order is drawn up the State Government cannot, in our opinion, be

regarded as bound by what was stated in the file. As along as the

matter rested with him the Revenue Minister could well score out his

remarks or minutes on the file and write fresh ones.

</p><p id="p_241">162. In AIR 1987 SC 1554 State of Bihar etc. vs. Kripalu

Shankar etc., the court observed that a Government functions by

taking decision on the strength of views and suggestions expressed

by various officers at different levels, ultimately getting finality at

the hands of the minister concerned, the court had observed that

<a href="/doc/1838225/" id="a_167">Article 166(1)</a> required that all executive action of the State

Government shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the

Governor. Undoubtedly, this clause relates to cases where executive

action has to be expressed in the shape of a formal order or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">                                  81</span>
 notification and it prescribes the mode in which an executive action

has to be expressed. It was held that notings by an official in the

department file would not come within the ambit of the Article nor

even notings of a minister. Evey executive decision need not be as

laid down under <a href="/doc/1838225/" id="a_168">Article 166 (1)</a> but when it takes the form of an

order, it has to comply with <a href="/doc/1838225/" id="a_169">Article 166 (1).</a> Clause 2 of <a href="/doc/358020/" id="a_170">Article 166</a>

states that orders and other instruments made and executed under

<a href="/doc/1838225/" id="a_171">article 166(1)</a> shall be authenticated in the prescribed manner. The

Apex Court observed that a study of the article, therefore, makes it

clear that the notings in a file culminated into an order effecting

rights of parties only when it reaches the head of the department and

is expressed in the name of the governor, authenticated in the

manner provided in <a href="/doc/500615/" id="a_172">article 166 (2).</a>
</p>
<p id="p_242">163.   Learned senior counsel for the petitioner has also placed

reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at AIR

1988 SC 782 <a href="/doc/611866/" id="a_173">Doypack Systems Pvt. Ltd. vs. UOI &amp; Ors</a>. which is

also to the same effect.   It was held that notings made in various

departments at various levels by the officers is not the view of the

cabinet.   The ultimate decision is taken by the cabinet so far    the

notings are not the guides as to what decision the cabinet took.

</p><p id="p_243">164. Learned standing counsel for the respondent no. 1 has placed

reliance on the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at AIR

2004 SC 949 M/s Tafcon projects <a href="/doc/1620217/" id="a_174">India Ltd. vs. UOI &amp; ors. In</a>

this case, an issue has been raised as to whether the minister's

signatures without anything more amounted to approval of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">                                  82</span>
 previous notings.   It was on a consideration of the conspectus of

facts including the several steps in the matter and earlier notings

thereon that the court held that the necessary approval or the

decision stood taken in the matter. The position in the instant case is

different as discussed hereinabove.
</p>
<p id="p_244">165. I have noticed in some detail the affidavit filed by the Indian

Olympic Association wherein it has been urged at length that on 31st

August, 2001, the Minister had stated that the Guidelines dated 14th

August, 2001 were merely in the nature of a draft and had directed

the Secretary of the Ministry to so intimate all concerned. This

position has been reiterated by respondent nos. 2, 3 and 4 on

separate affidavits before this court. If the Guidelines dated 14th

August, 2001 as a whole were merely a draft which were directed by

the Minister not to be implemented, it is evident that there is no

question of the same Minister directing that a tenure clause

contained therein be 'kept in abeyance' or 'be scrapped'. There is

neither occasion nor requirement for so ordering on draft Guidelines.

</p><p id="p_245">166. So far as tenure was concerned, clause 3.5 has been in

existence since 1975. An issue was raised at the instance of the

sports federations that the same was unreasonable.

</p><p id="p_246">167.   I find that the Government has placed before this court a

meeting notice and the agenda note for the same. The details of the

proposed amendment which were to be considered by the meeting

have been set out as agenda item no. 1. It is noteworthy that the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">                                  83</span>
 agenda items do not include any discussion relating to the tenure

clause in the guidelines. This was evidently for the reason that no

amendment was being proposed to the said clause.

</p><p id="p_247">168. In fact, in the meeting held on 11th October, 2001, it was

directed that the revised guidelines would be implemented with

immediate effect.   According to the Government, the Minister had

concluded that 'issue of tenure' would be kept in abeyance and would

be considered with the report of the working group. This by itself

shows that a report of the working group was being awaited before

taking any kind of decision, interim or final with regard to the

objection to the tenure clause.
</p>
<p id="p_248">169. The noting of the minister has to be read strictly and it would

not be permissible to derive any inference therefrom or conclusions

or directions. If the intention was to scrap the tenure clause, it

would have been recorded that the same 'shall stand scrapped' or

other words to this effect.   It would not have been noted that it

'should be scrapped' or other words to this effect.

</p><p id="p_249">     On the 11th of October, 2001, therefore, it was the issue as to

whether the tenure restriction is required to be removed or not

which was kept in abeyance and not the applicability of clause 3.5.

The same is supported by the manner in which the noting dated 24th

August, 2002 is recorded.
</p>
<p id="p_250">170. This position is also manifested from the further consideration

on the file. This noting is stated to have been placed before the new


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">                                  84</span>
 minister on 31st October, 2002 who had clearly noted that he had

scrutinized the previous noting and that piecemeal decisions were

not required to be taken. On 31st October, 2002, the minister had

directed the Secretary of the Ministry to examine all the issues in

totality and put up the matter on relevant files in a period of one

month.
</p>
<p id="p_251">171. At this stage, it becomes necessary to notice some curious

facts. During the pendency of the case, the petitioner has filed CM

No. 6578/2005 enclosing three pages appearing to be an extract

from a Government file stating that on 19th May, 2001, these pages

were left at 5 p.m. in the office of the counsel for the petitioner and

contending that if the same were part of the government record, they

authoritatively establish that there was no order altering or

modifying the guidelines dated 14th August, 2001 or keeping the

same in abeyance and that they remained applicable in every

manner.
</p>
<p id="p_252">172. The respondent no. 1 has responded to this application, again

by way of an affidavit of its Under Secretary unequivocally admitting

that the noting forms part of Government record.             The only

reservation is that the internal file noting of the Minister of Youth

Affairs &amp; Sports filed by the petitioner was without any file number

and that the note annexed by the petitioner "relates to another

section, which does not deal with the policy issue of amendment of

guidelines for assistance to national sports federations (NSFs)." The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">                                  85</span>
 respondents do not dispute the existence but explain inability to

produce this file for the reason that it is not traceable and that the

answering respondent is making sincere efforts to locate the said

note.
</p>
<p id="p_253">173. It is noteworthy that the respondent no. 1 relies on the notings

produced by the petitioner with C.M. No. 6578/2005 and have

reproduced a part thereof in the body of the affidavit on its behalf to

show that the note dated 30th October, 2001 was actually prepared

only to provide assistance in the revised/annexed scales to all NSFs

as well as federations who had become eligible for assistance after

the issue of the revised guidelines on 14th August, 2001.          The

affidavit further states that the purpose of this note was for seeking

orders to process cases for grant of assistance to N.S.Fs on revised

scale and freshly eligible federations as the office had withheld

processing of files in view of order dated 31.8.2001, 21.9.2001 and

11.10.2001 and that the decision of the then Hon'ble Minister that

the issue of tenure will be kept in abeyance and will be considered

alongwith the report of the working group (as indicated in the

minutes of the meeting held on 11.10.2001 filed before the Hon'ble

High Court on 19.5.2005) as well as to set up a Working Group to

suggest amendments to the Guidelines for Assistance to N.S.Fs,

among other issues relating to sports were not reversed. A working

group was thus set up vide order dated 03.12.2001 to suggest

amendments to the said guidelines.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_86">                                  86</span>
</p><p id="p_255"> 174. The note sheets contain approval of a noting dated 30th

October, 2001 by the concerned Minister as well as the Secretary of

the Ministry.   The noting dated 30th October, 2001 records the

sequence of events including the circumstances in which the meeting

dated 11th October, 2001 had been called.    Para 8 of this noting

summing up the position and setting out the proposal deserves to be

considered in extenso and reads thus :-

<blockquote id="blockquote_92">     "8. It may kindly be observed from above deliberations
     that the guidelines were issued to all the National Sports
     Federations and all other concerned and made effective
     from 14.8.2001 and it was only an internal view that the
     guidelines may be discussed with federations, for which
     Hon. Minister was apprised on file that these guidelines
     have been prepared after due consultation with IOA and
     Federations. No formal order for keeping the operation of
     the revised guidelines in abeyance was issued as such the

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_94">175. It is noteworthy that the noting records that the earlier revision

in the guidelines had been approved by the concerned minister as

well as the finance minister. The Deputy Secretary (R) endorsed the

noting and wrote on the file that approval of the minister for

application of the provisions of the scheme with effect from the date

of approval of the Ministry of Finance be sought. This noting was

endorsed by all seniors and bears the signatures of the Minister as

well. It certainly negates the respondents' case.

<p id="p_256">176. Learned senior counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_87">                                  87</span>
 the pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at (2001) 8 SCC

606 (paras 25-28) Centre for <a href="/doc/1755868/" id="a_175">Public Interest Litigation vs. UOI</a>

in support of its submission that the respondent no. 1 has

deliberately and malafide withheld relevant material from this court

and has filed false affidavits. Perusal of this judgment would show

that a similar stand taken by the Central Bureau of Investigation that

record which was required to be produced before the court was not

traceable was deprecated by the court and it was observed that the

allegation of the petitioner, if true, reflected very poorly on the

integrity of the organisation.
</p>
<p id="p_257">177. It has not been contended before this court that the note sheets

relied upon by the petitioner do not have a bearing or are not

relevant for the purposes of consideration of the pleas raised by the

parties before this court.   It needs no elaboration that a party in

possession of the best evidence and material is bound to place the

same before the court irrespective of the onus or burden of proof. In

the instant case, the respondent no. 1 cannot adopt a partisan stand

inasmuch as the petitioner is seeking enforcement of guidelines

framed by it and what is at stake is recognition of a national level

sports body and dispensation of enormous sums of public funds in

the form of financial assistance and utilisation of public resources.

The duty cast on the respondent no. 1 is even more onerous and it

was bound to have placed the complete facts and official records

before this court, leaving it to the court to draw its own conclusions

therefrom.    Instead, two contradictory stands have been taken


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_88">                                  88</span>
 during the course of hearing.
</p>
<p id="p_258">178. The petitioner has urged that it has been the consistent stand

of the Government of India itself before various courts in various

affidavits whereby it has placed the guidelines in totality before the

courts placing reliance on the same in support of submissions

relating to recognition and grant of financial assistance. It has been

stated by the petitioner that the respondent no. 1 has never stated

that the guidelines so far as the tenure clause was concerned were

not applicable or not implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_259">179. Before the Constitution Bench hearing <a href="/doc/404603/" id="a_176">Zee Telefilms &amp; Anr. vs.

UOI</a>, an issue was raised as to whether the Union of India had

granted de facto recognition to the BCCI under the very guidelines

which are placed before this court. In paras 203 to 208 at pages 73

and 74 of the report, the court has dealt at length with these

guidelines and the provisions thereunder.
</p>
<p id="p_260">180. So far as the Government stand was concerned, the same is

found to be referred to in paras 211 and 212 of the report which

makes a reference to an affidavit filed by the Government of India

where placing reliance on its power under the very guidelines, the

court has held thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_95">        "211. In the affidavit dated 8th October, 2004 affirmed
        by a Deputy Secretary to the Government of India,
        Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, it is stated:
        "1. I am informed that this Hon'ble Court required to
        be apprised as to whether it was mandatory for all
        sporting bodies including private entities or clubs to
        seek permission and to obtain the same for playing in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_89">                                  89</span>
           tournaments abroad.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_96">          2. In response to the issue raised before this Hon'ble
          Court, it is respectfully submitted that only the
          recognized. National Sports Federations are required
          to apply in the prescribed format for seeking
          permission to go abroad to play as a Team
          representing India. There have been instances where
          club teams; organizations engaged in sports activities
          etc. have applied for such permission but the Ministry
          has considered their request only when they were
          received through the National Sports Federation -
          BCCI in this case."
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_97">          212. It is not disputed that the Union of India has not
          recognized, any other national sports body for
          regulating the game of cricket in India. It is the
          categorical stand of the Union of India that only by
          such recognition granted by the Union of India the
          team selected by the Board is the Indian cricket team
          which it could not do in absence thereof."
</blockquote>


<p id="p_261">181. It was never stated that these were draft guidelines or that any

portion thereof was in abeyance.         The Union of India had pleaded

that the BCCI and its officials are the recipients of State largesse and

recognition under the Government guidelines.

</p><p id="p_262">182. The submissions made on behalf of the respondents can be

tested from yet another aspect.          If it were to be held that the

guidelines dated 14th August, 2001 are not binding, it may result in a

chaotic     state   of   affairs.    More      than   one   state   level

federation/association may claim that it is the national level

federation/association. These guidelines have been in force since the

year 1975.
</p>
<p id="p_263">183. The stand in the later affidavit is clearly an after thought and

contradicted by the copy of the notings produced by the petitioner


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_90">                                    90</span>
 and the affidavits of respondent nos. 2 to 4.
</p>
<p id="p_264">184. It is noteworthy that the note sheet produced by the petitioner

also shows that the revision in the guidelines has the approval of not

only the Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports but also has the

concurrence of the Ministry of Finance and that the circulation of the

order on 14th August, 2001 was not in the nature of circulation of a

draft guideline.
</p>
<p id="p_265">185. The guidelines including the tenure clause was in existence

since 1975.        It was retained and reaffirmed in 1997 and 201.

Recognition   to     national   level    sports   federation   as   well   as

dispensation of the state largesse was being effected on compliance

of the conditions laid down in these guidelines. The said guidelines

were definitely not draft guidelines.             They are also the only

regulatory guidelines which guide and govern recognition of national

sports bodies.      The said guidelines also provide the procedure

including the manner in which applications for aid and assistance

and the dispensation thereof is to be made by the respondent no. 1.

There is also nothing to indicate that the same were kept in

abeyance by any competent authority or binding order.

</p><p id="p_266">186. The fact that the Guidelines were admittedly issued in the form

of a formal order on behalf of the Government of India on the 11 th of

August, 1981 and duly circulated does not support the stand of the

Government of India. The guidelines were evidently not considered

in the nature of 'a draft' by the Government and were actually

binding. The respondents do not rely on any other guidelines which

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                        91</span>
 lay down the eligibility or procedure for dispensation of the largesse

or recognition as a national sports federation. The respondent no. 2

has applied under these guidelines, has been recognised as a

National Sports Federation and has received grants and other

assistance from the Government under the guidelines. So have the

other NSFs. This manifests both that the guidelines were not merely

a draft and that they were implemented.
</p>
<p id="p_267">     The stand taken before this court by the respondent no. 1 in the

additional affidavit is an after thought and not supported by any

decision or material.
</p>
<p id="p_268">187. The Government files have not been produced for perusal. The

contention that the guidelines were kept in abeyance is concerned, is

also not supported by any authentic or complete record before this

court.
</p>
<p id="p_269">     It is, therefore, held that the guidelines were neither draft

guidelines nor kept in abeyance. These guidelines bind the manner

in which recognition is to be granted to National Sports Federations

and financial assistance is to be dispensed.
</p>
<p id="p_270">No writ of mandamus can issue to enforce non-statutory

guidelines

</p><p id="p_271">188. It has been urged on behalf of the respondents that the

guidelines being administrative in nature would not be enforceable

by issuance of a writ in the nature of a mandamus. The submission is

that administrative rules, regulations, instructions, which do not flow


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                  92</span>
 from statutes have been held to have no force of law.      Guidelines

issued by way of executive instructions also cannot override

statutory provisions. Any order passed in violation of such guidelines

cannot be held to be illegal, void or inoperative.

</p><p id="p_272">189. It has been urged by Dr. A.M. Singhvi, Senior Advocate as well

as Mr. V.P. Singh, learned Senior Advocate representing the

respondent nos. 2 to 4 on the one hand and the Indian Olympic

Association that no writ in the nature of a mandamus can be issued

to enforce purely administrative instructions and a member of a

private association cannot approach the court for enforcement of

such administrative instructions which do not have the force of law

and cannot bind the associations. In this behalf, reliance has been

placed by learned senior counsels on the pronouncements of the

Apex Court reported at AIR 1965 SC 1196 <a href="/doc/414655/" id="a_177">State of Assam vs. Ajit

Kumar Sharma (Head</a> note, para 12); (1972) 4 SCC 188 <a href="/doc/401501/" id="a_178">Kumari

Regina vs. St. Aloysius Higher Elementary School and Anr</a>. and

(1988) 4 SCC 364 <a href="/doc/728749/" id="a_179">J.R. Raghupati vs. State of Andhra Pradesh

&amp; Ors</a>. (para 17 and 31).
</p>
<p id="p_273">190. By virtue of <a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_180">Article 73</a>, the executive power of the Union of

India is co-extensive with the legislative power of the parliament.

<a href="/doc/883495/" id="a_181">Article 73</a> does not define what would constitute an executive

function nor does it mention the subject matters over which the

executive power is exercised.    The executive power of the Union is

also not circumscribed by any existing legislation on the relevant

subject.   In the absence of any legislative provision, regulating or

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_93">                                   93</span>
 controlling sports activity at the national level, it has been held that

it is open to the Government of India to issue executive instructions

and orders to guide the same.      It is trite that such administrative

instructions issued in exercise of executive power, can be changed or

amended by the executive.
</p>
<p id="p_274">191. An identical issue had arisen for consideration before the Apex

Court in the pronouncement reported at (1973) 1 SCC 194 :

MANU/SC/0610/1972 entitled <a href="/doc/526906/" id="a_182">UOI vs. K.P. Joseph &amp; Ors. The</a>

Apex Court placed reliance on an earlier pronouncement reported at

AIR 1967 SC 1910 : (1966) 1 SCR 111 <a href="/doc/1320680/" id="a_183">Sant Ram Sharma vs.

State of Rajasthan &amp; Anr</a>. wherein it had been held that the

Government cannot supersede statutory rules by administrative

instructions.   Yet if the rules framed under <a href="/doc/1123043/" id="a_184">article 309</a> of the

Constitution of India are silent on any particular point, the

Government can fill up gaps and supplement the rules and issue

instructions not inconsistent with the rules already framed and that

these instructions would govern the condition of service.

</p><p id="p_275">192. The Apex court also reiterated the principles laid down by it in

the earlier decision reported at AIR 1968 SC 718 : (1968) 2 SCR

366, 377 <a href="/doc/1882267/" id="a_185">UOI &amp; Ors. vs. M/s Indo Afghan Agencies Ltd</a>. wherein

the question which was raised before the Apex Court was as to

whether the import trade policy was legislative in character. It was

held by the court that the trade policy was executive in nature. Yet it

had been held that courts have the power in appropriate cases to

compel performance of the obligation imposed by the schemes upon

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_94">                                   94</span>
 the departmental authorities.
</p>
<p id="p_276">193. In this background, in <a href="/doc/526906/" id="a_186">UOI vs. K.P. Joseph</a> (supra), the Apex

Court held that 'to say that an administrative order can never confer

any right would be too wide a proposition and that the general rule

that an administrative order confers no justiciable right was subject

to exceptions.    There are administrative order which confer rights

and impose duties which would be enforceable. The principles laid

down by the Apex Court in this behalf in this pronouncement read as

follows :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_98">       "10. xxx
       To say that an administrative order can never confer any
       right would be too wide a proposition. There are-
       administrative orders which confer rights and impose
       duties. It is because an administrative order can abridge
       or take away rights that we have imported the principle
       of natural justice of audi alteram partem into this area. A
       very perceptive writer has written :
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_99">       Let us take one of Mr. Harrison's instances, a regulation
       from the British War Office that no recruit shall be
       enlisted who is not five feet six inches high. Suppose a
       recruiting officer musters in a man who is five feet five
       inches only in height, and pays him the King's shilling;
       afterwards the officer is sued by the Government for
       being short in his accounts; among other items he claims
       to be allowed the shilling paid to the undersized recruit.
       The Court has to consider and apply this regulation and,
       whatever its effect may be, that effect will be given to it
       by the Court exactly as effect will be given to a statute
       providing that murderers shall be hanged, or that last
       wills must have two witnesses. (John Chipman Gray on
       "The Nature and Sources of the Law").
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_100">       11. We should not be understood as laying down any
       general proposition on this question. But we think that
       the Order in question conferred upon the first respondent
       the right to have his pay fixed in the manner specified in
       the Order and that was part of the conditions of his
       service. We see no reason why the Court should not
       enforce that right."
</blockquote>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_95">                                  95</span>
<p id="p_277"> 194. This very issue arose before this court in the pronouncement

reported at AIR 1976 Delhi 310 <a href="/doc/428183/" id="a_187">Jiwat Bai &amp; Sons vs. G.C. Batra</a>

and the applicable principles were put down with great clarity in the

judgment pronounced by H.L. Anand, J. The contention raised and

the principle laid down by the court were stated so :-

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_101">      "(8) Shri Dhebar. however, contends that assuming that
      the policy confers a right and that the right was denied to
      the petitioners in contravention of the policy, the petition
      for a writ of mandamus would, nevertheless be not
      maintainable and the petitioners would not be entitled to
      any relief because the policy was not statutory in nature
      and a mere breach of non-statutory policy or instructions
      would not afford a cause of action for such a relief. Shri
      Dhebar further contends that a claim for a writ of
      mandamus must be founded on a legal right and that
      breach of a mere non-statutory instructions neither
      confers a right nor gives rise to any statutory obligation
      which alone could be enforced by a writ of mandamus. It
      is further contended that an administrative direction like
      the present policy could not confer any justiciable right
      upon a citizen which could be enforced in a Court by a
      writ or order in the nature of mandamus and that the
      foundation for the issue of a writ or order in the nature of
      mandamus being the existence of a legal right, and
      administrative order being incapable of conferring any
      justiciable right, no writ could be issued. It is true that the
      policy is not statutory in nature and is, at best, in the
      nature of executive instructions issued with a view to
      regulate the renewal of vending licenses, and may, in that
      sense, be likened to a Government scheme. It is equally
      true that when an executive authority commits breach of
      these instructions, it could not be said that a statutory
      obligation had been violated. It is also undisputed that
      ordinarily a claim for mandamus must be based on a legal
      right and such a writ is granted to compel the
      performance of a statutory duty. There are, however, well
      recognised exceptions to this general rule. It has been
      recognised that there are administrative orders which
      confer right and impose duties and that Courts have a
      power in appropriate cases to compel performance of the
      obligation imposed by the non-statutory scheme or
      administrative instructions upon the executive authorities

       303, U.O.I. Vs Indo Afghan Co. Air 1963. S.C. 718. At one
       time it was no doubt that the executive instructions did
       not bind the authorities, could not confer any right or
       obligation and could not, therefore, be enforced, in a
       Court of law. Recent legal thinking has, however,
       recognised that where there is no statutory provision,
       executive instructions fill in the gap Sant Ram Vs State of
       Rajasthan AIR 1967 SC 1910 and are not only capable of
       conferring rights on the citizen and imposing obligations
       on the authorities, which are charged with the duty of
       carrying out the policy, but that in appropriate cases.
       Court may even compel the performance of such a duty."

<p id="p_278">195. A similar issue relating to enforceability of non-statutory

guidelines arose before the Supreme Court in the pronouncement

reported at 1990 Supp. SCC 440 <a href="/doc/65796/" id="a_188">Narendra Kumar Maheshwari

vs. UOI &amp; Ors. The</a> court was of the view that though the guidelines

were not judicially enforceable, however judicial review of the matter

could be made where there was arbitrariness and malafide or where

the    deviations   from   the   guidelines   involves   arbitrariness   or

discrimination or is so fundamental as to undermine a basic public

purpose which the guidelines and the statute under which they are

issued are intended to achieve.          In para 106 and 107 of the

judgment, the court held thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_102">      "106. It may, however, be stated that being non statutory in
      character, these guidelines are not enforceable. See the

</p><p id="p_280">      Norwich Corporation 1971 2 QB 614 and p. 626 Also the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_97">                                    97</span>
 observations in British Oxygen Co. v. Board of Trade 1971
AC 610. See also Foulkes' Administrative Law, 6th Ed. at
page 181-184. In Ex P. Khan (1981 1 All. E.R. page ), the
Court held that a circular or self made rule can become
enforceable of the application of persons if it was shown that
it had created legitimate expectation in their minds that the
authority would abide by such a policy/guideline. However,
the doctrine of legitimate expectation applies only when a
person had been given reason to believe that the State will
abide by the certain policy or guideline on the basis of which
such applicant might have been led to take certain actions.
This doctrine is akin to the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
See also the observations of Lord Wilberforce in IRC v.
National Federation 1982 AC 617. However, it has to be
borne in mind that the guidelines on which the petitioners
have relied are not statutory in character. These guidelines
are not judicially enforceable. The competent authority
might depart from these guidelines where the proper
exercise of his discretion so warrants. In the present case,
the statute provided that rules can be made by the Central
Government only. Furthermore, according to <a href="/doc/1215324/" id="a_193">Section 6(2)</a> of
the Act, the competent authority has the power and
jurisdiction to condone any deviation from even the
statutory requirements prescribed under <a href="/doc/76226/" id="a_194">Sections 3</a> and <a href="/doc/343062/" id="a_195">4</a> of
the Act. In Regina v. Preston Supplementary 197 I WLR p.
624 at p. 631, it had been held that the Act should be
administered with as little technicality as possible. Judicial
review of these matters, though can always be made where
there was arbitrariness and malafide and where the purpose
of an authority in exercising its statutory power and that of
legislature in conferring the powers are demonstrably at
variance, should be exercised cautiously and soberly.

</p><p id="p_281">107. We would also like refer to one more aspect of the
enforceability of the guidelines by persons in the position of
the petitioners in these cases. Guidelines are issued by
Governments and statutory authorities in various types of
situations. Where such guidelines are intended to clarify or
implement the conditions and requirements precedent to the
exercise of certain rights conferred in favour of citizens or
persons and a deviation therefrom directly affects the rights
so vested the persons whose rights are affected have a clear
right to approach the court for relief. Sometimes guidelines
control the choice of persons competing with one another
for the grant of benefits largesses or favours and, if the
guidelines are departed from without rhyme or reason, an
arbitrary discrimination may result which may call for
judicial review. In some other instances (as in the Ramanna
Shetty case), the guidelines may prescribe certain standards


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_98">                              98</span>
     or norms for the grant of certain benefits and a relaxation
    of, or departure from, the norms may affect persons, not
    directly but indirectly, in the sense that though they did not
    seek the benefit or privilege as they were not eligible for it
    on the basis of the announced norms, they might also have
    entered, the fray had the relaxed guidelines been made
    known. In other word they would have been potential
    competitors in case any relaxations or departure were to be
    made. In a case of the present type, however, the guidelines
    operate in a totally different field. The guidelines do not
    affect or regulate the right of any person other than the
    company applying for consent. The manner of application of
    these guidelines, whether strict or lax, does not either
    directly or indirectly, affect the rights or potential rights of
    any others or deprive them, directly or indirectly, of any
    advantages or benefits to which they were or would have
    been entitled In this context, there is only a very limited
    scope for judicial review on the ground that the guidelines
    have not been followed or have been deviated from. Any
    member of the public can perhaps claim that such of the
    guidelines as impose controls intended to safeguard the
    interests of members of the public investing in such public
    issues should be strictly enforced and not departed from as
    departure therefrom will take away the protections provided
    to them. The scope for such challenge will necessarily be
    very narrow and restricted and will depend to a
    considerable extent on the nature and extent of the
    deviation. For instance, if debentures were issued which
    provide no security at all or if the debt-equity ratio is 6000 :
    1 (as alleged) as against the permissible 2:1 (or thereabouts)
    a Court may be persuaded to interfere."

<p id="p_284">197. It   is   trite   that   the   administrative   orders   or   executive

instructions may be changed, rescinded or altered by administrative

orders or executive instructions issued at any time. In (1974) 2 SCC

348 <a href="/doc/1001043/" id="a_203">M/s Andhra Industrial Works vs. Chief</a> controller of

Imports &amp; Ors., the Import Control Policy Statement was held to be



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                                      100</span>
 only a policy statement and not a statutory document.          For this

reason, it was held that no person can, merely on the basis of such a

statement, claim a right to the grant of an import license,

enforceable at law.
</p>
<p id="p_285">198. Administrative   or   executive    instructions   can   supplement

statutory rules. There is a material and obvious distinction between

the impact of an executive instruction which runs contrary to

statutory provision and whittles down their effect which was the

subject matter of consideration before the Apex Court in 1992

Supp.1 SCC 150 <a href="/doc/1789036/" id="a_204">State of M.P. vs. G.S. Dall &amp; Flour Mills</a> , which

has been relied upon by the respondent. In this case, by virtue of a

notification issued under the M.P. General Sales Tax Act and M.P.

Deferment of Payment of Tax Rules, 1983, the petitioner became

entitled to certain exemptions.       By virtue of certain guidelines,

certain additional requirements were imposed in order to be entitled

to the exemption. In this background, the court reiterated the well

settled principles that executive instructions can supplement a

statute or cover areas to which the statute does not extend but they

cannot run contrary to statutory provisions or whittle down their

effect.   For this reason, instructions which denied exemption to a

person who qualified under the statutory notification were liable to

be struck down on the ground of impermissible delegation of

legislative power to the executive.
</p>
<p id="p_286">     There can be no dispute with this well settled legal principle.

However as noticed above, there is no statutory provision which


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                                  101</span>
 governs the subject matter of financial assistance or grant of

recognition to a sports association as a national body representative

of the sport and for this reason the principles laid down by the

judgment do not come into play.
</p>
<p id="p_287">199. The nature of an eligibility condition and the very authority of

the respondents to impose the same was assailed before the apex

court in (1979) 3 SCC 489 <a href="/doc/1281050/" id="a_205">Ramana Dayaram Shetty vs

International Airport Authority of India &amp; Ors.                    The</a> court

considered the expanding activities of the Government in a welfare

state and also noticed that the state dispenses large number of

benefits   as   well   as   special   services   which   include    financial

assistance, jobs, contracts, licenses etc and the manner in which this

dispensation ought to be effected. In this behalf, the observations of

the Apex Court in paras 10, 11 and 12 succinctly laid down the

principles which would govern the consideration of the very issues

raised before this court as well. It would be useful to set down these

principles which reads thus:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_108">               "10. xxx
               It is a well settled rule of administrative law that
      an executive authority must be rigorously held to the
      standards by which it professes its actions to be judged
      and it must scrupulously observe these standards on
      pain of invalidation of an act in violation of them.</blockquote><p id="p_288">
</p><p id="p_289">      ............ Today with tremendous expansion of welfare
      and social service functions, increasing control of
      material and economic resources and large scale
      assumption of industrial and commercial activities by
      the State, the power of the executive Government to
      affect the lives of the people is steadily growing. The
      attainment of socio-economic justice being a conscious
      end of State policy, there is a vast and inevitable
      increase in the frequency with which ordinary citizens

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                                      102</span>
 come into relationship of direct encounter with State
power-holders. This renders it necessary to structure
and restrict the power of the executive Government so
as to prevent its arbitrary application or exercise.
Whatever be the concept of the rule of law, whether it
be the meaning given by Dicey in his "The Law of the
Constitution" or the definition given by Hayek in his
"Road to Serfdom" and "Constitution of liberty" or the
exposition set-forth by Harry Jones in his "The Rule of
Law and the Welfare State", there is, as pointed out by
Mathew, J., in his article on "The Welfare State, Rule of
Law and Natural Justice" in "Democracy, Equality and
Freedom," "substantial agreement is in juristic thought
that the great purpose of the rule of law notion is the
protection of the individual against arbitrary exercise of
power, wherever it is found". It is indeed unthinkable
that in a democracy governed by the rule of law the
executive Government or any of its officers should
possess arbitrary power over the interests of the
individual. Every action of the executive Government
must be informed with reason and should be free from
arbitrariness. That is the very essence of the rule of law
and its bare minimal requirement. And to the
application of this principle it makes not difference
whether the exercise of the power involves affection of
some right or denial of some privilege.
</p><p id="p_290">11. To-day the Government, is a welfare State, is the
regulator and dispenser of special services and provider
of a large number of benefits, including jobs contracts,
licences, quotas, mineral rights etc. The Government
pours forth wealth, money, benefits, services, contracts,
quotas and licences. The valuables dispensed by
Government take many forms, but they all share one
characteristic. They are steadily taking the place of
traditional forms of wealth. These valuables which
derive from relationships to Government are of many
kinds. They comprise social security benefits, cash
grants for political sufferers and the whole scheme of
State and local welfare. Then again, thousands of people
are employed in the State and the Central Governments
and local authorities. Licences are required before one
can engage in many kinds of business or work. The
power of giving licences means power to withhold them
and this gives control to the Government or to the
agents of Government on the lives of many people.
Many individuals and many more businesses enjoy
largess in the form of Government contracts. These
contracts often resemble subsidies. It is virtually
impossible to lose money on them and many enterprises


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                           103</span>
 are set up primarily to do business with Government.
Government owns and controls hundreds of acres of
pubic land valuable for mining and other purposes.
These resources are available for utilisation by private
corporations and individuals by way of lease or licence.
All these mean growth in the Government largess and
with the increasing magnitude and range of
governmental functions as we move closer to a welfare
State, more and more of our wealth consists of these
new forms. Some of these forms of wealth may be in the
nature of legal rights but the large majority of them are
in the nature of privileges. But on that account, can it be
said that they do not enjoy any legal protection? Can
they be regarded as gratuity furnished by the State so
that the State may withhold, grant or revoke it at its
pleasure? Is the position of the Government in this
respect the same as that of a private giver? We do not
think so. The law has not been slow to recognise the
importance of this new kind of wealth and the need to
protect individual interest in it and with that end in
view, it has developed new forms of protection. Some
interests in Government largess, formerly regarded as
privileges, have been recognised as rights while others
have been given legal protection not only by forging
procedural safeguards but also by confining/structuring
and checking Government discretion in the matter of
grant of such largess. The discretion of the Government
has been held to be not unlimited in that the
Government cannot give or withhold largess in its
arbitrary discretion or at its sweet will. It is insisted, as
pointed out by Prof. Reich in an especially stimulating
article on "The New Property" in 73 Yale Law Journal
733, "that Government action be based on standards
that are not arbitrary or unauthorised." "The
Government cannot be permitted to say that it will give
jobs or enter into contracts or issue quotas or licences
only in favour of those having grey hair or belonging to
a particular political party or professing a particular
religious faith. The Government is still the Government
when it acts in the matter of granting largess and it
cannot act arbitrarily. It does not stand in the same
position as a private individual.
</p><p id="p_291">12. We agree with the observations of Mathew, J., in <a href="/doc/764006/" id="a_206">V.
Punnan Thomas v. State of Kerala</a> AIR 1969 Ker 81 that
: "The Government is not and should not be as free as an
individual in selecting the recipients for its largess.
Whatever its activity, the Government is still the
Government and will be subject to restraints, inherent
in its position in a democratic society. A democratic

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                            104</span>
 Government cannot lay down arbitrary and capricious
standards for the choice of persons with whom alone it
will deal". The same point was made by this Court in
<a href="/doc/743328/" id="a_207">Erusian Equipment and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West
Bengali</a> (1975) 1 SCC 70 where the question was
whether black-listing of a person without giving him an
opportunity to be heard was bad? Ray, C.J., speaking on
behalf of himself and his colleagues on the Bench
pointed out that black-listing of a person not only affects
his reputation which is in Poundian terms an interest
both of personality and substance, but also denies him
equality in the matter of entering into contract with the
Government and it cannot, therefore, be supported
without fair hearing. It was argued for the Government
that no person has a right to enter into contractual
relationship with the Government and the Government,
like any other private individual, has the absolute right
to enter into contract with any one it pleases. But the
Court, speaking through the learned Chief Justice,
responded that the Government is not like a private
individual who can pick and choose the person with
whom it will deal, but the Government is still a
Government when it enters into contract or when it is
administering largesse and it cannot, without adequate
reason, exclude any person from dealing with it or take
away largess arbitrarily. The learned Chief Justice said
that when the Government is trading with the public,
"the democratic form of Government demands equality
and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such
transactions. The activities of the Government have a
public element and, therefore, there should be fairness
and equality. The State need not enter into any contract
with anyone, but if it does so, it must do so fairly
without discrimination and without unfair procedure."
This proposition would hold good in all cases of dealing
by the Government with the public, where the interest
sought to be protected is a privilege. It must, therefore,
be taken to be the law that where the Government is
dealing with the public, whether by way of giving jobs
or entering into contracts or issuing quotas or licences
or granting other forms of largess, the Government
cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and, like a private
individual, deal with any person it pleases, but its action
must be in conformity with standard or norms which is
not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant. The power or
discretion of the Government in the matter of grant of
largess including award of jobs, contracts, quotas,
licences etc., must be confined and structured by
rational, relevant and non-discriminatory standard or


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                            105</span>
       norm and if the Government departs from such standard
      or norm in any particular case or cases, the action of the
      Government would be liable to be struck down, unless it
      can be shown by the Government that the departure
      was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid principle
      which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable or
      discriminatory."
</p>
<p id="p_292">200. So far as the jurisdiction to lay down conditions and enforce the

guidelines for grant of financial assistance and recognition is

concerned, an issue with regard to permissibility of University/State

providing for a condition for granting recognition/affiliation was

raised before the Apex Court in the judgment reported at AIR 2003

SC 3724 <a href="/doc/1978528/" id="a_208">Islamic Academy of Education vs. State of Karnataka</a> .

The Apex Court in para 17 of the judgment held that such

provisions/conditions prescribing merit base selection can be made

at the time of granting recognition or affiliation as well as

subsequently after the grant of such recognition or affiliation.

</p><p id="p_293">201. It is, therefore, trite that though it may not be possible to assert

a right based on administrative/executive instructions and non-

statutory guidelines, however, a challenge may be available to a

person to assail an action by the authority concerned on grounds of

arbitrariness, malafide for breach thereof. The prayers made by the

petitioner have to be tested in this background.

</p><p id="p_294">202. The respondent no. 1 has stated that the Indian Hockey

Federation is the national level federation recognised by the

Government for the game of hockey.         It is further stated by the

Government on affidavit that the Indian Hockey Federation is one of

the national sports federations getting financial assistance exceeding

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                                   106</span>
 Rs.1 crore in a year through the Comptroller General of India as per

the provisions of 'guidelines for assistance to National Sports

Federation' and that has been issued necessary instructions for audit

of its accounts. A statement showing grants released by the Ministry

of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports to the Indian Hockey Federation between

1995 to the year 2005 shows that in the year 1995 an amount of

Rs.80,54,831/- was released which in the year 1999, went up to

Rs.1,09,12,796/-    and   in   2004-2005   has   further   increased   to

Rs.1,94,21,032/-.
</p>
<p id="p_295">203. The respondent no. 2 though has not given the details of the

amounts advanced by the respondent no. 1, however it accepts that

respondent no. 1 is giving financial assistance have identified

activities of the players. It is also stated that apart from the grants

made by the Government of India, the respondent federation is

receiving funds through sponsorship and royalties from sale of

broadcasting rights of matches.
</p>
<p id="p_296">204. From a perusal of the various documents placed before the

court, it would appear that holding of an office in the National Sports

Federation enables the membership in international sports bodies.

Office bearers of the national sports federation are also entitled to be

office bearers in international sports bodies and forums. It enables

absolute control over the national and international level activities of

the sports federation and grants an absolute control to the person

concerned over the sport in question.       It enables the official to

manage, control, organise sporting conferences, events competition,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_107">                                   107</span>
 nationally as well as internationally.             Undoubtedly, the person

concerned gets enormous power over the amounts of finances which

are   available   to   the   national     sports    federations   both   from

Government and from the private persons; absolute control over the

game of hockey in India and the fate of hockey players in India.

</p><p id="p_297">205. The submission and objection on behalf of the respondents also

fails to take into consideration the pronouncement of the Apex Court

in <a href="/doc/404603/" id="a_209">Zee Telefilms vs. UOI &amp; Ors</a>. wherein the Apex Court has

categorically held that the impact thereon is not on the association

or federation alone. The impact of the guidelines and the object and

purpose for which they have been enforced certainly cannot be

ignored and even though the guidelines be non-statutory or issued in

exercise of executive powers by the Government.

</p><p id="p_298">206. In the case reported at <a href="/doc/414655/" id="a_210">State of Assam vs. Ajit Kumar

Sharma</a> (supra), Mr. Ajit Kumar Sharma was a teacher in the Hindu

Girls College at Gauhati which received a grant from the State of

Assam.     Certain conditions had been imposed by the State

Government of Assam while giving such a grant to private colleges to

enable them to give higher scales of pay etc. to their teachers in

accordance with the recommendations of the University Grants

Commission. The petitioner was seeking enforcement of these rules

as binding on the college and seeking a mandamus based thereon as

an entitlement to the benefits under the rules.

</p><p id="p_299">      In the judgment reported at AIR 1965 SC 1196 <a href="/doc/414655/" id="a_211">State of

Assam vs. Ajit Kumar Sharma</a>, the Apex Court clearly held that

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_108">                                    108</span>
 there was no law to prevent the state from prescribing the conditions

of the grants made by it by mere executive instructions which do not

have the force of statutory rules. Such conditions of grant in aid laid

down by executive instructions were open to the private college to

accept or not to accept them.           If it decides not to accept the

instructions, it would naturally not get the grant and aid which was

contingent      on   it   accepting   the   conditions   contained   in   the

instructions.
</p>
<p id="p_300">     It was held that the state could prescribe instructions laying

down condition of grant. However it was not open to a teacher to

insist that the governing body should carry out the instructions as

they conferred no right of any kind on teachers and consequently

they could not apply to the High Court for a mandamus seeking the

enforcement or non-enforcement of the rules, even if indirectly there

may be some effect on them because of the grant and aid being

withheld in whole or in part.
</p>
<p id="p_301">207. The pronouncement of the Apex Court reported at (1988) 4

SCC 364 <a href="/doc/728749/" id="a_212">J.R. Raghupati vs. State of Andhra Pradesh &amp; Ors</a>.

was concerned with a challenge to a pronouncement of the Andhra

Pradesh High Court involving a question of principle relating to

location of mandal headquarters in the state of Andhra Pradesh

under section 3(5) of the Andhra Pradesh Districts (Formation) Act,

1974. The issue raised before the court was whether location of the

Mandal Headquarters was a purely governmental function and

therefore not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of the High Court


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_109">                                      109</span>
 under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_213">article 226</a> of the Constitution. The High Court quashed the

Government notification issued after consideration of objections and

a detailed consideration by the authorities on the ground that the

government acted in breach of guidelines. In this case the court was

of the view that mandamus could not be issued to enforce the

guidelines which were in the nature of administrative instructions

not having a statutory force and not giving any legal right in favour

of the writ petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_302">     In this case, the Apex Court set aside the interference by the

High Court in cases where it had directed relocation of the Mandal

Headquarters inter alia for the reason that the location of the

Mandal Headquarters by the Government was on a consideration by

the Cabinet Sub-committee of proposals submitted by collectors

concerned and objections and suggestions received from local

authorities like the Gram Panchayat and the general public keeping

in view the relevant factors. The court was of the view that even if

breach of the guidelines laid down by the Government was

justiciable, the utmost that the high Court could have done was to

quashed the impugned notification in a particular case and direct the

Government to reconsider the question. It was further observed by

the court that there was nothing on record to show that the decision

of the State Government in any of the cases was arbitrary or

capricious or was one not urged in good faith or actuated with

improper consideration or influenced by extraneous considerations.

The issues raised before the Supreme Court in this case do not arise


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_110">                                 110</span>
 for consideration in the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_303">208. Again   in   <a href="/doc/401501/" id="a_214">Kumari    Regina       vs.   Saint   Aloysius   Higher

Elementary School and Anr</a>. reported at (1972) 4 SCC 188 the

Supreme Court held that if the terms of the appointment letter

issued by the school were different from the conditions of the

affiliation to be fulfilled by a school as imposed by the State

Government, a teacher aggrieved thereby may not be entitled to seek

a relief in his favour on the basis of the conditions of affiliation. At

the same time, the Apex Court held that, the state administration

was fully empowered to enforce the fulfilment of the conditions

towards affiliation against the school. It is noteworthy that in para

24 of the pronouncement, the Apex Court has clearly stated that the

Government has the power to admit schools to recognition and

grants in aid; and it cannot be gainsaid that de hors the statutory

enactment, the Government can lay out conditions under which it

would grant recognition and aid. It is further held by the Supreme

Court that   "to achieve uniformity and certainty to the exercise of

such executive power and to avoid discrimination, the Government

would have to frame rules which, however, would be in the form of

administrative instructions to its officers dealing with the matters of

recognition and aid. If such rules were to lay down conditions, the

Government can insist that satisfaction of such conditions would be a

condition precedent to obtaining recognition and aid and that a

breach or non-compliance of such conditions would entail either

denial or withdrawal of recognition and aid. The management of a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_111">                                  111</span>
 school, therefore, would commit a breach or non-compliance of the

conditions laid down in the rules on pain of deprivation of

recognition and aid.   The rules thus govern the terms on which the

Government would grant recognition and aid and the Government

can enforce those rules upon the management.
</p>
<p id="p_304">209. It is noteworthy that the conclusions of the Apex Court in the

case were based on the well settled principles that non-statutory

administrative/executive conditions and instructions would confer no

right on the teachers of private college and they cannot ask that

either a particular instruction or condition should be enforced or

should not be enforced to assert a right in his favour based thereon.

However, the Apex Court reiterated its earlier view that the

Government is entitled to insist on compliance with such conditions

for affiliation, recognition and aid; that breach or non-compliance

would vest the consequence of denial or withdrawal thereof.

</p><p id="p_305">210. A closer look at the guidelines dated 14th August, 2001 would

show that they have been framed with the objective of defining the

areas of responsibility of the various agencies involved in promotion

and development of sports in India; to identify national sports

federations/associations eligible for recognition and coverage under

the guideline; set out priority in sport; to detail procedures to be

followed by the national federations/associations to avail financial

assistance   sponsorship   and   all   other   assistance   which   the

Government advances; to state clearly the conditions for eligibility

which the Government would insist upon for recognition of the sports


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_112">                                 112</span>
 federations/associations as well as those which it would insist upon

for releasing grants to sports federations/associations.   The sports

authorities and bodies which are involved include the Sports

Authority of India; Indian Olympic Association etc.

</p><p id="p_306">211. It is well settled that a judgment or a judicial precedent is law

for the facts in which it was rendered.      In the instant case, the

petitioner is not asserting entitlement to any individual rights in his

favour. Detailed submissions have been made on acts and omissions

of the respondent no. 2 and complaints have been made by the

petitioner that there is violation of the guidelines dated 14th August,

2001. The petitioner has made a prayer for initiation of necessary

action in accordance with the guidelines for withdrawal of the

recognition conferred on the respondent no. 2 as a national level

sports federation as well as a prayer for withdrawal of the financial

assistance rendered by the Central Government.

</p><p id="p_307">212.   Malfunctioning on the part of a recognised national level

sports federation or association causes irreparable damage to the

progress of the sport in the country. There can be no comparison of

the private interest of an individual teacher seeking the benefit of a

particular level of salary or entitlement to a notice provided under

administrative instructions against his employer against the damage

which would result to the sport of hockey and national interest.

Effective and efficient working of the national sports federation

impacts the status, standing and reputation of the entire nation in

the arena of sports.

</p><p id="p_309"> 213. Mr. Pradeep Dewan, learned counsel appearing for the Indian

Olympic Association has placed reliance on the pronouncement of

the Apex Court reported at <a href="/doc/98822/" id="a_215">MANU/SC/1070/2003 UOI &amp; Ors. vs.

C. Krishna Reddy</a> wherein the respondent had sought issuance of a

writ of mandamus to the petitioners to release an amount by way of a

reward for having given information to concerned officers of the

Department of Customs and Central Excise leading to certain

recoveries.   The respondent was placing reliance on certain

guidelines issued by the Government of India on 30th March, 1985

regarding the policy, procedure and orders in respect of the grant of

rewards to informers and government servants in case of seizure

made and evasion of tax duty detected under the provisions of the

<a href="/doc/1059693/" id="a_216">Customs Act</a>; Central Excise and <a href="/doc/53524/" id="a_217">Salt Act</a>, 1962; Gold Control Act

and <a href="/doc/27905/" id="a_218">Foreign Exchange Regulation Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_310">     It is noteworthy that the guidelines clearly stated that the

reward was purely an ex gratia payment. This being so, it was held

by the court that no right accrued to the same till it is determined

and awarded. In writ jurisdiction the high court cannot examine or

weigh the various factors which are required to be taken into

consideration while deciding a claim regarding grant of the reward

which are matters exclusively within the domain of the authorities of

the department which alone can weigh and examine the usefulness

or otherwise of the information given by the informer.        In this

background, reward cannot be claimed as a matter of right.

</p><p id="p_311">     No such issue arises in the instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_312"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">                                 114</span>
</p><p id="p_313"> 214. Before this court, it is an admitted position that the Indian

Hockey Federation derives substantial financial assistance from the

Government of India. The Indian Hockey Federation stands formally

recognised as a national sports federation also by the Government of

India. The respondent no. 2 effectively controls the functioning of its

members.
</p>
<p id="p_314">215. The guidelines framed by the Government enable the National

Sports Federations recognised thereunder to derive substantial

financial assistance and other facilities from the Government. Apart

from purchase of valuable equipment, this assistance includes

training/coaching    camps;    assistance    for    organisation    and

participation in national and international competitions and training

abroad; appointment, availability and expenditure on foreign coaches

for training of sports person, assistance of the Sports Authority of

India as well as facilities at the state owned sports set ups.       To

enable meaningful utilisation of its assistance, the Government has

framed guidelines for recognition of national sports federations.

</p><p id="p_315">216. As part of its initiative, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports

operates a number of independent schemes alongwith the Sports

Authority of India which are apart from the financial grants to the

national federations.   These schemes have a direct bearing on the

promotion and development of sports in the country and include (i)

Exchange of Physical Education Teachers etc(CEPs); (ii) Rural Sports

programme, (iii) National Championships for Women, (iv) Grants for

Creation of Sports infrastructure, (v) Grants to Universities and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">                                  115</span>
 Colleges, (vi) Assistance for synthetic surfaces and (vii) Scholarships

for training abroad.     The Government has recognised that the

National Sports Federations are primarily responsible for judicious

selection of sports persons for participation in major international

events based on merit and with the objective of enhancing national

prestige and bringing glory to the world.       Such federation is also

required to be concerned with the development and encouragement

of the sport in the country.
</p>
<p id="p_316">217. The Apex Court has not prohibited the High Court in exercise of

its jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_219">article 226</a> from issuing a mandamus requiring

the Government from ensuring compliance with the guidelines or

conditions which it has fixed for grant of recognition and affiliation.

</p><p id="p_317">     The absolute prohibition urged by the respondents to the

maintainability of the writ petition seeking directions on a complaint

of breach of statutory guidelines certainly is not legally tenable is

hereby rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_318">218. The Government of India is dispensing not only financial

assistance but also providing other facilities in terms of the

guidelines;   has   recognised   national   level   federations;   framed

priorities in sports and has effected dispensation of state largesse

based thereon.
</p>
<p id="p_319">219. In view of the principles laid down by the Apex Court in the

aforenoticed judicial pronouncements, there can be no dispute that

the Government is entitled to frame the guidelines for dispensation

of its largesse which will take the nature of financial assistance;


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_116">                                   116</span>
 assistance in the nature of expert coaches, national level facilities

etc.   Certainly, the Government is entitled to notify and evolve a

procedure for dispensation of the financing assistance which runs

into crores of rupees as well as guidelines for recognition of the

national sports federation and cannot permit the same to be

disbursed arbitrarily without any clear directives in this behalf. The

guidelines issued by the Government and modified from time to time

have been therefore validly issued and are binding for the purpose

for which they have been issued.
</p>
<p id="p_320">       In view of the above discussion, it has to be held that a National

Sports Federation regulating the game of hockey in the country can

be compelled by the Government in discharge of its executive powers

and functions to abide by the rule of law as well as executive

guidelines framed for such recognition and dispensation.

No writ of mandamus can be issued to the Government to

legislate

counsels for the respondents that no mandamus can be issued to the

Government to legislate.
</p>
<p id="p_322">221. <a href="/doc/1707158/" id="a_222">In Common Cause vs. UOI</a> (supra) the Apex Court was

concerned with an amendment to the <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_223">Delhi Rent Control Act</a>. The



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_117">                                   117</span>
 petitioner's contention was that the amendment bill having received

the Presidential assent under <a href="/doc/158646/" id="a_224">Article 111</a>, stood lawfully enacted and

stood converted into an Act.     It was further urged that the same

having been placed on the statute book by a public notification in

terms of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_225">Section 366</a> (19), the Act was out of the legislative area. It

was argued that since the Parliament had not permitted appointment

of different dates for different provisions of the Act, <a href="/doc/1006024/" id="a_226">Section 5</a> of the

General Clauses Act was attracted and the Act came into force as

soon as the the President gave his assent to the bill.

</p><p id="p_323">     The court held that it could not be said that the Government

was not alive to the problem or was desirous of ignoring the will of

the Parliament. The legislature itself had invested the power in the

Central Government to notify the date from which the Act would

come into force and the Central Government is entitled to take into

consideration various facts while considering whether the Act should

be brought into force or not. Keeping in view these facts, it was held

that no mandamus could be issued to the Central Government to

issue the notification contemplated under <a href="/doc/233246/" id="a_227">section 1(3)</a> of the Act to

bring the Act into force.
</p>
<p id="p_324">222. In (2004) 11 SCC 360 Re Networking of Rivers, the court

was concerned with the project for linking of rivers. Certain aspects

of the matter required consideration by the Government and an

examination as to whether any further pieces of legislation were

necessary to bring about the interlinking. In this context, the court

had observed that it was not open to it to issue any direction to the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_118">                                  118</span>
 Parliament to legislate.
</p>
<p id="p_325">223. Similarly, in the pronouncement reported at 1992 Supp.(1)

SCC 548 <a href="/doc/1086398/" id="a_228">State of J &amp; K vs. A.R. Zakki &amp; Ors</a>., the court had

observed that a writ of mandamus could not be issued to the

legislature to enact a particular legislation.

</p><p id="p_326">224. There certainly cannot be any dispute with this well settled

principle of law. However, in the instant case, no prayer is made for

issuance of a mandamus to the government to legislate. No question

is raised or prayer made by the petitioner that the legislature be

called upon to make a law on any subject.          A simple case for

enforcement of and a grievance with regard to violation of non-

statutory guidelines, which regulate dispensation of state largesse, is

urged. This objection in the present case is wholly misplaced.

</p><p id="p_327">225. It has been argued by Mr. V.P. Singh, learned senior counsel

that the role of the Government is confined to grant of recognition

which is in the nature of a contract. This submission fails to take

into consideration the impact of the recognition and the tremendous

power which is created in an organisation which is recognised as a

National Sports Federation.
</p>
<p id="p_328">     Even otherwise, it is well settled that a writ would issue even in

matters relating to contract.
</p>
<p id="p_329">Restriction in clause 3.5 of the guidelines restricting the term

of the office bearer to a maximum of two years of four years

 the guidelines are valid, enforceable, legal and binding, the

stipulation in clause 3.5 restricting the tenure of the office bearers to

two terms of four years each impacts the constitutional rights of the

citizens guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_229">article 19</a> of the Constitution of India and

is therefore unconstitutional and unenforceable.

</p><p id="p_331">227. In support of the objection, the respondents have relied on the

AIR 1976 AP 340 (para 26 &amp; 34) a similar prohibition statutorily

contained in <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_232">Section 21C</a> in the Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area)

Cooperative Societies Act (7 of 1961) which stipulated that a person

who holds or has held office as a member of the committee of the

society for two consecutive terms shall not be eligible for being

chosen as a member of the committee for a third term in

continuation.    This statutory provision was challenged by the

petitioner inter alia on the ground that the bar to holding office as a

member of the committee for a third time in succession is ultravires

<a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_233">article 19(1)(c)</a> of the Constitution of India. It was observed by the

court that the statement of objects and reasons for the introduction

of the Bill furnished the court with reliable extrinsic evidence as

regards the purpose or object or reason for an Act. The state had

been utilising the device and framework of cooperative societies for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_120">                                   120</span>
 ushering in some of the welfare functions.              Even without the

assistance of 'objects and reasons', it could be said that the function

of the legislature in this mandatory legislative underlying <a href="/doc/161462810/" id="a_234">section

21(c)</a> of the Act is only to curb the growth of vested interest in

cooperative societies.       The Andhra Pradesh High Court has with

utmost clarity placed the distinction between, 'whether there is

fundamental right to form an association/society'; 'whether there is a

fundamental right to get the society registered and 'whether there is

a   fundamental      right    to   be     a   member   of   the   Executive

Committee/Governing Body.'          Challenge was laid to a statutory

restriction on the tenure in the executive body.

</p><p id="p_333">     Just as the present case, there was no prohibition on the

membership of the association. The grounds of challenge were the

same as those laid before this court. It would be useful to consider

the observations and findings of the court in extenso which reads

thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_109">          "26. Apart from the Committee being a committee of
          the co-operative society registered under the Act, we do
          not think the restriction in question imposed on
          becoming a member of the Committee for more than
          two consecutive terms violates the fundamental right to
          form Association guaranteed under <a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_235">Article 19 (1) (c)</a> of
          the Constitution. It is not the case of the petitioners
          that they are restricted from forming a co-operative
          society under the Act, or there was any compulsion on
          them to form a society under the Act or to become
          members of a society registered under the Act. Simply
          for the reason that some restrictions are imposed in
          connection with the working of the Society, that does
          not amount to curtailing the freedom of forming a
          society unless the restriction goes to the very root of
          the matter, which amounts to taking away the freedom
          to form an Association. In the present case the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_121">                                        121</span>
 restriction is only to become a member of the
Committee for a consecutive third term. That means
one cannot become a member of the Committee for
more than two terms continuously. There is no
restriction on becoming member of the Committee once
again there after for two more terms. With an interval
of one term in between one can become a member of
the Committee consecutively for two terms any number
of times. This restriction the Legislature in their
wisdom thought to be necessary in order to prevent
vested rights being established in the Societies which is
not very healthy for proper working of the Societies.
</blockquote><p id="p_334">Therefore, this is not a matter which touches the very
right to form a society. We are unable to agree with the
argument of Sri P.A. Chowdary that if such restriction
is imposed that would be abridging or taking away the
right to form a society or an Association. In this
connection Sri Chowdary placed strong reliance on two
decisions of the Supreme Court. <a href="/doc/1214330/" id="a_236">Smt. Damyanti
Naranga v. Union of India</a> AIR 1971 SC 966 and
<a href="/doc/1681994/" id="a_237">O.K.Ghosh v. E.X. Joseph</a> AIR 1963 SC 812. In the first
decision referred to above, the validity of the Hindi
Sahiya Samelan Act (1962) was in question. Under
<a href="/doc/343062/" id="a_238">Section 4</a> (4) of the Act apart from persons who are
members of the Society, some more members have
been added without any option being available to the
existing members of the Society to elect or refuse to
elect them as members which was the right they
possessed under construction of the Society itself. The
Supreme Court said that the Act does not merely
regulate the administration of the affairs of the society;
what it does is to alter the composition of the Society
itself. The result of this change in the composition is
that the members, who voluntarily formed the
Association, are now compelled to act in that
Association with other members who have been
imposed as members by the Act and in whose
admission to membership they had no say. Such
alternation in the composition of the Association itself
clearly interferes with the right to continue to function
as members of the Association which was voluntarily
formed by the original founders. The right to form an
Association implies that the persons forming the
Association have also the right to continue to be
associated with only those whom they voluntarily admit
in the Association. Any law, by which members are
introduced in the voluntary Association without any
option being given to the members to keep them out, or
any law which takes away the membership of those who


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_122">                          122</span>
 have voluntarily joined it, will be a law violating the
right to form an Association. Therefore, the Supreme
Court said on the fact of that case, that the provision of
law by which committee members have been added to
the Society without any opinion being available to the
existing members of the Society to elect or refuse to
elect them as members is violative of <a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_239">Art. 19 (1) (c)</a> of
the Constitution. Thus, the facts of that case are clearly
distinguishable from the facts before us. In the present
case, the only restriction imposed under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_240">Section 21-C</a>
of the Act is to be a member of the Committee
continuously for a third term. This is not a provision
which restricts the right to continue the Association
with its composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the
persons forming the Association. In this case, the
Supreme Court referred to their earlier case, which is
the second case mentioned above.
</p><p id="p_335">Xxx xxxx
</p><p id="p_336">34. Therefore, so long as there is no impediment to
form an Association or to become a member or having
become a member to continue or not as a member of
Association, no provision of law can be said to infringe
the fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_241">Article 19 (1)</a>
</p><p id="p_337">(c) of the Constitution merely because such a provision
seeks to regulate the functioning and administration of
the Association in the day to day working and in the
process imposes some restrictions, more so when they
are conceived in the best interests of the Association. It
is only in cases where a provision of law actually
amounts to curtailing the right to form an association in
the sense mentioned above, that can be said to be
violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under
<a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_242">Article 19 (1) (c)</a> of the Constitution. As we have
already discussed above, the restriction imposed under
<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_243">Section 21-C</a> on any person from becoming a member
of the Committee of the Society for more than two
consecutive terms cannot be said to amount to
curtailing the right or freedom of a person to form an
Association. As mentioned above, the Legislature in
their wisdom thought that such a restriction is
necessary in order to prevent any person from
acquiring any vested interest in the Society, which is
not a healthy sign for proper and efficient working of
the society in the best interests of all its members.
Therefore, <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_244">Section 21-C</a> of the Act is not violative of the
fundamental right guaranteed under <a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_245">Article 19 (1) (c)</a>
of the Constitution not only for the reason that the right
to form a Co-operative Society under a <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_246">Co-operative
Societies Act</a> is not a fundamental right and it is only a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_123">                          123</span>
        right given under the Act subject to its provisions and
       the Rules framed thereunder, but also on the ground
       that the restriction like the one imposed under <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_247">Section
       21-C</a> prohibiting a person from becoming a member of
       a Managing Committee of a Society consecutively for
       more than two terms cannot be said to be the one
       which either in reality or in substance amounts to
       restricting the right to form an Association guaranteed
       under it."

Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act (24 of 1961) and a challenge

to its vires was laid on the ground inter alia that it violated <a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_249">article

statutorily contained in <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_251">section 73A</a> of the Act was concerned, the

Bombay High Court held as follows:-

       such officer is not eligible to be re-elected or re-
       appointed for a period of three years after the expiry of
       the period of six years. Such a provision could have
       been made in the byelaws of the society at the time of
       registration. Such provision could have been made in
       the byelaws of the society at the time of registration.
       Such a provision could also be made in the byelaws at
       the instance of the Registrar at any time during the

</p><p id="p_342">17. As far as the impugned provision of sub-section (5)
of <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_254">Section 73-A</a> of the Act is concerned, it is not a
provision which restricts the right to continue the
association or composition that is voluntarily agreed
upon by the persons forming an Association. All that it
restricts is the continuance in office of the designated
officer if he has been continuously in the office for a
period of six years and the bar continues to apply only
for a period of three years and thereafter he is free to be
elected as one of the designated officers as per the bye
laws of the society. In our opinion, Damayanti's case AIR
1971 SC 966 is clearly distinguishable in that the
incorporation of the Sammelan under the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_255">Central Act</a>
was the result of legislative compulsion and did not
depend upon making voluntary application by the
existing members of Corporation as in the case of a
society registered under the Act on an application for
that purpose made voluntarily by its members,. As we
have noticed from the provisions of the Act above, the
members of the society are under no compulsion to
make an application for registration of the society under
the Act, but by making an application for registration
under the Act, they voluntary application by the existing
members of Corporation as in the case of a society
registered under the Act on an application for that
purpose made voluntarily by its members. As we have
noticed from the provisions of the Act above, the
members of the society are under no compulsion to
make an application for registration on the society
under the Act, but by making an application for
registration under the Act, they voluntarily submit to
the acceptance of the provisions of the Act, as binding
on them. In other words, by voluntarily agreeing to be a
society registered under the Act, they also voluntarily
agree to the <a href="/doc/322632/" id="a_256">Provisions of the Act</a> including the
provisions such as the framing of bye laws consistent
with the object of the provisions such as the framing of
bye laws consistent with the object of the provisions of
the Act and even agreeing to bye laws that may be

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                           125</span>
 directed to be made by the Registrar. It is under the bye
laws that the designated officer continues to remain in
the office for a particular period. The period could be
restricted even at the instance of the Registrar by
amending the bye laws as a result of the statutory
provision like sub-section (5) of Sec. 73-A . we do not
see how the provisions of this nature, in any manner,
impinge upon the right of the members to form an
association guaranteed under <a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_257">Article 19(1)(c)</a> of the
constitution. In our opinion, it is equally difficult to
appreciate the argument that a provision of this nature
takes away the rights of the members to continue the
association with its composition as voluntarily agreed
upon by them when there is no obligation or compulsion
to get the society registered. Provision can be said to be
one regulating the affairs of the society without in any
manner encroaching upon the right to continue the
association with its composition agreed upon by them.
</p><p id="p_343">      xxx xxx
</p><p id="p_344">21. Having regard to the above discussion, we are of the
view that the contention that sub-section (5) of<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_258"> S. 73-A</a>
encroaches upon the rights guaranteed under <a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_259">Article
19(1)(c)</a> is without any merit and in this view of the
matter, it would not be necessary to justify the provision
in clause (4) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_260">Article 19</a> of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_345">22. Even assuming that the impugned provisions can be
said to encroach upon <a href="/doc/445304/" id="a_261">Art. 19(1)(c</a>), we are also of the
opinion that the provision can be justified under clause
(4) of <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_262">Art. 19</a> as it imposes reasonable restriction in the
interest of morality. While, dealing with this aspect, it
would be useful to refer to passages from different
books relating to principles of co-operation extracted in
Brinjgoapal Denga v. State of M. P. AIR 1979 Madh Pra.
173, where the provisions of S. 19-c(2) of the Madhya
Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act conferring power on
the Registrar " to expel a member when it is necessary
or desirable in the interests of the society" were
challenged as being violative of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_263">Art. 19(1) .</a> It was held
by the court having regard to the scheme of the Act and
the fact that there is no compulsion to apply for
registration of the society under the Act, there is no
question of affecting the right under Art. . The Court
also held that the provision was also justified under <a href="/doc/1801956/" id="a_264">Art.
19(4)</a> as it imposes reasonable restriction in the interest
of society. The passage from the judgment runs thus
(para 8)
"The basic principle of cooperation is that the members


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_126">                          126</span>
 join as human persons and not as capitalists.
</p><p id="p_346">Cooperation is a form of organisation wherein persons
associate together as human beings on the basis of
equality for the promotion of the economic interest of
themselves. Cooperation is a method of doing business
with an ethical base. "Each for all, and all for each" is
the motto of cooperation. Cooperation not only develops
the latent business capacity of its members; it produces
leaders; it encourages the growth of social virtues;
honesty and loyalty become imperative; the prospect of
a better life obtainable by concerted effort is opened up;
the individual realises that there is something more to
be sought than mere material gain for himself.
</p><p id="p_347">Cooperation being a business - cum-moral movement ,
the success of the enterprise depends upon the reality
with which each one of the members works for the
achievement of the object of the organisation; (See law
and principles of cooperation by H. Calvart, pp. 18, 19,
22, and 45). The committee on cooperation in India
emphasised the moral aspect of cooperation. To quote
their words; "the theory of cooperative is very briefly
that an isolated and power less individual can by
association with others and by moral development and
mutual support, obtain in his own degree the material
advantages available to wealthy or powerful persons
and thereby develop himself to the fullest extent of his
natural abilities. By the union of forces, material
advancement is secured and by united action self-
reliance is fostered and it is from the inter-action of
these influences that it is a hoped to attain the effective
realisation of the higher and more prosperous standard
of life which has been characterised as better business,
better farming and better living; we have found that
there is a tendency not only among the out side public
but also among supporters of the movement to be little
its moral aspect and to regard this as superfluous
idealism. Cooperation in actual practice must often fall
far short of the standards aimed at and details
inconsistent with cooperative ideals have often to be re-
accepeted in the hope that they may lead to better
things. We wish clearly to express our opinion that it is
to true cooperation alone, that is, to a co-operation
which recognises the moral aspect of the question that
Government must look for the amelioration of the
masses and not to a psudo-cooperative edifice, however,
imposing, which is built in ignorance of cooperative
principles. The movement is essentially a moral one and
it is individualistic rather that socialistic. It provides as
a substitute for material assets" honesty and a sense of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_127">                            127</span>
        moral obligation and keeps in view the moral than the

       practice of Cooperation in India and Abroad by Kulkarni,
       vol. 1) Cooperation as a mode of doing business. Is at
       present applied as the solution of many economic
       problems. Cooperation is harnessed to almost all forms
       of economic activity. Though cooperation was
       introduced in this country as as remedy for rural
       indebtedness, it has been applied successfully in wide
       range of activities such as production, distribution,
       banking , supply marketing, housing and insurance:

<p id="p_349">230. <a href="/doc/1508089/" id="a_265">In Bijoe Emmanuel vs. State of Kerala</a> (supra) relied upon

by the respondents, the court had held that in order to regulate or

curtail fundamental rights guaranteed by the sub-clauses of <a href="/doc/1142233/" id="a_266">Article

19 (1</a>), the state has to make a law imposing reasonable restrictions

in the circumstances provided in the constitutional provision.

</p><p id="p_350">     There can be no dispute with the legal principles laid down.

</p><p id="p_351">231. So far as the pronouncement reported at Amreli Distt. Coop.

Sale &amp; Purchase Union Ltd., Amreli (supra) also placed by the

respondents is concerned, the same also deals with a statutory

prohibition in the tenure of an office bearer. With due respect to the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_128">                                 128</span>
 principles laid down in this judgment, I find that the submission that

registration of an association as a society is not mandatory but

purely a voluntary act was not placed before the court and therefore

not considered in the pronouncements. Furthermore, the court was

not concerned with a guideline framed by the Government for

regulating dispensation of its state largesse and recognition.    This

judgment would therefore have no application to the instant case.

</p><p id="p_352">232. Yet another aspect to this issue requires to be considered.

There is no statutory compulsion for registration of a society to carry

on the activities for which it is constituted. This would be evident

from the enabling provision which is to be found in the Societies'

Registration enactment of 1960 as well as the state enactments

which use the expression 'may' register. Registration of course can

be obtained only on the basis that the society was willing to abide by

the bye-laws of the society which are required to be approved by the

designated authority under the concerned statute in accordance with

the prescriptions therein and the rules framed thereunder.

</p><p id="p_353">233. The submission made by learned senior counsels for the

respondents requires to be examined from yet another angle. It is

noteworthy that in para 18 of the pronouncement in <a href="/doc/165174887/" id="a_267">Manohar vs.

State of Maharashtra</a> (supra), the court noticed that it was a

uniform pattern in cooperative law all over the country to restrict

tenure of certain officers and provision similar to those contained in

<a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_268">Section 73A</a> were made in all relevant state enactments pertaining to

cooperative societies in other parts of the country.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_129">                                  129</span>
</p><p id="p_354"> 234. So far as the <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_269">Delhi Cooperative Societies Act</a>, 1970 was

concerned, a similar disqualification clause based on tenures was

provided by way of <a href="/doc/86680883/" id="a_270">section 31(5)</a>.           The tenure restriction in the

<a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_271">Punjab Cooperative Societies Act</a> was found to be quite analogous to

the one contained in section 73A of the Bombay statute. The court

observed that the decision of the Division Bench of the Bombay High

Court at Nagpur in W.P.(C) No. 1418/1981 (reported at 1983

Maharashtra L.J. 719) showed that an All India conference of the

Chief Ministers and all State Ministers for cooperation was held at

Madras on 18th June, 1968. An important measure suggested by the

said conference with regard to curbing of vested interest in

cooperative societies included a restriction on holding offices in the

cooperative societies for more than the prescribed number of terms

inter alia and that in keeping with the national policy of removing

vested interest from cooperative institutions for attaining the object

of the cooperative movement which is to work as an institution for

uplifting of weaker and poorer sections of the society and with a view

to   make   the   cooperative     societies       broad   based     democratic

institutions rather than allow them to be monopolised by few persons

and for the purposes of orderly development of the cooperative

movement and further in accordance with the relevant directive

principles of state policy enumerated in the Constitution of India, the

tenure restriction provision in <a href="/doc/108006076/" id="a_272">section 73A</a> was inserted by statutory

amendment.
</p>
<p id="p_355">235. In   the   instant   case,   this    court    is   concerned    with   the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_130">                                    130</span>
 incorporation of a tenure clause as an eligibility condition for a body

seeking recognition and/or financial assistance from the Government

of India. The principles underlying restriction of the tenures of office

bearers in societies concerned with sports are similar to those on

which    other   cooperative    societies   are   registered.       The

pronouncements afore considered would apply on all fours to the

instant case.
</p>
<p id="p_356">236. I find that there is no prohibition to an unregistered association

or society of persons, either under the Constitution of India or under

any statute, to carry on its activities freely without any restriction.

There is no such restriction even under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_273">Societies Registration

Act</a>, 1860. The guidelines framed by the respondent no. 1 which are

the subject matter of the present consideration also do not restrict

formation of an association or society.
</p>
<p id="p_357">237. Though not placed before this court, but in view of the

submission that the respondent no. 2 is registered under the

Tamilnadu Societies Registration Act, 1975, I find that <a href="/doc/143764/" id="a_274">section 5</a> of

that statute, specifically mentions that any society which has for its

object, promotion of religion, athletics or sports may at its option

may be registered under this Act. There is therefore no binding that,

in order to carry out its object and activities a society has to be

compulsorily registered even under this enactment.

</p><p id="p_358">238. For this reason, the submission on behalf of the respondent that

the guidelines have the impact of supplanting or that they provide a

new condition concerning the working of the societies under the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_131">                                  131</span>
 <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_275">Societies Registration Act</a> is also wholly misconceived. There is no

requirement of complying with the guidelines for registration of the

sports federation or association or a society under the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_276">Societies

Registration Act</a> and it is open to get a society registered without

complying with the conditions of the guidelines and it would be open

to such a society to formulate its own bye-laws and rules without the

guidelines interdicting the same in any manner.

</p><p id="p_359">239. By the guidelines, the Government has not prohibited formation

of an association, society or federation with regard to any sport. It

has only mandated that in order to be entitled to financial assistance

or recognition as a national level body by the union government, it

would require to be a society or an association or federation which

enforces democracy by fixing the tenure of the office bearers. There

is no comparison between the election as an office bearer of a

national level sports body with the member of the parliament who

represents his constituency in the parliament.       For the foregoing

reasons, the conditions and criteria for recognition and grant of

assistance is neither arbitrary nor whimsical.

</p><p id="p_360">240. It is noteworthy that the national level federations enjoy a

monopoly position and are directly concerned with selection of teams

to represent the country. Though it should not, but there is every

possibility that vested regional biases and interests may influence

decision making especially in selection of teams. Thus office bearers

from a particular region, religion, political affiliation or having other

clout may be able to control selection and other matters relating to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_132">                                   132</span>
 the national sports federations influencing the development of the

sport in the country.
</p>
<p id="p_361">241. If such a tenure clause was not enforced, the office bearers

could be repeatedly elected from a particular region and continue to

dominate the affairs of the association/federation after having

created a monopoly over the sport. Tremendous damage could result

to the sport itself inasmuch as vesting of the control in authorities

from a particular region may result in diversion of funds, selection of

players from and development of a sport from only a particular

region.     The national sports federation would then not remain

representative of the hope and aspirations of the sports persons of

the entire nation.
</p>
<p id="p_362">242. A limited office tenure, certainly would have the impact of

minimising, if not eliminating, allegations, criticism and elements of

nepotism, favourtism and bias of any kind. In a country having the

federal structure of the nature that India possesses, the office

bearers being in circulation and there being change in the

representation on the executive of a national level body would go a

long way in promoting the diversity and expertise in the sport. There

must be states who have never been represented on the national

teams.     It would contribute to mainstreaming sport persons who are

marginalised on account of lack of regional representation at the

higher managerial echelons of the sports bodies or are otherwise not

visible.   Hundreds of sports persons without means, resources or

sources from every corner could hope for recognition of their skills


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_133">                                  133</span>
 and representation on regional and national teams.

</p><p id="p_363">243. Certainly the prescription by the Government of the office

bearers to two tenures which brings a length of the total office held

by them to 8 years as a condition for eligibility for recognition as a

national sports federation or for entitlement of financial assistance

from the Government, cannot by any measure be considered

insufficient for any office bearer to impart his best to the

organisation or the development of the sport or to make a difference.

Such a restriction would ensure new office bearers with fresh ideas,

enthusiasm and the wealth of their experience making a valuable

addition to the organisation.   It would also ensure circulation and

removal of such who are corrupt or undesirable in the organisation

who perhaps by virtue of exercise of political might or other

resources, are able to get repeatedly re-elected which would really

sounds a death knell for the sport and talented players.

</p><p id="p_364">     This is not to say that regional representation alone is the

benchmark for selection of a national team. Merit alone can guide

selection. However inability of a state to ever produce player(s) who

reach national trials or the national team would certainly reflect on

the failure of a national sports federation to develop the sport

nationally which is its prime mandate.
</p>
<p id="p_365">244. The petitioner has pointed out and has placed the constitution

of the respondent no. 2 as was prevailing between 1977 till the year

1992.   The constitution of the IHF incorporated a tenure clause

restricting the term of persons holding the positions of President,


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_134">                                 134</span>
 Honorary Secretary General and the Treasurar to a maximum of two

terms of four years each who could, therefore, hold these posts for a

maximum of eight continuous years only.
</p>
<p id="p_366">     There is no prohibition to standing for election again after the

break of one term.
</p>
<p id="p_367">245. The respondent no. 2 places reliance on amendments to the

Constitution carried out in the annual general meeting held on 8th

February, 2004 and have placed the amended Constitution on record

which is stated to be governing the functioning of the federation.

This constitution has amended the tenure clause to read that all the

office bearers shall be eligible for re-election for second and

subsequent terms of four years each on obtaining a simple majority

votes of the members present and voting in the election.

</p><p id="p_368">246. It is important to note that none of the respondents have till

date assailed any of the guidelines by way of an appropriate legal

proceedings or writ petition or otherwise. On the contrary they have

accepted their validity and acted thereupon. Both recognition, aid

and financial facilities have been sought thereunder, granted by the

Government and enjoyed by respondent nos. 2 to 4.          The current

stand that the same are beyond the executive power as the

Parliament does not have the legislative competence has been raised

only when a grievance is made by the petitioner that the respondent

no. 1 is not adhering to the rules.    In these circumstances, the

petitioner relies on the pronouncement of this court reported at

1996 (28) DRJ 358 (para 8, 11 and 12) <a href="/doc/363369/" id="a_277">Veterinary Council of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_135">                                 135</span>
 India vs. India Council of Agricultural Research</a> to urge that, as

a result, the respondent stands estopped from raising such a

challenge.
</p>
<p id="p_369">247. The petitioner has placed reliance on the pronouncements

reported at AIR 1988 SC 1247 (para 5) Asstt. <a href="/doc/90817/" id="a_278">Commissioner

Commercial Taxes vs. Dharmendra Trading Co</a>. in support of the

submission that the Union of India is estopped from contending that

its own guidelines are ultravires and without jurisdiction.

</p><p id="p_370">248. There is every reason why the office bearers of an organisation

would oppose a tenure clause.         Having been elected to an office

position, none likes to relinquish charge or demit a position. This is

manifested by the amendment to the constitution of respondent no. 2

in 2004 whereby the tenure restriction was removed.

</p><p id="p_371">249.   In the case in hand, clause 3.5 in the guidelines does not

impact any right or prohibit any person from becoming a member of

the society. On the contrary it has the impact of ensuring diversity

in the managerial affairs of the association. This is also in keeping

with the spirit, intendment and purpose of the statute under which

the respondent no. 2 is registered.
</p>
<p id="p_372">250. The Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the

Bombay High Court have squarely rejected similar contentions and

challenges to statutory provision.      The reasoning in these judicial

pronouncements throws valuable light on the challenge to the

executive guideline before this court on identical grounds.

</p><p id="p_373">251. Before this court, a submission was also made that the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_136">                                  136</span>
 international Olympic Charter prohibited any intervention by the

Government in the affairs of a society. Firstly, I see no interference

by the stipulation of the tenure condition as a condition for grant of

recognition and assistance by the Government. Secondly, the same

does not enable the Government to have any say of any kind in the

affairs of running of the sports body.       Thirdly, I find that the

respondent no. 2 has placed an extract of the rules and regulations

of various international bodies including the ICC; Federation

Internationale de Football Association and the International Olympic

Committee. It is disclosed that the International Olympic Committee

is the supreme authority of the Olympic movement.          Its executive

board was founded in 1921 and consists of the president, four vice

presidents and     ten other members.        All the members of the

executive board are elected for a four year term by the session in a

secret ballot by a majority of votes cast.
</p>
<p id="p_374">252. Perusal of the document placed before this court shows that a

tenure prohibition is to be found even in the rules governing the

duration of some of the office members of the International Olympic

Committee. It is prescribed in rule 19.2.2 that the duration of the

terms of office of the Vice-Presidents and of the ten other members

of the IOC Executive Board is four years. A member may serve for a

maximum of two successive terms on the IOC Executive Board,

regardless of the capacity in which he has been elected.

</p><p id="p_375">     In case of a member having completed two successive terms of

office pursuant to rule 19.2.2 above, he may be elected again as a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_137">                                   137</span>
 member of the International Olympic Committee executive board

after a minimum period of two years.
</p>
<p id="p_376">253. This   stipulation   in   the   international    Charter   shows   the

enforcement of democratic values and the reaffirmation of the

principle that the governing sports body has to be representative and

cannot be controlled by any particular person or set of persons and is

very similar to the stipulation contained in the tenure clause 3.5.

</p><p id="p_377">254. Therefore it has to be held that there is no legal prohibition to

the restriction of the tenure of an office bearer as a condition for

grant of recognition or financial assistance by the authority or

person awarding or dispensing the same. Such condition does not

adversely impact any fundamental right guaranteed under the

Constitution of India.    The objection to this effect raised by the

respondent has no legal basis and is opposed to the spirit,

intendment and the purpose of the <a href="/doc/1700055/" id="a_279">Societies Registration Act</a>; the

interests of national sports and hence, national as well as public

interest.
</p>
<p id="p_378">255. To dispel any impression of mal-functioning on the part of the

respondent no. 2, written submissions have been placed on record

stating that the respondent no. 2 has made tremendous efforts to

revive Indian hockey. It is stated in these submissions that the efforts

made by it under the current office bearers have borne fruit which

according to the respondent no. 2 are manifested from the following

<p id="p_387">
</p><p id="p_388">256. The tabulation placed by the respondent no. 2 before this court

unfortunately conceals the real position which is the abysmal fall

from the glory that Indian hockey has displayed. It fails to even state

that the Indian hockey team won a record six gold medals in a row at

six Olympics in the year 1928, 1932, 1936, 1948, 1952 and 1956

which example has not been replicated by any other country. It won

a silver medal in 1960 and a gold again in 1964 as well as 1980. The

Indian hockey team won the bronze medal at the 1968 and 1972



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_139">                                  139</span>
 Olympics.      So far as the World Cup was concerned, the Indian

hockey team won a bronze in 1971, a silver in 1973 and the gold at

the 1975 World Cup. These facts are general knowledge and known

to every sports enthusiast.
</p>
<p id="p_389">257. Absorption of the country with this game prior to its status till

the beginning of the 1980s, was perhaps as much, if not more, than

even cricket. The talent and skill of Indian hockey players of yore as

late Shri Dhyanchand are till date labelled as legendary and

internationally unmatched.     No country in the world can boast of

eight Olympic gold medals in a row. The prestige and standing of

Indian hockey in the past remains unparalleled.

</p><p id="p_390">258. Hockey is the National Game of India.        For the first time in

more than eighty years at the Beijing Olympics, the Indian Hockey

team could not even qualify to play the Olympics. Experience shows

that there is no dearth of sports talent in this great country.   In view

of the protracted hiatus certainly blame cannot be apportioned upon

the players.      There are most serious causes which remain totally

unexamined. As per the medal tally displayed by the respondent no.

2, the Indian team is now restricted to struggling for medals at the

regional level.
</p>
<p id="p_391">      Lesser teams have grown in stature while India languishes at

the bottom.
</p>
<p id="p_392">259. A very telling statement of Abhinav Bindra, the only Indian to

ever win an individual gold medal in 2009 Olympics, merits a

mention. A question was put to him as to whether India could hope


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_140">                                   140</span>
 to win medals not because of the systems but in spite of it.          His

answer to this question was reported by the Indian Express on the 4 th

January, 2009.        This so very talented Indian sport person

commenting on the Indian performance in the 2009 Olympics is

reported to have answered that "Some really talented athletes will

succeed but it will dry up if there is no vision. For a country of 1.25

billion people, three medals in an Olympics is pretty poor.       I was

happy to win the gold but I was also embarrassed that it took our

country so long to win one."
</p>
<p id="p_393">260. In this background, the allegations made by the petitioner in

the representations dated 10th January, 2005; 21st January, 2005 and

29th January, 2005 making allegations of grave mismanagement,

financial irregularities, lack of transparency, no system of approval

of annual accounts, indiscipline in the organisation, no distribution

or assignment of responsibility assume grave importance and require

to be addressed at the earliest. The petitioner has also pointed out

the objections raised by the auditor. The petitioner has stated that

he has raised issues and sought clarification even by his letter of 17th

February, 2005     which   remains un-addressed.        Allegations    of

fabrication of the minutes of the Annual General Meeting held on 30th

January, 2005 have been made which were objected by the

petitioner's letter dated 25th February, 2005. An allegation has been

made that the auditor for the respondent no. 2 was appointed in the

meeting on 8th February, 2004 till 2006. Without any authority, it is

alleged that the respondent no. 3 has appointed another auditor as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_141">                                  141</span>
 per the fabricated minutes dated 30th January, 2005.

</p><p id="p_394">      Apart from the irregularities pointed out by the petitioner, it

has also been urged that the auditor's report for the year 2003-04

had   also    pointed       out   glaring      financial   irregularities       and

mismanagement in the affairs of the respondent federation.

</p><p id="p_395">261. The     petitioner's    requests     to   the   respondent    no.      1   for

investigation into the complaints of breach of the guidelines dated

14th August, 2001 have fallen on deaf ears.
</p>
<p id="p_396">262. A very important aspect which may be the root cause for the

malaise which seems to have infested sports management in this

country deserves to be noticed at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_397">263. Despite the clear guidelines notified and circulated as back as

on 20th September, 1975, revised on two occasions first in 1997 and

then as circulated on 14th August, 2001, each of which contains the

office bearer tenure stipulation, the Government of India has filed an

affidavit before this court stating that while releasing assistance to

National Sports Federations, the stipulation contained in the

Government order dated 20th September, 1975 limiting the tenure of

office bearers to two terms of four years each is not being insisted

upon by the Government. This affidavit states that the same has not

been done 'in the interest of sports person'.
</p>
<p id="p_398">      What is the interest of the sports person is neither detailed nor

spelt out, either in the affidavit or in any document which has been

placed on record. There is not a single decision which is contrary to

the mandate and stipulation contained in the guidelines dated 20th

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_142">                                        142</span>
 September, 1975.
</p>
<p id="p_399">264. It is an admitted position that the guidelines were framed and

circulated in 1975, amended in 1997 and in 2001 with the approval

of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Expenditure.              State

revenue was involved.     It was incumbent on all those working the

guidelines to ensure that the guidelines were strictly complied with.

Certainly, there cannot be dispensation of state largesse which

include large amounts of funding and other technical assistance,

without   compliance    of   the   guidelines   laid   down   for   such

dispensation.
</p>
<p id="p_400">265. The consequence of such failure to abide by the guidelines is

that dispensation of state largesse admittedly running into several

crores of rupees has been effected in violation of the guidelines

framed by the Government of India for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_401">266. This matter assumes significance and importance in the light of

nature and extent of assistance rendered by the Central Government

in matters of sports relating to the various disciplines.

</p><p id="p_402">267. A submission was made by learned standing counsel for the

Union of India that the approval of the Finance Ministry was

confined to the provisions in the guidelines governing finance alone.

This view certainly undermines the importance and nature of the

approval of the Ministry of Finance and is also not borne out by the

communication dated 14th August, 2001 or the guidelines.             The

Ministry of Finance would be concerned certainly with not only the



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_143">                                   143</span>
 nature and manner of expenditure but also with the nature of the

body to whom the dispensation was being effected. It is required to

take a holistic view in the matter and is certainly expected to take

into its consideration all provisions in the guidelines.

</p><p id="p_403">268. The facts placed before this court and the representations of

the petitioner to the Central Government also display complete

disinterest with the fate of the sport persons or the glory of the

sport.   Complete autonomy and arbitrariness in the functioning of

NSFs is being permitted by the Government. Players and coaches

remain almost unrepresented on the sports body or in forums where

their voice and representation may ensure not only the interest of

the sports persons but also that the national interest and glory of the

sport is restored.
</p>
<p id="p_404">269. It takes a sportsman to understand the finest nuances of the

game; the psychology involved in mentally blocking out rowdy

spectators supporting a home team; the herculean effort entailed in

focussing   on the game against extreme provocations           of the

opponents. Only someone who has played or been involved in the

game can understand why some days are good, others not at all; the

positive support needed when "off form" and how insensitive

criticism can demolish the confidence of an able player.           The

essentiality of a good diet and rest regime, a clean environment and

adequate facilities can be also best ensured by those who have been

involved.   Sports persons also, understand the importance of 'rest'

and 'retirements'.
</p>
<p id="p_405">
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_144">                                   144</span>
</p><p id="p_406"> 270. The success of a sports board needs no further evidence than

the performance story of the team it endorses.       It is also not the

credentials or laurels of those who constitute the Board on which its

capability is to be evaluated but again the success of the game,

nationally and internationally. Such success may not be evaluated by

medals won but can equally be measured by the spread of the game

in the country, availability of modern facilities in its remote corners,

creation of a body of fit and able coaches and players and, of course,

the increase in popularity of the game amongst the masses.

</p><p id="p_407">271. Alongwith the counter affidavit of respondent no. 4 in support

of the credentials of the respondent no. 3, his CV has been placed on

record. The respondent no. 3 has declared his field of specialisation

as the maintenance of law and order and is a renowned officer of the

Indian police service.     Undoubtedly, there can be no doubt with

regard to his ability as an expert on law and order issues specially

relating to terrorism. He has several publications in these areas to

his credit for his services so rendered.    The respondent no. 3 has

been repeatedly decorated with police medals in 1989 and stands

awarded the Padamshri in 1989. The respondent no. 3 has stated

that he has received a large number honours from public and

voluntary organisations for restoring normalcy in Punjab after over a

decade of terrorism.     His areas of interest include English and Urdu

poetry and sports. It is stated that he holds the elected post of the

president of the Indian Hockey Federation, is the vice-president of

the Asian Hockey Federation; is the Chairman, Task Force, Indian


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_145">                                   145</span>
 Olympic Association and is a council member of the Federation

International DE Hockey. These positions in international bodies are

obviously on account of the office of President of the IHF which is

held by him since 1974.
</p>
<p id="p_408">272. Undoubtedly the respondent no. 3 would have brought the

discipline of the police to the Federation, which is one essential

component of the personality of a sport person. But certainly it is

not the only facet and experience has shown that there is much more

than just a stirling qualities of a highly decorated police officer which

would be required to restore the glory to India's national game

hockey for which India was known.
</p>
<p id="p_409">     Similar is the position of respondent no. 4.
</p>
<p id="p_410">273. The facts placed by the respondents and the curtain attempted

to be drawn over what Indian hockey was before this court is a

chilling certification of the negative performance or failure of a

board. The angst of those who labour and toil on the sports fields,

no acknowledgment of the talent of players, the complete lack of

visibility of the spread or encouragement of the sport in the country

and its fall in spectator popularity underline the malaise and no

management or board can refuse responsibility. The very fact that

this situation is persisting for not merely the last couple of years, but

after the 1980s, as manifested from the Olympic results, only

underlines the crying need for critical measures. But that can come

only if managerial bickering's were put on the back burner and

concerns of the sport permitted to come to the fore.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">                                   146</span>
</p><p id="p_411"> 274. The       parties   have      placed    the    details    of   the   boards   of

International      Olympic        Committee,       International    Rugby    Board,

Federation International de Football Association, Association of

Tennis Professionals, International Cricket Council, Hockey, Major

League Baseball, USA Basketball and list of sources before this

court.       Each one of them has celebrated sports personalities in

important positions. Today sports is no more something that can be

dealt with in a meeting over a five star meal. It requires technical

knowledge of both the game, the equipment and the training. Every

aspect from the aerodynamics in equipment, even of the clothes

worn by an athlete to shoes of a hockey/football/basket player; hair

cut of the swimmer to 'weight and material of the equipment used is

governed by scientific details and principles.                In times of expertise,

sports management experts are as important to a good sports

programme just as experienced competent players or ex-players in

decision and policy making areas who would ensure that the sports

persons got the same, if not better residential/hotel and other

facilities    as   the   office    bearers    at    national     and   international

competition venues; who understood how important good treatment

is for the self esteem and confidence of the teams and sports

persons, especially when their opponents get the best; where real

expenditure is incurred on and energy is devoted to sports persons

rather than on maintenance of the office bearers or squabbles over

elections.
</p>
<p id="p_412">      Only then could it be said that the sporting credentials or the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_147">                                        147</span>
 tenure of the controlling board is immaterial for the interest of the

sport.
</p>
<p id="p_413">275. In this background, the representations of the petitioner

deserved a serious examination by the respondent no. 1 and it is

imperative that the respondent no. 1 be directed to examine the

complaints made by the petitioner in accordance with the guidelines

governing recognition and dispensation of the largesse by the

respondent no. 1 out of the public exchequer and facilities developed

by it.   Undoubtedly, the action as per the guidelines has to follow

such investigation.
</p>
<p id="p_414">276. An argument was raised by learned senior counsels appearing

for respondent nos. 2 to 4 that permitting Government control into

the affairs of the Indian Hockey Federation, a dynamic body would

result in chaos which cannot be visualised and that the same would

impact the international sporting activities of the federation as well.

Such a submission was also made in respect of the BCCI and has

been considered and rejected by the Division Bench of this court in

114 (2004) DLT 323 Rahul Mehra vs. UOI &amp; BCCI in the

following terms :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_111">         "14. Dr Singhvi then contended that if it were held
         that BCCI was amenable to writ jurisdiction ''startling
         and legally untenable consequences would follow''.</blockquote><p id="p_415">
</p><p id="p_416">         For example, it may be conceivable to hold that the
         selection of a cricket team is discriminatory for
         arbitrary. There are several answers, none startling
         and all legally tenable. Firstly, not every action of the
         BCCI would fall under the scope of judicial review
         under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_280">article 226.</a> It must not be forgotten that ''the
         High Court does not act like a proverbial ''bull in a
         china shop'' in the exercise of its jurisdiction under


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_148">                                   148</span>
 <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_281">Article 226''.</a> It will not interfere in matters which do
not have any element of public law. Secondly,
''catching the bull by its horns'', as it were, suppose
the selection procedure of the BCCI prescribed that
players from a particular region, or a state or
belonging to a particular community were not to be
selected for the Indian team. Would it be so
preposterous if the High Court stepped in under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_282">article 226</a> and quashed such a prescription? Let us
take another example. Suppose the Selection
Committee of the BCCI were to alter its rules and
select a team to represent India not on merit but on
the basis of bids. Meaning, the highest bidders got to
play for India. Would the High Court then be justified
in throwing out a petition of aspiring, meritorious but
poor players on the ground that a writ cannot be
issued to the BCCI because, as they contend, it has a
carte blanche to do as it pleases? We think not.
</p><p id="p_417">Thirdly, even in cases of judicial review, the High
Court exercises self-imposed restraints. It does not
substitute its views in place of those under review.
Although it has become a hackneyed clich, it bears
repetition that in exercise of powers under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_283">article
226</a>, the High Court is not so much concerned with
the decision itself in the sense as to whether an action
is ''right or wrong'', but with the decision making
process signifying as to whether the action is ''lawful
or unlawful''. So, if the selection of the team is
lawfully made, the Court would not be concerned with
the composition of the team.
</p><p id="p_418">16. Another fear of the BCCI must be allayed. It was
submitted and, with some anxiety, that if the court
were to hold that BCCI was within the scope of <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_284">Article
226</a> then the splendid institution that has been so
assiduously built-up would lose its independence and
would fall prey to Governmental intervention and
ultimately spell its doom. Without making any value
judgment on quality of Governmental intervention, we
may straight away say that amenability to judicial
review is in no way connected with Governmental
interference in the affairs of the BCCI which is a self-
regulated body and will continue to be one. The only
difference being, that its discharge of public duties and
public functions (as distinct from private duties and
functions) would be open to judicial review under
<a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_285">article 226</a> of the Constitution. This does not, ipso
facto, translate into governmental intervention in the
internal affairs of BCCI which would remain a private
body."
</p>
<p id="p_419"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_149">                           149</span>
</p><p id="p_420">      It could not be put better and unhesitatingly would apply to the

Indian Hockey Federation.
</p>
<p id="p_421">277. Other than the objection to the stipulation with regard to the

re-election and a tenure of the office bearers, the respondents have

no objection to any intervention by the Government in these

guidelines in its activities which includes selection of national

coaches, prescription of priority sports etc.

</p><p id="p_422">278. It is noteworthy that the revised guidelines have guided

dispensation of the largesse of the Government which partook the

nature of grants, financial assistance and other infrastructure and

logistic support to the National Sports Federations. Neither the

Indian Olympic Committee nor any of the Sports Federations

including the Indian Hockey Federations/respondent no. 2 herein

have ever assailed the action of the Government or any stipulation in

the guidelines. It would therefore be apparent that the respondents

have accepted the authority and competence of the government to

lay down conditions and guidelines for eligibility and the manner in

which recognition of a federation or an association as a national level

body as well as the manner in which dispensation of the funds and

state largesse would be effected.
</p>
<p id="p_423">279. In this regard, it would be useful to also refer to the

pronouncement of the Supreme Court in AIR 2005 SC 592 : JT

2005 1 SC 235 : 2005 5 SCC 741 : MANU/SC/0019/2005 Board

of Control for <a href="/doc/1662742/" id="a_286">Cricket, India &amp; Anr. vs. Netaji Cricket Club &amp;


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_150">                                    150</span>
 Ors</a>. wherein also an identical issue has been raised in respect of the

BCCI. It was held by the court that in view of the fact that the BCCI

as a member of the ICC, it also represents the country in

international   foras.   It   exercises   enormous   authority    and   is

responsible for selecting players, umpires and officials to represent

the country in the international fora. It exercises total control over

the players, umpires and other officers. The Rules of the Board

clearly demonstrate that without its recognition no competitive

cricket can be hosted either within or outside the country. Its control

over the sport of competitive cricket is deep pervasive and complete.

</p><p id="p_424">280. So far as the nature of powers of the sports Board is concerned

and the extent of judicial intervention in the functioning of the BCCI

is concerned, the following parameters were laid down by the

Supreme Court :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_112">       "81. In law, there cannot be any dispute that having
       regard to the enormity of power exercised by it, the
       Board is bound to follow the doctrine of 'fairness' and
       'good faith' in all its activities. Having regard to the
       fact that it has to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of
       millions, it has a duty to act reasonably. It cannot act
       arbitrarily, whimsically or capriciously. As the Board
       controls the profession of cricketers, its actions are
       required to be judged and viewed by higher
       standards.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_113">       82. An association or a club which has framed its
       rules are bound thereby. The strict implementation of
       such rules is imperative. Necessarily, the office
       bearers in terms of the Memorandum and Articles of
       Association must not only act within the four corners
       thereof but exercise their respective powers in an
       honest and fair manner, keeping in view the public
       good as also the welfare of the sport of cricket. It is,
       therefore, wholly undesirable that a body incharge of
       controlling the sport of cricket should involve in
       litigations completely losing sight of the objectives of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_151">                                   151</span>
           the society. It is furthermore unfortunate that a room
          for suspicion has been created that all its dealings are
          not fair. The Board has been accused of shady
          dealings and double standards."</blockquote><p id="p_425">


</p><p id="p_426">     These principles would guide consideration to the acts and

omissions on the part of the respondent no. 1 as well.

</p><p id="p_427">281. The petitioner has complained not only violation of the

guidelines framed by the respondent no. 1 but has made serious

allegations with regard to failing to maintain financial discipline by

the respondent nos. 2 to 4. The petitioner has prayed for quashing of

the elections of respondent nos. 3 and 4 as the President and

Honorary Secretary General of the respondent no. 2 as being

contrary to rules dated 14th August, 2001 and sought a prohibition

against the respondent nos. 3 and 4 from continuing as the President

and Honorary Secretary General of respondent no. 2 or from

contesting the elections to these posts for the fourth consecutive

term.

</p><p id="p_431">283. In para 10 of R.D. Shetty vs. IAAI (supra), the Apex Court has

reiterated the settled rule of administrative law that an executive

authority must be rigorously held to the standards by whichit

professes its actions to be judged and it must scrupulously observe

these standards on pain of invalidation of an act in violation of them.

</p><p id="p_432">284. With regard to a popular sport like cricket, the Apex Court has

that breach of even non-statutory guidelines which have been framed

</p><p id="p_434">286. The Government stand before this court in the affidavit dated

16th May, 2005 itself states what the Government is required to do if

its guidelines have breached.       The deposition on behalf of the

Government on this aspect reads thus :-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_114">        "(9) That the only action that the Government of
        India can take against these defaulting Natinal
        Sports Federations (NSFs) under the prevailing
        circumstances is to stop giving financial assistance it
        is providing to them as per the policy/guidelines.
        But the Government, in general, refrains from taking
        such a harsh action, as it would adversely affect the
        interest of an Indian sports person having a lot of
        potential to excel in their respective sport."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_435">287. Before this court, it is a stand of the respondent no. 1 that it has

not enforced the guidelines. I have held otherwise. It follows as a

result of the above discussion that breach or violation of the

guidelines by    the respondent nos. 2 to 4 would vest upon the

respondent no.2, the consequences provided in the guidelines which

include withdrawal of recognition as well as financial assistance.

</p><p id="p_436">288. The petitioner has made complaints to the respondent no. 1

setting out in detail allegations with regard to breaches by the

respondent nos. 2 to 4. Having regard to the principles laid down by

the Apex Court, so far as complaints of breach of the guidelines

notified by the Government are concerned, it is the respondent no. 1

which is legally competent and best placed to examine the same and

pass appropriate orders thereon.         It is trite the scope of judicial


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_154">                                   154</span>
 review by this court is restricted. Needless to say the appropriate

orders in this behalf would required to be made strictly in terms of

the guidelines dated 14th August, 2001. It is not open to any official

to waive compliance with any provision contained in the guidelines.

</p><p id="p_437">(i)    It is now necessary to examine the prayers made by the

petitioner.   Prayer (a) in the writ petition seeks a direction to the

respondent no. 1 to produce the record relating to grant of financial

assistance to the respondent no. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_438">       In the light of the above discussion, it is not necessary for this

court to call for such a record.
</p>
<p id="p_439">(ii)   So far as prayer (b) is concerned, the respondent no.1 is

directed to examine all complaints made by the petitioner with regad

to breach of the subject guidelines as well as the terms for grant of

financial and other assistance to the respondent no. 2 as well as

utilisation of the funds provided by the Government. It shall be open

for the respondent no. 1 to make such investigation and enquiry in

this behalf as is deemed necessary; to call for a response of the

respondent no. 2 and any clarifications from the petitioner in this

behalf.    The complaints shall be disposed of by speaking orders

within a period of eight weeks from today. The copy of the order(s)

which may be passed thereon be made available to the petitioner and

the respondent no. 2 who shall be at liberty if aggrieved thereby to

assail the same in accordance with law.

<p id="p_440">       In view of the above, so far as the merits of the allegations of

 financial impropriety and indiscipline relating to the assistance

dispensed by the respondent no. 1 to the respondent no. 2 as well as

allegations of mismanagement of the affairs of respondent no. 2

against the other respondents and breach of the guidelines dated

14th August, 2001 are concerned, it is made clear that nothing herein

contained is an adjudication on the merits of the allegations levelled

against the respondents by the petitioner.
</p>
<p id="p_441">(iii) So far as the prayer (c) is concerned, the respondents have

pointed out that the Constitution and bye-laws of the respondent no.

</p><p id="p_442">2      were   amended     in   2004     and   they      contained   no

prescription/prohibition of a tenure clause. The consequence of the

breach of the conditions in the guidelines dated 14th August, 2001 is

provided therein and would follow on a consideration of the

complaints made by the petitioner in terms of the directions

contained in para (ii) above. No further directions are required to be

given at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_443">(iv)   So far as the prayer (d) is concerned, no such prescription by

any constitutional or statutory provisions is stated.    It is also not

pointed out as to how clause 8 of the constitution of respondent no. 2

is ultravires or illegal. In view of the guidelines dated 14th August,

2001, if the respondent no. 2 seeks recognition and affiliation, it

would require to abide by clause 3.5 therein.           The violations

complained by the petitioner have been directed to be examined by

the respondent no. 1 and the consequences shall flow therefrom.

</p><p id="p_444"> (v)     The prayers made in clauses (e) and (g) relate directly to

elections to the executive body of the respondent no. 2 and failure of

the respondent nos. 2 to 4 to furnish information relating to the

affairs of the respondent no. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_445">        In view of discussion hereinabove, such a grievance is required

to be made and appropriate relief sought before the competent
