<p id="p_3">

1.2             The complaint was entrusted to Shri Rajesh Chahal, Inspector, CBI, 

ACB, Delhi (hereinafter referred  as "TLO") for verification and laying a trap. For 

the purpose of verification, presence of two independent witnesses namely Shri 

Piyush   Kumar   Gupta   (shadow   witness/PW11)   and   Shri   D.K.   Mittal   (recovery 

witness/PW10),   both   Managers   of   Vijaya   Bank,   Regional   Office,   Barakhamba

the presence of independent witnesses, the complainant, on the instruction of 

TLO, contacted A­1 from his mobile no.9968294590 on the mobile phone no.

9868225133 of A­1 and the conversation that took place was recorded with the 

help of a digital voice recorder (hereinafter referred as "DVR"). The conversation 

so recorded confirmed demand of illegal gratification of Rs.three lacs by A­1 from 

the   complainant.     A­1   directed   the   complainant   to   come   on   24/01/2007   at 

10.00AM in his office at Tolstoy Marg, New Delhi with the bribe amount of Rs. 

three lacs. The conversation so recorded was transferred from the DVR to an 

audio   cassette   after   ensuring   its   blankness,   with   the   help   of   audio   cassette 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                        3 </span>
 recorder. The audio cassette was marked as Q­1 and sealed with the seal of CBI. 

Before sealing Q­1, another copy of the conversation was also prepared for the 

purpose of investigation. Facsimile impressions of the CBI was obtained in ink 

and lack on separate sheets of paper and witnesses signed thereon. The CBI 

seal (after use) was handed over to Shri D.K. Mittal for custody and to bring the 

same   the   following   day   for   use   in   the   further   proceedings.   The   aforesaid 

proceeding of the verification was recorded in a "Pre Trap Verification Memo". It 

was decided to lay a trap on the accused A­1 on 24/01/2007.



1.3            On 24/01/2007, the complainant, shadow witness, recovery witness 

and trap team members reached at CBI/ACB office.  The complainant produced 

a sum of Rs.two lacs in the form of 200 GC notes of denomination of Rs.1000/­ 

each. Numbers of GC notes were noted in the handing over memo. A leather bag 

containing empty clean glass bottles, tumblers, sodium carbonate powder, CBI 

seal, sealing material was arranged.  Phenolphthalein powder was also arranged 

separately   from   the   CBI   Malkhana.   The   GC   notes   were   treated   with 

phenolphthalein powder and a practical demonstration was given regarding the 

reaction between phenolphthalein powder and the colourless solution of sodium 

carbonate. Independent witness Shri D.K. Mittal was asked to touch the tainted 

GC notes with his right hand fingers and wash them in the colourless solution of 

sodium carbonate. On doing so by him, the colourless solution turned pink in 

colour   and   this   pink   coloured   solution   was   thrown   away   after   explaining   the 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                       4 </span>
 significance of the reaction. The remaining phenolphthalein powder was returned 

back to the Malkhana. Personal search of complainant was taken by Inspector 

Raj Singh and he was not allowed to keep anything incriminating on his person 

except his mobile phone. The bribe amount of Rs.two lacs mentioned above duly 

treated with phenolphthalein powder was kept in the right side pant pocket of the 

complainant.   Complainant was directed to hand over the tainted bribe amount to 

the accused on his specific demand and not otherwise or on his specific direction 

to some other person. All the members washed their hands with soap and water 

to ensure that there was no traces of phenolphthalein powder on their hands. 

Independent witness Shri Piyush Kumar Gupta was asked to act as a "shadow 

witness"   and   to   remain   close   to   the   complainant   and   try   to   overhear   the 

conversation and to see the bribe transaction between complainant and accused. 

Shadow witness Shri Piyush Kumar Gupta and the complainant were directed to 

give signal of completion of transaction of bribe by scratching their head with their 

both hands.   Other witness Shri D.K. Mittal was asked to remain with the other 

members of the trap team. A Cenix make digital recorder (DVR) was arranged 

and it was ensured that it did not contain any prerecorded voice. Thereafter, the 

introductory voices of both the independent witnesses were recorded  in DVR in 

its   beginning.   It   was   decided   to   hand   over   the   DVR   to   the   complainant   after 

reaching at the spot with direction to switch it on before meeting the accused at 

the spot. All the members except complainant mutually searched each other to 

ensure that they do not carry any incriminating document/article except their ID 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                           5 </span>

brass   seal   to   the   spot.     The   aforesaid   proceeding   started   at   8.30AM   and 

completed at 9.30AM and was recorded in "handing over memo".



1.4             The trap team reached near Prakash Deep Building, Tolstoy Marg, 

Connaught Place, New Delhi at about 10.30AM. The complainant was directed to 

contact   A­1   on   his   mobile   phone   to   find   out   his   whereabouts.   Accordingly, 

complainant   contacted   A­1.   Thereafter,   complainant   disclosed   that   A­1   had 

directed him to come to his office at 7th Floor of Prakash Deep Building along with 

money.     Thereafter,   it   was   decided   that   as   a   matter   of   additional   precaution, 

shadow witness will either give a call or missed call on the mobile phone of  TLO 

as   soon   as   the   transaction   is   over.   Thereafter,   the   DVR   was   handed   over   to 

complainant with the direction to switch it on before proceeding to the office of 

A­1.  Then complainant and shadow witness were directed to proceed to office of 

accused   Samir   Kumar   Ghosh   (A­1).     Rest   of   the   team   members   including 

independent   witness   Shri   DK   Mittal   also   followed   them   and   took   suitable 

positions at the staircase leading to 6th and 7th floor of Prakash Deep Building.  



1.5             At about 11.20AM, TLO received a call from the complainant and 

immediately after the call, another call was received from shadow witness. Both 

the   calls   were   made   as   a   signal   of   the   completion   of   the   bribe   transaction 

between complainant and accused. Immediately on the receipt of the aforesaid 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                          6 </span>
 signal, the CBI team along with PW10 Shri D.K. Mittal rushed towards the office 

premises of MSTC at 7th floor and enquired about the whereabouts of A­1. It was 

learnt   that   A­1   was   sitting   in   the   chamber   of   Shri   Ashok   Kumar,   Regional 

Manager on the same floor.   Accordingly, CBI team along with the above said 

independent   witness   entered   the   said   chamber   of   Regional   Manager.   It   was 

found that the complainant and shadow witness were sitting on a three seater 

sofa and the other person who was later on identified as accused Samir Kumar 

Ghosh (A­1), Senior Manager was sitting on the other single seater sofa. A­1 was 

challenged for demanding bribe of Rs.three lacs and accepting Rs.two lacs as 

bribe from complainant for extending favour in the matter of processing of auction 

bids   of   the   complainant's   firm.   Sub   Inspector   Sandeep   Chaudhary   and   Sub 

Inspector Surajit Dass had caught hold right and left wrist respectively of A­1. 

Shri Ashok Kumar, Dy. GM/Regional Manager, MSTC Ltd. was out of station to 

Amritsar. In the meantime, Shri B.S. Saini, Sr. Manager (Domestic Trade), MSTC 

Ltd.  also   entered  in   the   chamber  of  the   Regional   Manager/DGM  and   he   was 

requested   to   remain   present     throughout   the   remaining   post   trap   proceeding, 

which   he   did.     DVR   was   taken   back   from   the   complainant   and   heard.   The 

conversation   which   took   place   between   A­1   and   complainant   confirmed   the 

demand and acceptance of bribe on the part of A­1 from the complainant. Copies 

of recorded conversation were made into two blank audio cassettes with the help 

of Sony compact cassette recorder. One of the said cassette was sealed with the 

seal of CBI (after taking the seal from witness Shri DK Mittal) and was marked as 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                      7 </span>
 Q­2. The second cassette was kept unsealed for the purpose of investigation. 



1.6             On enquiry, shadow witness Shri Piyush Kumar Gupta stated that 

when he along with complainant entered the office premises of MSTC at 7 th floor 

and reached in the cabin of A­1 in Hall, the complainant did Namaskar which was 

reciprocated by A­1, and on enquiry from A­1, the complainant introduced him 

(shadow witness) as his assistant Shri Ojha. Thereafter on the instructions of A­1, 

the   complainant   and   the   shadow   witness   followed   him   to   the   chamber   of 

Regional   Manager   and   all   the   three   took   seats   on   sofa   set   available   in   that 

chamber.  After  some   conversation   regarding   auction   of   metal  scraps   with   the 

complainant,   when   complainant   disclosed   that   he   could   not   arrange   the   full 

(demanded) amount of Rs.three lacs but he had arrange only Rs.two lacs, A­1 

asked the complainant to hand over the same. On this, the complainant took out 

the bribe amount of Rs.two lacs from his right side pant's pocket with his right 

hand and extended the same towards A­1, who accepted the same with his right 

hand and directly kept the same in his right side pocket of the pant worn by him. 

The version of shadow witness was also confirmed by complainant.  



1.7             A colourless solution of sodium carbonate and water was prepared 

in a clean glass tumbler and A­1 was directed to wash his right hand fingers in 

the same. On his doing so, the said colourless solution turned pink in colour. The 

said pink coloured solution was then transferred into a clean glass bottle, which

1.8              On   the   direction   of   TLO,   witness   Shri   DK   Mittal   recovered   the 

tainted bribe amount from the right side pocket of the pant worn by A­1 and with 

the   assistance   of   independent   witness   Shri   Piyush   Kumar   Gupta   tallied   the 

numbers of the recovered tainted GC notes with the numbers already recorded in 

the handing over memo.

solution was then transferred into a clean glass bottle, which was then tightly 

capped and marked as "RSPPW" denoting "Right Side Pant's Pocket Wash" of 

A­1. The bottle was sealed with the seal of CBI. The inner lining of the said pant's 

pocket of A­1 was signed by both the independent witnesses. A rough site plan of

<p id="p_5">

1.10             With   the   help   of   DVR,   the   specimen   voice   of   A­1   was 

taken/recorded   with   his   consent.   The   recorded   conversation   of   the   DVR   was 

transferred into a blank audio cassette. The said cassette was sealed with the

<p id="p_7">

1.12            After   completion   of   the   proceedings   as   set   out   in   the   recovery 

memo at about 5.30PM, A­1 was interrogated and he disclosed that one Retired 

Colonel   Shri   Rajeev   Kumar   Sharan   (A­2)   who   is   a   Coordinator   of   MSTC   for

the e­auction process of metal scrap including M/s Karishma Enterprises and to 

obtain illegal gratification from such firms whose bids were under STA category if 

they   wanted   to   get   their   bids   confirmed   in   their   favour.     A­1   contacted   M/s 

Karishma   Enterprises   and   demanded   the   bribe.   On   further   interrogation,   A­1 

disclosed that he had demanded a bribe of Rs. three lacs from complainant and 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                          10 </span>
 accepted Rs. two lacs from complainant on today i.e. 24/01/2007 in his office and 

the said amount was to be further delivered to the said  Col. Rajeev Kant Sharan 

(A­2). Accordingly, it was decided to further lay a trap on the A­2. Thereafter, A­1 

was asked to contact from his mobile phone to the mobile phone of A­2 and to 

talk to him about the said matter of bribe.  A­1 contacted from his mobile phone 

no.9868225133   to   the   mobile   phone   no.9810833823   of   A­2.     In   the   same 

process, complainant had also talked to A­2 from the mobile phone of A­1.  The 

said conversation was recorded in DVR in the presence of above mentioned two 

independent witnesses. The above conversations were then heard at the spot 

immediately and it was revealed that A­2 was a party to the demand of bribe and 

had agreed to accept the said bribe amount on that day at about 7.00PM. A­2 

asked   the   complainant   to   come   to   his  residence   i.e.   flat   no.A­904,   Rajasthan 

CGHS,   Sector­4,   Dwarka,   New   Delhi   along   with   A­1   to   deliver   the   said   bribe 

amount   of   Rs.   two   lacs.   Accordingly,   it   was   decided   to   lay   a   trap   on   A­2   for 

demanding the said bribe. The seized pant of A­2 was given back to him to put 

on the same in order to avoid any suspicion.

<p id="p_8">

1.13             Witness Shri DK Mittal was asked to put the said tainted amount in 

the right side pocket of the pant worn by the complainant, which he did. A­1 was 

directed to accompany the complainant and remain in normal condition and to 

talk to A­2 as per situation. Then shadow witness/PW11 was asked to remain

between   complainant   and   A­2,   if   any.   All   the   team   members   were   suitably 

briefed. DVR was given to complainant in "off" mode with direction to switch it 

"on" immediately on reaching near the said residence of A­2 and then to contact 

A­2 over mobile phone to ascertain his presence as per the situation. A­1 was 

also asked to contact A­2 on reaching near his apartment over his mobile phone, 

if   required.   Both   were   directed   to   record   the   conversation   in   the   said   digital 

recorder, if any, between complainant and A­2 or between A­1 or A­2. Thereafter, 

the team members along with both independent witnesses, complainant and A­1 

left MSTC office for Dwarka by vehicles at around 6.45PM.



1.14            After reaching near the said apartment of A­2 in Sector 4, Dwarka, 

New Delhi all took suitable positions. The complainant put DVR in "on" mode. On 

directions, A­1 contacted (from his mobile phone to A­2) over his mobile phone. 

On   this   A­2   declined   to   meet   them   and   to   accept   the   said   bribe   amount. 

Accordingly,   it   was   decided   to   come   back   in   the   CBI,   ACB,   Delhi   office   to 

conclude the proceedings as there was no sufficient light and convenient place in 

Dwarka to do so. Then the said digital voice recorder was given to witness Shri

6.1             The   recorded   conversation   contained   in   audio   cassette   Q­1   is 

pertaining to the telephonic conversation dated 23.01.2007 between complainant 

PW9   and   accused   Samir   Kumar   Ghosh.   As   per   report   of   expert   (PW7)   from 

CFSL ,there was conversation of about 2 minutes and 3 seconds on side "A" of 

audio cassette Q­1. On comparison it was found by PW7 that questioned voice 

contained in Q­1 tally with specimen voice of accused Samir Kumar Ghosh and 

no tempering was found in the said recording. As per PW7 only two sentences 

were taken by him for comparison and entire conversation was not compared 

with the specimen voice of accused Samir Kumar Ghosh. The cassette Q­1 could 

not be played in the court during testimony of PW9 despite all efforts for about 40 

minutes.

6.2             Audio cassette Q­2 is pertaining to the recorded conversation dated 

24.01.2007   at   the   office   of   MSTC   which   is   mainly   between   complainant   and 

accused Samir Kumar Ghosh.   As per PW7, the questioned voice contained in 

Q­2 was the probable voice of accused Samir Kumar Ghosh. Audio cassette Q­3 

contained   the   recording   for   duration   of   about   3   minutes   20   seconds     and   10 

minutes  35   seconds   as  per   the   report   of  PW7.  For   comparison,   out   of   these

 conversation was not compared. 
</p>
<p id="p_41">

6.3             Ld.PP submitted that there is ample evidence on record that the 

recorded conversation contained in cassette Q­1, Q­2 and Q­3 was transferred 

from  DVR immediately at the spot and cassettes were sealed in presence of the 

witnesses which exclude any possibility of tempering. Ld.PP submitted that in 

view of the reports of expert (PW7)  and his testimony, it has been clearly proved 

that the recorded conversation are mainly between complainant, accused Samir 

Kr.   Ghosh   and   accused   R.K.   Saran.   The   recorded   conversation   has   clearly 

established the entire transaction of demand, acceptance and recovery of bribe. 



6.4             Ld. defence counsels for both the accused contended that as per 

prosecution, the original recording was done through the DVR. The DVR was 

neither sent to CFSL for the opinion of the expert nor has been produced before 

the   court.   Therefore,   the   primarily   evidence   has   not   been   produced   and   the 

possibility of tempering cannot be ruled out.  It was further argued that recorded 

conversation contained in cassette Q­1, Q­2 and Q­3 cannot be relied because 

the   substantial   portion   of   the   same   are   inaudible   and   not   clear.   The   another 

argument was that specimen voice of accused persons was not properly taken 

with   permission   of   the   court   and   therefore,   the   recorded   conversation   is   not 

admissible in evidence. One of the challenge was that recorded conversation was 

not clearly identified by the witnesses in the court.

6.15          PW11 is the important witness being the shadow witness at the time 

of trap. PW11  was working as Chief Manager in Vijaya Bank and was involved in 

the   proceedings   as   independent   witness.     The   following   discrepancies   were 

mentioned in  his testimony:­

</p><p id="p_86">   i) As per PW11 he reached in the office of CBI at about 5 PM and the (party) 

       complainant reached in the office of CBI between 10/11 PM. He could not 

       tell the name of the person who had arrived from Jaipur. 

</p><p id="p_87">   ii) PW11 stated that when he reached in the CBI office, he was called by Mr. 

       Rajesh Chahal  in  his office and  was informed  that approximately Rrs.5 

       lacs were to be given as bribe to Mr. Samir Ghosh with regard to tender 

       process in MSTC which is contrary to statement of PW9. 

</p><p id="p_88">   iii) PW11 stated that at the instance of Mr. Chahal that person (complainant) 

       gave   telephonic   call   to   Mr.   Ghosh.   The   telephonic   conversation   was 

       conveyed by complainant to PW11.  It reflects that telephonic conversation 

       between complainant and Samir Kumar Ghosh was not heard by PW11 

       and he has deposed on the basis of information received from TLO or 

       complainant.  He further stated that party produced G.C notes of Rs.3 lacs 

       in the denomination of Rs.500/­. The said statement of Pw11 is contrary to 

       the prosecution  case as complainant could  arrange only Rs.2 lacs and 

       produced the G.C notes in the denomination of Rs.1000/­each. 

</p><p id="p_89">   iv) He could not remember if any proceeding was conducted in the office of

        CBI in pre trap proceedings. 
</p>
<p id="p_90">   v) PW11   stated   that  party  (complainant)  told   Mr.  Ghosh  that  he   could   not 

       arrange Rs.5 lacs and had  arrange only Rs.3 lacs which is also contrary 

       to prosecution case. As per prosecution, trap money was  Rs.2 lacs. 

</p><p id="p_91">   vi) Pw11 stated that party (complainant) took out Rs.3 lacs from his pocket 

       and handed over to A­1 which A­1 kept in the pocket of his pant. This 

       claim   is   just   contrary   to   the   claim   of   PW9   who   stated   that   he   put   the 

       money on sofa. 
</p>
<p id="p_92">   vii) PW11 stated about preparation of transcript of recorded conversation on 

       last day of his visit to CBI office. It was observed by the court that there is 

       no transcript on record dated 25.1.2007 as stated by PW11. 



6.16            In my opinion, the testimony of Pw11 cannot be discarded in toto. 

His testimony may be relied where ever finds corroboration.

</p><p id="p_94">   (i) In   his   presence   complainant   had   conversation   with   Mr.   Ghosh   on

</p><p id="p_95">    (ii) PW10 stated that Mr. Chahal informed him that in respect of some scrap 

       bill, the amount of Rs.3 lacs was demanded from complainant by one Mr. 

       Sharan and  he could not remember if any proceeding was conducted on 

       23.01.2007. This statement reflect that demand was made by Mr. Sharan 

       and   TLO,   was   aware   about   the   demand   of   Mr.   Sharan   which   is   just 

       contrary   to   the   prosecution   case.   As   per   prosecution   case,   the 

       involvement of accused R.K. Saran came into the picture on 24.01.2007 

       from the disclosure statement of A­1 

</p><p id="p_96">   (iii) In respect of proceedings dated 24.1.2007 PW10 stated that he reached in 

       CBI office at 8 Am.  He could not remember about any proceedings which 

       took place in the office of CBI and straight away stated that they went to 

       Tolstoy Marg at the office of MSTC. This testimony  in examination in chief 

       reflect about the poor memory and creditability. At this stage, PW10  could 

       not depost about anything about pre trap proceedings. 

</p><p id="p_97">   (iv) In   respect   of   the   recovery   of   bribe   amount,   PW10   stated   that   he   was

       Piyush Gupta , Mr. Luharuwalla  and Mr. Ghosh were sitting in the room.

       was not at his home. PW9 did not talk about the telephonic conversation 

       with Mr. Sharan.

<p id="p_100">   (vii)Pw10 stated that after telephonic conversation, complainant informed that 

       Mr. Sharan had not asked for any bribe and also asked him to go away 

       which appears to be contrary to the testimony of Pw9 who did not mention 

       about these facts.

<p id="p_101">   (viii)PW10 stated that some internal proceedings were conducted in CBI office 

       but he could not remember about the said proceedings.

 Testimony of PW12 Sh. Rajesh Chahal,DSP, CBI (Trap Laying Officer/TLO) 

6.19            PW12 is an important witness being trap laying officer/ TLO. He has 

supported   the   prosecution   case   on   material   facts.   Admittedly,   PW12   was   not 

inside the room at the time of trap proceedings. Therefore, he is not a witness of 

demand and acceptance of bribe (at the time of trap) by accused Samir Kumar 

Ghosh.   He   has   supported   the   documents   prepared   by   him   during   the 

proceedings. He has supported the prosecution case on the question of demand 

of   bribe   at   pre   verification   stage   and   the   recovery   of   bribe   amount   from   the 

possession of accused Samir Kumar Ghosh at the stage of trap.

6.21              It   was   submitted   by   ld.   defence   counsel   that   no   disclosure 

statement was made by A­1 and disclosure statement Ex.PW15/E is a fabricated 

document.     Ex.PW15/E   does   not   bear   the   signature   of   accused   or   the

disclosure statement was not signed by A­1 or the witnesses. Prosecution failed 

to   explain   why   disclosure   statement   was   not   filed   alongwith   the   chargesheet. 

Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, there is serious doubt 

about the genuineness of disclosure statement Ex.PW15/E. The said doubt is 

further strengthen because PW9, PW10 and PW11 did not mention about the 

disclosure statement Ex.PW15/E.

10     In the case of  Jamir Ahmed Vs.   State, 1996 Crl. Law Journal 2354  it 

was held that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_9">               " It would be a hard not to crack to find out a case  
               which   is   bereft   of   embellishment,   exaggeration,  
               contradictions   and   inconsistencies.   The   said  
               things   are   natural.   Such   contradictions   and  
               inconsistencies   are   bound   to   creep   in   with   the  
               passage of time.   If the witnesses are not tutored  
               they   would   come   out   with   a   natural   and  
               spontaneous   version   on   their   own.     The   two  
               persons on being asked to reproduce a particular

               Each one of them will narrate the same in his own  
               words,   according   to   his   own   perception   and   in  
               proportion   to   his   intelligence   power   of  
               observation". 
</blockquote>
<p id="p_142">11             It   is   settled   proposition   of   law   that   the   testimony   of   witnesses  is 

required to be considered as a whole in the entire facts and circumstances of the 

case and keeping in view the contradictions, improvements and discrepancies. 

Testimony of any natural witness is bound to suffer from some contradictions and 

embroidery   of   falsehood.   Every   witness   has   his   own   intelligence,   capability, 

observation,  memory, knowledge and communication skill. Two witnesses of the 

same instance cannot narrate same incident in similar words. The testimony of 


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_48">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                            49 </span>
 witnesses always depends on their individual perception and capability. The duty 

of   the   court   is   to   analyze   the   statements   of   witnesses   in   the   context   and 

background of witnesses and circumstances of the case. 



12              The most important question is, whether witnesses have any reason 

to   depose   falsely   to   implicate   accused   persons?   In   the   present   case,   it   was 

argued by prosecution as well as defence that complainant was not known to 

either accused prior to this case. Similarly, two independent witnesses i.e. PW10 

and PW11 as well as TLO/PW12 had no previous background or enmity with any 

of   the   accused.   Nothing   has   been   brought   on   record   to   prove   that   material 

witnesses of the case has any motive or reason to implicate the accused persons 

falsely. Therefore, in my opinion the testimony of Pw9, PW10, PW11, PW12 and 

other witnesses cannot be treated as false with any ulterior motive. 



13      It is settled preposition of law that hostility of witnesses may be due to 

various reasons. Sometime witnesses may resile from their statement on account 

of lapse of time. Witnesses may forget minor aspects of the case and the minute 

details.   Sometime,   witnesses   may   contradict   due   to   confusion   or   lack   of 

understanding.
</p>
<p id="p_143">   

14      No   doubt   that   testimony   of   PW9,   PW10     and   PW11   suffers   from 

contradictions, improvements and deficiencies on some of the material facts as 

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                         50 </span>
 well as the minor details of the case. But, the important question  is, whether 

these witnesses are consistent, natural and trust worthy on the core issues of the 

case. Perusal of testimony of PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12 and documents on 

record proves that these witnesses have consistently deposed and corroborated 

each other  which proved following facts of the case:

</p><p id="p_144">   i) That complaint was lodged by PW9 with the CBI alleging demand of bribe.

</p><p id="p_145">   ii) That   pre   trap   verification   proceedings   were   conducted   wherein 

       complainant contacted accused Samir Kumar Ghosh (A­1) over the phone 

       which is proved by complainant and finds corroboration from PW11 and 

       PW12. 
</p>
<p id="p_146">   iii) There may be difference of opinion, whether there was demand in clear 

       terms   in   pre   trap   verification   proceedings.   But,   there   is   no   element   of 

       doubt   that   accused   Samir   Kumar   Ghosh   called   the   complainant   to   his 

       office on next day. 
</p>
<p id="p_147">   iv) That pre trap proceedings were conducted in the office of CBI which is 

       proved  by  PW12 (TLO)  as well as the documents prepared  in pre  trap 

       proceedings.   The   testimony   of   PW12   finds   corroboration   from   the 

       testimony of PW9, PW10 and PW12. 
</p>
<p id="p_148">   v) There   may   be   some   discrepancies   about   the   amount   produced   by 

       complainant to be used as trap money but Pw9, PW10, PW11 and Pw12 

       consistently   deposed   that   amount   of   trap   money   was   produced   by

        that the GC notes of trap money smeared with phenolphthalein powder 

        came   in   contact   with   accused   Samir   Kumar  Ghosh.   This   fact  has  also

Regional Manager. These circumstances also creates a serious doubt about the 

conduct of accused Samir Kumar Ghosh and corroborate the prosecution case. It 

corroborates   the   prosecution   case   that   A­1   fixed   the   meeting   in   the   office   of

establish the meeting of mind between the accused persons to enter into the 

criminal conspiracy and some overt act on the part of each accused towards the 

accomplishment of criminal conspiracy.     The offence of criminal conspiracy   is 

generally committed in clandestine manner to hide the commission of offence 

and therefore, generally there can hardly be any direct evidence in the form of 

independent witness in such cases.   The meeting of mind, criminal intention and 

respective roles of respective accused can be established either by the direct or 

the circumstantial evidence.   Therefore, circumstantial evidence also becomes

<p id="p_175">25             The involvement of accused R.K. Saran (A­2) in criminal conspiracy 

is   based   on   alleged   disclosure   statement   made   by   (A­1)   and   recorded 

conversation.   There   is   serious   doubt   in   the   disclosure   statement   of   accused 



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">DAI/2007/A/0005/CBI/ACB/New Delhi                                                     58 </span>
 Samir   Kr.   Ghosh.   Otherwise   also   the   alleged   disclosure   statement   is   not 

admissible in evidence unless the same comes u/s 27 of the <a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_40">Evidence Act</a>. As 

per prosecution, the involvement of accused R.K. Saran was revealed from the 

said disclosure statement , therefore, it comes within the purview of <a href="/doc/1312051/" id="a_41">section 27</a> of 

Evidence Act.   I do not agree with the contentions of Ld.PP.   In pursuance to 

disclosure statement neither there was any acceptance of bribe by accused R.K. 

Saran   nor   there   was   any   recovery   of   bribe   from   him   in   accordance   with   the 

disclosure statement of A­1. A­1 has denied the alleged disclosure statement. In 

my opinion, the disclosure statement allegedly made by A­1  is not proved  on 

record   by   reliable   evidence   and   therefore,   no   reliance   can   be   placed   on   the 

disclosure statement. As already discussed, recorded conversation contained in 

audio cassette allegedly in the voice of accused R.K. Saran (A­2) is not reliable 

evidence. Even if, for the sake of arguments only, the recorded conversation is 

taken   into   consideration,   the   same   may   be   used   only   for   the   purpose   of 

corroboration. In pursuance to the alleged recorded conversation neither there is 

any acceptance nor any recovery of bribe on the part of accused R.K. Saran. 



26              In view of above discussion, prosecution has failed to prove charges 

against   accused   R.K.   Saran   beyond   reasonable   doubt     in   respect   of   his 

involvement in criminal conspiracy. Therefore, charge of criminal conspiracy u/s 

120 B of <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_42">IPC</a> r/w <a href="/doc/324254/" id="a_43">Section 7</a> and <a href="/doc/178303/" id="a_44">13</a> (2) r/w 13 (1) (d) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_45">P.C Act</a> against both the

 acceptance and recovery of bribe is also not proved against accused R.K. Saran 

(A­2) and therefore charge  u/s 7  and 13 (2) r/w 13 (1) (d) of <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_46">P.C Act</a> could not be 

proved against him. However, the demand, acceptance and recovery of bribe and

of corruption is also wide between petty bribes to the corruption in thousands of 

crores   by   top   ranked   public   servants.   Sentence   to   a   convict   should   be 

proportionate and appropriate in response to the nature, gravity of offence and 

other   circumstances.     It   is   always   difficult   to   determine   a   proportionate   and 

appropriate   sentence   in   a   particular   case   which   may   serve   the   object   of   the 

sentence. In the cases of corruption, the main object of sentence is deterrence 

and   prevention   of   such   crimes   by   way   of     deterrence.   Reformation   theory   of 

punishment has comparatively lesser applicability in such cases. 



12              In order to determine the proportionate and appropriate sentence in 

such   cases,   court   may   start   from   middle   point   of   maximum   and   minimum 

sentence which may be inflicted against the convict. After starting from middle 

point,   court   may   consider   the   mitigating   and   incriminating   circumstance   to 

enhance   or   reduce   the   sentence   accordingly.   Similarly,   for   the   offence   in 

question, convicts are liable to pay fine. Quantum of fine may also be determined 

by considering the expenses incurred by the State during the investigation and 

trial. Though, it is difficult to determine the exact cost of such litigations, but court

is costly affair at the cost of public exchequer. Therefore, the quantum of fine 

should be proportionate to the gravity of offence, circumstance of convict as well

17              There is a famous saying that "power corrupts a man and absolute 

power corrupts absolutely". In the present context, it may also be said that it is 

not always power which corrupts a man but the corrupt man also corrupts the 

power i.e. system/processes. It is almost impossible to prepare a exhaustive list 

of the ill effects of corruption. Some of the ill effects are that it discredits the 

public   institutions;   creates   economic   inequality   in   the   public;   slow   down   the 

development of the country; creates frustration in the common masses; effects 

the  institutions as well  as the  individuals. In   democratic system  there  are  the 

demarcation of powers between the different institutions and the said powers are 

exercised   by   the   institutions   through   their   employees/officials.   The   public 

servants are expected to maintain the purity of the system and to implement the 

rule of law. Corruption anywhere in any form, particularly in public servants and 

public institutions attacks the very roots of the democratic system. No system can 

progress   unless   the   public   authorities   perform   their   duties   with   honesty   and 

dedication.   In   this  scenario  we   cannot  visualize   a   dream  of   a   developed   and 

powerful country unless the constitutional boundaries are being maintained and 

protected by the public authorities. The positions of public authorities in civil life is 

almost   similar   to   the   soldiers.   The   only   difference   is   that   our   soldiers   are 

expected to protect our territorial boundaries and the public authorities to protect

 the constitutional boundaries. If the fence starts eating the crops perhaps no one 

can save the future. To summarize, it may be said that corruption is the sharpest 

weapon of exploitation of masses by the individuals which in essence destabilize 

the faith of the people in rule of law.
