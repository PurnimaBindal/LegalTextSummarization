Conditions attached to the PO
</pre><p id="p_5">3. The terms and conditions attached to the purchase order („PO‟) dated 20th
December 1990 require to be discussed at this stage. The delivery schedule
stated that the delivery had to be completed by 20 th May 1991. The place of
delivery was also indicated. It stated "entire quantity is to be supplied to
Delhi/Bombay Unit." The consignee was "MTNL, Delhi/Bombay."
</p>
<p id="p_6">4. Clause 5.2 stated that the Store should be supplied as per Annexure-A.
The description of Item 4 above was erroneous and had to be amended
subsequently. The PO acknowledged that the FCL had furnished a
performance bank guarantee (PBG) dated 5th December 1990 for
Rs.18,37,650. It was stated that payment would be made by MTNL only
after acceptance of the BG.
</p>
<p id="p_7">5. Clause 9.2 stated that MTNL reserved the right to cancel the balance
quantity of order if the supply was not made within the delivery period or
extended delivery period, if any. In terms of Clause 10, delivery was to be as
per Annexure-A, which as already noted, required the delivery to be


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 2 of 23</span>
 completed by 20th May 1991. The addresses of the two consignees were
spelt out in Annexure-A as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">       "The Assistant Engineer,
       Mulund Cable Depot,
       Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited,
       Bombay-400080.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">       The Assistant Engineer,
       Circle Store Depot,
       Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited,
       A-III Block, Janakpuri,
       New Delhi."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_8">6. Under Clause 10.3 it was made clear that "the delivery of cables shall be
made as per Annexure-A. The stores were to be supplied conforming strictly
to the specification supplied by TEC/CGM (QA), Bangalore and
modification thereof, if any.
</p>
<p id="p_9">7. Under Clause 14.3 reasonable quantities were to be offered for inspection
to DET (QA). Thereafter the invoice raised by the supplier was to be
accompanied by such certificate of inspection stating that the stores
conformed to the specifications offered and were accepted. Under Clause 15
a taking over certificate („TOC‟) was to be attached to the invoice to the
payment. Clause 17 provided for liquidated damages and read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">       "17. Liquidated Damages

       17.1 The date of delivery of the stores stipulated in the
       acceptance of Purchase Order should be deemed to be the
       essence of the contract and delivery must be completed not later
       than the dates specified therein. Extension will not be given
       except in exceptional circumstances. Should, however,
       deliveries be made after expiry of the contract and be accepted

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                             Page 3 of 23</span>
        by the Consignee, such deliveries will not deprive the Purchaser
       of his right to recover liquidated damages under Clause 17.2
       below, where, however, supplies are made within 21 (twenty
       one) days of the contracted original delivery period, the
       consignee may accept the stores and in such cases the
       provisions of clause 17.2 will not apply.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">       Should the tenderer fail to deliver the stores or any consignment
       thereof within the period prescribed for delivery, the Chairman
       Cum Managing Director, MTNL, shall be entitled to recover
       ½% of the undelivered stores value of the Order placed; for
       each week of delay or part thereof, subject to a maximum of
       10% of the value of the Order placed."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">8. The error in the description against Serial No. 4 was that MTNL had
mentioned „Foam Type‟ whereas it had to be amended to „Foam Skin
Cable‟. By the letter dated 3rd January 1991 FCL asked MTNL to carry out
the necessary amendments to the specifications. On 14 th January 1991,
MTNL replied stating that Item No. 4 was "unarmoured Foam Skin jelly
filled cable" and that the specifications shall be as per the latest TEC
specifications for foam jelly filled cable with up to date amendments.
</p>
<p id="p_11">FCL's version of events that followed
</p><p id="p_12">9. What happened thereafter constitutes the bone of contention between the
parties. According to MTNL, FCL was to submit the sample for TEC
approval much in advance of the stipulated dated by which delivery had to
be completed i.e. 20th May 1991. As it transpired, the Petitioner submitted a
sample to TEC for approval only two days before the expiry of the
aforementioned deadline i.e. on 18th May 1991. The delay between 14th
January 1991 and 18th May 1991 for submitting the samples for „type
approval‟ by the TEC was not satisfactorily explained by FCL. The type


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 4 of 23</span>
 approval was granted ultimately on 5th August 1991. The reasons for the
failure to make delivery thereof are sought to be explained differently by the
two parties. According to FCL after the type approval was granted by the
TEC which was after the stipulated delivery period, MTNL time and again
wanted FCL to extend the delivery period. It is stated that FCL obliged and
kept extending the PBG from time to time.
</p>
<p id="p_13">MTNL's version
</p><p id="p_14">10. The version of MTNL, however, is different. It is stated that since the
TOC was not issued as documentary evidence of completion of the
contractual obligation, the PBG had to be kept alive. It is pointed that FCL
never objected to keeping the PBG alive. It is pointed out that though FCL
sought amendment of the delivery schedule which had already expired on
20th May 1991 it never really communicated its willingness to supply the
ordered quantity.
</p>
<p id="p_15">11. MTNL maintains that time continued to be the essence of the contract.
MTNL stated that after getting approval of the TEC on 5th April 1991, FCL
did not supply even a single meter of this variety of cable. There is no
exchange of correspondence during this period between the parties. What is,
however, apparent is that a letter was written by FCL to MTNL on 7th April
1992 requesting MTNL to short close the balance portion of the order
without any commercial implication as they presumed that requirement of
any supply cable did not exist anymore. MTNL points out that this
presumption by FCL was unilateral and not based on fact. MTNL‟s case is
that by keeping the PBG alive as and when demanded by MTNL, there was


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 5 of 23</span>
 an implied consent by FCL and MTNL to keep the PO alive.
</p>
<p id="p_16">12. For a period of over 9 years thereafter MTNL kept asking FCL to extend
the PBG and FCL also continued doing so. This conduct of both parties is
indeed intriguing. The PBG for the sum of Rs.18,37,650 was extended 15
times.
</p>
<p id="p_17">13. Meanwhile on 26th September 2000, FCL issued to MTNL two further
BGs in relation to certain other contracts for the sum of Rs.20,79,320 and
Rs.1,55,100.
</p>
<p id="p_18">Termination of contract
</p><p id="p_19">14. FCL addressed a letter to the Department of Telecommunication („DoT‟)
on 26th September 2001 "for induction of Foam Skin Cables („FOC‟) in
telecom network." In reply thereto on 14th December 2001, the TEC
informed FCL as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_5">         "The proposal for induction of Foam Skin Cables (FSC) in
         Telecom network has been considered. The proposal appears to
         be good but BSNL is trying to reduce the use of underground
         PIJF cable by using more and more other modern technology
         like WLL, DLC and HDSL etc. in its network. Further BSNL
         has issued instructions to the field units to shift from
         concentrated switching to distributing switching by use of more
         and more RSUs/RLUs so that large sizes of primary cables are
         reduced in the network. There is no plan of BSNL to try a new
         type of Foam Skin Cable in its network at present.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_6">         In view of the above we are not interested for presentation on
         advantages of Foam Skin Cables at this stage."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_20">15. What is strange however is that FCL did not address any letter as such to


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 6 of 23</span>
 MTNL asking whether it in fact still requires Foam Skin Cables as extracted
hereinbefore."
</p>
<p id="p_21">16. It is stated that on 29th January 2004 MTNL specifically invoked the BG
for alleged non-performance of the contract. A copy of the letter dated 29 th
January 2004 addressed by MTNL to the bank has been placed on record. It
appears that the said PBG for Rs.18,37,650 was in fact encashed. On 24th
February 2004, a letter was addressed by MTNL to FCL stating as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_7">       "Sir,
       Regarding the above mentioned purchase order, you did not
       supply 2400//4 mm. diameter wire without covering (25 km
       length). Due to this reason contract has been terminated. The
       loss due to termination of contract is calculated is
       Rs.40,70,756/- out of the Rs.18,37,650.00 bank cheque/DD has
       been encashed. Balance Rs.22,23,106.00 has to be recovered,
       the said amount within seven days of receipt of this notice,
       please give bank draft in favour of MTNL at office of
       undersigned.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_8">       In this much amount has not been deposited within this period,
       this amount will be deducted from any of your bills or any other
       bank guarantee."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_22">17. On 9th March, 2004, FCL wrote to MTNL stating inter alia that since the
requirement of the cable did not exist, they should not impose any financial
burden by encashing the BGs. FCL requested that the charges deducted be
reimbursed.
</p>
<p id="p_23">18. On 18th March, 2004, MTNL wrote to the Central Bank of India, Pimpri
Branch, Pune invoking the BG for Rs.20,79,320 given in another contract
and appropriated the said sum towards damages for the present contract. On

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                             Page 7 of 23</span>
 the same date, MTNL also encashed the BG for Rs.1,55,100 given in yet
another contract and appropriated that sum towards damages in the present
contract.
</p>
<p id="p_24">Arbitration proceedings
</p><p id="p_25">19. By the letters dated 6th November, 2005 and 24th December, 2005, FCL
sought reference of the disputes to arbitration. By the letter dated 30th
December, 2005, addressed to Mr. S.M. Dewan, the Chairman-cum-
Managing Director („CMD‟), MTNL appointed him as the sole Arbitrator
for adjudication of the disputes between the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_26">20. FCL then filed its statement of claim („SOC‟) before the learned sole
Arbitrator claiming a sum of Rs.40,70,756 from MTNL along with interest
@ 15% per annum from the date of invocation of the BG till the date of
repayment. FCL also prayed for cost of arbitration.
</p>
<p id="p_27">21. Apart from filing its reply to the SOC, MTNL also raised a counterclaim
of Rs. 6,28,44,266 from FCL towards losses suffered on account of delay in
supply of cables.
</p>
<p id="p_28">22. On 23rd June, 2008, the learned Arbitrator framed the following issues
for determination:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_9">       "(i) Whether the Respondent has rightly cancelled the Purchase Order
       No       MTNL/120-80(521)90-MM/FINOLEX/90-91/89                dated
       20.12.1990?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_10">       (ii) Whether invocation of Bank Guarantee by the Respondent in
       terms of Clause 7.4 of General Purchase Condition of NIT, was
       justified?
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                           Page 8 of 23</span>
<blockquote id="blockquote_11">        (iii) Whether Claimant is entitled for Rs.40,70,756/- against the
       invocation of bank guarantee by the Respondent?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_12">       (iv) Whether the Respondent is entitled to its counterclaim of
       Rs.6,28,44,256/- from the Claimant towards losses suffered on
       account of delay in supply of cables?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_13">       (v) Whether the parties are entitled to interest?
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_14">       (vi) Whether the parties are entitled to cost."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_29">Impugned Award
</p><p id="p_30">23. The learned Arbitrator on the basis of the written synopsis filed by the
parties passed the impugned Award dated 18th August, 2009 in which he
held as under:
</p>
<p id="p_31">i. There was an implied consent of both the FCL and the MTNL to keep the
PO alive. FCL did not insist on supplying of the goods or dispatching it to
MTNL. There was no evidence placed on record by the FCL to show that
MTNL, when supplied with the goods, refused to accept them. The
contention of the FCL that the MTNL was duty bound to demand delivery
appeared prima facie to be incorrect since the PO itself specified the place of
delivery, the delivery period, etc.

ii. MTNL not following up with the FCL to delivery material for a period of
12 years was not normal for a purchaser who required the goods.
Nevertheless the delay of 12 years in supply of the ordered material and the
lack of subsequent reminders by FCL to supply the material left no choice
with MTNL but to cancel the PO. Consequently the action of MTNL in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 9 of 23</span>
 cancelling the PO was "correct and well within the terms and conditions" of
the PO.
</p>
<p id="p_32">iii. Nothing was brought on record to show that both parties knew that any
loss is likely to result from non-delivery of the cables. MTNL had failed to
furnish details of the project in which the cables were to be used and
whether such project was, in fact, delayed or abandoned. There were no
details regarding loss incurred by MTNL, which could be attributed directly
to the non-availability of cables. No mention of any risk purchase had also
been made. The comparison of the price of the cables claimed to have been
used by MTNL with the ordered cable was not provided. If the agreed LD
were to be enforced it must be a result of some genuine pre-estimated
damages.
</p>
<p id="p_33">iv. Going by the terms of clause 7.4, MTNL was justified in invoking the
BG and recovering LD up to a maximum of 10% of the ordered value, i.e.,
Rs.36,75,300 only.
</p>
<p id="p_34">v. Except bald averments and an assumed loss of profit there is no material
placed on record by MTNL to substantiate the counterclaim. They were
accordingly rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_35">vi. No interest was awarded. The parties were directed to bear their
respective costs.
</p>
<p id="p_36">Submissions on behalf of FCL
</p><p id="p_37">24. Mr. Atul Y. Chitale, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the FCL


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                            Page 10 of 23</span>
 made the following submissions:
</p>
<p id="p_38">i. From the conduct of MTNL in getting FCL, time and again, to extend the
BG, it was apparent that time was not the essence of the contract. The facts
showed that on its part FCL never sought alteration of the date of delivery.
There was no failure as such by FCL to honour its commitment as far as the
supply of goods was concerned. MTNL did not, during this long period of
12 years, terminate the contract for failure to deliver within the extended
period of delivery.
</p>
<p id="p_39">ii. Reliance was placed on the decision in <a href="/doc/3413/" id="a_3">Keshavlal Lallubhai Patel &amp; Ors.
v. Lalbhai Trikumlal Mills Ltd</a>. AIR 1958 SC 512. It was urged that under
<a href="/doc/1105874/" id="a_4">Section 63</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 („ICA‟), the extension of time,
at the instance of MTNL, should be taken to be an acceptance by it of the
fact that time was no longer the essence of the contract. Consequently there
was no breach as such by FCL in failing to deliver the consignment of
cables. Reliance was also placed on the decisions in <a href="/doc/899181/" id="a_5">Arosan Enterprises
Ltd. v. Union of India</a> AIR 1999 SC 3804 and <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_6">Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Ltd. v. The Great Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>. (2008) 1 SCC
</p><p id="p_40">503.

iii. Reference was made to <a href="/doc/260928/" id="a_7">Section 2(6)</a> of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930
(„SOGA‟), which defined "future goods" to mean goods to be manufactured
or produced or acquired by the seller after making the contract of sale. This
had to be read with Section 6(3) of the SOGA, which states that "where by a
contract of sale the seller purports to effect a present sale of future goods,
the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods." Section 11 of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 11 of 23</span>
 SOGA stated that "unless a different intention appears from the terms of the
contract, stipulations as to time of payment are not deemed to be of the
essence of a contract of sale." Further "whether any other stipulation as to
time is of the essence of the contract or not depends on the terms of the
contract."
</p>
<p id="p_41">iv. There was an obligation on MTNL to apply for delivery. Section 35 of
the SOGA, states that "apart from any express contract, the seller of goods is
not bound to deliver them until the buyer applies for delivery." Reference is
made to the decisions in <a href="/doc/468409/" id="a_8">Nune Sivayya v. Maddu Ranganayakulu</a> AIR
1935 PC 67 and Alapaty Ramamoorthy v. Polisetti Satyanarayana AIR
1958 AP 550.
</p>
<p id="p_42">v. It is submitted that in the present case the contract for supply of goods
against item 4 of the PO was, in fact, a contract for supply of future goods.
It is submitted that the extension of the BG for a period of 12 years without
taking delivery of the goods and without raising a demand for supply was
proof that the items in question were "future goods" and not for a specific
project. For a period of more than 12 years MTNL neither invoked the BG
and sent no intimation for delivery of the goods. This did not happen even
till the time of short closure of the PO on 24th February, 2004. There was no
intimation, at any time, by MTNL to FCL about the delivery of the goods. It
is accordingly submitted that the invoking of the BGs and recovery of the
amount provided therein was untenable in law.
</p>
<p id="p_43">vi. Independent of the above, it is submitted that there was no loss
whatsoever suffered by MTNL for it to be compensated therefor. The type

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 12 of 23</span>
 of loss of profit as alleged was remote to the so-called breach. No
compensation was payable for any remote loss or damage sustained from
any such breach. No material was placed by the MTNL before the learned
Arbitrator to even remotely demonstrate that it suffered any loss. In any
event, in order to be entitled to damages, MTNL had to show that it took
steps to mitigate the loss. That was not done.
</p>
<p id="p_44">vii. Even assuming that Section 73 of the ICA would apply, it would only
entitle the Arbitrator to award "reasonable" compensation. There was no
justification, therefore, in allowing 10% of the value of the contract as
damages on the ground that it constituted a "genuine pre-estimate of
damages." Nothing was shown by MTNL that there were any deliberations
between the parties. It was merely a standard form of contract. Therefore,
MTNL was not entitled to claim and recover and FCL was not bound to pay
any sum as LD.
</p>
<p id="p_45">viii. Reliance is also placed on the decision in <a href="/doc/70828540/" id="a_9">Kailash Nath Associates v.
Delhi Development Authority</a> (2015) 4 SCC 136 to urge that the burden was
on MTNL to prove that it had suffered losses.
</p>
<p id="p_46">Submissions on behalf of MTNL
</p><p id="p_47">25. Countering the above submissions, Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior
Advocate appearing for MTNL, referred to clause 17 of the PO, which
provided for ½ % of the value of the undelivered stores, subject to a
maximum of 10% of the value of the order as LD. He submitted that in a
mercantile contract time continued to be the essence of the contract
irrespective of the extension of time. He referred to the decision in <a href="/doc/1079303/" id="a_10">Wasoo

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_13">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                           Page 13 of 23</span>
 Enterprises v. J.J. Oil Mills</a> AIR 1968 Guj 57.
</p>
<p id="p_48">26. Mr. Sethi pointed out that the PO made it clear that what the description
of the goods was and also who the consignees were. The time period of
delivery was also clearly indicated as was the quantity. He pointed out that
by the letter dated 3rd January, 1991, FCL accepted the revised delivery
schedule. Mr. Sethi pointed out that at no point of time did FCL inform
MTNL that it had readied the consignment for delivery. On its own it
presumed that MTNL no longer wanted the cables and by the letter dated 7 th
April, 1992 it sought "sympathetic consideration for short closing" the order
"without any commercial implication." In the letter dated 7 th April, 1992,
there was no claim made by FCL for any losses suffered for which
compensation was being sought.
</p>
<p id="p_49">27. Mr Sethi submitted that there was also inconsistency in the pleadings on
whether FCL, in fact, had the consignment ready. At one stage it was
pleaded in the SOC that FCL was compelled to keep the necessary stock of
raw materials for the unarmoured cable and that had caused loss and damage
to FCL. However, in the letter dated 9th March, 2004, addressed to MTNL,
FCL inter alia stated:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_15">       "It would not be out of place to put on record that till date we are still
       holding the stock of 5 (Five) drums of this Size/Type of Cable, since
       it was not required either by MTNL or by the then DoT (now BSNL)
       and this has put us in financial loss of developing this item besides,
       carrying the inventory for such a long time."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_50">28. At no time prior to this letter did FCL inform MTNL that it had the said
stock of cables ready for delivery. Since the PO itself specified the place of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_14">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                                Page 14 of 23</span>
 delivery, delivery period, etc., there was no need for MTNL to again make a
specific demand for delivery.
</p>
<p id="p_51">29. Mr. Sethi argued that what has been awarded by the learned Arbitrator is
only a reasonable pre-estimate of the genuine damages whereas clause 7.4
itself envisaged a maximum of 10% of the value of the order. There was no
need for MTNL to prove loss or damage. In that context a reference was
made to the decision in <a href="/doc/919241/" id="a_11">Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC) v.
Saw Pipes Ltd</a>. (2003) 5 SCC 705; Construction &amp; Design Services v.
Delhi Development Authority AIR 2015 SC 1282 and <a href="/doc/70828540/" id="a_12">Kailash Nath
Associates v. Delhi Development Authority</a> (supra). Mr. Sethi further relied
on the decision in <a href="/doc/42742762/" id="a_13">H.M. Kamaluddin Ansari &amp; Co. v. Union of India</a>
(1983) 4 SCC 417 and submitted that inasmuch as Clause 20 of the other
contract in which the other two BGs were furnished permitted it, the
encashment of such BGs in order to recover damages was not illegal. He
further submitted that the view taken by the learned Arbitrator was a
plausible one. Relying on the observations in <a href="/doc/31621011/" id="a_14">Associate Builders v. Delhi
Development Authority</a> (2015) 3 SCC 49 he submitted that the impugned
Award could not be said to be opposed to the fundamental policy of Indian
law and therefore, no interference was called for.
</p>
<p id="p_52">Scope of <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_15">Section 34</a>
</p><p id="p_53">30. The above submissions have been considered. At the outset, the Court
would like to recapitulate the Court‟s power under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_16">Section 34</a> of the Act to
interfere with an arbitral Award. The scope is considerably limited. <a href="/doc/31621011/" id="a_17">In
Associate Builders v. DDA</a> (supra), the present legal position has been

 summarised as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">       "It must clearly be understood that when a court is applying the
       "public policy" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court
       of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A
       possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster
       as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of
       evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus
       an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not
       measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be
       invalid on this score. Once it is found that the arbitrator‟s approach is
       not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_54">31. In NHAI v. ITD Cementation (2015) 14 SCC 21 the legal position was
reiterated as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_17">       "25. It is thus well settled that construction of the terms of a Contract
       is primarily for an arbitrator to decide. He is entitled to take the view
       which he holds to be the correct one after considering the material
       before him and after interpreting the provisions of the Contract. The
       court while considering challenge to an arbitral award does not sit in
       appeal over the findings and decisions unless the arbitrator construes
       the Contract in such a way that no fair minded or reasonable person
       could do."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_55">Breach of contract
</p><p id="p_56">32. One of the issues which arise for determination is whether the learned
Arbitrator could be said to have exceeded his powers and jurisdictions in
holding that the termination of the contract by MTNL was justified and
consequently whether the invocation and encashment of the BGs in question
was valid. On the question of the commission of breach of contract by the
Petitioner, the following facts emerge from the PO placed by MTNL on
FCL:
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                               Page 16 of 23</span>
<p id="p_57"> i. The PO itself clearly described the goods in question and whatever
amendment was required to be made to the PO was carried out by the letter
dated 14th January, 1991. The fourth type of cable was to be approved by
the TEC. The cable was of unique type. FCL accepted to develop it and
then got it approved by the TEC before the supply.
</p>
<p id="p_58">ii. Considering that the original delivery period was to expire on 20th May,
1991, it is not understood why FCL had to wait till 18 th May, 1991 to submit
the cable that it had made for approval by the TEC. There was an
unexplained delay between 14th January, 1991 and 18th May, 1991 in doing
so. Be that as it may, with the TEC having been approached only on 18 th
May, 1991, the grant of approval on 5th August, 1991 meant that the original
delivery period expired on 20th May, 1991.
</p>
<p id="p_59">iii. Both parties appear to have accepted this reality. Neither did MTNL
move to terminate the contract for failure of FCL to adhere to the delivery
period and nor did FCL resist the demands of MTNL from time and again
for keeping the BG alive. It must be recalled that the BG was for
Rs.18,37,650 and it kept getting renewed for a period of over 12 years with
MTNL making a request in that regard and FCL obliging it.
</p>
<p id="p_60">iv. The finding of the learned Arbitrator that there was "an implied consent
of both the claimant and the Respondent to keep the purchase order alive" is
the correct assessment of what transpired between them.
</p>
<p id="p_61">33. In the above context it is seen that the letter dated 7th April, 1992 by the
FCL to the MTNL seeking short closure was understandable. In that letter

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                               Page 17 of 23</span>
 all that is stated is that FCL had made arrangements "for procurement of raw
material for development of this item and within a period of 8-9 months we
were able to offer the cable for proto testing and finally we got type
approval." It offered short closure "without any commercial implication."
If indeed FCL suffered losses at that stage why it would offer for a short
closure "without commercial implication" is not understood.
</p>
<p id="p_62">Time not the essence
</p><p id="p_63">34. In the considered view of the Court for a period of 14 years after the
original PO dated 20th December, 1990, with neither party making a move
for closure of the contract, it was plain that time was, in fact, not the essence
of the contract from the point of view of either party.
</p>
<p id="p_64">35. In this context Section 63 of the ICA does come into picture and the
reliance by Mr. Chitale on the decision in <a href="/doc/3413/" id="a_18">Keshavlal Lallubhai Patel v.
Lalbhai Trikumlal Mills Ltd</a>. (supra); <a href="/doc/899181/" id="a_19">Arosan Enterprises Ltd. v. Union of
India</a> (supra) and <a href="/doc/1855581/" id="a_20">Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. The Great
Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd</a>. (supra) appears justified. In the last mentioned
judgment the Supreme Court observed as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_18">       "19. It is, no doubt, true that the general rule is that an offer is not
       accepted by mere silence on the part of the offerree, yet it does not
       mean that an acceptance always has to be given in so many words.
       Under certain circumstances, offerree‟s silence, coupled with his
       conduct, which takes the form of a positive act, may constitute an
       acceptance an agreement sub silentio. Therefore, the terms of a
       contract between the parties can be proved not only by their words but
       also by their conduct."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_65">36. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the parties accepted


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                                Page 18 of 23</span>
 the stark reality that time was never the essence of the contract and probably
there was no need for the cables any longer. Even if the PO had not been
cancelled it virtually amounted to cancellation because it was no longer
required.
</p>
<p id="p_66">37. There appears to be some confusion in the conclusion drawn by the
learned Arbitrator although the logic of his reasoning in the impugned
Award is on the above lines. The learned Arbitrator notes that the act of
MTNL in not following up to deliver material for a period of 12 years "is
not a normal act." To the Court it appears that not even replying to FCL‟s
letter dated 7th April, 1992 in seeking short closure was an equally unusual
act.
</p>
<p id="p_67">38. While the Court is unable to accept the plea of Mr. Chitale appearing on
behalf of the FCL that the goods in question were "future goods", there is
merit in his contention based on Section 35 of the SOGA that FCL was not
bound to deliver the goods till MTNL applied for delivery. The argument of
Mr. Sethi that the PO itself made clear what the dates of delivery should be
and therefore, the goods were not "future goods" is really an argument in
futility. The admitted position is that MTNL was in absolutely no hurry to
accept the delivery of the goods and they did not even bother to find out why
the goods were not delivered. This is despite the FCL writing to MTNL on
7th April, 1992 telling it "since it is more than two years our offer was
submitted........ Moreover there has not been requirement from the field units
in the last year for this high pair foam skin cable...."
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 19 of 23</span>
<p id="p_68"> 39. In that view of the matter while the Court concurs with the conclusion
drawn by the learned Arbitrator that time was no longer the essence of the
contract it does not accept the conclusion regarding the validity of the
cancellation of the PO by MTNL. The Court is of the view that the PO by
sheer efflux of time was no longer required to be complied with and in that
sense did not any longer represent a contract that was required to be
complied with by either of the parties.
</p>
<p id="p_69">No proof of loss suffered
</p><p id="p_70">40. This is critical because of the next issue that arose before the learned
Arbitrator, viz., whether the invocation of the BG by MTNL in terms of
Clause 7.4 of the PO was justified.
</p>
<p id="p_71">41. MTNL has no explanation whatsoever for suddenly springing on FCL
the unilateral invocation of the BG which it made FCL renew from time to
time. There was no loss suffered by MTNL on account of the failure of FCL
to supply the cables. Merely because Clause 7.4 of the PO entitles MTNL to
seek LD up to a maximum of 10% cannot justify the amount it sought to
recover, namely, the entire sum of Rs.36,75,300, which according to the
learned Arbitrator was approximately 10% of the contract value.
</p>
<p id="p_72">42. The law in relation to LD has been explained by the Supreme Court in
its decision in <a href="/doc/70828540/" id="a_21">Kailash Nath Associates v. Delhi Development Authority</a>
(supra). In para 43 of the said decision, the Supreme Court has explained the
legal position as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_19">       "43. On a conspectus of the above authorities, the law on
       compensation for breach of contract under Section 74 can be stated to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                             Page 20 of 23</span>
        be as follows:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_20">       43.1. Where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount
       payable by way of damages, the party complaining of a breach can
       receive as reasonable compensation such liquidated amount only if it
       is a genuine pre-estimate of damages fixed by both parties and found
       to be such by the Court. In other cases, where a sum is named in a
       contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only
       reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the amount
       so stated. Similarly, in cases where the amount fixed is in the nature
       of penalty, only reasonable compensation can be awarded not
       exceeding the penalty so stated. In both cases, the liquidated amount
       or penalty is the upper limit beyond which the Court cannot grant
       reasonable compensation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">       43.2. Reasonable compensation will be fixed on well known
       principles that are applicable to the law of contract, which are to be
       found inter alia in <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_22">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">       43.3. Since <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_23">Section 74</a> awards reasonable compensation for damage
       or loss caused by a breach of contract, damage or loss caused is a sine
       qua non for the applicability of the Section.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_23">       43.4. The Section applies whether a person is a plaintiff or a
       defendant in a suit.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_24">       43.5. The sum spoken of may already be paid or be payable in future.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">       43.6. The expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved
       to have been caused thereby" means that where it is possible to prove
       actual damage or loss, such proof is not dispensed with. It is only in
       cases where damage or loss is difficult or impossible to prove that the
       liquidated amount named in the contract, if a genuine pre-estimate of
       damage or loss, can be awarded.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">       43.7. <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_24">Section 74</a> will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest money
       under a contract. Where, however, forfeiture takes place under the
       terms and conditions of a public auction before agreement is reached,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 21 of 23</span>
        <a href="/doc/1941714/" id="a_25">Section 74</a> would have no application."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_73">43. It is, therefore, plain that it was incumbent on MTNL to prove that it had
suffered some loss although as Mr. Sethi rightly pointed out it did not have
to prove the actual loss. What, however, the learned Arbitrator has found
and which finding has not been challenged by MTNL is that MTNL suffered
no loss whatsoever. There was absolutely no material placed on record by
MTNL that it suffered an iota of loss on account of non-supply of cables.
Therefore, even assuming that Clause 7.4 signifies a genuine pre-estimate of
damages, MTNL was not relieved of showing that it had suffered some loss.
This again even if it proved that it suffered some loss, the adjudicatory body,
which in this case was the learned Arbitrator was required to award „a
reasonable sum‟. What is reasonable would depend on the facts and
circumstances of every case. If the maximum amount of LD was to be
awarded then it was incumbent on the Arbitrator to explain how the
maximum LD anticipated by the clause as reasonable sum. In this regard,
the Court finds no explanation whatsoever for the learned Arbitrator
awarding the maximum 10% of the total value of the contract particular
when no loss whatsoever has been suffered by MTNL.
</p>
<p id="p_74">44. The Court is, therefore, not able to sustain the impugned Award insofar
as it holds that the invocation of the BG by MTNL was justified and awards
MTNL a sum of Rs.36,75,300 as LD. This part of the Award is based on no
evidence whatsoever. It is contrary to the settled legal position as explained
by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/70828540/" id="a_26">Kailash Nath Associates v. Delhi Development
Authority</a> (supra) and NHAI v. ITD Cementation (supra). An Award
inconsistent with the law explained by the decision of the Supreme Court

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">OMP No. 746 of 2009                                              Page 22 of 23</span>
 would opposed to the fundamental policy of Indian law. It would attract
invalidation under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_27">Section 34</a> (2) (b) (ii) of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_75">Conclusion
</p><p id="p_76">45. Consequently, the Court sets aside the impugned Award to the extent it
awarded MTNL LD in the sum of Rs.36,75,300. The said sum has to,
therefore, be refunded to FCL by MTNL.
</p>
<p id="p_77">46. This is apart from the fact that there was no justification to invoke the
BGs furnished by FCL to MTNL for some other contracts and encashing
them to make up for the damages claimed by MTNL in this contract. The
aspect of encashment of those BGs without any breach of those contracts by
MTNL has not even been examined by the learned Arbitrator. In any event
in the considered view of the Court MTNL was not justified in encashing
any of the BGs for any reason whatsoever.
</p>
<p id="p_78">47. For all of the aforementioned reasons, the Court sets aside the impugned
Award insofar as it has held against the FCL and awarded MTNL a sum of
Rs. 36,75,300 together with the corresponding interest.
</p>
<p id="p_79">48. The petition is accordingly allowed with costs of Rs.20,000, which
would be paid by MTNL to FCL within a period of four weeks.
