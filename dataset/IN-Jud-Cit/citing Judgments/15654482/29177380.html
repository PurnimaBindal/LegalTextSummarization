<p id="p_1">1.     The plaintiffs have filed the above mentioned two suits for
permanent injunction restraining infringement of Indian Patent
No.203937 and for damages against the defendants. The invention
claimed by the plaintiffs inter alia for the treatment of cancer.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                 Page 1 of 86</span>
<p id="p_2"> 2.     By way of this common order, I propose to decide the pending
injunction applications filed by the plaintiffs under Order XXXIX Rules
1 and 2 read with Section 151 CPC in both the matters. The first suit
was filed in November, 2009. The second suit was filed in April 2013
on the basis of fresh cause of action. The suit patent remains the
same.
</p>
<p id="p_3">3.     Both suits are quia timet actions. The first suit, being CS
No.2303/2009, was filed against the defendants namely (i) Mr. JD
Joshi, Director of defendant No.2 and M/s MJ Chempharm Private
Limited (now known as BDR Lifesciences Private Limited) as the
plaintiffs have reasonable apprehension that the defendants are
going to launch the generic product which would infringe the claims of
IN 203937 and they may violate the exclusive rights of the plaintiffs
granted under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_1">Section 48</a> of the Indian Patents Act, 1970.
</p>
<p id="p_4">4.     Common facts as per plaints:
</p>
<p id="p_5">i)    Plaintiff No.1, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a company
      incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA
      founded under its present name in the year 1989 as a result of a
      merger between two pharmaceutical companies namely, Bristol-
      Myers Company founded in 1887 by William McLaren Bristol and
      John Ripley Myers and Squibb Corporation founded by Edward
      Robinson Squibb in 1858.
</p><p id="p_6">ii)   Plaintiff No.2, Bristol-Myers Squibb India Private Limited, is a
      private limited company incorporated in 2004 and is a subsidiary



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 2 of 86</span>
        of plaintiff No.1 and markets pharmaceutical products in the
       domestic market.
</p><p id="p_7">iii)   Plaintiff    No.1    along        with   its    subsidiaries     is    a    leading
       biopharmaceutical          company             dedicated    to        discovering,
       developing and delivering innovative medicines that help
       patients prevail over serious diseases. The plaintiffs have a
       strong presence in various therapeutic areas including cancer,
       cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, psychiatric disorders,
       Alzheimer's disease, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS and rheumatoid
       arthritis.
</p><p id="p_8">iv) Plaintiff No.1 is the exclusive owner of DASATINIB and its
       pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, isomers and
       prodrugs which is covered by the claims of IN 203937 in India.
       Plaintiff No.1's patent 203937 is valid and subsisting and has a
       term of 20 years from 12th April, 2000 in India. Plaintiff No.1,
       enjoys patent protection for the said patent in several other
       countries such as United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan
       etc.
</p><p id="p_9">v)     DASATINIB         which      is    the    INN     name     of     N-(2-chloro-6-

       accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid
       leukaemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy
       including imatinib, as well as, in the treatment of adults who have
       a particular form of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) called

       Philadelphia chromosomepositive (Ph+) ALL. In both the suits
      I.A. No.11344/2014 and I.A. No.11336/2014 have been filed
      stating that the plaintiff No.1 has assigned its rights, titles,
      interests in the suit patent by virtue of Assignment Deed dated
      1st December, 2012 in favour of Bristol Myers Squibb Ireland and
      its request filed on 7th November, 2013 is pending. (Both the
      applications have been allowed by separate orders passed and
      assigning party is impleaded as plaintiff No.3 in the suits).
</blockquote>
<p id="p_10">5.     It is claimed that Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), one of the
most common forms of leukemia, arises from the excessive
production of abnormal stem cells in the bone marrow, which
eventually suppress the production of normal white blood cells. The
development of imatinib mesylate, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI), was the first rationally designed drug for CML. While
imatinib mesylate has undoubtedly had, and continues to have, a
major impact in the treatment of CML, cases of 'imatinib-resistant
CML' are emerging. (Combating imatinib-resistant CML is an
important therapeutic challenge and one for which a new generation
of TKI inhibitors, such as DASATINIB, address.)

</p><p id="p_11">6.     It is also claimed that the plaintiff No.1's invention, DASATINIB,
addresses the above challenge by reducing the activity of one or
more proteins responsible for the uncontrolled growth of the leukemia
cells of patients with CML or Ph+ALL. This reduction allows the bone
marrow to resume production of normal red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets. The compounds of the present invention inhibit


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                Page 4 of 86</span>
 protein tyrosine kinases and are thus useful in the treatment,
including prevention and therapy, of protein tyrosine kinase-
associated disorders such as immunologic disorders, oncologic
disorders and diabetic retinopathy. In vitro, DASATINIB is active in
variants of imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant leukemic cell
lines. DASATINIB inhibited the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in cell lines over
expressing BCR-ABL.
</p>
<p id="p_12">7.     It is alleged in the plaint that Dasatinib and its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts (which is the INN name of N-(2-chloro-6-
methylphenyl)-2-[[6-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1       -piperazinyl]-2-methyl-4-
yrimidinyl]amino] -5-thiazolecarboxamide) is covered by claim 1 of IN
203937 and in particular claim 7. The patent specification in example
455 exemplifies Dasatinib and the method for manufacturing the
same is provided in the patent specification. (The copy of the
complete specification is filed in the present proceedings.)          Apart
from the above plaintiff No.1 has also made an application in India for
crystalline monohydrate form of Dasatinib. The said application is
numbered 4309/DELNP/2006 dated 4th February, 2005 and is
currently pending before the Indian Patent Office. The monohydrate
form of Dasatinib has been granted patents in 45 countries and is an
improvement patent of Indian Patent No.203937. The said application
relates to crystalline monohydrate form of Dasatinib and if granted
would confer the plaintiff an additional layer of protection, although
the present patent and in particular claim 7 is broad enough to cover



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                               Page 5 of 86</span>
 all the salts, prodrugs, solvates isomers as explained in the patent
specification, irrespective of the fate of the pending application. It is
stated that any person who makes use, sell etc Dasatinib
monohydrate form will infringe not only Indian Patent No.203937 but
also Indian Patent Application No.4309/DELNP/2006 as and when
granted.
</p>
<p id="p_13">8.       It is also stated in the plaint that the plaintiff No.1's product
DASATINIB was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
on 28th June, 2006. It is presently sold in approximately 50 countries
throughout the world. A marketing approval for DASATINIB was also
granted by the Drug Controller General of India ("DCGI") on 30th
August, 2006 to plaintiff No.2, who has since that time been
marketing DASATINIB under the brand name "SPRYCEL" across
India.
</p>
<p id="p_14">         Plaintiff No.2 has marketed SPRYCELTM in India since
November 2006. In India, SPRYCELTM is made available to patients
across the country through a Centralized Vendor System which
ensures delivery of the product at the door-step of the patients.
</p><p id="p_15">         The plaintiffs efforts to make SPRYCELTM more accessible and
available to patients across India have lead to substantial sales which
are indicated in the table below:

</pre><p id="p_16">9.     It is averred in the plaint that during the past five years, plaintiff
No.1 has donated nearly $260 million of medical products, valued at
wholesale, to support partner programs throughout the world. Plaintiff
No.2 has taken initiatives for addressing the specific needs of
physicians and their imatinib-resistant patients in India who may
benefit     from     Sprycel      and   runs   commercial   patient   access
programmes with respect to Dasatinib. Dasatanib is not an Over-the
counter drug but a prescription drug. Ever since the launch of
Dasatinib in India, the plaintiffs have addressed the access and
affordability needs of the patients by an aggressive commercial
Patient Access Program (PAP) through which prices of the drug is
reduced to a fraction of the MRP. This has evolved over time thereby
consistently reducing the cost of drug to patients. The program is
available through a third party service provider, for the self paying
patients prescribed Dasatinib, by an Oncologist. The service provider
of plaintiff No.2, through a centralized call center, delivers the drug to
the prescribed patients at the door step anywhere in India with no
additional delivery cost.
</p><p id="p_17">       The plaintiffs' Patient Access Program (PAP) is publicized to all
the oncologists of the country through regular advertisements in
medical journals like India Journal of Cancer. The availability of this

 Program has been broadly communicated to help to ensure patients
do not experience treatment hurdles/interruptions. The commercial
program of plaintiffs has strong utilization and support from the
medical community. In addition to offering Dasatinib at a reduced
price, this Program also provides patient education to facilitate
compliance to therapy.
</p>
<p id="p_18">10.    In the first suit, it was stated by the plaintiffs that around
December 2008, they received information that defendant No.2 ("M.J.
Chempharma Pvt. Ltd.") had applied to the DCGI for the marketing
approval for Dasatinib. The plaintiffs sent a 'cease and desist' letter
dated 12th January 2009 to defendant No.2 asking them to restrain
from infringing IN 203937. (For a long time, no response was
received from the defendants-Company.) In the meantime, plaintiffs
also filed a Right to Information ("RTI") Application with the DCGI on
12th May 2009 enquiring as to whether the defendants-Company had
filed an application seeking marketing approval for Dasatinib. The
plaintiffs received a reply from the DCGI on 25th June 2009 which
stated that two companies have applied for the marketing approval
for Dasatinib but did not disclose the name of the companies. The
plaintiffs thereafter sent a reminder to its letter dated 12th January
2009. A response was received from the defendants on 6th August
2009 in which it admitted to have applied for a marketing approval for
Dasatinib. In view of the apprehension that the defendants may not
infringe the plaintiffs' exclusive right of the patent, the plaintiffs filed a
suit being CS(OS) No.2303/2009 in the nature of a quia timet action



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                  Page 8 of 86</span>
 against the defendants on 3rd December 2009 for the infringement of
IN 203937.
</p>
<p id="p_19">11.    The suit was listed before this Court on 4th December 2009
along with interim injunction application being I.A. No.15720/2009.
</p>
<p id="p_20">12.    The Court while issuing the summons in the main suit
restrained the defendants by passing the following injunction:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_2">      "I have heard the learned counsel for the plaintiffs. I am of
      the view that they have made out a prima facie case at this
      stage. The balance of convenience also appears to be in
      favour of the plaintiffs. In the event, the plaintiffs are not
      protected their interests may be jeopardized. In these
      circumstances, defendants, their directors, employees,
      officers,   servants,     agents    are    restrained     from
      manufacturing, selling, distributing, advertising, directly or
      indirectly any product which infringes the plaintiffs'
      registered patent 203937."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_21">13.    The defendant No.1 neither appeared nor filed the written
statement despite of service of summons in March, 2010. Defendant
No.2, i.e. the Company filed its written statement wherein it was
admitted that they have applied for the marketing approval of
Dasatinib having the same chemical structure as disclosed in
example 455 of the patent specification and claim 7 of the patent
claims. It is also stated that it would launch the generic version of
Dasatinib when it obtains the marketing approval to manufacture it
from the DCGI. The name of defendant No.2 was changed to BDR
Life Sciences Private Limited ("BDR Life Sciences") on 7th September
2010. By a separate order, the defendants' application under Order 1
Rule 10 CPC in respect thereof has been allowed.

<p id="p_22">        In para 26 of their Written Statement, it was admitted that the
defendant is intending to launch the generic version of Dasatinib only
if the DCGI grants licence to the defendant to manufacture under the
provisions of DCA. In para 5 and paras 20, 21, 23, 24, 28 and 29 of
the parawise reply of the Written Statement the defendants admitted
having made an application for grant manufacturing licence for
generic DASATINIB. In paragraph 13 of the reply on merits of the
Written Statement the defendant No. 2 further admitted that their
impugned drug has the same chemical structure as that of the
plaintiffs.

that BDR Pharma did not follow the due procedure in law prior to

       Dear Mr. Shah,

       Thank you for your letter dated 10th May 2013.

       Our response is as follows:-



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                     Page 16 of 86</span>
</pre><p id="p_33">        In the first instance, we have come to learn through
       newspaper reports of a compulsory license application
       having been filed by you on the 4th of March 2013. We
       are surprised you have not informed us about this
       application at any time during our correspondence starting
       in February 2012 and terminating with your present letter
       which is under reply.
</p>
<p id="p_34">       Second, it appears that you had already announced the
       launch of your product commercially at about the time when
       you applied for a compulsory license and therefore your
       application is not bonafide. As you are well aware, an
       application for a compulsory license must be founded in good
       faith by a person genuinely desiring to manufacture goods in
       larger public Interest. On the other hand, someone who starts
       infringing a patent and simply applies for a compulsory license
       to test the waters not only seriously lacks bonafides but the
       entire compulsory license process is vitiated by this conduct.
</p>
<p id="p_35">       Your initial letter for a voluntary license was dated 2nd February
       2012 and promptly responded by us by our letter of 13th March
       2012. We are quite surprised that for 14 months you did not
       deem it fit to respond to our letter of 13th March 2012 and all
       this while you kept preparing to commercially launch the
       product. Hence, even your request for a voluntary license
       lacks bonafides and stands vitiated by your dubious conduct.
</p>
<p id="p_36">       Without prejudice to the above, since there is an injunction
       operating in civil suit being CS(OS) No. 2303 of 2009 titled Bristol
       Myers Squibb Company &amp; Anr. v Mr. JD Joshi and Anr. and a
       statement given by you in civil suit being CS(OS)No. 679 of 2013
       titled Bristol Myers Squibb Company &amp; Anr. v Mr. D Shah and Anr
       to the effect that you are not currently manufacturing or marketing
       the drug in question, we would like you to give an undertaking
       before the Delhi High Court in the pending suits being CS(OS)
       No.679 of 2013 that you will not manufacture and sell the drug in
       question during the time period that the dasatinib patent



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                    Page 17 of 86</span>
        (IN203937) remains in full force and effect in India and BMS has
       an opportunity to fully consider your request."
</p>
<p id="p_37">       The talks again continued till 20th September 2013 when BDR
abruptly ended the correspondence as they did not provide the
information asked by the plaintiffs.
</p>
<p id="p_38">23.    After that, it came to the knowledge from one sources that BDR
Pharma and BDR Life Sciences had obtained manufacturing licenses
for Dasatinib Tablets and Dasatinib BULK respectively and the
plaintiffs filed an application seeking discovery in both the suits.
</p>
<p id="p_39">24.    By order dated 1st October, 2013 passed in the first Suit, the
Court directed BDR Life Sciences to disclose the manufacturing
license for DASATINIB BULK.
</p>
<p id="p_40">25.    As already mentioned, defendant No.1 did not appear despite
of service of summons in March, 2010 in the first suit. In April, 2010,
defendant No.2 sought time to file the written statement but the same
was filed in January, 2011.         No counter claim was filed by the
defendant No.1 along with the written statement.            It was filed in
November, 2013 i.e. after the expiry of three years from the date of
service of summon and positive knowledge of infringement suit.
Although, the Court directed the plaintiffs to file the written statement
to the counter-claim but the objection was raised by the plaintiffs that
it is time barred and cannot be condoned.
</p>
<p id="p_41">26.    In the Second Suit, this Court recorded an undertaking of BDR
Pharma on 3rd October, 2013 that it shall not launch Dasatinib till the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                 Page 18 of 86</span>
 injunction application is disposed of. The said undertaking has been
in operation till date. Upon clarification, the Court also directed BDR
Pharma to disclose the manufacturing license for Dasatinib Tablets
by its order dated 13th November, 2013.
</p>
<p id="p_42">27.    On 28th October, 2013 the Controller of Patent rejected BDR
Pharma's application for obtaining the compulsory license. The
relevant extracts of the said decision of the Controller in his order in
paras 8, 9, 21 to 23, 29 &amp; 30 are reproduced here as under:-
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_19">      "8.     In the present case, the applicant sent a letter dated
        nd
      2 February, 2012, to the patentee requesting for a
      voluntary licence for manufacturing Dasatinib. By letter
      dated 13th March 2012, the patentee raised certain queries
      such as ''facts which demonstrate an ability to consistently
      supply high volume of the API, DASATINIB, to the market",
      "facts showing your litigation history or any other factors
      which may jeopardize Bristol-Myers Squibb's market
      position", "quality related facts and in particular compliance
      with local regulatory standards and basis GMP
      requirement", "quality assurance system due diligence",
      "commercial supply teams", "safety and environmental
      profile", "risk of local corruption". The applicant took this
      reply of the patentee as 'clearly indicative of the rejection of
      the application for voluntary licence' and did not pursue the
      matter and made no further effort to arrive at a settlement
      with the patentee. The present application for compulsory
      licence was filed on 4th March 2013 i.e. after almost one
      year from the date receiving reply from the patentee.

       approval from the DCGI, and 'the applicant has also not
      made efforts to obtain a licence from the patentee on
      reasonable terms and conditions' (hereinafter referred to as
      the 'efforts'). The applicant was informed that in
      accordance with the provisions of Rule 97(1) of the Rules,
      a request for being heard is required be filed within one
      month from the date of this order failing which the
      application shall be rejected.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">      21.     In the present case, the applicant made the request
      for a voluntary licence on 2nd February, 2012 to the
      patentee who, by letter dated 13th March 2012, raised
      some queries. More than four and a half months remained
      unutilized out of the 'reasonable period' prescribed by the
      legislature for the purpose of mutual confabulations but the
      applicant chose not to take any action during this precious
      time period that was available with the applicant. In fact,
      after receiving the reply from the patentee, dated 13th
      March, 2012, the applicant waited for 1 year to file the
      present applicant, which demonstrates that the applicant
      did not intend to engage in any kind of dialogue,
      whatsoever, after making the initial offer to the patentee.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">      22.     On the face of the record, I am of the view that the
      applicant's contention that the said letter is 'clearly
      indicative of the rejection of the application for voluntary
      licence' does not hold good, as the aforementioned queries
      raised by the patentee appear largely to be reasonable.
      Even if the applicant was under an impression that the
      patentee was engaging in delaying tactics, the omission of
      not replying at all to the patentee's said letter dated 2nd
      February 2012 is unexplainable as it goes against the
      golden threat apparently visible in <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_9">Section 84(6)(iv)</a>.
      Applicant ought to have appreciated that the provisions
      relating to compulsory licence are to be invoked as the last
      resort, i.e if the mutual deliberations do not lead to a result
      within six months, in accordance with the scheme of the
      law.

      after receiving the notice dated 4th May 2013, replied to the
      patentee's letter dated 13th March 2012. It is pertinent to
      mention that this reply was sent after a delay of about 14
      months. It was submitted by way of petitions under rule
      137 that correspondence that took place between the
      applicant and the patentee subsequent to the filing of the
      application for compulsory licence, be taken on record.

<blockquote id="blockquote_25">      29.    The applicant sought to argue that the three
      substantive requirements under clause (a), clause (b) and
      clause (c) of sub-section (1) of <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_10">Section 84</a> of the Act have

      the considered opinion that the deliberate intent on part of
      the applicant to refrain from entering into any kind of
      dialogue with the patentee from the purpose of securing
      the grant of a voluntary licence, and the exercise of a
      deliberate choice to only invoke the provisions relating to
      compulsory licences without taking the requisite steps laid
      down by the law, cannot be classified as an 'irregularity in

<p id="p_45">30.     It is not denied by the defendants about a connection between
the present defendants and M/s MJ Chempharma Private Limited
(the company which was restrained by this Court from infringing the
plaintiffs Patent No.203937 in CS(OS)No.2303 of 2009). It is pleaded
by the defendants that name of M/s MJ Chempharma Private Limited,
was changed to BDR Lifesciences Private Limited. Furthermore,
defendant No.1 J.D. Joshi in earlier suit was also one of the Directors
on the Board of the said BDR Lifesciences Private Limited who has
equity of M/s M.J. Chempharma Private Limited as appeared from
the annual report of defendant No.2 showing BDR Lifesciences

Limited in order to surpass and over-reach the order dated 4th
December, 2009 passed by this Court and to disguise its infringing

further submitted that defendant No.1 and 2's conduct in the past
with respect to the invention claimed in the suit patent has been

 dishonest and deceitful. It is done between the defendants and its
sister concern/associate company to circumvent the orders of this
Court as it is also evident from the fact that in February, 2012,
defendant Nos.1 and 2 knowing full well that plaintiff No.1 was the
proprietor of Indian Patent No.203937 approached plaintiff No.1 for
obtaining a voluntary license for manufacturing DASATINIB in India.
Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 through their letter dated 2nd February, 2012
also requested plaintiff No.1 to send detailed terms and conditions.
</p><p id="p_47">32.     The plaintiffs had shown their interest for entering into a
commercial transaction in order to take the matter forward requested
the said defendants to furnish certain details relating to the matter by
the letter dated 13th March, 2012. But the plaintiffs thereafter did not
receive any response from defendant No.1 and 2 with regard to the
queries raised in their letter dated 13th March, 2012 and thus,
considered the matter as closed as they may not be more interested
to deal with the plaintiffs. However, in the second week of March,
2013,      after     almost       one   year   from   the   aforementioned
correspondence, the plaintiffs came to know that the defendants had
filed an application under <a href="/doc/799603/" id="a_12">Section 84</a> of the Patents Act, 1970 before
the Controller of Patents for grant of a Compulsory Licence with
respect to DASATINIB. As defendant Nos.1 &amp; 2 started advertising
and/or offering for sale the impugned product on their website, the
plaintiffs had an apprehension that defendant No.1 and 2 are in the
process of manufacturing generic DASATINIB and are soon going to
sell DASATINIB across the country including within the jurisdiction of
this Court.

<p id="p_48"> 33.    It is argued by the plaintiffs that the letter dated 2nd February,
2012 for a voluntary licence was just an eye-wash in order to conceal
the real intention of the defendants of infringing the plaintiffs' Patent.
Rather defendant Nos.1 and 2 along with their associate company/
sister concern have systematic way to violate the restraining order
dated 4th December, 2009 passed by the Court in CS(OS) No. 2303
of 2009 by using, manufacturing, selling and/or offering for sale a
generic version of DASATINIB through defendant No.2 company. It is
submitted that the impleadment of defendant Nos.1 and 2 in civil suit
being CS(OS) No.2303 of 2009 was not possible on account of the
present action being a fresh cause of action and earlier proceedings
are four years old. Therefore the plaintiffs had decided to file a fresh
suit which has been filed. The interim protection in the fresh second
suit was granted and still continues.
</p>
<p id="p_49">34.    By virtue of the grant of IN 203937, plaintiff No.1 under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_13">Section
48</a> has the exclusive right to make use, sell, import and distribute
Dasatinib and it is pharmaceutically acceptable, salts irrespective of
the form (pro drugs, solvates, isomers).Hence, the aforementioned
acts of the defendants are prohibited by <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_14">Section 48</a> and amount to

<p id="p_50">35.    Many pleas have been taken by the defendants in both the
written statements. However, at the time of hearing, counsel for the
defendants have raised the following main points :
</p><p id="p_51">a)    The defendant, BDR Pharmaceuticals Private Limited is a
      Mumbai       based          Company   engaged   in   the   business         of
      manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical compounds. Defendant
      Company originally known as MJ Chemphan Private Ltd. formed
      in 2002 which was changed to BDR Life Sciences Private
      Limited. BDR Pharmaceuticals and BDR Life Sciences are part
      of the same group company and are engaged in manufacture of
      Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and finished formulations.
</p><p id="p_52">b)    Credible Challenge in the form of Counter Claim raised by
      defendant to the effect that Patent invalid as it obvious in view of
      prior art filed along with the counter claim. The suit patent also
      lacks utility and hence invalid. Thus, the plaintiffs are not entitled
      for injunction.
</p><p id="p_53">c)    The request for voluntary license by the defendant is immaterial,
      therefore, there is no bar to contest the validity of patent in a suit

      of validity of patent.

      prior art :
</p><p id="p_58">       It is argued on behalf of defendants that Dasatinib is covered
by Indian Patent No.203937. Claim No.7 is drawn to Dasatinib. The
chemical name of Dasatinib is N-(2-Chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-[[6-[4-
(2-hydrosyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]-2-methl-4-pyrimidinyl]                 amino]-5-
thiazolecarboxamide.              The   molecule   Dasatinib   is   primarily       a
thiazolecarboxamide derivative.

<p id="p_60"> 36.    It is submitted by the defendants that the impugned compound
Dasatinib is obvious to a person skilled in the art on the following
reasons:
</p><p id="p_61">(a) That it has been well known that tyrosine kinase (PTKs) family of
      enzymes releases substances which cause cancer; therefore,
      PTKs has always been a subject of study and has been used as
      a target for development of anti-cancer drugs for a long time.
      The entire goal is to produce chemical compounds that stop the
      production of these toxic substances by the enzyme PTKs. The
      plaintiff also acknowledges this fact in their patent specification.
</p><p id="p_62">(b) In this regard, amino-1,3-thiazole derivatives are known in the art
      for a very long period. Such compounds primarily comprise a
      thiazole as the basic nucleus. It is also known that such thiazole
      based compounds can be used and are capable of inhibiting
      tyrosine and stopping it from producing substances that cause
      cancer. The defendants has quoted three examples of EP
      0412404, US 5,668,161 and WO 98/28282 to show that thiazole
      derivative compounds are known as useful for the treatment of
      the cancer.

Markush formula discloses several hundred compounds, some of
which bear a structure similar to Dasatinib which is claimed in the suit

obvious. It is submitted that the prior art compounds are derived from
Markush and thus there exists a motivation to make Dasatinib: All the
prior art cited by defendant disclose various compounds useful for
treatment of various diseases including cancer. The prior art cited are
broadly worded and include compounds for treatment of cancer.
Plaintiff suit patent is also drawn to multitudes of compounds for
treatment of various diseases including cancer.     Markush formula is
a short hand for representing various compounds in a precise
manner. Markush formula can otherwise be written as individual
compounds and in such a case, each of the compounds disclosed
should be read as individual disclosure of each compound i.e.
individual disclosure of each of the compounds. Hence each
compound would act as prior art and make the claims of the suit
patent obvious. In such an event, as per the defendant, the suit
patent is obvious to the person skilled in art on account of the
depiction of the similarly looking structure in the earlier patents or in
Markush formula as well as the knowledge of the thiazole compounds
yielding to treatment of the cancer.

</p><p id="p_74">40.       I have gone through the submission advanced by the learned
counsel for the defendants and have also perused the patents
documents EP'404 filed on 31st July, 1990, US'161 filed on 9th July,
1996 and also perused the explanation provided by the defendant's
expert in his affidavit in relation WO 98/28282. It is indeed correct
that the three patents filed in different years disclose the existence of
the Thiazole derivates which are yielding results and/ or connecting
thiazole derivatives in inhibiting PTK to release toxic substances, also
in some references talks about tumors etc. I find that the said


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 30 of 86</span>
 information is a part of the common knowledge and for which one
need not cite any prior patents like the ones cited by the defendants.
It is on the contrary a precursor to the plaintiffs patent itself wherein in
the introductory part of the specification, the plaintiffs acknowledges
the said position. Therefore, the existence of the information that
Thiazole compounds having a role to play in curing tumors and
cancer is, I think a bare minimum information for any person skilled in
the art to arrive at the plaintiff's patent. This is my prima facie
observation by merely having a glance to the patents cited by the
defendants to lay the challenge as to obviousness. This is due to the
reason that the defendant while citing the said patents filed in Europe
and US acknowledges that the said patents were filed in the year
1990 and 1996 using thiazole derivates compounds and also talking
at some places about their role to cure cancer and tumors amongst
other diseases. If the mere nexus of use of Thiazole Derivatives as
compound to inhibit PTK is assumed to be the sole ground to infer
obviousness, then it is defendants' own argument and saying that the
Thiazole derivates are known since the year 1950 and all these
patents using Thiazole derivates and their references towards
inhibiting PTK should lead to a presumptive kind of approach that the
subsequent patents granted in the years 1990 onwards are all
obvious to the person skilled in the art. I think such is not the case
and cannot be the case and the said submission ignores the principle
operating behind improvements in the patents. It is common in the
field of the medicines that the chemical compounds are pre-existing
and there are further improvements upon treatment and workings on


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                Page 31 of 86</span>
 the compounds so as to increase their efficacy by reacting with
chemical compounds and the group of the reactants. Therefore, the
commonality of the base compound like thaizole derivatives and its
characterstics may be one of the attending circumstance which can
act as a starting point to consider the plea of the obviousness but it
cannot be said that the said commonality is the sole basis which
yields to inference of the obviousness to the person skilled in the art.
Believing this submission of the defendants would raise questions/
concerns which are that if the compounds are so obvious then, why
did it take years together from 1990 to 1996 to arrive at the different
compounds of Thiazole derivatives as per the prior arts/ patents
quoted by the defendants and why these patents were then not
rejected on the ground of prior arts or obviousness if they are simply
on the face of it so obvious. Clearly, there is something else to it
besides the simple chain of events like commonality of the thiazole
derivates and its nexus with curing cancer by inhibiting PTK. The said
something else is the process of reactants and the role of other group
of reactants and the relevant processes in the patents. Therefore, I
prima facie do find myself to be convinced with this simplicitor theory
of the presence of Thiazole derivatives leading to obviousness to the
person skilled in art which is otherwise easy to understand but
miserably ignores the pragmatic approach that the major medicinal
patents are chemical compounds which are in the nature of the
improvements in the existing state of the art and having higher
efficacy than what was present decades ago. Thus, commonality of
few integers would not alter the position unless the cause and effect


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                            Page 32 of 86</span>
 relation between all the integers are present and indicating towards
arriving at the subject invention in the suit patent which is missing in
the present case.
</p><p id="p_75">41.    In this context, I had an occasion to examine the obviousness
plea in the case of <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_17">Hoffman La Roche v. Cipla Ltd</a>. (supra), wherein
I took the similar view while deciding the case finally and rejected the
plea of obviousness due to the failure of the defendant to prove the
connecting factors leading to invention or making it obvious. The
relevant discussion is reproduced below:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_30">      "The said submissions are neither present in the written-
      statement nor in the counter claim nor same are deposed
      in the affidavit of DW1, 2 and 3 towards establishment of
      the fact that the said working on the compounds is arbitrary
      and based on trial and error. I find that the said
      submissions cannot be believed in the abstract in the
      absence of the any positive evidence coming from the
      defendant's end showing some tenability of the same
      clinically as to how the said invention could be arrived at on
      trial and error method or selection is arbitrary. This could
      have been done by the defendant by going step by step.
      Firstly to show the example from the known compound,
      which the defendant has done, secondly to show as to how
      the said selection is not far removed not merely by relying
      upon the structural similarity or generally saying that the
      ethynyl or methyl could reap the similar results but by
      clinically showing what is the effect of the said working of
      ethynyl at the several positions and how it is not far
      removed from EP'226 and lastly by showing that the entire
      selection is arbitrary. All this could have been done by the
      defendant in the affidavit by showing positive evidence.
      Failure on the part of the defendant to establish the bare
      minimum material facts would thus lead to inference as to
      non obviousness.

<blockquote id="blockquote_31">       84. In the absence of the positive evidence from defendant
      to the effect that the selection of the range is arbitrary by
      non application of mind which CS(OS) No. 89/2008 Page
      No.85 of 275 is crucial factor in discerning whether the said
      impugned patent is obvious or not, It cannot be assumed
      on a priori basis that the mere fact that there exist some
      similarities in the structure of ranges, the replacement of
      the third position with ethynyl may follow and thus the said

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">      I find that if the evidence to show the selection is arbitrary
      is not present on record and even it is established on the
      record that there is a sort of inspiration taken from EP'226,
      the existence of the said fact, by itself does not denote
      obviousness. This is due to the reason that it is seen in the
      deposition of the PW-3 Nick Thatcher and in the other
      pleadings also stating that there were certain defects in the
      medicine GEFTINIB and for the said reason the said
      medicine was not able to cure the patients properly and
      consequently was not recommended. Therefore, even if it
      is shown that the starting point of the invention is EP'226
      and there are changes made in the chemical structures
      cited as example compounds in the said patent by reacting
      the same with ethynyl later on in relation to selected range,
      I do not find that such selection can be arbitrary, rather it
      can be inferred that there may be some further
      experimentations done in future on the Geftinib compounds

aware of the defects in the pre-existing medicine or compound and its
inability to cure the disease properly and therefore would select the
range from the point from where the last research ended. Therefore,
there is no harm so far as taking the compounds from the previous
state of the art is concerned unless it is further backed by the
evidence that the said selection and the working thereupon is not far
removed from the known range, further that the said selection and
the working is arbitrary in nature. On the other hand, it indicates that
inventor was conscious about the existing state of art. Accordingly,
even if the range from EP'226 is selected by the plaintiffs to conduct
the further workings upon the same, unless shown contrary, it cannot
be said that the said selection to be an arbitrary one. (Emphasis

        From the reading of the above observations and coupled with
the discussion done above, I prima facie reject the plea of
obviousness on the two prong theory propounded by the defendant
which is that the endeavor of every inventor is to find out the
compound to inhibit PTK to produce the toxic substance to cause
cancer and the commonality of the thiazole derivates both of which
are of common knowledge and yet there are different kinds of the
improved inventions existing having these common factors. Likewise,
applying the dictum of the Roche (supra), the mere some similarity of
the structure would not lead to inference as to obviousness unless it
is shown that the said selection was arbitrary one without application
of mind and thereafter the working done was also inconsequential
result which leads to workshop result and not further new
improvement. Even if the defendant intend to show on prima facie
basis, some sort of the connectors must be shown to lend prima facie
credibility to such defence. Once, this point of obviousness is
discussed threadbare and rejected on these lack of connectors
towards obviousness, then the Court has now been equipped in
evaluating the tenability of the plea at this prima facie stage.
Therefore, if it lacks material facts, there is no option but to left this
plea open ended to be proven in trial without finding force in the
same.

       Thus structures of all the exhibited prior art compounds are not
similar. Furthermore, none is an analogous prior art. All the cited
patents disclose compounds for treating are not for the same
ailments. Therefore, even the hypothetical structures given by BDR
fail to establish the ground of obviousness.

<p id="p_90">       In view of the above explanation, I would say that there are two
rival stands which are available so far as the similarity of the structure
of formula of the compounds are concerned which are that as per
plaintiffs there are differences of the formula present in the suit patent
with that of the prior patents whereas, the defendants continue to
maintain that the examples quoted in the EP 414, WO 098 and US'
161 are same. There is an expert report filed by the defendants in
this respect. However, I would not venture into the exercise of the
appreciation of the evidence lead by the expert at this prima facie
stage when the plaintiff is yet to lead its own expert evidence and the
parties are also yet to cross examine the experts in order to find out
the truth during the process of trial. Suffice it is to say, that in view of
the differences explained by Mr. Anand, learned counsel for the
plaintiff, there are two rival stands available on record and the
defendant's position that the similarity of the structure exists between
the prior patents and that of the one claimed in claim no. 1 and claim
no. 7 of the suit patent cannot be readily inferred and neither they are


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                Page 40 of 86</span>
 so obvious to believe the stand of the plaintiffs or to brush aside the
same at the threshold. Rather, the plaintiffs pointed the differences
also need examination as to whether these are workshop
substitutions or there lies innovation in the said substitutions of the
positions of the chemicals. Therefore, I prima facie consider this
aspect of the similarity of the structures of the formula as a disputed
question of the fact and do not find the challenge on this count as
credible enough to doubt the validity of the patent at this stage on the
premise of the similarity of the structure of the formulae in the manner
contended by the defendants. It has been thrashed out in trial as to
what extent the formulae/ structure of the compounds stated to be
similar as examples are same/ similar to the suit patent Markush
claim. The plea of the obviousness raised by the defendants on this
ground is thus rejected. Likewise, the judgment of Biswanath
Prasad (supra), Gleverdale (supra), 3M (supra) and others relied on
by the defendants are factually distinguishable as in those cases the
common integers leads to arriving at the inventions were present in
order to infer obviousness in the form of attendant circumstances
which are missing in the present case for prima facie purposes.

discloses no utility and is void/invalid and fails for lack of utility. It is

is resistant to treatment by Imatinib.       The patentee has failed to

knew that all the compounds would be useful against Chronic

on the ground that the invention as claimed is not useful.
</p>
<p id="p_94">45.    It is argued on behalf of the defendants that in the present
cases, a plain reading of the suit patent reveals that it simply provides
a list of billions of compounds and leaves the "utility" or "evidence of
usefulness" to the imagination of a person skilled in the art. There is
not a single sentence or whisper as to how the billions of compounds
claimed in claim 1 or other claims are useful for treatment of blood
cancer or leukaemia. The mode and use of the compounds for
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia is conspicuously missing. In the present
case there is no evidence of BCR-ABL inhibition and utility qua CML.
The plaintiffs have only made the statement that the compounds are
useful for treatment of various diseases including cancer is a self-
declaration by the plaintiffs without any evidence; even for the 580
compounds, which are shown in experiments, there is not an iota of
data to show whether all of these compounds or even one of these

 compounds is useful for treatment of all the diseases under the head
"utility".
</p>
<p id="p_95">46.    It is argued by the defendants that the patentee never knew on
15th April, 1999 i.e. on the priority date of suit patent that the
compounds had activity qua CML or were useful against Imatinib
which is of resistant cancer as Imatinib was approved by USFDA and
launched by Novartis in November 2001. It is therefore inconceivable
that in 1999, plaintiffs knew that Imatinib would be approved for
treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia and patients would develop
resistance and plaintiffs' compound would be used to treat such
resistance in patients - it is for this reason that there is no evidence
of utility tests in their patent. The plaintiff's sequel patent for use of
Dasatinib against CML and Imatinib resistant cancer was not filed in
India as the plaintiffs having realised that their suit patent does not
cover "treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia or Imatinib resistant
cancer" and filed a "sequel-patent" in US i.e. US 7125875 which was
not been filed in India. This patent covers case of the compounds of
suit patent for treatment of CML and Imatinib resistant cancer only.
</p>
<p id="p_96">47.    There is also no evidence in the specification for a person
skilled in the art to determine which compound is most effective as
compared to other compounds. Therefore, a person skilled in the art
would have to perform unduly large number of experiments to
ascertain which compound is useful for which disease condition.
There is no evidence as to which compound is superior - hence,
patent is a merely library of compounds, insufficient and vague.

<p id="p_97"> 48.    It is argued that validity of suit patent is wholly in doubt and
under cloud, especially in the light of challenge raised by defendants.
It is settled law that grant of patent does not guarantee its validity and
there cannot be any presumption in favour of validity of the patent
and when validity of Patent is yet to be tested, and credible challenge
is made out, no injunction can be granted.
</p>
<p id="p_98">49.    From the mere reading of the aforementioned submissions of
the defendants on the aspect of the lack of utility, it can be said that
the defendants continue to insist that in order to qualify the test of the
utility, the plaintiffs ought to have disclosed numerous aspects as
narrated by the defendants above and the same are missing in the
patent. The counsel for the defendants also contend that the suit
patent contains several compounds which are claimed but does not
provide how these compounds can be used to cure the blood cancer
or leukaemia. It is further stated that the mode and use of the
compounds for chronic myeloid leukaemia is missing. It is further
argued that the details as to in vitro or in vivo studies on inhibition of
BCR- ABL. Likewise, it is also stated that the utility is assumingly
claimed only for treatment of the cancer caused by particular family of
tyrosine kinase which SRC family and not by the BCR - ABL family
which normally causes Blood cancer or leukaemia.

in order to contend that the plaintiffs suit patent lacks utility. Further, it
is argued that the plaintiffs deliberately did not provide the statement

CML as well. In this context, it has been argued that the plaintiffs
also filed sequel patent to cure CML in US but not in India bearing no.
US' 7125875. The defendants also relied upon several judgments in
this respect which proceed to hold that the patent should describe the
practical way of the exploiting it in atleast one field of the industrial
activity and it should not be vague and speculative etc.

</p><p id="p_100">51.    Per contra, Mr. Anand learned counsel for the plaintiff refuted
the challenge laid by the defendants on the ground that the patent
lacks utility by making following submissions:
</p>
<p id="p_101">a.     The patent specification has extensively discussed the
       utility/industrial application of the compounds of IN 203937 as
       being Protein Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and their use in the
       treatment of cancer. The International Authorities have also
       recognized the claims of the patent to possess industrial
       application. The Indian Patent Office during examination of the
       suit patent recognized the industrial applicability of the IN
       203937. It is undisputed fact that the commercial product has
       been developed from IN 203937 endorses that the compound,
       Dasatinib has utility and industrial applicability, otherwise why
       the defendants have sought a voluntary and compulsory license
       for IN 203937 from time to time even rejected of the prayer of
       the compulsory licence.

      1969 Bom 255] has held:
</p><p id="p_103">         "17. ...The first question that arises in regard to the
         subject of the utility of the plaintiffs' patent is what is the
         quantum of utility required to support a patent. Reference
         may be made in that connection to the statement in
         Patents for Inventions by T. A. Blanco White (the learned
         Counsel appearing for the plaintiffs in the present case),
         3rd edn., at pp. 152-153 to the effect that in the absence
         of any promise in the specification that a definite degree
         of advantage would result from the use of the
         invention, the amount of utility required to support a
         patent is very small. It is further stated in the said
         passage that it is, in particular, not necessary that the
         invention as described should be commercially
         useful, unless the specification promises that it would
         be, and that it is sufficient that that invention should, by
         reason of the features that distinguish it from earlier
         proposals, be of some use to the public...
</p><p id="p_104">         ...
</p>
<p id="p_105">         20. As stated by Halsbury (3rd Edn.) Vol. 29 p. 59 Para.
         123, "not useful" in patent law means that the
         invention will not work, either in the sense that it will
         not operate at all or more broadly, that it will not do
         what the specification promises that it will do. If the
         invention will give the result promised at all, the
         objection on the ground of want of utility must fail. It
         is further stated in the said passage that the practical
         usefulness or commercial utility of the invention
         does not matter, nor does it matter whether the
         invention is of any real benefit to the public, or
         particularly suitable for the purposes suggested, and
         that it is only failure to produce the results promised
         that will invalidate the patent, not misstatements as


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                  Page 46 of 86</span>
          to the purposes to which such results might be
         applied. In Terrell on the Law of Patents, (11th Edn.) p.
         98 para 248, quoting from an English case, it is stated
         that if the patentee claims protection for a process for
         producing a result and that result cannot be produced by
         the process, the consideration fails. It is further stated
         there that objections to patents on such grounds are
         sometimes treated as objections for want of utility, and
         when so treated, the well known rule is that the utility of
         an invention depends upon whether, by following the
         directions of the patentee, the result which the patentee
         professed to produce can in fact be produced. Quoting
         from another English case, the same proposition is
         stated in another way in Terrell at p. 99, viz. that the
         protection is purchased by the promise of results, and
         that it does not, and ought not, to survive "the proved
         failure" of the promise to produce the results. As already
         stated above, the only result which the specification (Ex.
         A) in the present case professed to produce was a new
         class of chemical compounds having hitherto
         unsuspected blood sugar lowering property, but without
         the undesirable side effects of the previously known
         sulphonamides. As also stated above, the defendants
         have not been able to prove that a single compound
         falling within the patent does not possess blood sugar
         lowering properties to a greater or lesser degree. The
         position, therefore, is that not only is there no "proved
         failure" to produce the results promised by the plaintiffs'
         patent specification (Ex. A), but there is a "proved failure"
         on the part of the defendants to show that compounds
         falling within the patent do not have the blood sugar
         lowering properties promised by that patent. I, therefore,
         hold that the objection on the ground of want of utility
         must fail, and with it also the objection that the methods
         of manufacture are old and known methods and,
         therefore, there is no inventive step as far as the
         plaintiffs' patent No. 58716 is concerned. In the result, all
         the grounds on which the validity of the plaintiffs' patent

         explained above, it is concluded that prima facie there is
         a concrete basis for recognizing that the contribution of
         the suit patent could lead to practical application in the
         industry. As long as Sitagliptin is recognized to have a
         therapeutic effect in humans, it is practically applicable,
         even if it is not commercially successful due to an

the parties, it can be said that it is the case of the defendants that the
plaintiffs have not sufficiently disclosed the working of the each and
every compound contained in the suit patent and there exists a
vagueness in the disclosed process/ working of the patent which
does not allow the person skilled in art to arrive at the compounds
contained in the patent. On the contrary, the plaintiffs counter the
said plea by negating the position taken by the defendants and by
stating that the minimum level of the utility required to be disclosed
and the same is present sufficiently in the suit patent. I find that the
argument of the sufficiency and inadequacy of the utility raised by the

 defendants not potent enough to raise any doubts as to the validity of
the patent at this prima facie stage. Again, this is a bald defense
raised by the defendants at their own whims and understanding of
the invention in the suit-patent and its utility. The points which the
defendants insist must be present in the suit patent or required to be
appropriately described further require an in depth enquiry in to
several questions to be examined from various perspective and few
of them can be posited as under :
</p>
<p id="p_111">     What is the extent of the disclosure so far as the working/
      operation of the compounds as claimed in the suit patent is
      concerned?
</p><p id="p_112">     Whether such operation of the compound is in consonance
      with the promises made by the specification or not?
     Whether the workings of the few of the compounds are
      present in the suit patents as against others or not?
     Whether the absence of the workings of the few compounds
      in the suit patents would effect the disclosure of the utility
      relating others which are most relevant and closely
      connected with the claims or not?
</p><p id="p_113">     Whether such absence of the workings or manner to arrive at
      the few compounds depicted in the suit patent would be fatal
      to the entire patent when such compounds are merely
      forming part of the larger whole?
</p>
<p id="p_114">53. Till the time answers to these concerns/question emerging
immediately after hearing the submissions of the parties on lack of

 the utility are conclusively determined/ ascertained by appreciation of
facts and in depth analysis of the patent specification, no prima facie
opinion to the challenge as to lack of utility of the patent can be
formed merely upon the insistence of the defendants that certain
elements ought to have been present in the suit patent and the same
are missing. Suffice it is to say that there is a statement of the utility
contained in the patent specification and the same has to be read
along side the other paragraphs of the specification meaningfully in
order to analyze the disclosure of the working of the compound,
which is claimed in the suit patent. Prima facie, such disclosure has
to be considered for the purposes of considering the plea of the
utility. Now, if the defendants' questions the utility on certain facts and
insisting that those set of facts must find place in the specification
and the plaintiffs dispute the said position by contending to the
contrary, the same is again the question which cannot be determined
at this stage. Neither, the said question of lack of utility is such which
is so clinching enough to immediately arrive at the view that the
patent lacks utility. This obviously requires an indepth enquiry into
further facts, the elaboration of which is necessary in advance stage
of the proceedings. Therefore, I do not find that the plea of lack of
utility such which raises a credible challenge as to the validity of the
patent warranting the modification of the interim order already
granted on the said ground.

<p id="p_115">54. It is noteworthy to mention here that the challenges which can
be raised under the provisions of the Section 64 of the Patents Act



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                               Page 50 of 86</span>
 1970 (as amended in the year 2005) are in the nature of the
questions dependent on facts or the mixed question of facts and
laws. Where in the case after applying the facts in the form of
challenge and legal position, it can be prima facie readily inferred that
the good ground for the challenge is made out which raises a credible
challenge to the validity of the patent, then such inference can be
drawn prima facie to state that the credible challenge to the validity is
raised. As against the same, there are certain questions within the
challenges which requires the enquiry into more facts or complicated
questions on which no opinion by the preference one set of facts over
the other can be formed at the prima facie stage till the time those
facts are ascertained in the trial as they are disputed question of the
facts. Those are merely the defences raised by the defendants
though not credible enough to raise prima facie doubts as to validity.
Those questions can be deferred to trial for further enquiry into facts
as against straightaway presuming that they raise prima facie
challenge to the validity when they actually do not. I find that the
challenge as to utility is such which cannot be by mere asking of the
defendants be assumed to be raising a doubt as to the validity of the
patent till the time answers to relevant concerns/questions are
provided during the trial. Therefore, I prima facie do not find the plea
of the lack of utility as convincing to raise any credible
challenge to the validity of the suit patent though it may be a defence,
which is yet to be substantiated with more facts during the course of
the trial.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_52">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 52 of 86</span>
 which differ in respective compounds from each other atleast for
prima facie purposes.
</p>
<p id="p_119">57.    Even assuming that <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_27">Section 3</a> (d) of the Act is peculiar to Indian
law and the observations of mine on obviousness would only be
relevant for the said head and <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_28">Section 3</a> (d) is distinct from the aspect
of obviousness, the question still remains that if the suit compound is
a mere derivative of known elements/ integers, then why the suit
patent and claimed compound is so successful in curing the cancer
and leukaemia. Further, the connected question still remains
unanswered which is that if the suit compounds lacks efficacy in
curing the cancer, then why the defendants are proposing to launch
the product if it is lacking efficacy. Certainly, it requires a fact finding
in the trial. But one cannot adopt the presumptive kind of approach by
mere saying of the defendants that the patent lacks efficacy.
Therefore, even assuming for the sake that the defendants plea that
the suit patent compound is a derivate of the known compound, still
<a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_29">Section 3</a> (d) cannot be pressed in to service till the time the
compound involved in the patent is efficacious. It is true that the
plaintiffs have not proved this position by way in vitro or in vivo tests
to show the efficacy, but that is the stage of the evidence to show and
prove that the product is indeed efficacious in nature. At this prima
facie stage, the wholistic reading of the plaints along side the written
statement and the attendant circumstances where in the defendants
are also equally inclined to launch this product itself shows that the
efficacy is involved in the product in treating the ailment including



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                Page 53 of 86</span>
 cancer for prima facie purposes though more elaborate proof of
efficacy shall be ascertained in the trial. Therefore, the objection
under <a href="/doc/874310/" id="a_30">Section 3</a> (d) of the Act raised by the defendants is also
rejected.
</p><p id="p_120">Non Compliance of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_31">Section 8</a>

</p><p id="p_121">58.    Learned counsel for the defendants has raised the objection
under <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_32">Section 8</a> of the Act in the written submissions by contending
that the suit patent violates the said provision by not disclosing the
following :
</p>
<p id="p_122">Non-Compliance of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_33">Section 8</a> - Revocation Under <a href="/doc/1499217/" id="a_34">Section 64(1)(N)</a> :
</p>
<p id="p_123">    It is submitted that as per <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_35">Hoffman-La-Roche vs. Cipla</a>, the
       plaintiff is required to disclose to the Controller any patent
       application which is pending in any country outside India in
       respect of the same or similar application.
</p>
<p id="p_124">    In the present case, the plaintiff filed further application for
       Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia in US and Europe, which
       application is drawn from the present suit patent. However, this
       is not disclosed to the Patent Office under Form-3 i.e. filing of
       US 7,125,875 and EP 1610780 not disclosed to Patent Office,
       same is not refuted by plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_125">    The European Patent No.1610780 stands revoked which is not
       refuted by plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_126">    The Chinese Patent which is corresponding to the suit patent
       stands withdrawn.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                            Page 54 of 86</span>
<p id="p_127">     However, these are not disclosed to the Patent Office and not
       disputed by plaintiff.
</p>
<p id="p_128">    In view of the above, there is substantial non-compliance of
       <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_36">Section 8</a> and on this ground, the suit patent is liable to be
       revoked.
</p>
<p id="p_129">       I have gone through the objection taken by the defendants as
to non compliance of the provisions of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_37">Section 8</a> of the Act. Although,
the said plea raised by the defendants is not argued at the time of
hearing. Still, I am inclined to deal with it. The provisions of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_38">Section 8</a>
are already discussed at great length by the courts as such wherein
the Court may or may not revoke the patent depending upon the
nature of the information not supplied to the controller, relevance of
the information and the conduct of the patentee etc. This objection
under <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_39">Section 8</a> has been discussed in the counter claim as well as in
the written submission which was not argued by the counsel orally
before the Court nor the relevance of such patents was brought to the
notice of the Court as to how the said patents could have effected or
impacted the validity of the suit patent. The mere stray references in
the written submissions by enlisting the number of the patents in an
itemised manner do not imply that there exists a violation of the
provisions of <a href="/doc/879773/" id="a_40">Section 8</a> of the Act which otherwise lies in the
discretion of the Court to accept such challenge or not in the end.
Therefore, for prima facie purposes, the said objection of the
defendant is also without any substance and is not considered to be
vital enough to doubt the validity of the patent. There is no positive


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                              Page 55 of 86</span>
 details produced by the defendants by raising such plea. The said
objection is afterthought.        It was not raised in the first written
statement specifically.
</p>
<p id="p_130">Insufficiency

       Likewise, in the same manner, the defendants counsel has also
enlisted the objections as to insufficiency of the patent in the written
submissions though no elaborate submissions were canvassed
across the bar to explain them. The same are:
</p>
<p id="p_131">     It is submitted that the claims of the suit patent are very broad
      and include thousands of compounds, if not millions.
</p>
<p id="p_132">     The plaintiff has provided examples for preparation of around
      500 compounds;
</p>
<p id="p_133">     Undue experimentation required to test utility - hence patent
      invalid for lack of sufficiency : There is nothing in the
      specification to demonstrate whether all these compounds are
      useful against all the diseases mentioned under the Section
      "Utility" or whether some of the compounds are useful or not.
      There is also no evidence in the specification for a person skilled
      in the art to determine which compound is most effective as
      compared to other compounds. Therefore, a person skilled in the
      art would have to perform unduly large number of experiments to
      ascertain which compound is useful for which disease condition.
</p>
<p id="p_134">     No evidence as to which compound is superior - hence, patent
      is a merely library of compounds, insufficient and vague : The


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                              Page 56 of 86</span>
       Markush clams is drawn to millions of compounds, if not billions.
      Any person skilled in the art would require more than a life time
      to actually prepare these compounds.          Therefore, these are
      theoretical compounds for which patent has been granted to the
      plaintiff.   Therefore, on this ground alone, the suit patent is
      insufficient, vague and liable to be revoked.
</p>
<p id="p_135">     In view of the above, the claims are overly broad, vague and
      ambiguous rendering the entire patent void for such vagueness.
</p>
<p id="p_136">       From the reading of the said objections as to insufficiency of
the patent, it can be said that the said objections are also the kinds of
the infirmities pointed out by the defendants. The said objections are
akin to the head of the utility as discussed above and raises the
several kinds of the concerns and questions, the answers to which
are required to be provided in the trial. The defendants are
themselves not sure while informing the court as to whether the
patent covers thousand compounds or millions as they take different
stands at different places and use these terms loosely. If the
objections of the defendants are not well founded or not properly laid
before the court, the defendants cannot expect the Court to rule on
such objections and the Court is left with no option but to reject them
as such. In case any such objection exists, the defendants are at
liberty to prove it at the time of the trial and final arguments.
</p>
<p id="p_137">Seeking Voluntary licence no bar to challenging the validity

       On behalf of the defendants, it is argued that it is a settled
position of law that once a patent is granted, any person in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                Page 57 of 86</span>
 market may seek voluntary licence. Making a request for voluntary
license is a bonafide act in everyday's business and such request for
license is without prejudice and not an admission of the validity of the
patent. In the present case, the communications regarding voluntary
license were "without prejudice" meaning thereby that they were
without prejudice to the rights and remedies that may be available to
the defendant but the plaintiff was not willing to grant any license and
therefore, the discussions did not succeed.
</p>
<p id="p_138">59.    It is argued by the defendants that the filing of compulsory
license application or rejection thereof, was on the ground that
appropriate efforts for obtaining voluntary license was not made and
hence, the application for compulsory license was rejected. The
plaintiff was never willing to grant license and only kept asking for
unwanted information and derailed and frustrated the negotiation
process. As a result the application of the defendants came to be
rejected "for lack of efforts" The application was not rejected on
merits. Hence, this factor cannot be held against the defendants. The
plaintiffs cannot be allowed to take advantage of his own wrong.
</p>
<p id="p_139">60.    I have gone through the submissions raised by the defendants
that seeking of the license is no bar to challenge the validity of the
patent. Once, I am deciding on the objections on the validity of the
patent by returning the prima facie opinion on the same, the said
question of seeking a license is no bar to challenge the validity is
purely academic in that sense. Therefore, I do not consider




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                            Page 58 of 86</span>
 necessary to venture into such exercise when the said question is of
less relevance in the facts of the present case.
</p>
<p id="p_140">Suppression of Material facts

</p><p id="p_141">61.    It is submitted by the defendants that the plaintiffs have not
disclosed European Patent for Dasatinib for treatment of Chronic
Myeloid Leukaemia revoked in February 2013, much prior to the filing
of the suit. In the said patent, the use of Dasatinib for treatment of
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia was claimed but such claim was
rejected.
</p>
<p id="p_142">62.    It is further argued that the plaintiff has not disclosed that the
plaintiff's product in the market is a monohydrate. A separate
application No.4309/DELNP/2009 claiming such monohydrate was
filed. The same fact was not disclosed in CS (OS) No.679 of 2009.
The withdrawal of the Chinese patent was suppressed and not
disclosed to this Court. In view of such suppression, plaintiff is not
entitled to any injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_143">63.    I have gone through these objections raised by the defendants
on the concealments taken by the defendants and prima facie found
no merit in any of them. This is due to the reason that the so far as
the revocation of the European patent is concerned, it is to be seen
what relevance the European patent would have on the Indian patent.
The patent law is always territorial in nature and the rejection,
acceptance of the patent depends on several factors which depends
on case to case basis. The defendants while raising these objections
that the plaintiffs European patent has been revoked and Chinese


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_59">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 59 of 86</span>
 patent has been withdrawn have not pointed out as to what bearing
these patents would have to the facts of the present case and how
the same could have the right and entitlement to the injunction of the
plaintiffs. Simply by raising the plea that there are patents which has
been revoked or withdrawn without discussing under what conditions
such happenings took place is totally out of place. Therefore, I do not
really find the said objections as concealments till the time it is shown
that the same are deliberate in nature and would otherwise if could
have shown or explained would be detrimental to the case of the
plaintiffs so far as the entitlement of the interim injunction is
concerned. Likewise, the plea that the product is monohydrate in
nature. Upon this fact being put to Mr. Anand, it has been
categorically stated that the salts of the compounds are covered
within the ambit of the claims of the patent which is as per claim no. 7
are covered. Monohydrate is one of the salts of the compound. In
such an event, the said alleged non disclosure as stated by the
defendants would also not disentitle the plaintiffs from the interim
injunction when the said product is prima facie appears to be covered
within the scope of the patent.
</p>
<p id="p_144">Non working of the patent

</p><p id="p_145">64.    It is submitted by the defendants that "working" as envisaged
under <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_41">Section 83</a> must be adequate so as to fulfil the requirement of
the public and not mere lipsake. A comparison of the import
data/sales in India (as in plaint), the working statement and the total
patient base would reveal that the supply of the product by the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 60 of 86</span>
 plaintiff in India is highly inadequate. There is a great demand for the
product Dasatinib in the Country and the same can only be fulfilled if
there are more than one source of supply of the product. Working of
a patent in case of medicines and pharmaceutical products must be
interpreted as "local manufacture" keeping in view the "Make in India"
slogan of the Government of India. Without local working, it is
submitted that technology transfer would never occur. Mere
importation and sale of product in India would completely go against
the principle of "Make in India" adopted by the Government of India.
It is submitted that Non-working Patentee is not entitled to any
equitable relief such as injunction, the following decisions are
referred :
</p>
<p id="p_146">i)    <a href="/doc/254672/" id="a_42">Franz Xaver Huemer v. New Yash Engineers</a>, AIR 1997
      Del 79, paras 16 - 21, 22

</p><p id="p_147">ii)   <a href="/doc/47594754/" id="a_43">Sandeep Jaidka v. Mukesh Mittal &amp; Anr</a>. (supra)

       I have gone through the objection raised by the defendants
on working of the patent in India. I find that the said objection is
also without any substance in as much as it is the plaintiffs
position that the suit patent covers the salts of the compound
claimed therein and monohydrate product shall fall in the same
though the defendants states to the contrary. It is also known that
the plaintiffs have supplied the drugs of millions of rupees as
stated in the plaint in India as well. Thus, it really passes human
comprehension as to how this plea of the non working of the
Indian patent can be sustained at this stage when there is a


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                            Page 61 of 86</span>
 disputed question of fact which is yet to be determined as to
whether the suit patent covers the monohydrate version of the
compound or not. Prima facie on the fair reading of the
specification and the claim statement, it appears that the salts are
covered within the ambit of the suit patent. I find that the said
statement in the claims of the patent in this respect is enough for
the prima facie purposes to reject this plea of non-working of the
patent and rest is to be proved in trial. Lastly, so far as the non
fulfilment of demand and importation of the articles are concerned,
the aspects are more of a significance in the application seeking
compulsory licence as against in the infringement proceedings. I
have already discussed the difference between the scheme of the
Compulsory licensing, revocation on the ground of the non
working which is a distinct chapter providing independent grounds
than that of the infringement proceedings and defences available
as grounds of revocation which are altogether different from those
mentioned        in    the        compulsory   licensing.   Therefore,    the
considerations which are relevant for the compulsory licensing are
less of a significance in the defence to the infringement
proceedings. Thus, prima facie I do not find merit in the plea of the
defendants with respect to non working of the patent.
</p>
<p id="p_148">65.    ON THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC INTEREST
       It is stressed by the learned counsel for the defendants that the
product Dasatinib has now been recommended as first line treatment
for Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia therefore, all patients detected with



<span class="hidden_text" id="span_62">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                    Page 62 of 86</span>
 CML may be administered dasatinib 100 mg. People suffering from
Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia is more than 20,000 per year and the
patient base over the last 5 years may be more than 30-40,000
patients. Most CML patients are diagnosed at the chronic stage. A
perusal of the import data, the working statement and the total patient
base would show that there is a great demand for the product
dasatinib and over the last 5 years plaintiff's is able to fulfilment of
hardly 5% of the patient base. It shows that the product is not
available and beyond the reach of most of the population in the
country. The spread of the disease there is a compelling public
interest to make the drug available at reasonable cost, which is only
possible through generic competition. The price of plaintiff's product
and of defendants' proposed price are set out here below:</p><pre id="pre_7">
  Strength of tablet        Proposed   Cost   of   BDR Cost   of     Plaintiff's
                            product [per month]        product [per month]
  100 mg                    Rs.8,100                   Rs.1,67,000


</pre><p id="p_149">66.    The recommended dosage of the drug is 100 mg and average
cost of this therapy per month is about Rs.1,65,000/-. Even, if a drug
is, in fact, existing in the market but beyond the reach of the general
population, it would be deemed not 'available' to the public. While the
drugs Imatinib, Dasatinib and Nilotinib are used for treatment of CML,
only Dasatinib is a product that give a sustain long lasting relief to the
patient from CML. Imatinib as is known gives rise to resistance within
month and become useless thereafter. Nilotinib cannot be given to
patients with hyperglycaemia.
</p>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_63">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                    Page 63 of 86</span>
<p id="p_150"> 67.    It is submitted by Ms.Rajeshwari, learned counsel for the
defendants that the plaintiff's charity program of a drug being out of
reach of common man and even an existence of the charity program
itself is an admission that the price of the plaintiff's product is too high
and beyond the reach of a common man in India.               It is also an
admission that plaintiff is aware that their product is too expensive for
an average common man. Therefore, the public interest demands
that the injunction granted be vacated immediately.
</p><p id="p_151">68.    Per contra, Mr. Anand, learned counsel for the plaintiff
submitted on the public interests plea by making suitable response to
the submissions of the defendants in the following manner:
</p><p id="p_152">69.    As per the pleadings of the plaintiffs wherein it is stated that
ever since the launch of Dasatinib in India, the plaintiffs have
addressed the access and affordability needs of the patients by an
aggressive commercial Patient Access Program (PAP) through which
prices of the drug is reduced to a fraction of the MRP in order to
reduce the cost of drug to patients. BMS's Patient Access Program
(PAP) is publicized to all the oncologists of the Country through
regular advertisements in medical journals like India Journal of
Cancer. The PAP for Dasatinib is termed as the Sprycel Access
Programme as mentioned in the affidavit of Mr. Jitendra Tyagi dated
23rd April, 2015. The Sprycel Access Programme is made available
through a third party service provider for the self paying patients
prescribed Dasatinib by an Oncologist. It is alleged by the plaintiffs
that this programme is publicized to all the oncologists of the country
through       leave      behind   literature/brochure   as   well    regular


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_64">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                Page 64 of 86</span>
 advertisements in medical journals like India Journal of Cancer and
banners in oncology conferences. The details or the same are filed
along with list of documents dated 24th March, 2015. It is the case of
the plaintiffs that the service provider, through a centralized call
center, delivers the drug to the patients at the door step anywhere in
India with no additional delivery cost. In its current form, the effective
cost for a months' therapy for the Indian patient is as follows:
</p><pre id="pre_8">a.     20mg- Rs. 7529 for a month's treatment
b.     50mg - Rs. 15062 for a month's treatment
c.     70mg- Rs. 16110 for a month's treatment
</pre><p id="p_153">70.    It is stated that in order to avail this service a patient is only
required to provide the following documents as mentioned in the
affidavit of Mr.Jitendra Tyagi, dated 23rd April, 2015 where the details
of declaration is shown:
</p><p id="p_154">a.     A prescription for Dasatinib from an Oncologist.
b.     Any identification to establish the nationality of the patient as
       the program is available to only Indian nationals.
c.     Declaration to the effect that patient is a self paying or that the
       Patient's insurance would not cover the MRP of Dasatinib.
</p><p id="p_155">71.    The details have been produced whereby the plaintiffs have
received tremendous appreciation from both patients and doctors for
their Patient Access Program. The plaintiffs have given the
justification about the current MRP for a month's treatment with 50mg
of Dasatinib is Rs.1,65,680/-. The MRP of the drug reflects the
investments made by BMS in the R&amp;D; drug development; clinical
trials; pharmaco-vigilance and in addition to that, the MRP of the drug


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_65">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                              Page 65 of 86</span>
 cannot be reduced due to other factors inter alia efflux of parallel
exports to other jurisdictions including where governments provide
drug access to patients. The plaintiffs through their Sprycel Access
Programme have developed an effective mechanism to reduce the
price of the drug to 1/11th of the MRP for patients in India while
preserving the plaintiffs' right to recover investments in other
developed jurisdictions as alleged by them.        It is the case of the
plaintiffs that Dasatinib is not the only treatment option available to
patients suffering from CML. In order to ascertain the demand for
Dasatinib, the plaintiffs had sent RTI Queries to 12 top Government
Cancer Hospitals across various regions in India enquiring about the
treatment protocols in respect of CML. Responses were received
from 9 hospitals. The answers to the RTI Applications clearly show
that (a) in 95-100% cases Imatinib is the first line treatment; and (b)
In the event of failure with Imatinib, the alternatives (without any
preference) are (i) Dasatinib; (ii) Nilotinib; (iii) Stem Cell Therapy; and
</p><p id="p_156">(iii) Bone Marrow Transplant. The RTI responses along with a
summary of the same from the 9 Cancer Hospitals have been filed in
the present proceedings.          Assessing the demand of Dasatinib by
regularly filing RTI applications, conducting market surveys and
obtaining expert opinions, the plaintiffs are meeting such demands at
an affordable price. The opinion of an Oncologist in India Prof. Dr.
Purvish M. Parikh has been filed as Annexure D with the affidavit of
Mr. Jitendra Tyagi dated 23rd April 2015.
</p><p id="p_157">72.    The following are the main reasons given by the plaintiffs to
provide the drug to the patients in reasonable price:-
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_66">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                               Page 66 of 86</span>
<p id="p_158"> (i)   BMS, through its Patient Access Program, makes the product
      available at reasonable prices to non-reimbursed self paying
      patients. Through the program the product is available for a
      monthly price of approximately Rs.15,000/- as opposed to
      Rs.1,65,000/-. The PAP is transparent and easily accessible.
      The said scheme has been appreciated by doctors and
      patients.
</p><p id="p_159">(ii) CML itself is a very rare disorder and the first line treatment

       suffering from CML as filed as Annexure D of affidavit of Mr.
      Jitendra Tyagi dated 23rd April, 2015 which says as under:-
         "First line therapy" is the treatment regimen or
         regimens that are generally accepted by the medical
         establishment for initial treatment of a given type and
         stage of cancer. It is also called primary treatment or
         therapy. "Second-line therapies" are those tried when
         the first ones do not work adequately. The management
         of a cancer case requires regular evaluation of treatment
         to assess their success and adjust as needed."
</p><p id="p_162">73.    I have gone through the submission of the defendants on the
public interest requiring the vacation of the injunction. I would say that
after examining the material available on record, again there exist the
rival stands of the parties in form of the contra material available on
record that the plaintiffs are adequately able to meet the demands of
the public. No conclusive opinion or prima facie opinion in favour of
the either side can be formed by appreciating the said material. At
this stage, it could be said that the credibility of the plea of the
defendants is yet to be tested in view of the fact that defendants
being a proposed competitor of the plaintiffs and is in desperately
attempting to launch the product under the same compound and
whether such plea of the serving the public interest is genuine or not.
In this connection, I have done detailed analysis in the judgment of
<a href="/doc/68879740/" id="a_44">Novartis v. Cipla</a> (supra) decided on 15th January, 2015 herein I
have discussed this plea of public interest often taken by the
defendants who intend to do private business by manufacturing the
products under the patents and affecting the statutory rights of the
patentees. The scheme of the patent Act allows the examination of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_68">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                              Page 68 of 86</span>
 the plea of public interests towards allowance of the compulsory
licence under the distinct chapter of the compulsory licensing and
non working of the patent which is code in itself. The question of the
public interests for the purposes of the infringement proceedings in
the form of deciding the interim application has to be only seen from
the prima facie view of the credibility in the defence of the
defendants. I find that the plea of the defendants being non credible
in the present case and in case the defendants intend to have a
licence from the plaintiffs, the defendants need not inform the term of
2.7 % blanketly but should come out with concrete proposal which
should be discussed amongst the parties on the mutually agreed
terms or before the competent tribunal which is the compulsory
licensing tribunal as provided under the patents Act. This aspect has
been discussed by me in detail in Novartis case (supra) at great
length and is equally applicable to the facts of the present case.
Therefore, prima facie plea of the public interest or setting out the
terms of the royalty cannot be accepted at this stage. The defendants
are although free to approach the plaintiffs on any terms mutually
acceptable to the parties or before the compulsory licensing tribunal
in this respect.

<p id="p_163">Product not covered by the Patent claims

</p><p id="p_164">74.    Learned counsel for the defendants has raised the plea that the
product which the plaintiff No.1 is using is the monohydrate version of
the Dasatinib which is not covered by the suit patent and is the matter
of the separate application. It has been argued that once the product


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_69">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                           Page 69 of 86</span>
   is not covered by the patent, thus, the proposed launch of the product
  by the defendants would also not fall within the ambit of the suit
  patent

</p><p id="p_165">  75.        In response thereto, plaintiffs submit that the plaintiff No.1 has
  also filed applications including a divisional application for the
  crystalline monohydrate form of Dasatinib and their intermediates
  which are currently pending before the Patent Office. The chemical
  structure for Dasatinib Monohydrate is as follows:

<p id="p_166">                                                                   Monohydrate

  Active compound

</p><p id="p_167">  76.        The active ingredient/molecule of the commercial product is
  Dasatinib. It is the active ingredient which refers to the chemical that
  results in the therapeutic effect. It is Dasatinib that has a medical
  value in managing certain diseases and conditions. Monohydrate is
  merely a carrier that has no therapeutic value. The Division Bench of
  this Court in Merck v. Glenmark [FAO(OS) in 190/2013] observed
  that:

<blockquote id="blockquote_44">            "50. In this case, from known compounds, prima facie,
            the Sitagliptin free base is disclosed. As it is a free base, a
            pure form of an amine, as opposed to a salt form, this
            naturally does not include particular salts, whether
            phosphates, hydrochlorides or any other. The elements of
            the free base - since many alternatives exist - are then


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_70">  CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                                   Page 70 of 86</span>
       also detailed in the above table. Conspicuously - and this
      is not denied by Glenmark- the free base must be
      transformed into a salt form before it can be administrated
      to patients (with the salt acting as the carrier).
      Unsurprisingly the free base requires a further appropriate
      reaction to create that salt. The argument that at no point is
      the free base disclosed (and only salt forms, though still not
      the phosphate salt form, SPM) lacks prima facie
      substance. First, Scheme 6, read with the table above,
      discloses the free base, which is claimed in Claim 1, and
      specifically, Claim 19. In each of these specifications,
      Sitagliptin is found as a free base, without any attached
      salt. Two, the Court has to look to the invention in this
      case, and not read the claims literally. The invention in this
      case is a DPP inhibitor which assists control and
      prevention of diabetes by regulating insulin production, and
      specifically, inhibiting the DPP-IV enzyme activity. The
      claims and disclosures made, should be seen in the light of
      the invention underlying the patent and sought to be
      disclosed. In this case, the active therapeutic component is
      the Sitagliptin free base (which is delivered into the body
      with an attached salt that wears away once in the system),
      and not the attaching phosphate, Hcl or other carriers. No
      doubt such carrier salts are needed to deliver the drug into
      the body, and the salt must contain certain crucial
      properties that allow for the drug to be administrated
      properly (solubility, flow issues, propensity for adhesion,
      poor filtration, drying etc.) This is recognized in the
      statement of the inventor, Mr. Robert M. Wenslow FAO
      (OS) 190/2013 Page 39 Jr, as well in determining the best
      method for administration (on which Glenmark relies in its
      written submissions); but there too, the active therapeutic
      ingredient remains the Sitagliptin free base, and that
      product is sufficiently disclosed in Form 2 filed by MSD. It
      seems, that Sitagliptin free base's activity, prima facie, on
      the DPP enzyme is not naturally affected by the attached
      salt; those properties remain, though the efficacy of
      administration is dependent in part upon the carrier. The

       Sitagliptin free base, previously unknown as a compound
      that could affect the activity of the DPP enzyme is a new
      and arguably, a novel addition. It is in that context - and in
      the shoes of that notional addressee who is working in that
      field of pharmaceuticals - that the technical contribution
      has to be seen...

      compound, for example, a salt. It is contemplated that the
      active ingredient - which refers to the chemical that results
      in the therapeutic effect - will be combined with a carrier of
      some form. The essential focus of the specification
      therefore is the industrial application of the main
      therapeutic agent, or simply, the invention. There is also an
      implicit admission that while it is the active ingredient -
      Sitagliptin free base - that has a medical value in managing

      during the course of oral hearings that this is not the case
      since Zita uses SPM, which is manufactured directly
      without using the Sitagliptin free base. The Court is
      unimpressed with this submission - not only was no
      evidence or document adduced to support this plea, but
      moreover, the written submission and counter-claim do not
      in any meaningful manner disclose such a case. Indeed,
      Zita - by account of all documents canvassed before the
      Court - uses the Sitagliptin free base as the active
      component i.e. the DPP inhibitor. Glenmark's explanation
      that it uses a different process to produce the infringing

      results in the restoration of the position as it stood on the
      date of the passing of the order which has been quashed.
      The stay of operation of an order does not, however,
      lead to such a result. It only means that the order

<p id="p_172">81.    In any case, the sum and substance of the plea raised by the
defendants when they state that the plaintiff No.1 has filed another
patent for the monohydrate form of Dasatinib is that the monohydrate
form of the compound is not covered in the suit patent and the
product which is the reproduction of the monohydrate form of
DASATINIB would not be infringing the patent. On the contrary, Mr.
Anand states and urges that the said monohydrate form contains the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_74">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 74 of 86</span>
 essentially the same compounds with some treatment but not able to
explain the filing of the separate patent if it is essentially covered in
the first one as a broad based claim. This question of the scope and
ambit of the monohydrate version Dasatinib is relevant and
necessarily required to be adjudicated once the defendants point out
elaborately the differences claimed in the subsequent patent filed by
the plaintiffs as claims relating monohydrate form of DASATINIB and
relate it with the claims of the suit patent and how they are different
from each other and relate all these with alterations in the
consequential products and its working. At this stage, where the
defendants are yet to launch the product containing DASATINIB in
either form after obtaining the license to manufacture the same, the
question of distinction of monohydrate form or otherwise lends no
support to the plea of the defendants that there lies difference in the
nature of the products and their workings and they are not covered
with in the ambit of the suit patent. After all, it is the defendants who
are raising the plea that the suit patent does not cover the
monohydrate version of DASATINIB, therefore, in order to set up this
plea, the onus lies upon the defendants to explain the differences by
carving out the two patents filed by the plaintiffs and thereafter
relating with the products which are available in the market whether
of the defendants or other parties in either of the forms suggested by
the defendants. It is only then, the onus shall shift to the plaintiffs who
shall be called upon to explain the difference in the patents filed by
them, the respective forms and the difference in their workings. This
requires further fact finding and elaboration that of merely raising the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_75">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                               Page 75 of 86</span>
 plea. Without the existence of the product, a plea which has been
inadequately set up by the defendants purely on academic basis lying
a distinction between amorphous and monohydrate nature of
DASATINIB is merely a bald defence which is required to be
substantiated during the course of the trial. There exists a distinction
between the credible nature of the defence affecting the validity of the
patent vis-a-vis a bald defence of non infringing product to the claim
of infringement. The later form is not the question affecting the
validity of the patent and thus doubts of the invalidity in such a case
cannot be inferred on the suit patent. It is only to escape the charge
of the infringement, such a defence is raised. Therefore, the mere
fact that the defence as to non infringement is deferred to the trial for
further substantiation of facts does not warrant the variation of the
interim order till the time the defence raised by the defendants are
fully substantiated. At this prima facie stage, I find that in case the
defendants maintains the position is that the monohydrate version of
the DASATINIB product is not covered in the suit patent and the
defendants' product is monohydrate version of the DASATINIB which
is yet to be launched, then there was no occasion for the defendants
to contest the suit patent so vehemently or challenging its validity on
several scores though it is the statutory right of the defendants to
challenge the validity. On the contrary, the defendants are doing so
which means that there is some more facts which are to be brought
into light and the defendants are also unsure as to whether the suit
patent covers all forms of the DASATINIB or not. In such event, I
would refrain from upsetting the status quo in the form of ad interim


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_76">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 76 of 86</span>
 injunction which has already been operating merely on the ground
that the proposed product to be launched by the defendants which is
yet to the see the light of the day is the form of the DASATINIB drug
is not covered by the suit patent. If that is so, the status quo as on
date does not harm the defendants, but this Court would refrain from
commenting anything on the same till the facts are completely
brought into light during the voyage of the trial.
</p><p id="p_173">82.    In view of the above discussion, it is seen that the defences
raised by the defendants are prima facie not credible but vague or
bald which require more factual foundation. The patent No. IN
203937 is an old patent and has been on the register for 15 years. It
is settled law that in the case of old patents there is a kind of
presumption of validity in the form of the continuance and perpetuity
arises unless controverted with the strong evidence to the contrary.

      the subsequent application filed by the appellant IA
      6504/2000 alleging that the patents of the respondent had
      not been worked and since they were not being
      commercially exploited, no injunction could be granted in
      favor of the respondent. This plea is sought to be again
      forcefully contended before us by counsel for the appellant.
      The Division Bench judgment of this court in <a href="/doc/254672/" id="a_48">Franz Cavern
      Huemer v. New Yash Engineers</a> 1996 PTC (16) 232 has
      been considered by the learned Single Judge. There can
      be no doubt about the proposition that since the patents
      create a monopoly, they must be commercially exploited
      and the parties are not to only register a patent and sit tight
      over it. However, Mr. Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for
      the respondent sought to rely on the statement of working
      of patents filed in the year 1998-99 to contend that the
      patents are being exploited and thus the present case
      would not fall within the parameters laid down in Franz
      Xaver's case (supra) to categories the patents in the
      present case as one which are not commercially exploited
      and thus leading to a conclusion that public was being
      denied the benefit of such patents by its lack of user. The
      learned Single Judge accepting this contention concluded
      that he was not satisfied at this stage that the five patents
      are not being worked by the respondent in view of the

      once a violation is established in case of a registered

      not be permissible to contend that the said patentee is not

       entitled to an injunction. A monopoly of the patent is the
      reward of the inventor. It is also to be appreciated that law
      of the patent is slightly different from the law of copyright
      and trademark as the patent is granted only for a period of
      14 years. It is also relevant to note that in the agreement of
      technical services dated 28.11.94 there is no mandate for
      the appellant to provide technical information to the
      appellant in respect of the manufacture of any other items
      but the only requirement is that the same can be done if
      terms and conditions are agreed upon between the parties.
      If the respondent would have provided D2 range of
      products to the appellant it would have been entitled to
      royalty in terms of Clause 6.4 of the said agreement. It is
      thus difficult to believe, as stated above, that there could be
      a license to copy and that is a major factor which has
      weighed with us in deciding the present appeal. It may also
      be added that <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_49">Section 83</a> of the Patent Act, 1970 falls

      in view of <a href="/doc/1891720/" id="a_51">Section 83</a> read with <a href="/doc/1513349/" id="a_52">Section 90(d)</a> of the Patents
      Act, 1970 the patent has to be worked out in India by
      manufacture and not by import. Mr. Kathpalia sought to rely
      on the commentary of Terrel on the Law of Patent, 13th
      edition chapter X para 10.07, 10.09, 10.10, 10.13, 10.14
      and 10.17. Mr. Kathpalia submitted that same principles
      would apply in respect of the Indian law and thus in the
      absence of definition of commercial scale, natural and
      ordinary meaning should be given to the expression. He
      submitted that in terms of the said treaties the general
      principles set out are that a patentee must manufacture the

       product in that country and it should not also be mere
      improvements. We have, however, considered this aspect
      aforesaid and have come to the conclusion that there is no
      force in the submission of the appellant."
</blockquote><p id="p_177">Quia Timet Action
</p><p id="p_178">85.    As far as law with regard to Quia Timet Action is concerned, it
is settled law that such action is maintainable. If a party fears or
apprehends, who may obtain injunction to prevent some threatened
act being done which if done, would cause him substantial damage
and which money would not be an adequate or sufficient remedy. In
a quia timet action, in the absence of evidence if a strong case is
made out against the defendants, after valid justification, the interim
order may be passed by the Court. Reliance is placed on the
following decisions:-
</p><p id="p_179">i)     Kuldip Singh versus Subhash Chander Jain &amp; Ors., AIR
       2000 SC 1410

         "A qui timet action is a bill in equity. It is an action
         preventive in nature and a specie of precautionary justice
         intended to prevent apprehended wrong or anticipated
         mischief and not to undo a wrong or mischief when it has
         already been done. In such an action the Court, if
         convinced, may interfere by appointment of receiver or
         by directing security to be furnished or by issuing an
         injunction or any other remedial process " (Para 7)

</p><p id="p_180">ii)    <a href="/doc/1091683/" id="a_53">Rohtas Industries Limited v. IHP.Co.Ltd</a>., AIR 1954 PATNA
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_80">       492</span>

         "Even proof of an intention to infringe, apart from actual
         infringement, may justify an injunction to restrain the
         infringement provided it is established to the satisfaction
         of the court that the alleged infringer, dealing with what

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_81">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                              Page 80 of 86</span>
          he is doing as a matter of substance, is taking the
         invention claimed by the patent." (Para 16)

</p><p id="p_181">86.    Therefore, the suit for quia timet action is maintainable. No
further discussions are necessary on this issue.
</p><p id="p_182">87.    It was observed in the judgment of <a href="/doc/123231822/" id="a_54">Roche vs. Cipla</a> (supra)
cited by the defendants, that the plaintiffs failed to establish prima
facie case of infringement and on the contrary, defendant
successfully raised credible challenge to the validity of the patent and
the Courts have accepted the plea of the defendants in that case on
the basis of defence raised.      However, such circumstances are
missing in the present case.
</p><p id="p_183">88.    Prima facie, it appears that the plaintiffs have got the valid
patent and the defences raised by the defendants do not enable the
court to find out any apparent concerns which can doubt the validity
of the patent but are those which require more fact finding and
substantiation prior to arriving to any such contrary view. In such
event, the plaintiffs have a prima facie case of the valid patent and
the alleged apprehension of the infringement where the defendants
have already taken the preparatory steps towards the manufacturing
of the products by obtaining the license etc.

Irreparable Harm

</p><p id="p_184">89.    The defendants have not launched the product in the market,
no loss or irreparable harm will be caused to BDR if they are
restrained from doing activities that they have not yet commenced.
On the other hand, grave prejudice will be caused to the plaintiffs if


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_82">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                            Page 81 of 86</span>
 the defendants are allowed to manufacture and market generic
Dasatinib in which the patentee has the exclusive rights in IN 203937
under <a href="/doc/108658340/" id="a_55">Section 48(a)</a> of the Patents Act, 1970 especially at the time
when the defences raised by the defendants are prima facie less
credible and does not warrant any alteration of the already existing
status quo in the form of the interim injunction.
</p>
<p id="p_185">90.    There are cases pending against three other generic
companies which have been filed by the plaintiffs for the infringement
of IN 203937. Injunctions are operating in two matters.
</p>
<p id="p_186">91.    Even otherwise, where the Central Government is of the
opinion that a patent granted, which is exercised, is mischievous to
the State or generally prejudicial to the public after giving the notice
to the patentee, make a declaration under <a href="/doc/441313/" id="a_56">Section 66</a> of the Patents
Act, 1978 to the effect that the patent shall be deemed to be
removed. In the present case, no doubt, the defendants have taken
the plea of non-availability of product to all patents in India, as the
product in question is of first line product which is highly expensive
and the issue of public interest. The grounds which are available for
the person interested while seeking an application for the compulsory
licensing or revocation of the patent on the ground of non working of
the patent could be urged before the relevant authority which will
consider the matter and cannot be imported as a matter of defence to
the suit for infringement as the civil court hearing the suit for
infringement cannot transgress within the domain of the authority/
controller/Central Government which are distinct functionaries having


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_83">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                            Page 82 of 86</span>
 their powers and considerations specifically defined under the
specific provisions of the Act. Even under the World Trade
Organization Trip Agreement, Compulsory Licenses are recognized
in order to overcome barriers in accessing affordable medicines and
on other ground of non-workable of suit patent as per conditions
prescribed under <a href="/doc/471445/" id="a_57">Sections 83</a> and <a href="/doc/799603/" id="a_58">84</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_187">92.    Hence, if the patent is valid and the defendant has not been
able to establish prima-facie credible defence, the case of
infringement is made out.         Under the said circumstances, public
interest is an exception to the patent, otherwise the rights granted
under <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_59">Section 48</a> by the Sovereign towards monopoly would be
undermined. The plea of public interest may be invoked once the
Court would find that prima-facie the case of credible defence is
made out. In the present case, the defendants have not made any
representation to the Central Government by raising the plea of
public interest, expensive drug and fully non-availability of the drug in
question to the patients, nor has the Government exercised its
discretion under <a href="/doc/441313/" id="a_60">Section 66</a> of the Act.
</p>
<p id="p_188">93.    The ad-interim injunction has been operating against the
defendants since 4th December 2009. It is an admitted position that
the defendants have not yet launched the generic version of
Dasatinib commercially in the market. No application for vacation has
been filed by the defendants for the last more than five years. No
request was made by the defendants to the Court during this period
to know their interest or intent to launch the product. Proxy war in the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_84">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 83 of 86</span>
 Court at this stage cannot be permitted to allow. The conduct of the
parties is obviously paramount. Thus, the balance of convenience
tilts in favour of the plaintiffs otherwise.
</p>
<p id="p_189">94.    The object of the injunction in patent matters is to protect the
patentee against the injury by violation of right for which he could not
be adequately compensated in damages recoverable in the action if
ultimately a decree for damages is passed. There is no rule in the
patent matters that a plaintiff must make out a prima-facie case. No
doubt, the Court must be satisfied that the claim(s) is not frivolous or
vexatious. An interim injunction may be granted if the defendant has
applied for a compulsory licence but he infringes the patent. The
interim injunction may also be passed in respect of single claim which
is valid even though other claims in the specific actions are not prima
facie valid.
</p>
<p id="p_190">95.    The patent law in India is governed by <a href="/doc/1937976/" id="a_61">Patents Act</a>, 1970 as
amended in the year 2005. What constitutes infringement of a patent
is not denied in the Act. Thus, one has to gather the meaning of
infringement from the scope of the monopoly rights conferred on the
patentee for infringement is the violation of those rights. <a href="/doc/564101/" id="a_62">Section 48</a>
confers on the patentee, his agents and licensees the exclusive rights
to make, use, exercise or distribute invention in India. The rights of
the patentee are infringed if anyone makes and supplies or
commercially uses and the patentee may be granted interim order,
subject to the condition if the patent is valid. It is not incumbent upon




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_85">CS(OS) Nos.2303/2009 &amp; 679/2013                             Page 84 of 86</span>
 the plaintiff in case of infringement to show that the plaintiff has
suffered commercial loss.
</p>
<p id="p_191">96.     In the present case, as per the conduct of the defendants,
prima-facie no credible challenge has been made, rather they have
admitted infringement in their pleadings. The defendants in both the
matters are connected with others, hence it is immaterial if two
companies are different entity. Their main intent is to manufacture
and sell the product in question.
</p>
<p id="p_192">97.     In view of the above said reasons if defendants would be
allowed to commence the infringement in full knowledge of the
patentee invention, the plaintiffs would suffer injury and irreparable
harm.
</p><p id="p_193">98.     On the balance of convenience in a quia timet action the House
of Lords, in American Cyanamid Company v. Ethicon Limited
[1975 FSR (1) 101], held that:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_57">        "Where other factors appear to be evenly balanced it is a
        counsel of prudence to take such measures as are
        calculated to preserve the status quo. If the defendant is
        enjoined temporarily from doing something that he has
        not done before, the only effect of the interlocutory
        injunction in the event of his succeeding at the trial is to
        postpone the date at which he is able to embark upon a
        course of action which he has not previously found it
        necessary to undertake ; whereas to interrupt him in the
        conduct of an established enter- prise would cause much
        greater inconvenience to him since he would have to start
        again to establish it in the event of his succeeding at the
        trial."</blockquote>

<p id="p_194">        A similar approach has been taken by the Supreme Court in
India in the cases of <a href="/doc/330608/" id="a_63">Wander Ltd. &amp; Anr. V. Antox India P. Ltd</a>.

</p><p id="p_195">99.    For the aforesaid reasons and in view of the facts and
circumstances, the interim order passed on 4th December, 2009 in
CS(OS) No.2303 of 2009 shall continue during the trial and the same
shall also apply to the parties in CS(OS) No.679 of 2013.              The

liberty to move the fresh application for compulsory license with the
Controller of Patents or voluntary license with the plaintiffs as per law
as the defendants earlier application was rejected due to non
compliance but the liberty granted to the defendants does not
tantamount to allow or disallow such application(s) as the defendants
have to comply with the due process. Such petition(s)/application(s)
cannot be decided as per demand or as per defendants' whims and
fancy. The same has to be considered on merit and if so filed it
would be decided without any influence of the order passed in these
applications.      Even otherwise, the findings are tentative and shall
have no bearing when the suit would be finally decided by the Court
after recording the evidence.
