<p id="p_1">	Animadverting upon the method and manner in which the F.I.R in R.C.No.15
of 2009 has been registered by C.B.I, this petition is focussed to get it
quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_2">	2. Heard both sides.	
</p>
<p id="p_3">	3. Compendiously and concisely, the relevant facts absolutely necessary
and germane for the disposal of this petition would run thus:
</p><p id="p_4">	(i) Indubitably and indisputably, the petitioner/A.1 was working as
Recovery Officer in Madurai Debts Recovery Tribunal functioning under the
Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (hereinafter
referred to as R.D.B.F.Act,) and as against him, the C.B.I. registered the
F.I.R. in R.C.No.15 of 2009 and the relevant portion is extracted hereunder for
ready reference:
</p><p id="p_5">INFORMATION
	A reliable information has been received at the office of the
Superintendent of Police, CBI,ACB, Chennai alleging that the accused persons A-1
to A-4 and others entered into criminal conspiracy at Madurai during the period
from March to June 2008 to cheat the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Government of India
and Dhanalakshmi Bank, by under valuing the properties to be auctioned.
Consequently, A-1 by abusing his official position, auctioned the properties at
the lower rate than the market rate to A-3 to A-4 and thereby caused wrongful
loss to property owner as well as to the Dhanalakshmi Bank and corresponding
wrongful gain to themselves.
</p><p id="p_6">	The information revealed that the Debt Recovery Tribunal No.III, Mumbai in
O.A.No.2054/2000 vide Order dated 24.08.2004, had ordered to recover an amount
of Rs.19,03,118/- with simple interest @ 15% from Shri.M.R.Gopinathan, S/o
Shri.M.N.Ramalingam, E-17, Sarvodaya Estte, Chembur,Mumbai,by auctioning the
following three properties belonging to him, pledged with Dhanalakshmi Bank,
Mumbai, as he failed to repay the loan availed from the said Bank.
</p>
<p id="p_7">	(i)Land and building at Plot No.22 in Survey No.4245/20 and 4247/4 at
Krishnapuram Colony, II nd  Street,Maudrai with an upset price of Rs.6.31 Lakhs.
</p><p id="p_8">	(ii)Land at Plot No.7 in Survey No.22/2 Bibikulam village, LIC Colony,
Madurai with an upset price of Rs.1.50 Lakhs.
</p><p id="p_9">	(iii)Land and Building at Plot T in Survey No.2738/2A &amp; 7A(New Nos.4245/20
&amp; 4247/4) with an upset price of Rs.8.67 Lakhs.
</p><p id="p_10">	As the above properties were located at Madurai, the proceedings were
transferred to DRT Madurai, for further action.
</p><p id="p_11">	The information revealed that, in pursuance of the said conspiracy, Shri
S.Kasimayan, working as a public servant in the capacity of Recovery Officer,
Debt Recovery Tribunal, Madurai has given Tender-cum-Auction Notice in a Tamil
and English Newspaper for the said three properties viz., (i)Land and Building
at Plot No.22 in Survey No.4245/20 and 4247/4 at Krishnapuram Colony, IInd
Street, Madurai with an upset price of Rs.6.31 Lakhs, (ii)Land at Plot No.7 in
Survey No.22/2 Bibikulam village, LIC Colony, Madurai with an upset price of
Rs.1.50 Lakhs and (iii)Land and building at Plot T in Survey No.2738/2A  &amp;
7A(New Nos.4245/20 &amp; 4247/4) with an upset price of Rs.6.87 Lakhs, to be
auctioned on 24.04.2008.  The information revealed that Shri.S.Kasimayan (A-1),
by abusing his official position, fraudulently fixed the upset prices of the
above mentioned properties in the year 2008 based on the valuation report of the
year 2006.
</p><p id="p_12">	In pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy, Shri Rajesh Kannan(A-3) only
bidder for the properties at Sl.(i) and (iii) above, quoted Rs.1,000/- more than
the upset price fixed by A-1 i.e., 6.32 Lakhs and 8.68 Lakhs, respectively.  For
the property mentioned at Sl.(ii) above, out of the five bidders,
Smt.R.Anitha(A-4) W/o R.Selvaraj(A-2) had quoted Rs.1.55 Lakhs, against the
upset price of Rs.1.50 Lakhs, as the highest bidder.
	In pursuance of the conspiracy the above properties (i) to(iii) were
auctioned on 24.04.2008 by the A-1 by fraudulently quoting the market value for
the year 2006 at Rs.6.32 Lakhs, Rs.1.5 Lakhs and 8.68 Lakhs respectively,
whereas the assessment value for the above said properties for year 2008 were
</p><p id="p_13">(i)Rs.13,35,150/- (ii)Rs.8,40,500/- and (iii) Rs.19,55,700/-.
	In pursuance of the said Criminal conspiracy, the properties at Sl.No.(i)
and (iii) were auctioned to Shri. Rajesh Kannan(A-3) and the property at
Sl.No.(ii) above was auctioned to Smt.R.Anitha(A-4) who is the wife of
Shri.R.Selvarj(A-2) who is working as a UDC at the DRT Madurai and was closely
associated with the proceedings of the office of DRT, Madurai.  The information
revealed that as per Debts   Recovery Tribunals part II(Recovery of Debts due to
Bank and Finance Institutions) Act, 1993 and <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_2">IT Act</a> 1961 under <a href="/doc/938899/" id="a_3">Section 17</a>, Shri
R.Selvarj(A-2) and Smt.Anitha(A-4) were prohibited against bidding and purchase
of immovable properties auctioned by DRT, Madurai.	
	Information revealed that Shri.S.Kasimayan(A-1)and Shri.R.Selvaraj(A-2)
and others unkown officials  of DRT/Dhanalakshmi Bank, had managed to fix the
value of the properties in the year 2008, at the prices valued in the year 2006
and auctioned the properties fraudulently and dishonestly to Shri.Rajesh
Kannan(A-3) and R.Anitha(A-4) at a price much lesser than the market value as on
24.04.2008.  Information further revealed that Shri. M.R.Gopinathan the
property owner obtained a stay order from DRAT, Mumbai on 16.05.2008 as the
properties were auctioned based on the valuation report of the year 2006.
	In pursuance of the said criminal conspiracy, Shri S.Kasimayan (A-1) by
abusing his official position, knowing fully well that a stay was granted by the
Hon'ble DRAT, Mumbai on 16.05.08 against the auction of the above said three
properties, fraudulently confirmed on 27.06.08, the sale of said properties to
Shri.Rajesh Kannan(A-3) and Smt.R.Anitha(A-4) much below the market value and
thereby had caused pecuniary advantage to A-3 and A-4, with a vested interest.
	Thus by cheating the DRT and auctioning and purchasing the three
properties worth Rs.41,31,350/- at a cost of Rs.16,55,000/-, A-1 to A-4 had
caused a wrongful loss of Rs.24,76,350/- to the property owner/Dhanalakshmi Bank
and corresponding wrongful gain to themselves.
</p><p id="p_14">	The above information prima facie discloses the commission of offences
punishable under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_4">Section 120-B</a>, r/w 169 and 420 <a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_5">IPC</a> and <a href="/doc/10772/" id="a_6">Section 13(2)</a> r/w

</p><p id="p_15">	(ii) C.B.I commenced the investigation. Whereupon, this Criminal Original
Petition has been filed impugning and challenging the act of the C.B.I in
registering the F.I.R without getting previous permission from the competent
authority concerned, on various grounds inter alia thus:
</p>
<p id="p_16">	(a) The act of selling the property in auction sale after fixing the upset
price and confirming the same, is a judicial act irrespective of the fact
whether the Recovery Officer is nomenclatured or designated, labelled or dubbed
as a judge or not.
</p>
<p id="p_17">	(b) The suo motu action taken by the C.B.I was unwarranted and that no one
lodged a complaint also expressing grievance over the sale conducted by the
petitioner/A.1, the Recovery Officer.
</p>
<p id="p_18">	4. Whereas on the side of the respondent/ complainant, it was contended
inter alia thus:
</p>
<p id="p_19">	The Recovery Officer by no stretch of imagination could be termed as a
judge and his acts cannot be termed as judicial acts and he could be treated
only as an Executive Official under the control of the Central Government and
C.B.I being the Central Government Agency having competence to register an F.I.R
and investigate into the cognizable offences, its act cannot be found fault
with.
</p>
<p id="p_20">	5. During arguments, it transpired that the main thrust of the contention
to get quashed the F.I.R is based on the ground that the petitioner/A.1's act is
a judicial act enjoying statutory protection.
</p>	
<p id="p_21">	6. Wherefore, the point for consideration is as to whether the F.I.R has
to be quashed on the ground that the petitioner/A.1's act selling the property
in auction sale and confirming the same, is a judicial act enjoying statutory
protection, from being investigated by C.B.I suo motu after registering the
F.I.R?
</p>
<p id="p_22">	7. At the outset itself, I hark back to the following decisions of the
Honourable Apex Court:
</p><p id="p_23">	(i) <a href="/doc/1033637/" id="a_7">State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal</a> reported in AIR 1992 SUPREME COURT 604.
An excerpt from it, would run thus:
</p><p id="p_24">	"The following categories of cases can be stated by way of illustration
wherein the extraordinary power under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_8">Article 226</a> or the inherent powers under
<a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_9">Section 482</a> CrPC can be exercised by the High Court either to prevent abuse of
process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may
not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently
channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an
exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised:
	(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the
complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their
entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against
the accused.
</p><p id="p_25">	(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other
materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence,
justifying an investigation by police officers under <a href="/doc/51689/" id="a_10">Section 156(1)</a> of the Code
except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of <a href="/doc/1518148/" id="a_11">Section 155(2)</a> of
the Code.
</p><p id="p_26">	(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and
the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of
any offence and make out a case against the accused.
</p><p id="p_27">	(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable
offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is
permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated
under <a href="/doc/1518148/" id="a_12">Section 155(2)</a> of the Code.
</p><p id="p_28">	(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and
inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a
just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused.
</p><p id="p_29">	(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_13">
of the Code</a> or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is
instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where
there is a specific provision in<a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_14"> the Code</a> or the concerned Act, providing
efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.
	(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide
and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive
for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to
private and personal grudge."
</p>
<p id="p_30">	(ii) <a href="/doc/393035/" id="a_15">Jeffrey J.Diermeier and another v. State of West Bengal and another</a>
reported in (2010) 6 Supreme Court Cases 243.
</p><p id="p_31">	(iii) <a href="/doc/46704/" id="a_16">Preeti Gupta and another v. State of Jharkhand and another</a> reported

1412.
</p>
<p id="p_33">	8. A mere reading of the decisions referred to supra of the Honourable
Apex Court, would exemplify and demonstrate that the quashment of the F.I.R
would arise only in the rarest of rare cases and that the power under <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_18">Section
482</a> Cr.P.C which is based on the maxim "Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur et
omne per quod pervenitur ad illud." (When anything is commanded, everything by
which it can be accomplished is also commanded.) could be exercised, cautiously
and sparingly and with circumspection.
</p>
<p id="p_34">	9. At this juncture, it has to be considered as to whether the probe by
C.B.I, is touching upon any judicial act or any non-judicial act.
</p>
<p id="p_35">	10. Once it is found that the probe emanated centering on a judicial act,
then the answer is at once clear that the previous permission from the higher
authority in the same hierarchy at least, was required before entering upon such
probe.
</p>
<p id="p_36">	11. The learned Special Public Prosecutor would submit that in this case,
the preliminary enquiries were made and thereafter alone, the suo motu F.I.R was
registered and it is strictly in compliance with the directives governing the
C.B.I probes and investigations.
</p>	
<p id="p_37">	12. The gist and kernel of the arguments as put forth by Mr.S.Rozario
Sundarraj, learned Special Public Prosecutor for the respondent would run thus:
</p><p id="p_38">	(a) The Recovery Officer under the Act, is not a judge and none of his
functions could be termed as judicial acts or judicial functions. He is only
bound to execute the certificate issued by the D.R.T or the Appellate Tribunal
in the hierarchy and nothing more.
</p><p id="p_39">	(b) In this case, A.1 was deputed from the defence service and virtually
he is an employee of the Central Government of India and he is not enjoying any
immunity as that of a judge or judicial officer.  <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_19">The Judges (Protection) Act</a>,
1985 and the <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_20">Judicial Officers Protection Act</a>, 1850, are not applicable to him.
None of the decisions cited on the side of the petitioner/A.1 could be pressed
into service in favour of A.1 because he is not a judicial officer or a judge.
</p><p id="p_40">	(c) A perusal of the F.I.R along with the typed sets would indicate and
exemplify the manner in which A.1 had committed various misdeeds and also had
conspired with others for the purpose of illegally selling the said property
involved in the proceedings for a low price.
</p><p id="p_41">	(d) The recovery of amount by conducting auction sale was relating to
enforcement of a certificate sent from Mumbai Tribunal to Madurai. Even though
the auction was conducted in the year 2008, the value during the year 2006
relating to the properties concerned was taken into account and in fact, when
the debtor filed an application for considering the fresh and upto date
valuation, A.1 passed order observing that the debtor could bring better offers
at the time of auction sale, without refixing and enhancing the upset price.
</p>
<p id="p_42">	(e) After the auction sale but before confirmation of sale, stay was
obtained by the debtor from the appellate authority at Mumbai, but ignoring the
same, A.1 confirmed the sale.  The investigating agency also traced out various
incriminating documents during the house search as against A.1.  The property
which was sold was taken in the name of the wife of a staff of the Debts
Recovery Tribunal and various other illegalities also, were committed by A.1.
</p>
<p id="p_43">	13. By way of attempting to torpedo and pulverise the arguments set out on
the side of the C.B.I, Mr.B.Kumar, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner
would put forth and advance his arguments which could tersely and briefly be set
out thus:
</p>
<p id="p_44">	(a) Even though the Recovery Officer is not termed as a judge, the
functions which he is carrying out while bringing the property for sale and
confirming the same are necessarily judicial functions.
</p><p id="p_45">	(b) The discretion is also vested with the Recovery Officer to fix the
upset price as per law.
</p><p id="p_46">	(c) The Recovery Officer under the Debts Recovery Tribunal is actually
doing a very crucial task by selling the property in the process of recovering
the amounts due.
</p><p id="p_47">	(d) So far this case is concerned, the F.I.R is centered on the act of the
Recovery Officer-A.1 in fixing the upset price and bringing it for sale and
selling it and thereafter confirming it and in such a case, C.B.I did not obtain
previous permission from the higher authority in the the hierarchy concerned,
but straight away registered the F.I.R and probed into A.1's judicial act.
</p><p id="p_48">	(e) The higher-up in the hierarchy of Debts Recovery Tribunal is the
competent authority to decide as to whether the act performed by the Recovery
Officer is right or wrong.
</p>
<p id="p_49">	(f) Furthermore, the orders passed and the acts performed by the Recovery
Officer are subject to being challenged in appeal. In fact, the judgment debtor
preferred M.A.No.318 of 2008 in Appeal No.77 of 2008.  There was a delay of 1269
days in filing the appeal. The Appellate Authority rejected the application for
getting the delay condoned. Consequently, the appeal itself was dismissed. In
such a case, the C.B.I was not justified in suo motu registering the F.I.R and
probing into the matter.
</p>
<p id="p_50">	(g) Section 29 of the R.D.B.F.Act, would usher in the Second and Third
Schedules appended to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_21">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961, which would clearly point out
that the Recovery Officer is enjoying the protection under the <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_22">Judicial Officers
Protection Act</a>, 1850 and that itself is indicative of the fact that the acts
performed by the Recovery Officer is protected by the <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_23">Judicial Officers
Protection Act</a>, 1850 on the ground that his acts are judicial acts.  In fact,
the departmental probe by A.1's higher official gave him clean chit.
Accordingly, he prays for quashment of the F.I.R.	
</p>	
<p id="p_51">	14. Whereas the learned Special Public Prosecutor would submit that the
C.B.I completed the investigation and approached the Sanctioning Authority for
getting sanction in terms of <a href="/doc/97670/" id="a_24">Section 19</a> of Prevention of Corruption Act.
</p>
<p id="p_52">	15. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would submit that the
submission made by the learned Special Public Prosecutor attacking the sale
conducted by A.1 are not tenable for the reason that  A.1 properly fixed the
upset price after considering the available materials, but the debtor did not
make  use of the opportunity given by A.1, the Recovery Officer for furnishing
his valuations before fixing the upset price; only after the fixation of upset
price, the debtor filed a petition suggesting higher price and for that, A.1
ordered that it was open for the debtor to bring prospective bidders to bid at
the auction for higher price than the upset price fixed.  According to him, the
contention on the side of the Special Public Prosecutor that ignoring the stay
order of the Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai, the sale was confirmed, was not correct
as A.1 called upon the debtor to produce necessary stay order, but that was not
produced. On the one hand, the C.B.I would contend that the sale effected by A.1
was fraught with fraudulent conduct on the part of A.1 and other accused; per
contra, A.1 would contend that the sale was perfectly in order.  At present,
this Court is not at all concerned with the issues as to whether the upset price
fixed was correct or not; whether the  sale confirmed was correct or not and
also as to whether such sale was actuated and fraught with fraudulent motives or
purposes etc. or not.
</p>
<p id="p_53">	16. In this factual matrix, this Court is concerned with the fact as to
whether the acts of  having brought the property for sale and confirmed  it by
the Recovery Officer under the Debts Recovery Tribunal could be termed as
judicial acts.
</p>
<p id="p_54">	17. The learned Special Public Prosecutor in support of his contentions
cited the following precedents:
</p><p id="p_55">	(i) <a href="/doc/1155272/" id="a_25">Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. v. Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation</a> in Civil Appeal No.4796 of 2009 dated 29.07.2009 (arising out of
SLP.(C)No.24715 of 2008)
</p><p id="p_56">	(ii) <a href="/doc/677551/" id="a_26">Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank</a> reported in AIR 2000 SUPREME COURT
1535.
</p><p id="p_57">	(iii) Ravishankar Srivastava v. State of Rajasthan and others reported in
III(2005) CCR 15.
</p>
<p id="p_58">	18. <a href="/doc/1155272/" id="a_27">In Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. v. Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation</a> in Civil Appeal No.4796 of 2009 dated 29.07.2009 (arising out of
SLP.(C)No.24715 of 2008), no doubt, the Honourable Apex Court unambiguously and
unequivocally, plainly and pellucidly has held that the Tribunal is not a civil
Court and any final order passed by it cannot be termed as a decree. Absolutely,
there is no quarrel over such a proposition.  But, here, the point involved is
as to whether the Recovery Officer's acts are protected as judicial acts or not.
The Recovery Officer as per law is having the duty to fix the upset price for
bidding in the auction sale. In this case,the upset prices, it appears, were
fixed by the Officer concerned taking into account the valuation as it existed
during the year 2006, thus:
</p>
<p id="p_59">1st item  Rs.6.32 lakhs
2nd item  Rs.1.5 lakhs
3rd item  Rs.8.68 lakhs

Whereas the learned Special Public Prosecutor would submit that the actual
valuation during the year 2008 should have been taken into consideration and the
upset price should have been fixed as under:	
</p>
<p id="p_60">1st item   Rs.13,35,150/-
</p><p id="p_61">2nd item   Rs.8,40,500/-
</p><p id="p_62">3rd item   Rs.19,55,700/-
</p>
<p id="p_63">	19. No doubt, in the year 2008, the property was sold, but, A.1 relied
upon the valuation as it existed in year 2006 and furthermore, even before
bringing the property for sale, the judgment debtor himself furnished the higher
valuation, for which, the Recovery Officer passed the order to the effect that
he could bring bidders at the time of auction for bidding at a higher value than
the upset price fixed by A.1 already.  These are all judicial acts only in my
considered opinion. To the risk of repetition and pleonasm, I would point out
that as of now, I do not in any way decide the validity or otherwise of the said
auction sale. In the civil Court, while bringing the property for sale, the
executing judge is expected to fix the upset price after giving opportunity to
both sides to furnish their respective valuations and thereafter, the Judge
would fix the upset price and specify it in the proclamation of sale.  In fact,
the same procedures are being adopted by the Recovery Officer in fixing the
upset price and in selling the property in auction and confirming the same.  As
such, in my considered opinion, the act of the Recovery Officer is no less than
that of a judicial function and it is a judicial act. In fact, the judicial
discretionary power is available with the executing judge as well as with the
Recovery Officer in fixing the upset price.
</p>
<p id="p_64">	20. Incontrovertibly and indubitably, indisputably and unassailably, the
act of the Recovery Officer is not that of a mere clerical staff of the Debts
Recovery Tribunal and at one point of time, the learned Special Public
Prosecutor  for the respondent attempted to project the act of the Recovery
Officer as that of a Court Amin only, which I with great respect to him, would
observe that such an argument is ex facie untenable.  Amin's function, it is
well known, is clerical in nature, and his function cannot be equated with that
of the function of a Recovery Officer under the R.D.B.F.Act.
</p>
	
<p id="p_65">	21. The learned Special Public Prosecutor would place reliance on Section
7 of the R.D.B.F.Act,, which would run thus:

</p><p id="p_69">	22. Placing reliance on the same, the learned Special Public Prosecutor
would submit that the Recovery Officer is termed only as staff in the Act and
according to him, a staff cannot be equated to the level of a judge and the
definition of a 'judge' as in Black's Dictionary is as under:
</p>
<p id="p_70">	"judge.- A public official appointed or elected to hear and decide legal
matters in court."
</p><p id="p_71">would not in any way include the Recovery Officer, for which, the learned Senior
Counsel for the petitioner would invite the attention of this Court to <a href="/doc/1807029/" id="a_28">Section
19</a> of the Indian Penal Code which would run thus:
</p><p id="p_72">	"19."Judge".- The word "Judge" denotes not only every person who is
officially designated as a Judge, but also every person,-
	who is empowered by law to give, in any legal proceeding, civil or
criminal, a definitive judgment, or a judgment which, if not appealed against,
would be definitive, or a judgment which, if confirmed by some other authority,
would be definitive, or
	who is one of a body of persons, which body of persons is empowered by law
to give such a judgment.
</p><p id="p_73">Illustrations
</p><p id="p_74">(a) A Collector exercising jurisdiction in a suit under Act 10 of 1859, is a
Judge.
</p><p id="p_75">(b) A Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in respect of a charge on which he has
power to sentence to fine or imprisonment, with or without appeal, is a Judge.
</p><p id="p_76">(c) A member of a panchayat which has power, under Regulation VII, 1816, of the
Madras Code, to try and determine suits, is a Judge.
</p><p id="p_77">(d) A Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in respect of a charge on which he has
power only to commit for trail to another Court, is not a Judge." 	
	(emphasis supplied.)

</p><p id="p_78">	23. He would also rely upon <a href="/doc/306489/" id="a_29">Section 77</a> I.P.C which is extracted hereunder
for ready reference:
</p><p id="p_79">	"77. Act of Judge when acting judicially.- Nothing is an offence which is
done by a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or
which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law."
</p>	
<p id="p_80">	24. Placing reliance on the above provisions, the learned Senior Counsel
for the petitioner would develop his argument to the effect that there is no
pre-condition for an official to get protection for his judicial acts that he
should have been designated as a judge, but the acts which he performed should
have been judicial acts.
</p>
<p id="p_81">	25. A plain reading of <a href="/doc/1807029/" id="a_30">Section 19</a> I.P.C would indicate and evince that
irrespective of the fact as to whether a person is designated as a judge or not,
he would be enjoying the status of a judge depending upon the acts he performs.
In the illustration to <a href="/doc/1807029/" id="a_31">Section 19</a> I.P.C., even a Collector exercising
jurisdiction in a suit under Act 10 of 1859, is treated as a judge. Similarly,
in other illustrations (b) and (c) also, the same point is found highlighted and
illustrated. As such, I cannot accept the contention of the learned Special
Public Prosecutor that simply because the Recovery Officer was not designated as
a judge, his official acts in the discharge of his duty cannot be taken as
judicial acts.
</p>
<p id="p_82">	26. <a href="/doc/306489/" id="a_32">Section 77</a> I.P.C is having wider application which I need not consider
at this stage.
</p>
<p id="p_83">	27. Nevertheless the Recovery Officer is contemplated under Section 7 of
the R.D.B.F.Act, bearing the Section heading viz., 'Staff of Tribunal', yet he
should not be treated as a clerical staff.
</p>
<p id="p_84">	28. It would not be out of place or context, to portray that the
confirmation of sale is virtually a judicial act which is definitive and subject
to appeal. Axiomatically, the Recovery Officer possesses all power to confirm
the sale which implies the power not to confirm the sale and I am at a loss to
understand as to how such an act cannot be termed as a judicial act. Adversarial
proceedings are contemplated before the Recovery Officer and he has to adhere to
the maxim "Audi alteram partem" (Hear the other side. No one should be condemned
unheard.) and I stress upon the maxim "Jura naturae sunt immutabilia" (The laws
of nature are unchangeable.) and the Recovery Officer as per law is enjoined to
do such judicial act in adversarial proceedings.  In an adversarial proceedings
after hearing both, if any decision or adjudication is made, it in a sense
tantamounts to judgment.  Section 2(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure, defines a
judgment as under:
</p><p id="p_85">	"2(9). "Judgment" means the statement given by the Judge on the grounds of
a decree or order."
</p>
<p id="p_86">	29. It is therefore just and necessary to extract Section 29 of the
R.D.B.F.Act, as well as R.82 to Part VI of the Second Schedule to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_33">Income Tax
Act</a>, 1961, hereunder :
</p><p id="p_87">	"29. Application of certain provisions of <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_34">Income-tax Act</a>.- The provisions
of the Second and Third Schedules to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_35">Income-tax Act</a>, 1961 and the Income-tax
(Certificate Proceedings) Rules, 1962, as in force from time to time shall, as
far as possible, apply with necessary modifications as if the said provisions
and the rules referred to the amount of debt due under this Act instead of to
the income-tax:
</p><p id="p_88">	Provided that any reference under the said provisions and the rules to the
"assessee" shall be construed as a reference to the defendant under this Act."
</p>
<p id="p_89">* * *
	"Officers deemed to be acting judicially.
</p><p id="p_90">	82. Every [Chief Commissioner or Commissioner], Tax Recovery Officer or
other  officer acting under this Schedule shall, in the discharge of his
functions under this Schedule, be deemed to be acting judicially within the
meaning of the <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_36">Judicial Officers Protection Act</a>, 1850 (18 of 1850)."
</p><p id="p_91">				(emphasis supplied.)

</p><p id="p_92">	30. A mere reading of the provisions cited supra would unambiguously and
unequivocally, pellucidly and palpably highlight and spotlight the fact that the
Recovery Officer while bringing the property for sale, is doing certain acts,
which are zealously protected by the statute namely the <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_37">Judicial Officers
Protection Act</a>, 1850.
</p>
<p id="p_93">	31. It is therefore clear that <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_38">Section 29</a> of the Act read with the Second
Schedule to <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_39">Income Tax Act</a>, does demonstrate and display that the acts performed
by the Recovery Officer should be taken as judicial functions and they are
protected by the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_40">Judges (Protection) Act</a>, 1985. If an act of bringing the
property for sale by the Recovery Officer cannot be termed as a judicial act,
then there would have been no necessity for the legislators as per <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_41">Section 29</a> of
the Act, to usher in the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act and also in
mandating under the said Second Schedule that the Recovery Officer under the
<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_42">Income Tax Act</a> should be protected by the Judicial Officers' <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_43">Protection Act</a>,
1850.
</p>	
<p id="p_94">	32. The R.D.B.F.Act, itself was interpreted by the Honourable Apex Court
in various decisions which would exemplify and indicate that not only pending
suits should be transferred to the Debts Recovery Tribunal on the commencement
of the Act, but also the execution proceedings pending in the civil Court.
There was a doubt at one point of time as to whether the pending execution
proceedings also should be transferred, for which the Honourable Apex Court's
dictum made all to understand that the execution proceedings also should be
transferred from the civil Court to the Debts Recovery Tribunal.
</p><p id="p_95">	33. Mr.B.Kumar, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would stress
upon the fact that the very fact that even the execution proceedings having been
transferred from the civil Court to Debts Recovery Tribunal for the Recovery
Officer to execute the same by way of bringing the property for sale, would
amply make the point clear that the Recovery Officers have been vested with the
power to perform judicial acts in selling the properties and confirming the sale
and their acts are protected as per the Judicial Officers' <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_44">Protection Act</a>, 1850.
Over and above that, the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would cite
one other Act, so to say, the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_45">Judges (Protection) Act</a>, 1985.
</p>
<p id="p_96">	34. No doubt, the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_46">Judges (Protection) Act</a>, 1985, has not been referred to
in the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act.  As a corollary, it should be
taken that the said Act of 1985 also is protecting the Recovery Officer of
Income Tax Department as well as the Debts Recovery Tribunal. The acts of
Recovery Officer is termed as judicial act by the legislators themselves in view
of <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_47">Section 29</a> of the Act read with the Second Schedule to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_48">Income Tax Act</a>.
The protection as contained in the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_49">Judges (Protection) Act</a>, 1985, supplements
the already existing protection under the Judicial Officers' <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_50">Protection Act</a>,
1850 and it is quite obvious and axiomatic and no more elaboration and dilation
in this regard is required.
</p>
<p id="p_97">	35. The Recovery Officer under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_51">Income Tax Act</a> and the Recovery Officer
under the R.D.B.F.Act,, should be construed as equally performing important
functions and they are entitled to equal protection as per law and more
specifically, as per <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_52">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.  I am at a loss to
understand as to how it could be contended that the Judicial Officers'
<a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_53">Protection Act</a>, 1850, could protect only the Recovery Officer under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_54">Income
Tax Act</a>, 1961 and not the Recovery Officer under the  R.D.B.F.Act, and that too,
when <a href="/doc/176471/" id="a_55">Section 29</a> of the said Act contemplates that mutatis mutadis the Second and
Third Schedules appended to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_56">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961, shall be applicable while
recovering the dues under the R.D.B.F.Act,, by the Recovery Officer.
</p>	
<p id="p_98">	36. I recollect and call up the following maxims:
</p>
<p id="p_99">	(i) Verba generalia generaliter sunt intelligenda. (General words are to
be understood generally.)
</p><p id="p_100">	(ii) Verba ita sunt intelligenda, ut res magis valeat quam pereat. (Words
are to be so understood that the matter may have effect rather than fail.)

</p><p id="p_101">	37. Accordingly, if interpreted and viewed in the wake of the concept of
equal protection of the laws as envisaged under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_57">Article 14</a> of the Constitution
of India, the Recovery Officer under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_58">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961 and the Recovery
Officer under the  R.D.B.F.Act,, should be accorded with equal protection and
the Recovery Officer under the  R.D.B.F.Act,, cannot be left high and dry while
he is performing his functions which are tantamounting to judicial acts.	
</p>
<p id="p_102">	38. The learned Special Public Prosecutor for the respondent would place
reliance on the decision in Ravishankar Srivastava v. State of Rajasthan and
others reported in III(2005) CCR 15. An excerpt from it, would run thus:
	"80. The Supreme Court, in the case of <a href="/doc/1804373/" id="a_59">Raj Kishor Roy v. Kamleshwar Pandey
and Another</a>, reported in IV(2002)SLT 659 = III(2002)CCR 128(SC)=2002(6) SCC 543,
wherein the matter was pending for quashing of complaint on the ground that
sanction under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_60">Section 197</a>, <a href="/doc/445276/" id="a_61">Cr.P.C</a> not obtained, has observed that question of
sanction can be raised at any time after the cognizance of offence is taken, may
be even at the time of conclusion of trial.
</p><p id="p_103">	81. It is further held that it is mandatory where the act has been done by
the public servant in the course of his service or in the discharge of his duty-
protection under <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_62">Section 197</a> not available, if the act complained of is not in
connection with the discharge of official duty.
</p><p id="p_104">	82. Applying the ratio decided by Hon'ble Supreme Court as in the instant
case the petitioner while in Jaipur away from his office has accepted the bribe
and even otherwise without discussing on the merit of the case as trial is
already commenced,  the petitioner in view of this judgment can raise the
question before the trial. It is for the petitioner to raise these questions
before the Trial Court whether the sanction is necessary or not.
</p><p id="p_105">	83. At this stage while considering the writ petition whether the FIR
lodged against the petitioner on the face value itself is false or not is only a
question to determine by this Court. Even in the lack of obtaining sanction the
FIR has been lodged, cannot said to be false at face value and on this ground
the FIR cannot be quashed and set aside as per the principle laid down by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court."	(emphasis supplied)

</p><p id="p_106">	39. The perusal of the aforesaid decision would highlight that in the case
cited supra, a member of the Revenue Board was proceeded against for the act of
he having obtained bribe before exercising his power. In that connection, the
learned Judge observed as such in the aforesaid extracted paragraphs 80, 81, 82
and 83. As such, that case is factually distinguishable. Here, the main thrust
of the F.I.R is on the act of A.1 in fixing the upset price and selling the
properties and confirming the same.  As such, the said decision of Rajasthan
High Court is not applicable to the facts of the present case.
</p>	
<p id="p_107">	40. The learned Special Public Prosecutor also would rely on the decision
in <a href="/doc/677551/" id="a_63">Allahabad Bank v. Canara Bank</a> reported in AIR 2000 SUPREME COURT 1535  to
highlight the point that R.D.B.F.Act is a special enactment and the Debts
Recovery Tribunal has got exclusive jurisdiction and the functions cannot be
equated with that of a civil Court. There could be no quarrel over such a
proposition.  But, here, as has been highlighted by me supra, the point involved
is entirely different, so to say, this Court is probing into the fact as to
whether the act of the Recovery Officer in bringing the property for sale and
confirming the same, is a judicial act coming under the protective umbrage of
the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_64">Judges (Protection) Act</a>,1985 and the Judicial Officers' <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_65">Protection Act</a>, 1850
and also the directives of the Honourable Apex Court protecting the judicial
functions or not.

<p id="p_157">	43. Among the voluminous precedents, only a few are relevant for deciding
this Criminal Original Petition and I incline to refer to those crucial ones
infra.
</p><p id="p_158">	44. The most crucial decision is <a href="/doc/39303/" id="a_119">U.P.Judicial Officers' Association v.
Union of India and others</a> reported in JT 2002(8) SC 133.  An excerpt from it,
would run thus:
</p><p id="p_159">	"... The Counsel also urged that some additional guidelines be issued to
the effect that before lodging an FIR against any judicial officer, the
permission of the Chief Justice of the High Court should be obtained
irrespective of the nature of the offence and irrespective of the fact that the
alleged offence are in discharge of his official duty or purported discharge of
his official duty. We do not think it necessary to issue any such direction, as
at present in the case in hand. The interim orders and directions issued in this
case as well as the guidelines indicated by this Court in the case of Delhi
Judicial Service Association (supra) are sufficient to protect the independence
of the judicial officers.  Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we
dispose of this matter by directing the prosecution to proceed with the criminal
case as expeditiously as possible, and we further direct that the disciplinary
authority should initiate/take appropriate disciplinary action against the
errant police officer. This writ petition is disposed of accordingly with the
aforesaid observations. The disciplinary authority would do well in reporting to
this Court what action has been taken in this matter."
</p><p id="p_160">	45. A mere perusal of it would clearly exemplify and indicate that the
Honourable Apex Court zealously wanted to protect the judicial functions being
probed into by the investigating agency holus bolus.  If an investigating agency
is allowed to probe into the judicial functions, then the persons enjoined to
perform such act would have a fear that they are being watched by the
investigating agency and at any time, they may bounce upon them. At this
context, the following maxim could fruitfully be referred to:
	"De fide et officio judicis non recipitur quaestio,  sed  de  scientia
sive  sit  error  juris  sive  facti.  (The  honesty and  integrity  of  a
judge cannot  be  questioned,  but  his  decision  may  be impugned  for  error
either  of  law  or  of  fact.) As  such,  the  Honourable  Apex  Court  in the
aforesaid  judgment and also in  the
earlier judgments, highlighted and stressed that for enabling the officials to
perform judicial functions and acts, without any fear or favour, protection
should be given to such persons from they being investigated straight away.
With that in mind alone, the Honourable Apex Court in the aforesaid judgments,
laid down the law that the judicial functions and acts should be protected.
</p>
<p id="p_161">	46. The learned Special Public Prosecutor once again would advance his
argument that the judicial functions performed by the judicial officers and the
personnel in the cadre of judicial officers are protected by the Honourable Apex
Court's judgment and not acts of the persons like the Recovery Officers who are
only the staff of the Tribunals and even Presiding Officers of the Tribunals are
not judges and in such a case, the Recovery Officers working under those
Presiding Officers by no stretch of imagination could be termed as judges or
persons performing the judicial acts or judicial functions.
</p><p id="p_162">	47. My discussion supra touching upon the judicial function and act would
highlight that the Recovery Officers also are performing judicial acts as in
this case and before  their judicial acts are being probed into, previous
permission from their higher-up in that hierarchy is required.
</p>
<p id="p_163">	48. For the purpose of comprehensively deciding the issue, I would like to
refer to the other decisions of the Honourable Apex Court also as under:
</p><p id="p_164">	(i) <a href="/doc/1269046/" id="a_120">In K.Veeraswami v. Union of India and others</a> reported in (1991) 3
Supreme Court Cases 655, the Honourable Apex Court laid down the law to the
effect that the High Court Judges and the Supreme Court Judges being
constitutional functionaries   should be protected.
</p><p id="p_165">	(ii) <a href="/doc/1496509/" id="a_121">In Delhi Judicial Service Association v. State of Gujarat</a> reported in
(1991) 4 Supreme Court Cases 406 also, the Honourable Apex Court laid down the
law as under:
</p><p id="p_166">	"(A) If a Judicial Officer is to be arrested for some offence, it should
be done under intimation to the District Judge or the High Court as the case may
be.
</p><p id="p_167">	(B) If facts and circumstances necessitate the immediate arrest of a
Judicial Officer of the subordinate judiciary, a technical or formal arrest may
be effected.
</p><p id="p_168">	(C) The fact of such arrest should be immediately communicated to the
District and Sessions Judge of the concerned District and the Chief Justice of
the High Court.
</p><p id="p_169">	(D) The Judicial Officer so arrested shall not be taken to a police
station, without the prior order or directions of the District and Sessions
Judge of the concerned district, if available.
</p><p id="p_170">	(E) Immediate facilities shall be provided to the Judicial Officer for
communication with his family members, legal advisers and Judicial Officers,
including the District and Sessions Judge.
</p><p id="p_171">	(F) No statement of a Judicial Officer who is under arrest be recorded not
any panchnama be drawn up nor any medical tests be conducted except in the
presence of the Legal Adviser of the Judicial Officer concerned or another
Judicial Officer of equal or higher rank, if available.
</p>
<p id="p_172">	(G) There should be no handcuffing of a Judicial Officer.  If however,
violent resistance to arrest is offered or there is imminent need to effect
physical arrest in order to avert danger to life and limb, the person resisting
arrest may be overpowered and handcuffed. In such case, immediate report shall
be made to the District and Sessions Judge concerned and also to the Chief
Justice of the High Court.  But the burden would be on the police to establish
the necessity for effecting physical arrest and handcuffing the Judicial Officer
and if it be established that the physical arrest and handcuffing of the
Judicial Officer was unjustified, the police officers causing or responsible for
such arrest and handcuffing would be guilty of misconduct and would also be
personally liable for compensation and/or damages as may be summarily determined
by the High Court."
</p>
<p id="p_173">	49. Subsequently, the Honourable Apex Court, so to say, the Constitutional
Bench of the Honourable Apex Court in <a href="/doc/39303/" id="a_122">U.P.Judicial Officers' Association v.
Union of India and others</a> reported in JT 2002(8) SC 133, as set out earlier,
pointed out that even the registration of F.I.R and probing into the judicial
acts should be protected.
</p>
<p id="p_174">	50. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would place reliance on
the decision in <a href="/doc/1896811/" id="a_123">R.Subba Rao v. Advocate-General, A.P</a>. reported in AIR 1981
SUPREME COURT 755.  Certain excerpts from it, would run thus:
</p><p id="p_175">	8. The contention is clearly unsustainable. <a href="/doc/241834/" id="a_124">Section 1</a> of the Judicial
Officers Protection Act, 1850 provides:
</p><p id="p_176">"No Judge, Magistrate, justice of the Peace, Collector or other person acting
judicially shall be liable to be sued in any civil court for any act done or
ordered to be done by him in the discharge of his judicial duty, whether or not
within the limits of his jurisdiction:
</p><p id="p_177">Provided that he at the time, in good faith, believed himself to have
jurisdiction to do or order the act complained of; and no officer of any court
or other person, bound to execute the lawful warrants or orders of any such
Judge, Magistrate, Justice of the Peace, Collector or other person, acting
judicially shall be liable to be sued in any civil court, for the execution of
any warrant or order, which he would be bound to execute, if within the
jurisdiction of the person issuing the same."
</p><p id="p_178">	9. As pointed out by this Court in <a href="/doc/199388/" id="a_125">Anwar Hussain v. Ajay Kumar Mukherjee1</a>
the section affords protection to two broad categories of acts done or ordered
to be done by a judicial officer in his judicial capacity. In the first category
fall those acts which are within the limits of his jurisdiction. The second
category encompasses those acts which may not be within the jurisdiction of the
judicial officer, but are, nevertheless, done or ordered to be done by him,
believing in good faith that he had jurisdiction to do them or order them to be
done.
</p><p id="p_179">	10. In the case of acts of the first category committed in the discharge
of his judicial duties, the protection afforded by the statute is absolute, and
no enquiry will be entertained as to whether the act done or ordered to be done
was erroneous, or even illegal, or was done or ordered without believing in good
faith.
</p><p id="p_180">	11. In the case of acts of the second category, the protection of the
statute will be available if at the time of doing, ordering the act, the
judicial officer acting judicially, in good faith believed himself to have
jurisdiction to do or order the same. The expression "jurisdiction" in this
section has not been used in the limited sense of the term, as connoting the
"power" to do or order to do the particular act complained of, but is used in a
wide sense as meaning "generally the authority of the judicial officer to act in
the matters". Therefore, if the judicial officer had the general authority to
enter upon the enquiry into the cause, action, petition or other proceeding in
the course of which the impugned act was done or ordered by him in his judicial
capacity, the act, even if erroneous, will still be within his "jurisdiction",
and the mere fact that it was erroneous will not put it beyond his
"jurisdiction". Error in the exercise of jurisdiction is not to be confused with
lack of jurisdiction in entertaining the cause or proceeding. It follows that if
the judicial officer is found to have been acting in the discharge of his
judicial duties, then, in order to exclude him from the protection of this
statute, the complainant has to establish that (1) the judicial officer
complained against was acting without any jurisdiction whatsoever, and (2) he
was acting without good faith in believing himself to have jurisdiction.
</p>
<p id="p_181">As such, there is no quarrel over such a proposition.
</p>
<p id="p_182">	51. The core question arises as to whether in this case the act of A.1 in
selling the properties and confirming the same could be taken as one protected
by virtue of the decision in <a href="/doc/39303/" id="a_126">U.P.Judicial Officers' Association v. Union of
India and others</a> reported in JT 2002(8) SC 133 and Section 29 of the R.D.B.F.Act
read with Second Schedule to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_127">Income Tax Act</a>, 1961.
</p>
<p id="p_183">	52. In my considered opinion, the protection extended to Judicial Officers
and Recovery Officers under the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_128">Income Tax Act</a>, should be taken as the one
extended to all acts performed by all Tribunals and the Recovery Officers
attached to such Tribunals irrespective of the fact as to whether the personnel
performing such officials are having the designation of a judge or not.
</p>
<p id="p_184">	53. The learned Special Public Prosecutor for the respondent would
informatively submit that only the Joint Secretaries and the Officials above the
level of such officials of the Central Government do enjoy certain immunities
and if the C.B.I wants to register an F.I.R against such personnel, then
previous permission should be obtained from the authority concerned and not in
respect of any other officials.  According to him, A.1 enjoys only the status of
an Under Secretary as per the Central Government norms and in such a case, he
cannot press into service such immunity.
</p>
<p id="p_185">	54. I call up and recollect the view of the Honourable Apex Court in
<a href="/doc/1203995/" id="a_129">Vineet Narain and others v. Union of India and another</a>  reported in  1998
Supreme Court Cases (Cri) 307 and the relevant portions are extracted hereunder:
	"42. Once the jurisdiction is conferred on the CBI to investigate an
offence by virtue of notification under <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_130">Section 3</a> of the Act, the powers of
investigation are governed by the statutory provisions and they cannot be
estopped or curtailed by any executive instruction issued under <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_131">Section 4(1)</a>
thereof. This result follows from the fact that conferment of jurisdiction is
under <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_132">Section 3</a> of the Act and exercise of powers of investigation is by virtue
of the statutory provisions governing investigation of offences. It is settled
that statutory jurisdiction cannot be subject to executive control.
</p><p id="p_186">	43. There is no similarity between a mere executive order requiring prior
permission or sanction for investigation of the offence and the sanction needed
under the statute for prosecution. The requirement of sanction for prosecution
being provided in the very statute which enacts the offence, the sanction for
prosecution is a prerequisite for the court to take cognizance of the offence.
In the absence of any statutory requirement of prior permission or sanction for
investigation, it cannot be imposed as a condition precedent for initiation of
the investigation once jurisdiction is conferred on the CBI to investigate the
offence by virtue of the notification under <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_133">Section 3</a> of the Act. The word
"superintendence" in <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_134">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act in the context must be construed in
a manner consistent with the other provisions of the Act and the general
statutory powers of investigation which govern investigation even by the CBI.
The necessity of previous sanction for prosecution is provided in <a href="/doc/608297/" id="a_135">Section 6</a> of
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (<a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_136">Section 19</a> of the 1988 Act) without
which no court can take cognizance of an offence punishable under <a href="/doc/65305/" id="a_137">Section 5</a> of
that Act. There is no such previous sanction for investigation provided for
either in the <a href="/doc/1331755/" id="a_138">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> or the <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_139">Delhi Special Police
Establishment Act</a> or in any other statutory provision. The above is the only
manner in which <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_140">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act can be harmonised with <a href="/doc/694023/" id="a_141">Section 3</a> and the
other statutory provisions.
</p><p id="p_187">	44. The Single Directive has to be examined in this background. The law
does not classify offenders differently for treatment thereunder, including
investigation of offences and prosecution for offences, according to their
status in life. Every person accused of committing the same offence is to be
dealt with in the same manner in accordance with law, which is equal in its
application to everyone. The Single Directive is applicable only to certain
persons above the specified level who are described as "decision-making
officers". The question is whether any distinction can be made for them for the
purpose of investigation of an offence of which they are accused.
</p><p id="p_188">	45. Obviously, where the accusation of corruption is based on direct
evidence and it does not require any inference to be drawn dependent on the
decision-making process, there is no rational basis to classify them
differently. In other words, if the accusation be of bribery which is supported
by direct evidence of acceptance of illegal gratification by them, including
trap cases, it is obvious that no other factor is relevant and the level or
status of the offender is irrelevant. It is for this reason that it was conceded
that such cases, i.e., of bribery, including trap cases, are outside the scope
of the Single Directive. After some debate at the Bar, no serious attempt was
made by the learned Attorney General to support inclusion within the Single
Directive of cases in which the offender is alleged to be in possession of
disproportionate assets. It is clear that the accusation of possession of
disproportionate assets by a person is also based on direct evidence and no
factor pertaining to the expertise of decision-making is involved therein. We
have, therefore, no doubt that the Single Directive cannot include within its
ambit cases of possession of disproportionate assets by the offender. The
question now is only with regard to cases other than those of bribery, including
trap cases, and of possession of disproportionate assets being covered by the
Single Directive.
</p><p id="p_189">	46. There may be other cases where the accusation cannot be supported by
direct evidence and is a matter of inference of corrupt motive for the decision,
with nothing to prove directly any illegal gain to the decision- maker. Those
are cases in which the inference drawn is that the decision must have been made
for a corrupt motive because the decision could not have been reached otherwise
by an officer at that level in the hierarchy. This is, therefore, an area where
the opinion of persons with requisite expertise in decision-making of that kind
is relevant and, may be even decisive in reaching the conclusion whether the
allegation requires any investigation to be made. In view of the fact that the
CBI or the police force does not have the expertise within its fold for the
formation of the requisite opinion in such cases, the need for the inclusion of
such a mechanism comprising of experts in the field as a part of the
infrastructure of the CBI is obvious, to decide whether the accusation made
discloses grounds for a reasonable suspicion of the commission of an offence and
it requires investigation. In the absence of any such mechanism within the
infrastructure of the CBI, comprising of experts in the field who can evaluate
the material for the decision to be made, introduction therein of a body of
experts having expertise of the kind of business which requires the decision to
be made, can be appreciated. But then, the final opinion is to be of the CBI
with the aid of that advice and not that of anyone else. It would be more
appropriate to have such a body within the infrastructure of the CBI itself.
</p><p id="p_190">	47. The Single Directive cannot, therefore, be upheld as valid on the
ground of it being permissible in exercise of the power of superintendence of
the Central Government under <a href="/doc/768381/" id="a_142">Section 4(1)</a> of the Act. The matter has now to be
considered dehors the Single Directive."
</p>
<p id="p_191">	55. Wherefore, from the excerpts supra, it is crystal clear that the
Honourable Apex Court even went to the extent of striking down the notification
protecting the higher officials from they being probed by C.B.I. However, the
Honourable Apex Court clearly held as earlier pointed out that the judicial
functions should be protected.
</p><p id="p_192">	56. This Court raised a query to the learned Special Public Prosecutor for
the respondent as to whether the C.B.I complied with C.B.I Manual which
contemplates certain pre-conditions before registering the F.I.R, for which the
learned Special Public Prosecutor would at once submit that the preliminary
enquiries were made by the C.B.I before registering the F.I.R and it is not as
though holus bolus the F.I.R was registered as against A.1 and others. According
to him, C.B.I always au fait with law and au curante with facts initiate
proceedings and not haphazardly and that there is no dewy eyed approach or
vindictive approach in this matter.
</p>
<p id="p_193">	57. The plea of Res judicata as put forth on the petitioner/A.1's side is
a misconceived one as simply because some probe was effected by some person and
no further action was taken, cannot be pitted as against the present F.I.R and
pray for quashment of the F.I.R.  The criminal proceedings are different from
departmental proceedings or non-criminal proceedings.  I firmly hold that the
principle of Res judicata based on the following maxims,
</p><p id="p_194">	(i) Res judicata pro veritate accipitur. (A matter adjudged is taken for
truth.)
</p><p id="p_195">	(ii) Nemo debet bis vaxari pro una et eadem causa. (No one ought to be
twice troubled for one and the same cause.)
</p><p id="p_196">	(iii) Nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto. (No one ought to be punished
twice for the same offense.)
</p><p id="p_197">	(iv) Autrefois acquit. (A plea in bar of arraignment that the defendant
has been acquitted of the offense.)
</p><p id="p_198">	(v) Autrefois convict. (A plea in bar of arraignment that the defendant
has been convicted of the offense.),
cannot be pressed into service by the petitioner/A.1. However, it is for the
Sanctioning Authority to consider the factum of the said previous non-criminal
proceedings alleged to have taken and dropped, while viewing as to whether
sanction could be granted or not.
</p>
<p id="p_199">	58. The learned Special Public Prosecutor placing reliance on Section 33
of the R.D.B.F.Act, would develop his argument that if at all good faith is
involved in an act, the question of non-prosecution would arise. In fact, the
learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would also rely upon the very same
section of law and argue that in view of the said provision, bad faith or good
faith as pointed out, could be probed into only after obtaining previous
permission from the competent authority.  Precisely, as the impugned act comes
within the ostensible power of the official, no probe straight away could be
undertaken by C.B.I without such previous permission, as otherwise, such
protection under <a href="/doc/1670053/" id="a_143">Section 33</a> of the Act would be rendered illusory and nugatory.
</p>

<p id="p_200">	59. The pertinent question now arises is as to whether previous permission
from the higher-up in the hierarchy of the Debts Recovery Tribunal before
registering the F.I.R as against the Recovery Officer for he having committed
the alleged illegalities in bringing the property for sale and confirming the
same, was obtained or not, for which the obvious answer is that no such
permission was obtained.  The very subject matter of probe by C.B.I itself is
relating to the fixation of upset price and in selling the property and in
confirming the sale, which are part and parcel of the Recovery Officer's
official duties and in such a case, C.B.I should have obtained previous
permission from the higher-up in the hierarchy of the Debts Recovery Tribunal to
probe into such conduct and that only would have been in commensurate with the
dicta as found enunciated in the decisions of the Honourable Apex Court as well
as in<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_144"> Indian Penal Code</a>; the <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_145">Judges (Protection) Act</a>, 1985; the Judicial
Officers' <a href="/doc/76735723/" id="a_146">Protection Act</a>, 1850 and Section 29 of the R.D.B.F.Act, read with
Second Schedule appended to the <a href="/doc/789969/" id="a_147">Income Tax Act</a>.
</p>
<p id="p_201">	60. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would submit that once
it is found that the F.I.R was registered without getting previous permission
from the higher-up in the hierarchy, then the F.I.R itself has to be quashed,
leaving the C.B.I to get previous permission from the higher-up in the hierarchy
and afresh deal with the matter and investigate into it if they so decide and
desire. According to him, without such permission if F.I.R is registered in
matters of this nature, it should be taken as void ab initio and accordingly,
irrespective of the consequences, the F.I.R should be quashed.
</p>
<p id="p_202">	61. Now, the core question arises as to whether the F.I.R itself should be
quashed.
</p>

<p id="p_203">	62. It is  quite clear that now as stated by the learned Special Public
Prosecutor, the matter is already before the Sanctioning authority under Section
19 of P.C.R.Act, for granting sanction.  The Sanctioning authority unambiguously
is the highest authority having control over A.1 and in such a case, it would be
a futile exercise to quash the F.I.R and direct the C.B.I to once again probe
into it after getting permission.  Since the case has reached the stage of
obtaining the permission from the Sanctioning Authority which is the highest
authority having the control over A.1, I instead of quashing the F.I.R, issue
direction that the Sanctioning Authority shall consider the finding of this
Court and also the relevant acts and take a decision as to whether in the facts
and circumstances of this case, sanction could be granted or not.
</p>
<p id="p_204">	63. I recollect and call up the following maxim:
</p><p id="p_205">	Omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitur et mandato priori aequiparatur. (Every
subsequent ratification has a retrospective effect and is equivalent to a prior
command.) I am fully aware of the fact that the expose facto permission should
be an exceptional one and not a routine one to be adhered to as a rule of
practice.  If it is done as a routine, the very safeguard itself would be
rendered nugatory and that would become illusory. This is a singularly singular
case for the reason that so far there is no clear cut direct decision or
precedent available pertaining to the registration of F.I.R as against the
Recovery Officer of the Debts Recovery Tribunal relating to illegality in the
conduct of sale and confirmation of sale.  As suggested by the learned Senior
Counsel for the petitioner, if F.I.R is quashed leaving the C.B.I to obtain
necessary permission from the higher-up for afresh conducting the investigation,
then that would look odd and unconvincing as per jurisprudence and common sense
and the C.B.I will have to undergo the rigmarole  of once again doing the same
investigation. The Sanctioning Authority is the highest authority so far A.1 is
concerned and it is for the Sanctioning Authority now to consider as per the
mandate of this Court as to whether the previous permission would have been
granted by the Sanctioning Authority for registering the F.I.R, had it been
brought to its knowledge by the C.B.I before registering the F.I.R.
</p>
<p id="p_206">	64. No doubt, in the decision of the Honourable Apex Court in <a href="/doc/39303/" id="a_148">U.P.Judicial
Officers' Association v. Union of India and others</a> reported in JT 2002(8) SC
133, it is found exemplified that previous permission from the Chief Justice of
High Court concerned should be obtained before registering the F.I.R; but, so
far the Recovery Officers of the Debts Recovery Tribunal are concerned, it
cannot be inferred that to register an F.I.R as against the Recovery Officers,
the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned should be approached as that would
be onerous, however, by analogy, it should be taken that the higher-up in the
hierarchy of the Tribunal should be approached for getting previous permission
before registering the F.I.R and these features are not precisely with clarity
already found exemplified in any precedents.
</p>
<p id="p_207">	65. At this juncture, I would like to distinguish  a case of quashment of
F.I.R on the ground of non-availability of prima facie case attracting the
ingredients of a particular offence with that of a case of this nature on hand.
Without any second thought, the F.I.R has to be quashed if the materials
disclose that no offence has been made out ex facie from the averments and the
circumstances, but this is not a case of that nature as it is quite obvious from
my discussion supra. The distinction sought to be made by me is not one that of
tweedledum and tweedledee or six of the one and half a dozen of the other or
between rock and hard place, but it is one that of chalk and cheese.  As such,
in these circumstances, even though this Court is giving a finding that the
C.B.I could have obtained previous permission from the higher-up in the
hierarchy before registering the F.I.R, as against A.1, yet I do not incline to
quash it, but I would like to direct the Sanctioning Authority to consider
before according sanction under Section 19 of the P.C.R Act, the aforesaid
factors set out in this judgment.
</p>
<p id="p_208">	66. The learned Special Public Prosecutor made an extempore submission
that the Sanctioning Authority under Section 19 of the P.C.R Act, is not a party
to this petition.  That makes no difference as I am of the considered view that
this Court now only directs the Sanctioning Authority to consider these facts
before according sanction. The Sanctioning Authority has not been found fault
with in this matter and no adverse remarks have been passed by this Court as
against such authority. Wherefore, the non-impleadment of the Sanctioning
Authority would not in any way incapacitate this Court in passing the  direction
as set out supra in this order.  It is for the C.B.I. to bring to the knowledge
of the Sanctioning Authority the order of this Court along with other papers
and do the needful.
</p>
<p id="p_209">	67. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is disposed of.
Consequently, the connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.
