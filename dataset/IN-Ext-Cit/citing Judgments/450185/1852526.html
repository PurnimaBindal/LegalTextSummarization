:ORDER
</pre>
<p id="p_1">(Order of the Court was made by F.M.IBRAHIM KALIFULLA,J)

		The petitioner seeks for the issuance of a writ of Certiorarified
Mandamus to call for the records of the Arbitration Award No. 02/2004 dated
27.02.2005 passed by

the second respondent, quash the same and to direct the respondents 4 to 8 to
make necessary and suitable rules regarding the working conditions in IT
industries in India, as contemplated under Articles 14, 15, 16 and 42 of the
Indian Constitution and ensure adherence of various employment protection of
legislature.
</p>
<p id="p_2">		2.The brief facts, which are required to be stated, are that the
first petitioner is the wife of the second petitioner. The challenge is to the
Arbitration Award passed by the second respondent in Award No.02/2004 as between
the third respondent and the first petitioner.   The first petitioner is an
Engineering Graduate in Computer Science.  She joined the third respondent
company on 29.07.2000. At the time of joining, an agreement came to be signed by
the first petitioner and the third respondent called 'intellectual property
agreement' dated 29.07.2000.  The said agreement was initially for a period of
three years, which was extended for one more year. It inter alia provided for
the payment of salary to the first petitioner by mutual consent of the parties.
For the whole period of four years, the first petitioner was paid a salary of
Rs.4,23,382/-.
</p>
<p id="p_3">		3. It is common ground that the agreement contains a provision for
arbitration in the event of any dispute arising between the parties. It is also
an admitted fact that the first petitioner did not report for duty between
06.04.2002 to 30.09.2002 and 09.10.2003 to 27.03.2004. It is relevant to state
that the first petitioner did not apply for any maternity leave for the above
said periods.  It was in the above stated background it is stated that the third
respondent wanted the first petitioner to abide by the terms of the agreement
and fulfil her obligation by rendering service for the agreed period as per the
agreement dated 29.07.2000.  When the said demand of the third respondent was
not complied with, as per the clause in the agreement, the third respondent
preferred a claim before the sole arbitrator viz., the second respondent.
</p>
<p id="p_4">		4.After the resignation of services by the first petitioner on
02.08.2004, the third respondent preferred a claim based on clause 14 of the
agreement which stipulated that in the event of violation of clause 10(A), the
first petitioner is liable to pay penalty of Rs.6,00,000/- together with
compound interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date on which the demand
for penalty is claimed.  When the issue was before the second respondent
arbitrator, both parties filed their respective pleadings. The first petitioner
in her pleadings raised as many as six contentions. The second respondent, after
considering the respective stand of the parties, passed an award holding that
the first petitioner as a party to the agreement and the second petitioner, as a
guarantor are jointly and severally liable to pay the third respondent a penalty
of Rs.6,41,459/- along with interest at the rate of 18% till the penalty is
paid.  The award came to be passed on 27.02.2005.
</p><p id="p_5">		5.The petitioners did not challenge the said award before the
appropriate Court as provided under the provisions of the Arbitration and
<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_6">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.  The third respondent preferred an Execution Petition in
E.P.No.44 of 2006 on the file of the District Judge, Thoothukkudi. pursuant to
which, the petitioners were issued with notice as early as in the Month of
September 2006.  Thereafter, the petitioners have now come forward with the
present writ petition in November 2006.
</p>
<p id="p_6">	 6.Arguing for the petitioners, Mr.T.S.R.Venkataramana, learned counsel
appearing for the petitioners, raised as many as three contentions. In the first
place, the learned counsel contended that since there is a Constitutional
infirmity in the award,  the petitioners were obliged to file this writ
petition.  Secondly, it was contended that the Constitutional invalidity of the
award cannot be a subject matter of challenge before the forum created under the
provisions of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_7">Conciliation Act</a> and therefore the rights of
the petitioners have to be worked out only in this writ petition.  Lastly, it
was contended that the second respondent arbitrator failed to advert to any of
the grounds raised by the petitioners in the award proceedings and therefore for
non-consideration of contentious issues, the award is liable to be set aside.

</pre><p id="p_25">		8.As against the above submissions Mr.A.L.Somayajee, the learned
Senior counsel appearing for the third respondent, who is the real contesting
respondent, contended in the first place that such a public interest litigation
is not maintainable, inasmuch as the issue involved is purely a personal dispute
between the first petitioner and the third respondent. The learned senior
counsel then contended that as against the award impugned in this writ petition,
the petitioners have got two tier remedy under the provisions of the Arbitration
and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_29">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996.  According to the learned senior counsel, the
petitioners have got a remedy under <a href="/doc/536284/" id="a_30">Section 34</a> for setting aside the award and
also have an appellate remedy before the concerned Court under <a href="/doc/772406/" id="a_31">Section 37</a> of the
Act.  The learned senior counsel also contended that there was no public
interest involved in  this writ petition and therefore the writ petition is not
maintainable.  It is the further contention of the learned senior counsel that
the first  petitioner, after having signed the agreement, was bound to serve in
the third respondent for the required period as agreed between the parties as
the third respondent has fulfilled the obligations on its part of the contract
and that the first petitioner committed a breach by not serving the full period
as agreed to by her. It was therefore contended that the first petitioner having
failed to even avail the benefits of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_32">Maternity Benefit
Act</a>, 1961 cannot be permitted to raise any Constitutionality in relation to the
issue involved in this writ petition.  The learned senior counsel relied upon
the decisions reported in A.I.R.2007 SC 758 = 2007(2)SCJ 162 - <a href="/doc/578362/" id="a_33">Neetu  vs.  State
of Punjab</a>; 1980 (4) SCC 556 - <a href="/doc/1979603/" id="a_34">Rukmanibai Gupta  vs.  Collector, Jabalpur &amp;
Others</a>; and A.I.R.2003 SC 2629 - <a href="/doc/919241/" id="a_35">Oil and Natural Gas Corporation   vs.  SAW
Pipes Ltd</a>. in support of his submissions.
</p>
<p id="p_26">		9.The main thrust of the contentions of the petitioners, as regards
the Constitutional violation in relation to the main award, was based on <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_36">Article
42</a> of the Constitution, falling under Part-IV of the Constitution.  Learned
counsel for the petitioners would contend that under <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_37">Article 42</a> of the
Constitution it has been mandated that the State should make provision for
securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief, that the
claim of the third respondent before the Arbitrator, which came to be ultimately
awarded by the second respondent, had virtually deprived of the first petitioner
to avail all the relief granted under the Constitution.  The learned counsel,
therefore, submitted that though such a Constitutional provision would fall
under Part-IV of the Constitution as one of the Directive Principles of State
Policy, since the    so-called intellectual property agreement did not provide
for availing of such a relief which is Constitutionally mandated, the impugned
award should be struck down as null and void.  It is on the basis of the above
said submission, the learned counsel argued that a larger relief was claimed by
the petitioners in the public interest and that while couching the relief in the
prayer, apart from challenging the impugned award dated 27.02.2005 passed in
Arbitral Award No.2/2004, the petitioners also seek for appropriate directions
to respondents 4 to 8 to make necessary and suitable Rules regarding the working
conditions in I.T.Industry in India, as contemplated under Articles 14, 15, 16
and 42 of the Constitution.
</p>		
<p id="p_27">		10.When we considered the said contention, at the outset we state
that we are not able to see any Constitutional violation involved while
analysing the  impugned award passed by the second respondent based on the
agreement entered into between the petitioners and the third respondent herein.
In this context, it will be relevant to refer to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_38">Maternity
Benefit Act</a>, 1961, the <a href="/doc/110162683/" id="a_39">Central Act</a>, which has been enacted to regulate the
employment of women in certain establishments for certain period before and
after child-birth and to provide for maternity benefit and certain other
benefits.  As far as the application of the said Act is concerned, under <a href="/doc/1804257/" id="a_40">Section
2</a> (1)(b) of the Act, it is made applicable to every shop or establishment within
the meaning of any law for the time being in force in relation to shops and
establishments in a State, in which ten or more persons are employed, or were
employed, on any day of the preceding twelve months.  Again, the term
'establishment' has been defined under <a href="/doc/686376/" id="a_41">Section 3(e)</a>, wherein, in sub-clause
(iva) it is stated that  the term 'establishment' will take within its fold a
shop or other establishment.
</p><p id="p_28">		11.The learned senior counsel for the third respondent fairly
conceded that the third respondent would squarely fall within the provisions of
the Tamil Nadu Shops and <a href="/doc/1692639/" id="a_42">Establishments Act</a>, 1947.  In such circumstances, by
virtue of the provisions contained in the said Act, namely the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_43">Maternity Benefit
Act</a>, 1961, such as <a href="/doc/1167956/" id="a_44">Sections 4</a>, <a href="/doc/1130021/" id="a_45">5</a>, <a href="/doc/85782/" id="a_46">6</a>, <a href="/doc/1164277/" id="a_47">9</a>, <a href="/doc/312788/" id="a_48">10</a>, <a href="/doc/820891/" id="a_49">11</a>, <a href="/doc/1811175/" id="a_50">14</a> and <a href="/doc/694720/" id="a_51">17</a>, sufficient provisions
have been made to ensure maternity benefit as well as the required period of
absence to a woman employed in an establishment covered by the provisions of the
said Act.  Therefore, it can be safely held that the requirement of <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_52">Article 42</a>
of the Constitution has been sufficiently complied with by the State by virtue
of the above referred to enactment, specifically providing for the maternity
benefits as well as other safeguards that are required to be complied with in
respect of women employed in an establishment.  It is not the case of the
petitioners that the provisions of the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_53">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, 1961 are not
applicable to the third respondent or that the first petitioner was ineligible
to claim the benefits provided under the said Act.
</p><p id="p_29">		12.Having regard to the said statutory protection that is made
available to a woman employee, the contentions raised on behalf of the
petitioners based on <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_54">Article 42</a> and the other provisions of the Constitution are
not available to the petitioners.  If once such a claim of the petitioners based
on <a href="/doc/111604/" id="a_55">Article 42</a> of the Constitution is duly covered by a statute, then the remedy
of the first petitioner is to work out the same under the provisions of the said
Act.  It is not the case of the first petitioner that she wanted to avail of the
benefits provided under the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_56">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, 1961 while she was in the
services of the third respondent and that such a benefit was not extended to
her.  On the other hand, the undisputed position is that the first petitioner
had never made any claim under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_57">Maternity Benefit Act</a>,
1961, either for availing the leave benefits or other material benefits, which
were made available to such a 'woman employee' under the said Act.  In any
event, even if the said benefit had not been extended to the first petitioner by
the third respondent, the remedy of the first petitioner was  to work out the
same by approaching the concerned authorities constituted under <a href="/doc/1811175/" id="a_58">Sections 14</a>, <a href="/doc/589108/" id="a_59">15</a>
and <a href="/doc/694720/" id="a_60">17</a> of the said Act.  The first petitioner having failed to avail such a
statutory benefit by following the prescribed procedure, the present prayer of
the petitioners as though such a protection for a pregnant woman employed is
totally deprived is solely with a view to circumvent her lapses in having failed
to avail the statutory benefits in the manner in which it is proscribed.
</p><p id="p_30">		13.It will have to be stated that the petitioners have couched the
second part of the prayer in order to give a colour to the writ petition as a
public interest litigation, as the petitioners have failed to work out their
remedy as against the Arbitral Award of the second respondent under the
provisions of the Arbitration and <a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_61">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 (hereinafter called
"the 1996 Act").  We are fortified in our conclusion, since in the case on hand
the impugned award of the second respondent was passed as early as on 27.02.2005
in Award No.2 of 2004.  Under <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_62">Section 34</a> of the 1996 Act, the petitioners should
have worked out their rights as against the impugned award by taking recourse to
a court of law by filing an application for setting aside the said award in
accordance with sub-sections (2) &amp; (3) of the said <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_63">Section 34</a>.  Under sub-
section (3), it is specifically stipulated that an application for setting aside
an award cannot be made after three months have lapsed from the date of which
the party making that application had received the arbitral award.  Under the
proviso to sub-section (3) of <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_64">Section 34</a>, it is stated that if the Court is
satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the
application within the said period of three months, it can entertain the
application within a further period of 30 days, but not thereafter.  In this
context, it is also relevant to refer to the recent decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court reported in 2007 (1) Arbitration L.R. 399 (<a href="/doc/1684857/" id="a_65">State of Arunachal
Pradesh  vs.  Damani Construction Company</a>), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court
has made it clear that once the period prescribed under sub-section (3) of
<a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_66">Section 34</a> had expired, no Court, including the writ court, can extent the said
time limit in order to enable the party aggrieved to move an application under
<a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_67">Section 34</a> of the Act.  Further, under <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_68">Section 37</a> of the 1996 Act, as against
any order passed by the court of law in an application filed under <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_69">Section 34</a> of
the Act, an appeal lies to the appellate forum from the original decrees of the
court of law passing orders in such application either for setting aside or
refusing to set aside the arbitral award under <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_70">Section 34</a>. When the case of the
petitioners is considered in the light of the above provisions contained in the
<a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_71">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, 1961 and the 1996 Act, it will have to be held that the
present attempt of the petitioners in contending as though a larger question of
public interest is involved is not acceptable.
</p>
<p id="p_31">		14.Further,  it will have to be held that a private interest
litigation as between the petitioners and the third respondent is sought to be
portrayed as a public interest litigation in order to cover up their lapses in
not having diligently worked out their remedies under the provisions of the
above referred to enactments.  When once we reach the above said conclusion and
state that there is no Constitutional infirmities as attempted to be portrayed
by the petitioners nor was any public interest involved in this writ petition,
it will have to be held that the petitioners have only attempted to abuse the
process of this Court by resorting to filing of this writ petition.  When we are
on this, it will be appropriate to refer to a recent decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court reported in 2007(2) SCJ 162 (<a href="/doc/578362/" id="a_72">Neetu  vs.  State of Punjab and
others</a>).  In paragraphs 6, 7 and 10 of the said judgment, sufficient guidelines
have been indicated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court to weed out such frivolous and
private interest litigations in order to ensure that precious  time of the Court
is not wasted by entertaining such reckless litigations.
</p>
<p id="p_32">		15.The relevant part of paragraphs 6, 7 and 10 of the judgment are
extracted here under.
</p><p id="p_33">	"6..... No litigant has a right to unlimited draught on the Court time and
public money in order to get his affairs settled in the manner as he wishes.
Easy access to justice should not be misused as a licence to file misconceived
and frivolous petitions.  ...  Today people rush to Courts to file cases in
profusion under this attractive name of public interest.  They must inspire
confidence in Courts and among the public.
</p>
<p id="p_34">	7.....Though the parameters of public interest litigation have been
indicated by this Court in large number of cases, yet unmindful of the real
intentions and objectives, High Courts are entertaining such petitions and
wasting valuable judicial time which, as noted above, could be otherwise
utilized for disposal of genuine cases.  Though in <a href="/doc/309358/" id="a_73">Dr.Duryodhan  Sahu and Others
v. Jitendra Kumar Mishra and others</a> (AIR 1999 SC 114), this Court held that in
service matters PILs should not be entertained, the inflow of so-called PILs
involving service matters continues unabated in the Courts and strangely are
entertained.  The least the High Courts could do is to throw them out on the
basis of the said decision. ....

<p id="p_36">	10.Public interest litigation is a weapon which has to be used with great
care and circumspection and the judiciary has to be extremely careful to see
that behind the beautiful veil of public interest an ugly private malice, vested
interest and/or publicity seeking is not lurking.  It is to be used as an
effective weapon in the armory of law for delivering social justice to the
citizens.  The attractive brand name of public interest litigation should not be
allowed to be used for suspicious products of mischief.  It should be aimed at
redressal of genuine public wrong or public injury and not publicity oriented or
founded on personal vendetta. As indicated above, Court must be careful to see
that a body of persons or member of public, who approaches the court is acting
bona fide and not for personal gain or private motive or political motivation or
other oblique consideration.  The court must not allow its process to be abused
for oblique considerations by masked phantoms who monitor at time from behind.
Some persons with vested interest indulge in the pastime of meddling with
judicial process either by force of habit or from improper motives and try to
bargain for a good deal as well to enrich themselves.  Often they are actuated
by a desire to win notoriety or cheap popularity.  The petitions of such busy
bodies deserve to be thrown out by rejection at the threshold, and in
appropriate cases with exemplary costs."
</p>
<p id="p_37">		16.Having regard to our above conclusion in holding that there was
no Constitutional infirmity as contended by the petitioners in this petition and
that there is no element of public interest involved and that the grievance of
the petitioners are purely personal, namely  it is only as between the
petitioners and the third respondent, we are constrained to hold that the
present attempt of the petitioners in having preferred this writ petition,
without working out their remedy either under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_74">Maternity
Benefit Act</a>, 1961 or under the 1996 Act, would render this writ petition not
maintainable.  Inasmuch as the writ petition has been designedly moved by the
petitioners as a public interest litigation in order to agitate their private
interest litigation as between them and the third respondent and since
considerable time of this Court was wasted by resorting to such a frivolous
litigation, we feel that the petitioners should be directed to pay exemplary
costs.  While dismissing this writ petition, it will be relevant to state that
both the petitioners are fully qualified engineers.  Therefore, it cannot be
said that the petitioners were ignorant of law or that they were not in a
position to work out their remedies either under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_75">Maternity
Benefit Act</a>, 1961 or under the 1996 Act.  Therefore, we are unable to state that
the petitioners had moved this Court unknowing of the concept of PIL in order to
simply dismiss the writ petition,  while pointing out the remedies available to
them under the above referred to statutory enactments.
</p>
<p id="p_38">		17.Having regard to our conclusions, we do not find any need or
necessity to refer to the various decisions relied upon by the learned counsel
for the petitioners which related to the infringement or otherwise of the
parties rights, vis-a-vis the relevant service regulations.  In the case on
hand, the rights of the parties, namely the petitioners, were governed by the
provisions of <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_76">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, 1961 and the 1996 Act.  The petitioners
knowing full well of the benefits and the remedies available under the above
referred to enactments and having failed to work out the same in the manner
prescribed thereto they cannot be permitted to seek for the redressal of the
very same grievance by merely preferring the litigation in the form of 'public
interest litigation'.  Therefore, we hold that none of the decisions relied upon
by the learned counsel for the petitioners on that score will be of any
assistance to the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_39">		18.The reliance placed upon the decision reported in 2007(2) CTC 135
</p><p id="p_40">- <a href="/doc/1608802/" id="a_77">Munivenkatappa, M.S.  v.  State Bank of India</a> to contend that mere
availability of an alternative remedy cannot be a ground for rejecting the writ
petition, will not also hold good since in the case on hand it cannot be held
that the grievances of the petitioners are of such an extraordinary or extreme
magnitude so as to hold that such a grievance should be redressed by invoking
the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court available under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_78">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution.   On the other hand, as has been stated by us in the earlier part
of this order, the various provisions contained in the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_79">Maternity Benefit Act</a>,
1961 and the 1996 Act provide for a very elaborate safeguards to protect
whatever deprivation in the form of benefit that would have been available to
the petitioners when the first petitioner was performing her contractual
obligations to the third respondent pursuant to the so-called intellectual
property agreement.  Therefore, when the petitioners have deliberately failed to
avail such statutory benefits in the manner prescribed under the relevant
enactments, on that score it cannot be held that an extraordinary situation
prevail so as to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_80">Article 226</a> of the
Constitution.   For the very same reasons, we are not in a position to refer to
the other decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners.
</p>
<p id="p_41">		19.Looked at from any angle, we are not convinced of the
petitioners' claim that the petitioners are entitled for any relief in this writ
petition, dehors the remedies available to the petitioners under the provisions
of the <a href="/doc/600217/" id="a_81">Maternity Benefit Act</a>, 1961 and the 1996 Act.
</p><p id="p_42">		20.Therefore, the writ petition deserves to be dismissed and
accordingly dismissed with a costs of Rs.5,000/- (Rupees five thousand only)
payable to the Mediation and Conciliation Centre, Madurai Bench of Madras High
Court, Madurai within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of a copy
of this order. Consequently, connected M.P.(MD)Nos.2 and 3 are also dismissed.
