    CORAM: JUSTICE S. MURALIDHAR

                                            JUDGMENT
</pre><p id="p_1">                                             30.03.2012

Introduction
</p><p id="p_2">1. These are three petitions under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_1">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and
<a href="/doc/1306164/" id="a_2">Conciliation Act</a>, 1996 ('Act') arising out of the proceedings in which a final
Award dated 10th March 2011 was passed by the Arbitral Tribunal
('Tribunal') constituted under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC
International Court of Arbitration.
</p>

<p id="p_3">2. OMP No.414 of 2011 is by Vale Australia Pty Ltd. ('Vale') formerly
known as CVRD Australia Pty Ltd. and OMP No.415 of 2011 is by AMCI
Pty Ltd. ('AMCI'). Both petitions challenge the final Award dated 10th
March 2011 whereby the Tribunal allowed the claim of Respondent No.1 -
</p><span class="hidden_text" id="span_1">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011           Page 2 of 46</span>
<p id="p_4"> Steel Authority of India Ltd. ('SAIL') for damages and held that Vale and
AMCI were liable to pay SAIL damages equivalent to US Dollar ('USD')
152,270,789.10, simple interest on the said sum at the rate of 2.335364% per
annum pendente lite from 2nd April 2009 till the date of the Award
aggregating to USD 6,897,815.48, 80% of the SAIL's legal costs and
expenses in the sum of USD 320,000 and a sum of USD 160,000 being the
advance on costs paid by the SAIL to ICC.
</p>

<p id="p_5">3. After the final Award was passed, both Vale and AMCI filed separate
applications on 7th April 2011 under <a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_3">Section 33</a> of the Act praying for an
additional award on the issue of interest for the post-Award period. These
applications were rejected by the Tribunal on 16th May 2011 clarifying that
the Tribunal had "consciously omitted to make any direction on post-Award
interest in the final Award". AMCI has filed a separate petition being OMP
No.451 of 2011 under <a href="/doc/1722761/" id="a_4">Section 34</a> of the Act challenging the aforementioned
Order dated 16th May 2011.
</p>

<p id="p_6">Background Facts
</p><p id="p_7">4. Vale is a company incorporated in Australia having its registered office at
Brisbane. It was formerly known as AMCI Australia Pty. Ltd. It was
renamed as CVRD Australia Pty. Ltd. and thereafter as Vale after the CVRD
Group acquired the shares of AMCI Holding Australia Pty. Ltd., the parent
Company of AMCI Australia Pty Ltd. pursuant to an agreement executed on
24th February 2007. AMCI Australia Pty. Ltd. was acting both as the coal
producer and seller in terms of the earlier agreements executed between
AMCI Australia Pty Ltd. and SAIL as well as under the Long Term
Agreement ('LTA') dated 23rd April 2007 (LTA 217/2007) between the
parties which forms the subject matter of the present dispute. After the
acquisition by the CVRD Group of Vale, Vale acted as the producer under
the Agreement and AMCI Pty. Ltd. (AMCI) which was the newly formed
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_2">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011           Page 3 of 46</span>
 subsidiary of AMCI Australia Pty. Ltd. was to act as the seller. In other
words, under the present arrangement, Vale was the producer of coal and
AMCI was the seller.
</p>

<p id="p_8">5. By an Agreement dated 22nd June 2004 and by a subsequent Agreement
dated 12th April 2005 Vale, then known as AMCI Australia Pty Ltd., had
completed supplies of coking coal to SAIL. Under the LTA in question dated
23rd April 2007, Vale and AMCI agreed to supply SAIL 750,000 Metric
Tonnes ('MT') of Broad-Borough medium volatile hard coking coal.
Pursuant to an amendment dated 7th June 2007, Vale and AMCI were jointly
responsible to supply the contracted hard coking coal, with Vale acting as the
producer and AMCI the seller.
</p>

<p id="p_9">6. In terms of Clauses 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 of the LTA 750,000 MT plus/minus
10%, plus 250,000 MT at SAIL's option, was to be supplied by Vale and
AMCI to SAIL within the delivery period from July 2007 to June 2008
[hereinafter referred to as 'the First Delivery Period' (FDP)] at a price of
USD 96.45 per MT ('PMT') FOB. In terms of Clause 2, the price for the later
delivery periods was to be mutually fixed prior to the commencement of the
delivery period. Clause 1 of the LTA specified that Broad-Borough Medium
Volatile hard coking coal was to be a blend of 50% Carborough Downs hard
coking coal and 50% Broadlea hard coking coal.
</p>

<p id="p_10">7.    On 26th March 2007, SAIL exercised its option for purchase of an
additional quantity of 250,000 MT Broad-Borough hard coking coal for
supply during the FDP. Vale and AMCI supplied 246,539 MT of the
contracted hard coking coal during the FDP between 1st September 2007 and
21st March 2008. Disputes arose between Vale and AMCI on the one hand
and SAIL on the other regarding the supply of the balance 753,461 MT.
SAIL's case was that there was a deliberate breach of the LTA by Vale and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_3">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011           Page 4 of 46</span>
 AMCI in not meeting the target supplies in the FDP since there was a
manifold rise in the price of coal from USD 96.45 PMT to USD 400 PMT
FOB during the relevant period 2007-08. SAIL's case is that as a result it had
to procure the balance quantity from other sources at a price much higher
than the market price at the risk and cost of Vale and AMCI.
</p>

<p id="p_11">8. Under Clause 2.2 of the LTA "price shall be firm and not be subject to
any escalation for any reason, whatsoever, until the completion of delivery of
the entire Agreement quantity due for delivery in the relevant delivery period
with such extensions as might be mutually agreed upon between the
purchaser and seller." Under Para 1.2 of the General Conditions of the
Agreement ('GCA'), it was stated that "quantities which are delayed and are
delivered after expiry of the relevant delivery period shall not attract price
adjustment and shall be supplied at the price fixed for the relevant delivery
period subject to provisions of Clause 2.2 of the Agreement." Para 7.1 of the
GCA stated that "The period of delivery is of the essence of this Agreement."
Under Para 8.1 of the GCA, upon the seller's failure to deliver the required
materials within the time specified in the Agreement, the seller would have to
pay the liquidated damages (not by way of penalty), a sum equivalent to one
percent of the price of any materials which the seller has failed to deliver for
each and every month of delay or part thereof provided, however, such
liquidated damages ('LD') shall not apply to any period of extension granted
by the purchaser under the force majeure condition. The maximum amount
of LD levied on any shipment will not exceed 10% of the value of the
materials in that shipment. Further, delivery of materials, after the same was
to become liable for levy of LD under the said clause, "shall not operate as a
waiver of the Purchaser's right to levy liquidated damages."
</p>

<p id="p_12">9. Para 9 of GCA concerned risk purchase. Para 9.1 read as under:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_1">              "9.1 If the Seller in any manner or otherwise neglects or fails
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_4">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011               Page 5 of 46</span>
       to perform the Agreement, the Purchaser after having come to know
      of such negligence or non-performance after giving a notice shall
      take such action as it considers fit including taking any risk purchase
      action for supply of similar materials at the risk and cost of the
      Seller."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_13">10.      Under Para 12.1 of the GCA if the Agreement did not meet the
objectives set out therein and upon mutual agreement between the parties, it
could be foreclosed. Para 20.1 of the GCA contained an arbitration
agreement whereby all disputes arising in connection with the Agreement
were to be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International
Chamber of Commerce, Paris by the Sole Arbitrator appointed in accordance
with the said Rules. The Award made pursuant thereto was to be binding on
the parties. The Arbitrator was to give reasons for the award. The place of
Arbitration was to be New Delhi, India. Under Para 21.1 of the GCA, the
Agreement was to be governed by and construed according to the laws of
India for the time being in force.
</p>

<p id="p_14">Arbitral proceedings
</p><p id="p_15">11. SAIL submitted its request for arbitration to the ICC on 31st March 2009.
The ICC International Court of Arbitration appointed Professor Lawrence G.
S. Boo as the Sole Arbitrator in accordance with <a href="/doc/419534/" id="a_5">Article 9(3)</a> of the ICC
Rules at its session on 11th June 2009.
</p>

<p id="p_16">12. SAIL's claim as it initially submitted to the Tribunal included a claim for
a sum of USD 153,440,000 for non-supply of the contracted quantity of
753,461 MT. This was computed as the total of the excess price PMT paid
for different quantities i.e. USD 203.55 (USD 300 - USD 96.45 for 605,240
tonnes); 204.45 (USD300.90 - USD 96.45 for 148,221 tonnes). SAIL also
claimed unpaid demurrage charges pursuant to Bill of Lading dated 21st
February 2008 (Hardwar Shipment) in the sum of USD 950,000. In addition

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_5">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011               Page 6 of 46</span>
 to the above two claims, SAIL had initially claimed USD 7,260,000 as LD in
terms of Para 8 of the GCA and USD 50,000 being the sum incurred on
account of extra efforts to obtain the contracted material from alternate
sources. The last two claims were given up at the final closing submissions
by SAIL. The revised claim was for the sum of USD 153,440,000 for non-
supply of contracted tonnage based on the excess PMT paid over the contract
price and USD 950,000 towards unpaid demurrage charges for the vessel
Hardwar and interest at 12.75% per annum from April 2008 till the date of
realization and cost of arbitration.
</p>

<p id="p_17">13. The above claims were resisted by Vale and AMCI on the ground that on
account of the failure by SAIL to issue them a risk purchase notice under
Clause 9.1 of the GCA, no claim for risk purchase could be sustained. SAIL
had agreed to accept alternate supply of coal and had thereby discharged both
Vale and AMCI from further obligation to supply the hard coking coal for
the FDP. SAIL had itself granted extension of time for performance of the
contract without reserving its rights. Therefore, Vale and AMCI were not in
breach of the contract. It was contended that the letters dated 22nd and 31st
October 2008 and 1st December 2008 from SAIL to Vale and AMCI
manifested the intention on the part of SAIL "to recognize or to accept the
promise of the performance of the alternate obligation" by Vale and AMCI.
SAIL had elected for performance and not opted to void the LTA. SAIL was,
thus, estopped from alleging any breach by Vale and AMCI. It was further
contended that the ongoing participation, negotiation and continued
insistence upon specific performance by SAIL after the alleged date of risk
purchase was inconsistent with the risk purchase claimed. Therefore, SAIL
had lost or alternatively waived its right to claim damages towards risk
purchase. It was also inconsistent with its claim for LD. It was specifically
pleaded by Vale and AMCI that SAIL had failed to mitigate the loss and that
SAIL had not established that it had made risk purchase. The claims for risk
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_6">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011          Page 7 of 46</span>
 purchase were not properly documented. The documents tendered by SAIL
made no reference to the risk purchase. It was likely that SAIL had made the
purchase pursuant to the existing LTAs with other Long Term Suppliers
(LTSs) which were not risk purchases under the contract. SAIL's claim for
LD was resisted on the ground that there were no particulars to substantiate
such a claim. Also while extending the time for performance of the contract,
SAIL had made no reservation of its right to claim LD for the delay. SAIL
had not suffered any loss on account of delay and had not pleaded loss. The
claim for LD was inconsistent with the claim for risk purchase. Since the
contract did not provide for payment of interest, there was no basis for the
claim on that score. In any event, the rate of interest claimed was excessive.

<p id="p_20">The Arbitral Award
</p><p id="p_21">15.      The impugned Award answered issue (a) in the negative. After
examining the correspondence exchanged between the parties and after
discussing the decisions of the Indian Courts interpreting <a href="/doc/679619/" id="a_6">Sections 55</a> and <a href="/doc/1105874/" id="a_7">63</a>
of the Contract Act 1872, the Tribunal concluded that while due consideration
was given by SAIL to the proposals of Vale and AMCI to fulfill their
contractual commitments, none of them came to fruition and the time for the
performance of contract was never extended by SAIL. In particular, it was
held that "no carryover of the First Delivery Period was ever agreed". It was
held that the alleged extension of time to be granted by the non-defaulting
party had to be "categorical in nature, rather being vague or on the anvil of
presumptions". It was further held that a mere call by SAIL (through its
counsel's letter dated 20th January 2009) to Vale and AMCI to perform their
contractual obligation in accordance with the terms of the contract would not
amount to an extension of time or a waiver of late performance.
</p>

<p id="p_22">16. The impugned Award answered issue (b) in the negative. It was held that
SAIL had not accepted the promise of Vale and AMCI to supply an alternate
quality of coal. Issue (c) was answered in the negative by holding that SAIL
had not dispensed with the strict performance of the contract. Issue (d) was
answered in the negative by holding that SAIL had not waived and was not
estopped from claiming any remedy for the non-performance of the contract
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 10 of 46</span>
 by Vale and AMCI. Issue (e) was answered in the affirmative. It was held
that the notice dated 20th January 2009 by SAIL's lawyer to Vale and AMCI
was properly given. Its effect was, however, minimal and did not affect the
parties' rights whatsoever in the arbitration. It was concluded by the Tribunal
that the balance of the contracted materials of 753,461 MT had not been
delivered to SAIL within the First Delivery Period. Vale and AMCI did not
offer any reason or explanation to account for such failure. It followed that
they were in breach of the contract dated 23rd April 2007.
</p>

<p id="p_23">17. As regards issues (f) and (g) , the Tribunal found that the invitation by
SAIL to AMCI and Vale to attend the meeting of the Empowered Joint
Committee ('EJC') would not itself constitute sufficient notice of risk
purchase which was required to be given under Para 9 of the GCA. However,
the Tribunal answered issue (h) in the affirmative and held that Vale and
AMCI had waived notice under Para 9 of the GCA by letter dated 18th
December 2007. SAIL was thereafter not required to comply with the
requirement of prior notice for making risk purchase. The Tribunal further
held that by merely asking Vale and AMCI to comply with their contractual
obligation, SAIL had elected not to go in for risk purchase or to exercise its
other remedies. Answering issue (j) in the negative, the Tribunal held that
there was no affirmation of the contract by SAIL and its actions or omissions
did not preclude it "from taking all actions including risk purchase action for
the undelivered balance of the Materials due under the First Delivery Period."
</p>

<p id="p_24">18. As regards issue (i), the Tribunal held that SAIL had consciously decided
to purchase 800,000 MT of hard coking coal to cover the amount of coal not
delivered by AMCI and Vale. On the issue of similarity of the coking coal
purchased by SAIL from its three LTSs i.e. BHP Billiton Marketing AG
('BHP'), Anglo Coal Australia Pty Ltd. ('Anglo') and Peabody Energy
Australia Coal Pty Ltd. ('Peabody'), it was held that the differences in quality
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 11 of 46</span>
 were not substantial. On issue (l), the Tribunal held that SAIL had done all it
could to minimize its loss by purchasing replacement coal from its LTSs
instead of the spot market. On issue (k), it was held that SAIL had suffered
loss and damage amounting to USD 152,270,789.10.
</p>

<p id="p_25">19.      SAIL did not press its claim for LD. Also, at the stage of final
submissions SAIL elected to abandon the claim for expenditure. Thus issues
</p><p id="p_26">(m) to (q) were not required to be decided. SAIL's claim for demurrage issues
</p><p id="p_27">(r) and (s) were rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_28">20. As regards the claim for pendente lite interest [issue (t)], the Tribunal
awarded SAIL the LIBOR interest rate + 1.25% i.e. at 2.335364% on USD
152,270,789.10 from the date of request for arbitration (2nd April 2009) till
the date of the Award. As regards the cost of arbitration [issue (u)], it was
held that Vale and AMCI had to bear the whole of the cost and accordingly,
the Arbitrator directed that USD 160,000 be paid to SAIL being the cost paid
to the ICC. As regards the legal costs incurred by SAIL, the Tribunal held
that Vale and AMCI should pay 80% of the cost incurred.
</p>

<p id="p_29">21. SAIL has accepted the impugned Award and has not challenged the
rejection of its claim for demurrage. The present petitions by AMCI and Vale
challenge the findings of the learned Arbitrator on issues (a) to (e) [regarding
breach of the contract by them], on issues (f) to (l) [concerning risk purchase
damages], issues (t) and (u) [concerning interest, cost of arbitration and legal
costs] and to the extent that both the applications of AMCI and Vale under
<a href="/doc/1393668/" id="a_8">Section 33</a> of the Act were rejected by the Tribunal by the further Order dated
16th May 2011 clarifying that the Tribunal had "consciously omitted to make
any direction on post-Award interest in the final Award".

<p id="p_30">22. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Arvind Nigam, Senior
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_11">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 12 of 46</span>
 Advocate and Mr. Amit Sibal, Advocate for Vale, Mr. Rajiv Nayar, Senior
Advocate for AMCI, Mr. A.K. Ganguli and Mr. Sanjay Jain, Senior
Advocates and Mr. Sunil K. Jain, Advocate for SAIL.
</p>

<p id="p_31">23. The Court proposes to consider the submissions issue-wise in the same
order as the Tribunal did. Issues (a) to (d) concerned the failure of Vale and
AMCI to meet their respective obligations under Contract No. 217 of 2007
dated 23rd April 2007. It was held by the Tribunal that (a) SAIL had not
extended the time for the supply to be made by Vale and AMCI under the
FDP; (b) SAIL had not accepted their offer to supply alternate quality of
coal; (c) that SAIL had not dispensed with strict performance of the contract
and (d) that SAIL was not estopped from claiming remedies for non-
performance of contract by Vale and AMCI.

<p id="p_32">Scope of the Court's jurisdiction under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_9">Section 34</a> of the Act
</p><p id="p_33">24. Before commencing the exercise of examining the correctness of the
impugned Award, it is necessary to recapitulate the settled principles of law
regarding the scope of the powers of the Court under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_10">Section 34</a> of the Act.
<a href="/doc/996348/" id="a_11">In McDermott International Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd</a>. (2006) 11 SCC
181 the Supreme Court traced the change in the parameters for judicial
review of arbitral awards from the 1940 Act to the 1996 Act as under (SCC,
p. 209):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">    "58. <a href="/doc/86594/" id="a_12">In Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co</a>.1994 Supp (1)
    SCC 644, this Court laid down that the arbitral award can be set aside if it
    is contrary to (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; (b) the interests of
    India; or (c) justice or morality. A narrower meaning to the expression
    "public policy" was given therein by confining judicial review of the
    arbitral award only on the aforementioned three grounds. An apparent
    shift can, however, be noticed from the decision of this Court in ONGC
    Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (2003) 5 SCC 705 (for short "ONGC"). This Court
    therein referred to an earlier decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/477313/" id="a_13">Central Inland
    Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly</a> (1986) 3 SCC 156
    wherein the applicability of the expression "public policy" on the
    touchstone of <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_14">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act and <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_15">Article 14</a> of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_12">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 13 of 46</span>
     Constitution of India came to be considered. This Court therein was
    dealing with unequal bargaining power of the workmen and the employer
    and came to the conclusion that any term of the agreement which is
    patently arbitrary and/or otherwise arrived at because of the unequal
    bargaining power would not only be ultra vires <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_16">Article 14</a> of the
    Constitution of India but also hit by <a href="/doc/1625889/" id="a_17">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act.
    In ONGC this Court, apart from the three grounds stated in Renusagar,
    added another ground thereto for exercise of the court's jurisdiction in
    setting aside the award if it is patently arbitrary.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_25">    59. Such patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter. The
    public policy violation, indisputably, should be so unfair and
    unreasonable as to shock the conscience of the court. Where the arbitrator,
    however, has gone contrary to or beyond the expressed law of the contract
    or granted relief in the matter not in dispute would come within the
    purview of <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_18">Section 34</a> of the Act. However, we would consider the
    applicability of the aforementioned principles while noticing the merits of
    the matter.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_26">    60. What would constitute public policy is a matter dependant upon the
    nature of transaction and nature of statute. For the said purpose, the
    pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would be
    relevant to enable the court to judge what is in public good or public
    interest, and what would otherwise be injurious to the public good at the
    relevant point, as contradistinguished from the policy of a particular
    Government. (<a href="/doc/1422834/" id="a_19">See State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nahata</a> (2005) 12 SCC
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_27">    77)

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_28">    61. In ONGC this Court observed: (SCC pp. 727-28, para 31)

         "31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase 'public policy of India'
         used in <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_20">Section 34</a> in context is required to be given a wider
         meaning. It can be stated that the concept of public policy
         connotes some matter which concerns public good and the public
         interest. What is for public good or in public interest or what
         would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public
         interest has varied from time to time. However, the award which
         is, on the face of it, patently in violation of statutory provisions
         cannot be said to be in public interest. Such
         award/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect the
         administration of justice. Hence, in our view in addition to
         narrower meaning given to the term 'public policy' in Renusagar
         case it is required to be held that the award could be set aside if it

          is patently illegal. The result would be--award could be set aside
         if it is contrary to:

<blockquote id="blockquote_33">    Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial
    nature it cannot be held that award is against the public policy. Award
    could also be set aside if it is so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the
    conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and is
    required to be adjudged void."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_34">25. Significantly, in McDermott International Inc., the Supreme Court was
careful to highlight that the ONGC grounds of challenge were an addition to
the grounds earlier listed in Renusagar. Those grounds have been reiterated
in a large number of decisions and summarised in <a href="/doc/455122/" id="a_21">Steel Authority of India
Limited v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Limited</a> (2009) 10 SCC 63 (SCC, p.
</p><p id="p_35">78):
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">    "(i) In a case where an arbitrator travels beyond the contract, the
    award would be without jurisdiction and would amount to legal
    misconduct and because of which the award would become amenable
    for being set aside by a court.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_35">    (ii) An error relatable to interpretation of the contract by an arbitrator
    is an error within his jurisdiction and such error is not amenable to
    correction by courts as such error is not an error on the face of the
    award.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">    (iii) If a specific question of law is submitted to the arbitrator and he
    answers it, the fact that the answer involves an erroneous decision in
    point of law does not make the award bad on its face.

<blockquote id="blockquote_37">    (iv) An award contrary to substantive provision of law or against the
    terms of contract would be patently illegal.

     breach can only claim the sum specified in the contract and not in
    excess thereof. In other words, no award of compensation in case of
    breach of contract, if named or specified in the contract, could be
    awarded in excess thereof.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_39">    (vi) If the conclusion of the arbitrator is based on a possible view of
    the matter, the court should not interfere with the award.

<blockquote id="blockquote_40">    (vii) It is not permissible to a court to examine the correctness of the
    findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
    findings."
</blockquote>

<p id="p_36">26. The proceedings under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_22">Section 34</a> are certainly not of an appellate
nature. <a href="/doc/478091/" id="a_23">In P.R. Shah, Shares &amp; Stock Broker v. M/s. B.H.H. Securities (P)
Ltd</a>. 2011 (11) SCALE 668, the Supreme Court held: "A court does not sit in
appeal over the award of an arbitral tribunal by re-assessing or re-
appreciating the evidence." <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_24">Section 34</a> is not meant to clothe the Court with
anything more than a power of limited judicial review, the width of which is
definitely less than that of an appellate court. Considering that the essential
thrust of the 1996 Act was to minimize judicial interference, where the court
is satisfied that the parties have had a full-fledged opportunity of a hearing on
facts and law, including examination of witnesses, followed by a detailed
reasoned Award issue-wise, the Court should be reluctant to easily interfere.
The threshold set in ONGC by the Supreme Court and further elaborated in
McDermott International Inc., has to necessarily be high. The illegality has
to be "patent" or "go to the root of the matter". Otherwise, every petition
under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_25">Section 34</a> of the Act would end up being argued as an appeal, which
definitely was not the legislative intent behind <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_26">Section 34</a>. Also, since
arbitration as an alternative to judicial proceedings was intended to be both
efficacious and expeditious, converting the proceedings under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_27">Section 34</a> to
that of an appeal on facts and law would defeat that objective.
</p>

<p id="p_37">27. The Court proceeds to examine the challenge to the impugned Award in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_15">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011              Page 16 of 46</span>
 light of the parameters delineated in the above decisions of the Supreme
Court.
</p>

<p id="p_38">Were Vale and AMCI in breach of the LTA?
</p><p id="p_39">28. Issues (a) to (e) were grouped under the broader issue whether Vale and
AMCI were in breach of the LTA? The defence of AMCI and Vale was that
SAIL had impliedly granted extension of time for performance and chose to
insist on performance rather than voiding the contract. Issue (a) therefore was
whether in fact there was such extension of time granted by SAIL? Vale and
AMCI submitted that the Tribunal's finding that there was nothing to suggest
that SAIL had granted an extension of time or had acquiesced for time to "go
by" is against the evidence on record, in particular SAIL's letters of 22nd and
31st October 2008, 1st December 2008 and 20th January 2009. Further it is
submitted that SAIL's witness Mr. Rawat had in respect of the aforesaid
letters admitted that in effect SAIL had offered an opportunity to Vale to
supply the balance quantity.
</p>

<p id="p_40">29. There were two specific submissions by Vale and AMCI in this regard.
One was that by extending the time for performance of the contract SAIL had
dispensed with requirement for timely performance of the contract.
Reference was made to <a href="/doc/679619/" id="a_28">Sections 55</a> and <a href="/doc/1105874/" id="a_29">63</a> of the Contract Act by pointing
out that there was no avoidance of the contract by SAIL, which in the
circumstances was one option available to it. Reliance is placed on the
decisions in <a href="/doc/1519151/" id="a_30">Muhammad Habidullah v. Bird &amp; Co</a>. AIR 1922 Privy Council
178; <a href="/doc/893062/" id="a_31">Kailash Nath and Associates v. Delhi Development Authority</a> 2007

Enterprises v. Union of India</a> (1999) 9 SCC 449. Secondly, it is submitted
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_16">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 17 of 46</span>
 that <a href="/doc/1105874/" id="a_36">Section 63</a> of the Contract Act does not require any bilateral agreement
for dispensation of performance. It entitles a promisee to dispense with strict
performance of the contract and the promisor would then not be held liable
for non- performance of the original obligation. In this regard, reliance is
placed on the decisions in Todarmal v. Chironjilal AIR 1956 M.B. 25 and
<a href="/doc/734096/" id="a_37">Mt. Jamnubai v. Murlidhar</a> AIR 1946 Nagpur 148. It is pointed out that in
para 66 of the Award, the Tribunal noted AMCI's argument that time being
of the essence of the contract then upon non-performance, the contract
becomes voidable at the option of the promisee and that in such a case the
only right under <a href="/doc/679619/" id="a_38">Section 55</a> of the Indian Contract Act which the promisee
has is to avoid the contract. It is submitted that this argument was based upon
the judgment of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in <a href="/doc/250150/" id="a_39">T. Venkata Reddy v.
Vegesana</a> AIR 1968 AP 190. The Tribunal however wrongly assumed that
AMCI's argument was "culled from Privy Council's remarks" in
<a href="/doc/1519151/" id="a_40">Muhammad Habidullah v. Bird &amp; Co</a>. and held in Para 67 that there was
nothing in the said judgment to substantiate AMCI's argument. It is
accordingly submitted that the Tribunal rejected the plea available in law on
a totally misconceived premise.
</p>

<p id="p_41">30. The facts relevant for the first set of issues are that under the LTA dated
23rd April 2007 Vale and AMCI were required to deliver to SAIL 1 million
MT of hard coking coal during the FDP July 2007 to June 2008. In response
to a query from SAIL on 18th May 2007 whether Vale and AMCI would be
willing to supply any additional quantity for the FDP, AMCI replied the
same day citing restricted port allocation at the Dalrymple Bay Coal
Terminal (DBCT) which was undergoing expansion of its facilities and
upgrade of its loading capacity. This meant no supplies during July 2007 but
deferred coal supplies of 100,000 MT during the months of August, October
and December 2007 in two batches of 50,000 MT each month. SAIL wrote
to AMCI on 19th May 2007 reminding it that it was required to supply evenly
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 18 of 46</span>
 at least 85,000 MT per month continuously in order to meet the LTA
obligations and that other Australian LTSs, were despite the port restrictions
at DBCT, not prevented from supplying not less than the pro rata quantity
during the same period. SAIL requested that supply of at least 100,000 MT
be made per month. AMCI by its reply dated 20th May 2007 however
expressed inability to offer additional quantities due to port restrictions.
There was a continuous exchange of correspondence thereafter between the
parties with the explanations offered by AMCI and Vale for not meeting the
target supplies under the LTA ranging from technical problems with the coal
processing equipment to high demurrage rates and restricted port allocation
at DBCT. As a result the supply targets under the LTA were progressively
reduced to 300,000 MT by December 2007 (instead of 500,000 MT) and then
further down to 250,000 and 200,000 MT. In the third quarter of the FDP it
was 150,000MT and finally down to nil supplies in the last quarter of the
FDP 2007-08. During this period from May 2007 till May 2008 the market
price of hard coking coal sharply rose from USD 96.45 PMT to USD 400
PMT.
</p>

<p id="p_42">31. It is in the above background of continuous exchange of letters between
the parties before and after the letter dated 18th December 2007 of AMCI,
that the said letter had to be viewed. By the said letter AMCI informed SAIL
that due to the delay in completion of the expansion of the port of DBCT
they had not been able to get access to the port allocation and "this port
allocation has been permanently lost." Further, "with the delay of January to
March period, 1/4th of this capacity has been lost i.e. 500,000 MT has been
lost. In an effort to treat all customers fairly, we had allocated 50% of this
allocation to the SAIL business, therefore our ability to perform the above
mentioned agreement has been permanently reduced to 300 kt." AMCI made
it clear therefore that it would not be able to deliver 0.3 million MT of hard
coking coal as contracted under the LTA dated 23rd April 2007 in the FDP. It
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011           Page 19 of 46</span>
 had "tentatively planned" a shipping schedule for the 0.7 million MT to be
supplied between July 2007 and June 2008. AMCI requested deferral of "all
tonnage commitments for the 2008 and 2009 contract years with resumption
of deliveries in 2010." It was emphasised that AMCI and Vale had "very
little confidence in the availability of port capacity in the near to medium
term." They were impelled to "advise SAIL as early as possible so that SAIL
is able to consider any other sourcing options that may be available."
</p>

<p id="p_43">32. This was followed by a series of letters exchanged between the parties
which has been tabulated by the Tribunal in para 61 of the Award. Since in
support of their submissions Vale and AMCI have particularly referred to the
letters dated 22nd and 31st October 2008, 1st December 2008 and 20 January
2009 from SAIL, those may be briefly examined. By its letter dated 22nd
October 2008 SAIL rejected the offer of Vale and AMCI to foreclose the
contract and asked them to supply the balance contracted quantity of 750,000
MT for the FDP. This by no means was grant of extension of time but
actually a reminder of the default in complying with a contractual obligation.
The letter dated 31st October 2008 was in the nature of a further reminder by
SAIL to Vale and AMCI to honour their supply commitments for the FDP.
The 'conceptual proposal' that Vale and AMCI put forth was rejected by
SAIL by its letter dated 1st December 2008 and they were asked to supply the
balance FDP quantity in "the shortest possible time." It is inconceivable how
this could be viewed as an extension of time for performance. The legal
notice dated 20th January 2009 reminded Vale and AMCI to resume supplies
under the LTA.
</p>

<p id="p_44">33.     The Tribunal concluded, after reviewing the case law in regard to
<a href="/doc/679619/" id="a_41">Sections 55</a> and <a href="/doc/1105874/" id="a_42">63</a> of the Contract Act that the extension of time by the non-
defaulting party had to be "categorical in nature rather than being vague on
the anvil of presumptions." Indeed this is the law explained in Arosan
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 20 of 46</span>
 Enterprises v. Union of India where it was explained that the parties should
"knowingly give a go-by to the stipulation as regards the time" and pointed
out that this may have two effects. Either they may "name a future specific
date for delivery" or "may agree to abandonment of the contract." Either
course of course had to have consensus. In the present case there was no
consensus between the parties that the time for performance would be
extended. There were negotiations but to no result. In the circumstances, the
Tribunal rightly concluded that SAIL's calls for performance was at best an
invitation to redress a breach and would not amount to an extension of time
or "a waiver of late performance." The finding that there was no extension of
time granted by SAIL was the right one as it was based on a correct
understanding of the requirement under Indian law for the defence under
<a href="/doc/679619/" id="a_43">Sections 55</a> and <a href="/doc/1105874/" id="a_44">63</a> of the Contract Act to be availed by the defaulting parties,
which in this case were Vale and AMCI.
</p>

<p id="p_45">34. It is next submitted that the Tribunal erred in holding that SAIL had
never accepted the offer by Vale and AMCI to supply an alternate quality
coal. The facts relevant to this issue are that by letters dated 23rd April, 29th
April and 1st May 2008 Vale and AMCI made it clear that they were not in a
position to supply coal of the quantity and quality as agreed under the LTA.
Going to the spot market to make up for the deficit would have proved too
costly for SAIL and so it turned to its other LTSs. On 11th June 2008 Vale
and AMCI offered what SAIL terms as "soft coking coal" with no
commitments as to quantity or delivery period. On 9th September 2008 Vale
and AMCI offered 300,000 MT of Broadlea specification coking coal to be
delivered within 12 months. But SAIL insisted on a confirmation that the full
balance quantity of 750,000 MT would be supplied. This was not
forthcoming from Vale and AMCI. On 7th November 2008 Vale offered to
combine the FDP and SDP quantities but this was rejected by the
Empowered Joint Committee (EJC) since the offer had elements that were
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011              Page 21 of 46</span>
 "vague and uncertain." It was stated that "there cannot be any question of
novation of the earlier contract based on such premises." The fourth offer
was made on 8th December 2008 for supply of 300,000 MT of Broadlea
coking coal at USD 96.45 but SAIL did not accept it and asked it to resume
supplies of coal as agreed under the LTA.                  The fifth offer was on 2nd
February 2009 for supplying 300,000 MT of Broadlea coal and 450,000MT
of hard coking coal but not specifying the delivery period or price. The sixth
offer was for the entire balance quantity of 750,000 MT of hard coking coal
but again without mentioning the price or delivery period. The Tribunal too
has, in paras 84 to 94 of the Award, analysed the entire correspondence
between the parties in this regard and concluded that SAIL had not accepted
the offer of Vale and AMCI to supply an alternate quality of coal. It is
accordingly concluded that at no time did SAIL dispense with the strict
performance of the contract. The Court is unable to find any error in the
analysis of the evidence or the conclusion of the Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_46">35. Raising the plea of estoppel in law, it is submitted by Vale and AMCI
that the Tribunal did not consider whether SAIL's conduct after June 2008 in
seeking deliveries of 750,000 MT of coal till January 2009 amounted to a
representation to AMCI and Vale that SAIL had not procured risk purchase
coal. According to Vale and AMCI, the question to be answered by the
Tribunal was whether they had acted upon the representation that SAIL had
not undertaken risk purchase action. In para 105 of the Award, the Tribunal
noted that the various proposals given by AMCI and Vale were not based on
any "representation that SAIL would not undertake risk action". It is
submitted that the Tribunal failed to note that the question whether "SAIL
would not undertake risk action" was irrelevant to the defence of estoppel.
According to Vale and AMCI, the relevant question was whether SAIL had
represented to AMCI and Vale, whether by conduct or otherwise, that it had
not undertaken risk purchase (and not that it would not). It is submitted that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011                   Page 22 of 46</span>
 the Tribunals' finding in Para 106 of the Award that AMCI and Vale had not
acted on SAIL's representation, and had suffered no prejudice or detriment,
was without any basis or reasoning. It is submitted that the Impugned Award
is against the principle of promissory estoppel under <a href="/doc/565781/" id="a_45">Section 115</a> of the
Evidence Act, which binds a promisor to his promise if the person to whom
this promise is made acts on that promise. In this regard, reliance is placed on
the decisions in Central London Property v. High Trees (1947) I KB 130;
<a href="/doc/871220/" id="a_46">Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills v. The State of Uttar Pradesh</a> AIR 1979 SC

</p>

<p id="p_47">36. The factual foundation for sustaining a plea of estoppel against SAIL had
not been laid by Vale and AMCI in the arbitral proceedings. They were
unable to show that SAIL had made any representation about not going in for
risk purchase. The very submission that by "seeking deliveries of 750,000
MT of coal till January 2009" SAIL had made a representation to AMCI and
Vale that it "had not procured risk purchase coal" is to say the least, far-
fetched. The correspondence between the parties discussed earlier could not
have left Vale and AMCI in any doubt that they were in breach of their
obligations of the LTA and SAIL was justifiably concerned about their
default. In asking them to honour their commitments under the LTA, SAIL
was making no "representation" about not opting for risk purchase, "by
conduct or otherwise". Their response was not to comply but make offers of
alternate supplies which were not acceptable to SAIL. Neither Vale nor
AMCI altered their positions in any manner or suffered any detriment. In any
event neither placed evidence to prove that proved that it did. The plea of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_22">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 23 of 46</span>
 estoppel raised by Vale and AMCI has been rightly rejected by the Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_48">37.      Vale and AMCI admit that they failed to supply 753,461 MT of
contracted coal during the FDP. They have also not seriously contested the
finding in Issue (e) that SAIL's legal notice dated 20th January 2009 was
properly issued. Vale and AMCI did not examine any witness to explain why
they were unable to complete their supply obligations during the FDP. As
pointed out by the Tribunal, both AMCI and Vale chose to rely only on the
evidence of Mr. Rawat and Mr. Arun Jot Malhotra, who were both SAIL's
witnesses. That evidence has been analysed in great detail by the Tribunal.
This Court is not persuaded to re-appreciate that evidence although it was
read extensively by Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Vale and AMCI.
The scope of the present proceedings under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_50">Section 34</a> does not allow this
Court to go over the entire evidence again and come to a different conclusion
only because it is possible to do so.
</p>

<p id="p_49">38. The Court finds no error in the Tribunal's determination that Vale and
AMCI were in breach of the LTA dated 23rd April 2007.
</p>

<p id="p_50">Risk Purchase Damages
</p><p id="p_51">39. The Tribunal addressed issues (f) to (l) under the broad heading of 'Risk
purchase damages'. It noted in Para 119 that SAIL "had not pleaded its case
to come within the ambit of <a href="/doc/339747/" id="a_51">Section 73</a> (of the <a href="/doc/171398/" id="a_52">Contract Act</a>) for general
damages but have elected to pursue its claim damages under a specific clause
in the conditions of the contract viz., Para 9 GCA." In the context of the
defences raised by Vale and AMCI the Tribunal addressed the issues whether
SAIL had elected for performance of the contract which in turn precluded it
from taking risk purchase action for non-delivery during the FDP [issue (j)];
whether SAIL was required to and in fact did give Vale and AMCI prior
notice of risk purchase under Para 9 GCA [issues (f) and (g)]; whether Vale
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011          Page 24 of 46</span>
 and AMCI had waived the requirement of such notice [issue (h)]; It then
addressed the issue whether SAIL in fact undertook risk purchase under Para
9 GCA [issue (i)]; whether SAIL was entitled to damages on that account
[issue (k)] and whether SAIL had mitigated the loss it alleged to have
suffered [issue (l)].
</p>

<p id="p_52">Election
</p><p id="p_53">40. According to Vale and AMCI, not only did SAIL not give them any
notice of its intention to go in for risk purchase, which in fact, was found to
be the case by the Tribunal but it in fact required both Vale and AMCI to
perform the contract. It is, accordingly, contended that SAIL elected to
pursue with the contract and kept extending the time for Vale and AMCI to
perform their obligations thereunder. It is only in the claim petition that
SAIL adverted to the fact of having undertaken risk purchase. It is submitted
that having elected to affirm the contract and insist on its performance, SAIL
was estopped from invoking the risk purchase clause and making risk
purchase.
</p>

<p id="p_54">41. It is pointed out that when SAIL invited AMCI and Vale for the first
meeting with the EJC, it continued referring to the FDP. It is, therefore,
claimed by Vale and AMCI that risk purchase was not contemplated by SAIL
even at that stage. According to Vale and AMCI, the issue before the
Tribunal was whether SAIL had affirmed the Contract and if so, whether the
affirmation precluded the claim for risk purchase action for non-delivery
during the FDP. It is submitted that the Tribunal did not decide the issue that
was framed for determination. What had been submitted before the Tribunal
was that even assuming SAIL had invoked Para 9 of the GCA and had
procured risk purchase coal, SAIL could not claim damages as it had elected
for and communicated to AMCI and Vale its election of the right to seek
performance of the Contract. The right to seek performance being
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 25 of 46</span>
 inconsistent with the right to claim damages under Para 9 GCA, no damages
could be claimed under the latter right because of election by SAIL of the
former right. According to AMCI the Tribunal, in Para 125 of the Award,
however, assumed AMCI's argument to be that SAIL having elected for
performance, it could not invoke Para 9 of the GCA "to make risk
purchases". Because of this fundamental error in the premise on which the
Tribunal proceeded to decide the issue of election, it concluded in Para 136
of the Award that SAIL was not precluded from taking risk purchase action.
The Tribunal erred in proceeding on the basis that risk purchase action was
undertaken subsequent to SAIL's demands for performance after 22nd
October 2008 whereas SAIL had invoked Para 9 even before it claimed
performance. Reliance is placed on the decisions in <a href="/doc/899309/" id="a_53">National Insurance Co.
Ltd. v. Mastan</a> (2006) 2 SCC 641; <a href="/doc/1048451/" id="a_54">Haridas Mafatlal Gagalbhai v.

</p><p id="p_56">42. The correspondence between the parties reveals that both Vale and
AMCI conceded to their respective inability to make the balance supplies
under the LTA in the FDP. While SAIL cannot be faulted for insisting that
Vale and AMCI should fulfil their contractual obligations, this by no means
can be construed as a waiver by SAIL of its right to seek other appropriate
remedies, including making good of the shortfall from other sources. This
much was known to AMCI and Vale as is evident from the correspondence
between the parties. The email dated 24th April 2008 addressed to AMCI
inviting it to the EJC meeting held on 9th May 2008 was indeed to discuss
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_25">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011         Page 26 of 46</span>
 "the status of supply of coking coal by M/s. AMCI and CVRD to sell during
July 2007 - June 08 delivery period under the existing LT Agreement
No.217/2007." However, it was also for supply of coking coal to be made to
SAIL during the "July 2008 - June 09 delivery periods." While SAIL was
inviting AMCI and Vale to make good the shortfall for the FDP, neither Vale
nor AMCI was ready for this. In its email dated 29th April 2008, AMCI
informed SAIL that it was unable to participate "meaningfully in the EJC
meeting." Vale too indicated that it will not be possible to produce the
necessary coal required under the contract. It further stated that "to the
extent of those discussions impact upon the LT Agreement Number
217/2007, I would be pleased if you could keep me advised." Vale by letter
dated 1st May 2008 reiterated that "we cannot continue to meet the targeted
obligations and our assessments has identified that we cannot meet the
contracted specifications for another at least Mean Max Reflectance, Fluidity
and Vitrinite Percentage going forward."                   Vale attached a copy of the
Boradlea Coking Coal specification which showed deterioration in quality.
Vale stated that "these conditions were not foreseen at the time of the
Agreement No. 27/2007 was entered into." It was stated that in the
circumstances, "we are left with little choice but to suggest foreclosure of the
Agreement 217/2007." Both AMCI and Vale knew the inevitable
consequence of their failure to meet their commitments under the LTA would
mean that SAIL would have to source the shortfall from elsewhere. This in
fact was their advice to SAIL.
</p>

<p id="p_57">43. In the instant case, the Court is unable to read the correspondence
between the parties as implying any waiver by SAIL of its right to seek all
remedies available to it in terms of Para 9.1 GCA including risk purchase "at
the risk and cost of the Seller." SAIL has reiterated in its written submissions
that its claim is "not based on the principle of general damages". It has based
its claim under the risk purchase clause for only the price difference between
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_26">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011                     Page 27 of 46</span>
 the contracted price and the price at which it effected risk purchase. Given
the wording of Para 9.1 GCA it cannot be said that if SAIL opted for risk
purchase it cannot claim damages as envisaged in Para 9.1 itself. Further,
when it was plain that Vale and AMCI were in breach of their obligations
despite being repeatedly asked to comply, SAIL was not precluded from
opting for risk purchase under Para 9.1. The effect of non-compliance with
the requirement of prior notice under Para 9 will be considered hereafter.
However, to the question whether SAIL was precluded from opting for risk
purchase only because it had asked Vale and AMCI to comply with their
obligations under the LTA, which they admittedly failed to, the answer must
be in the negative. When SAIL actually invoked the risk purchase option is
also not determinative of whether it could still claim damages. In other
words, merely because SAIL had already taken steps for risk purchase and
was still asking Vale and AMCI to comply with their contractual obligations
did not preclude SAIL from seeking to be compensated for the risk purchase
under Para 9.1 GCA. These were options available to SAIL which it could
and did exercise. The Tribunal has already discussed the case law cited by
Vale and AMCI in sufficient detail and rightly summarised the position in
Indian law in regard to the doctrine of election.
</p>

<p id="p_58">44. There is merit in the contention that an innocent party that suffers a
breach of contract by the defaulting party can resort to either a statutory
remedy that may be available or a remedy envisaged by the contract itself.
The principle in law that a party suffering a breach of contract must be
restituted to the same position had the breach not occurred is well recognised
(See Rohtas Industries Ltd. v. Maharaja of Kasimbazar, China Clay Mines
ILR (1951) 1 Cal 420; <a href="/doc/1210914/" id="a_59">R.K. Malik v. Kiran Pal</a> (2009) 14 SCC 1; <a href="/doc/519110/" id="a_60">Lalchand
Chowdhury v. Union of India</a> AIR 1960 Cal 270). In the present case, the
risk purchase clause that envisages the innocent buyer that invokes it to do so
at the cost of the defaulting seller, is one species of the above settled legal
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_27">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 28 of 46</span>
 principle.
</p>



<p id="p_59">45. The finding of the Tribunal that SAIL was not precluded from invoking
Para 9.1 GCA to make risk purchase does not call for interference.
</p>


<p id="p_60">Notice under Para 9 GCA and Waiver
</p><p id="p_61">46. The next issue to be considered is whether the Tribunal, after holding
under issues (f) and (g) that SAIL had failed to give Vale and AMCI prior
notice under Para 9.1 GCA, held in issue (h) that Vale and AMCI had waived
the requirement of such notice.
</p>


<p id="p_62">47.      It is submitted by Vale and AMCI that advance notice prior to
undertaking risk purchase as envisaged under Para 9 GCA, was consistent
with the customary practice. Reliance is placed on the decisions in <a href="/doc/808548/" id="a_61">Alfa
Laval (India) Ltd. v. Union of India</a> (2000) I AD (Del) 145; <a href="/doc/613226/" id="a_62">Union of India

State Electricity Board, Bombay v. Sterlite Industries</a> AIR 2000 Bom 204. It
is pointed out that the Tribunal in fact found that no risk purchase notice as
contemplated under Para 9 GCA, was given by SAIL. Since this pre-
condition of prior notice had not been met, SAIL could not have resorted to
risk purchase at all. It is further submitted by Vale and AMCI that the
Tribunal erroneously concluded that the letter dated 18th December 2007 was
an unequivocal recognition by AMCI that SAIL could proceed under Para 9
GCA. The Tribunal not only acted contrary to the settled principle of waiver
but also consciously disregarded Para 17 of the Agreement which mandates


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_28">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 29 of 46</span>
 strict compliance of the Agreement. Para 17.1 of the Agreement reads as
follows:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_41">    "This Agreement cancels all previous negotiations between the parties
    hereto. There are no understanding or agreements between the
    Purchaser and the Seller which are not fully expressed herein and no
    statement or agreement, oral or written, made prior to or at signing
    hereof shall affect or modify the terms hereof or otherwise be binding
    on the parties hereto. No change in respect of the terms covered by
    this Agreement shall be valid unless the same is agreed to in writing
    by the parties hereto specifically stating the same as an amendment to
    this Agreement".
</blockquote>
<p id="p_63">48. It is further submitted that in any event even if the letter dated 18th
December 2007 amounted to waiver, it was incumbent on SAIL to inform
Vale and AMCI that it was purchasing coal at their risk and cost from
alternate suppliers. Admittedly, SAIL had not done so. Even the letter dated
18th December 2007 did not ask SAIL to procure coal at the risk and cost of
both Vale and AMCI. Thus, even if SAIL wanted to procure alternate
supplies, it could never have imposed the costs on AMCI and Vale. In this
regard reliance is placed on the decisions in <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_66">Babulal Badriprasad Varma v.
Surat Municipal Corporation</a> AIR 2008 SC 2919 and <a href="/doc/858066/" id="a_67">Ramdev Food
Products Pvt. Ltd. v. Arvindbhai Rambhai Patel</a> 2006 (33) PTC 281;

Chatterjee v. State of West Bengal</a> (1997) 2 Cal LT 4 (HC).
</p>

<p id="p_64">49. Para 9.1 GCA, which has been reproduced earlier, is the clause of the
LTA that permits SAIL to undertake risk purchase where Vale and AMCI
fail to meet their obligations to supply the contracted quantity. That clause
permits SAIL to take "such action as it considers fit including taking risk
purchase action for supply of similar materials at the risk and cost of the
Seller" but "after giving a notice". As rightly pointed out by Vale and AMCI,
the Tribunal has in Paras 140 and 141 of the impugned Award held that such
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011           Page 30 of 46</span>
 prior notice was required to be given by SAIL if it contemplated risk
purchase action and that in fact it did not give such written notice. It also
observed in Para 144 of the Award that the invitation by SAIL to Vale and
AMCI to attend the EJC meeting "would not of itself be sufficient to
constitute notice under Para 9." Also, it was held that the failure of Vale and
AMCI to attend the EJC meeting could not be taken as a "green light" for
SAIL "to do as it liked." However, the letter dated 18th December 2007 from
Vale and AMCI to SAIL was held to be a waiver by them of the requirement
of notice.
</p>

<p id="p_65">50. Before dealing with the factual aspects of the case in this regard, the law
may be briefly recapitulated. <a href="/doc/160214/" id="a_71">In Babulal Badriprasad Varma v. Surat
Municipal Corporation</a> it was explained that "waiver" is the abandonment of
a right "in such a way that the other party is entitled to plead the
abandonment by way of confession and avoidance if the right is thereafter
asserted, and is either express or implied from conduct." In Pradip Kumar
Chatterjee v. State of West Bengal the Calcutta High Court held that waiver
of a legal right required a "clear, unequivocal and decisive act of party
showing such purpose as acts amounting to an estoppel on his part"
</p>

<p id="p_66">51. The contents of the letter dated 18th December 2007 have been discussed
in some detail earlier. It was urged both by Vale and AMCI that at best the
above letter could be read as an inability by them to deliver only 0.3 million
MT for the FDP and not an inability as regards the entire lot for the FDP. It
was submitted that it was only for the Second Delivery Period (SDP) and
Third Delivery Period (TDP) that they were putting SAIL on notice of their
inability to perform their contractual obligation and asking SAIL to consider
other sourcing options.
</p>

<p id="p_67">52. The letter dated 18th December 2007 from AMCI to SAIL reiterated the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 31 of 46</span>
 explanation earlier offered for why the target supplies of hard coking coal
under the LTA for the FDP could not be adhered to. The delay in completion
of the expansion of the port of DBCT had according to Vale and AMCI
resulted in their not been able to get access to the port allocation and that the
said port allocation had "been permanently lost." Vale and AMCI made it
clear that their ability to perform the LTA in the FDP "has been permanently
reduced by 300 kt." Also in relation to the FDP they offered a tentative
schedule of supply of 700,000 MT in the FDP. Vale and AMCI requested
deferral of "all tonnage commitments for the 2008 and 2009 contract years
with resumption of deliveries in 2010." AMCI and Vale advised that SAIL
should "consider any other sourcing options that may be available." The said
letter therefore talks of the FDP as well as the SDP and TDP. As regards the
FDP, there is an admission by Vale and AMCI of the inability to meet the
commitment of 300,000 MT in the FDP. Since even the offer of supply of
700,000 MT was only "tentative", it was plain that there was no firm
commitment even as regards that quantity. By this date therefore it was plain
to Vale and AMCI that it was unlikely that they were going to meet their
commitments for the FDP. They also anticipated what SAIL was likely to do
in that event and so advised it to consider "other sourcing options". This was
a conscious act of Vale and AMCI and was clear and as unequivocal as it
could be. As it turned out Vale and AMCI admittedly failed to supply
753,461 MT in the FDP. They left SAIL with little option but to go for other
sources. SAIL adopted the strategy of still pressing for the FDP quantities
while undertaking risk purchase, which was an option available to it and
which approach, as rightly held by the Tribunal, cannot be said to be
"improper".
</p>

<p id="p_68">53. Both of SAIL's witnesses, Mr. Rawat and Mr. Arun Jot Malhotra, stated
that Vale and AMCI were in fact not told by SAIL of the risk purchase
undertaken and at the same time SAIL asked them to comply with the FDP
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011              Page 32 of 46</span>
 commitments. The Tribunal has analysed the evidence in great detail to come
to the conclusion that Vale and AMCI "as sophisticated players in the
industry" were fully aware that they would be exposed to claims by SAIL
and that the various proposals made by them to supply alternate coal was to
persuade SAIL to delay exercising its options to seek remedies including the
remedies under Para 9 GCA. The conduct of the parties had to be viewed in
the light of the exchange of letters between them before and after 18th
December 2007. When so viewed, the conclusion of the Tribunal that there
was an implied waiver by Vale and AMCI of the prior notice under Para 9
GCA does get strengthened. The objection in this regard is rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_69">SAIL did undertake risk purchase
</p><p id="p_70">54. It will be recalled that with regard to issue (i) the Tribunal held that
SAIL had in fact undertaken risk purchase under Para 9 GCA to make up for
the shortfall of supply of coking coal by Vale and AMCI under the LTA for
the FDP. According to Vale and AMCI, the case pleaded by SAIL in its
statement of claim was that consequent upon the meetings and discussions
held by the EJC, SAIL had agreed to purchase from its LTSs the short fall of
753, 461 MT of coal at about USD 300 PMT. However, SAIL set up another
case through its witnesses from which it was apparent that no conscious
decision as such was taken to procure risk purchase coal. According to Vale
and AMCI, the Tribunal did not consider the case which was put forward by
SAIL in its Statement of Claim and proceeded on the basis of the case set up
by SAIL's witnesses while completely ignoring the plea raised by AMCI and
Vale that SAIL's evidence was not in support of its Statement of Claim but
was in fact, a new case set up by SAIL.
</p>

<p id="p_71">55. It is further submitted that SAIL did not produce any document in
support of any alleged decision taken by the EJC for procuring Risk Purchase
coal. The request to produce the decision was opposed by SAIL on the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011          Page 33 of 46</span>
 ground that the minutes of the EJC meeting were confidential. It is submitted
that the Tribunal's conclusion in Para 177 of the Award that SAIL had
procured 803, 395 MT of Hard Coking coal out of which it had consciously
attributed 753,461 MT as Risk Purchase coal was not supported by reasons.
Further, the Tribunal's conclusion that SAIL had procured 803,395 MT of
coal was without any factual basis. It is submitted that SAIL did not produce
any witness to say that any decision to procure risk purchase coal was in fact
taken. Being a public sector undertaking, it was inconceivable that SAIL
would have taken a 'conscious decision' without a written document.
</p>

<p id="p_72">56. Vale and AMCI submit that SAIL's case of inviting other LTSs to
negotiate the procurement of risk purchase coal was patently false. SAIL had
not filed any document to show that as a consequence of the non-supply of
full quantity of coal by AMCI and Vale, it had invited the other LTSs for
discussions about risk purchase. The redacted contracts filed by SAIL also
did not reveal that there was any procurement of additional coal by SAIL
from its Australian LTSs. According to Vale and AMCI, to overcome this,
Mr. Arun Jot Malhotra in his affidavit dated 17th March 2010 pleaded a new
case for SAIL that all the Australian suppliers except AMCI and Vale had
supplied full quantity of coal which they agreed to supply during the
Delivery Period 2007-08; that because of non-supply by AMCI and Vale,
there was a shortfall in the buffer stock which SAIL was required to maintain
for the year 2008-09; in order to make up the shortfall in the buffer stock,
SAIL agreed to procure "additional" 800,000 MT of coal from the other
Australian suppliers 500,000 tons from BHP, 100,000 tons from Peabody and
200,000 tons from Anglo. It is submitted that the Tribunal ignored that the
aforesaid was a new case set up by SAIL only for the reason that the
contracts it was compelled to produce belied its case put forward in the
Statement of Claim.
</p>

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011           Page 34 of 46</span>
<p id="p_73"> 57. Vale and AMCI submitted that SAIL in order to enhance its case had by
way of the affidavits of its witnesses travelled beyond its pleadings which
was prima facie unfair and contrary to settled legal principles. Reliance is
placed on Rajgopal (Dead) by LRS. v. Kishan Gopal (2003) 10 SCC 653 and
<a href="/doc/1539259/" id="a_72">State Bank of India v. S.N Goyal</a> (2008) 8 SCC 92. It is submitted that a
settled rule of evidence is that if the contents of a document are to be proved,
the document must be produced itself ("the best evidence rule"). In this
regard, reliance is placed on <a href="/doc/1543769/" id="a_73">Roop Kumar v. Mohan Thedani</a> (2003) 6 SCC
595; <a href="/doc/1099802/" id="a_74">Bai Hira Devi v. The Official Assignee of Bombay</a> AIR 1958 SC 448;

<a href="/doc/202223/" id="a_77">Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra</a> (1977) 1 SCC 133.
</p>

<p id="p_74">58. It is submitted that the Tribunal also ignored the evidence adduced in the
arbitration which showed that SAIL's other Australian supplier BHP had not
supplied the full contracted quantities in 2007-08 and, further, that there had
been no decline in the buffer stock of SAIL as a result of any non delivery by
AMCI and Vale. The quantities mentioned in Ex. C-85, which purportedly
were the risk purchase quantities procured by SAIL, did not in fact tally with
the actual purchases claimed to have been made for the purpose of risk
purchase. Exception was taken to SAIL producing documents along with its
written submissions that disclosed that in fact there was a default in supply
by one LTS BHP of the contracted quantities for 2007-08. It is submitted
that the Tribunal was to give a finding on this aspect along with the final
Award but it failed to do so.
</p>

<p id="p_75">59. Before considering the above submissions it is necessary to advert to the
international practice in the sourcing of hard coking coal. It is the common
case between the parties that Japan is the largest manufacturer of steel and
sets a benchmark for purchase of coal for all other steel producing countries
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_34">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 35 of 46</span>
 including India. Procurement of coal is done on a yearly basis. In Japan it is
done on calendar year basis. In India it is done on yearly basis in the same
year. While the procurement process in Japan commences during April, in
India it commences in May and continues till August and September.
Additionally, in the instant case, where the EJC meeting was to assess the
likely consumption of coal in the following year, it was not an exercise for
SAIL alone but other steel manufacturers including Rashtriya Ispat Nigam
Ltd. Long Term Contracts are entered into by steel companies with coal
suppliers to provide for total quantities, the specific quantities of coal to be
supplied periodically as well as the terms and conditions of delivery. The
procurement is a continuous process for which the steel industry is required
to maintain a buffer stock. It is stated that the buffer stocks of carry over in
connection with the supply of coking coal was a common feature in the long
term coking coal market. The experts examined on behalf of the parties have
broadly testified to the above international practice.
</p>

<p id="p_76">60. There is merit in the submission on behalf of SAIL that any suggestion
to the LTSs that they were being approached to supply extra quantities on
account of the failure by AMCI and Vale to meet their obligations under the
LTA dated 23rd April 2007 would have resulted in those LTSs quoting much
higher prices. With a view to mitigate the significant losses that would have
to be borne by it if it had gone for spot purchases, SAIL invited all its LTSs,
including Vale and AMCI to the EJC. SAIL's decision not to disclose to the
other LTSs that Vale and AMCI had defaulted in their obligations under the
LTA dated 23rd April 2007 was its prerogative. Vale and AMCI despite being
invited were not prepared to attend the EJC meeting since they were certain
that they would not be able to meet the supply obligations during the FDP or
the SDP and TDP.
</p>

<p id="p_77">61. On the issue of whether a conscious decision was indeed taken by the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_35">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 36 of 46</span>
 EJC or SAIL to undertake risk purchase, Mr. Rawat's cross examination
revealed how he briefed the EJC, and how it was the Chairman, SAIL who
had to take a final call on undertaking purchase of additional coal to make up
for the shortfall during the FDP. The affidavit of Mr. Arun Jot Malhotra dealt
with this aspect and he too was subject to extensive cross examination. The
Tribunal analysed their evidence at great length. It ultimately concluded that
SAIL did in fact procure 800,000 MT of additional coking coal for the period
following the FDP.
</p>

<p id="p_78">62.     The Tribunal in the impugned Award analyzed in great detail the
documents by SAIL which showed the quantities agreed to be supplied by
the LTSs under the respective LTAs with them. It took note of the
submissions of Vale and AMCI that if there was any additional increase in
supply and purchase from those LTSs in the post delivery period, it would
have been 200,000 MT and not 800,000 MT as claimed by SAIL. The
Tribunal negatived the submission by holding that it is not unreasonable for
SAIL to take into account the actual delivery quantities for one period and
project them in the next delivery period. The figure of 800,000 MT correlated
with the total amount of actual coal supplied by BHP, Anglo and Peabody
during the period July to September 2008.                  The total hard coking coal
received in August to September 2008 was 803,395 MT. The Tribunal has
given its reasoning in the following manner:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_42">      "175. The Respondents had spent much time in the course of the
      arbitration to build a scenario under which it was suggested that the
      Claimant could not have consciously decided to undertake risk
      purchase action. It was not disputed that price negotiations for hard
      coking coal usually take place between BHP Billiton - Mitsubishi
      Alliance ("BMA") and Nippon Steel of Japan usually begin at the
      end of the calendar year and settlement is usually reached between
      January and March. The prices settled between BMA and Nippon
      would usually be the benchmark price for the Claimant in its
      negotiations with its suppliers in May. For 2008-2009, it was settled
      at US$300/MT. During September 2008 to March 2009, due to the
      global financial crisis, the steel producers announced rapid cuts in
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_36">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011                   Page 37 of 46</span>
     production. Steel producers such as SAIL faced high prices for its
    hard coking coal of USD 300/MT, and a lower steel price of USD
    500/MT. By January-February 2009 the spot market prices of prime
    hard coking coal fell to around USD 135/T. So SAIL would be
    paying a high premium for its coking coal from its long term
    suppliers. Relying on McCloskey's Coal Report of October 28, 2008,
    it was said that SAIL was pushing back stems (a term used in
    maritime transportation to mean shipping/loading arrangements) as
    the demand for steel had declined. The respondents therefore said
    that SAIL had never intended to take up the Respondents' various
    offers for the short-delivered coal because of the fall in coal price
    such that it became no longer beneficial to do so.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_43">    176. However, interesting and realistic the theory propounded by
    the Respondents may be, the fact still remained that the Respondents
    had failed in the performance of the Contract, giving the Claimant the
    liberty to exercise its right under Para 9 of the GCA. If indeed SAIL
    was behaving as the Respondents suggested it did, the Respondents
    could have simply offered and made delivery of the full contracted
    Materials much earlier rather than wait until the threat of legal
    proceedings. As it is, without any factual witness from the
    Respondents, the full facts can never be ascertained. The Tribunal
    can only make its decision on what is before it and what can actually
    be ascertained."
</blockquote>
<p id="p_79">63. The Tribunal analysed the evidence of both Mr. Rawat and Mr.Malhotra
and came to the conclusion that SAIL had affected the shortfall of supply
during the FDP into the overall requirement for 2008-09. It cannot be said
that the said conclusion was beyond the scope of the arbitral proceedings or
not based on any evidence whatsoever. With their affidavits the internal notes
of SAIL regarding requirement of coking coal for 2007-08 and 2008-09 were
enclosed. The extensive cross-examination of the two witnesses does indicate
that there was a decision taken at the EJC for sourcing the shortfall during the
FDP and subsequent delivery periods.
</p>

<p id="p_80">64. The Tribunal's analysis of the invoices attached to Exhibit C-85 to the
Statement of Claim showed 397,543 MT received from BHP, 198,155 MT
from Peabody and 207,697 MT from Anglo. The Tribunal held that there
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 38 of 46</span>
 need not be a specific attribution or earmarking of a specific shipment from
specific supplier to be considered as risk purchase coal. There was no
obligation on SAIL "to have to connect each and every procurement from
BHP, Anglo and Peabody to the shortfall of cargo". The findings in para 174
of the Award are purely factual based on the figures produced before the
Tribunal. The overall conclusion drawn by the Tribunal, on the evidence of
SAIL's witnesses, was that SAIL "had taken into consideration the amount of
coal not delivered by the Respondents in 2007-2008 and factored them into
the overall coal requirements for 2008-2009."
</p>

<p id="p_81">65. On the above aspects, as can be seen from the submissions made,
counsel for Vale and AMCI treated these proceedings under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_78">Section 34</a> of the
Act as a first appeal on facts and took the court through several pages of
documents and depositions of the witnesses. At the risk of repetition it must
be stressed that the Court hearing a petition under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_79">Section 34</a> of the Act is not
expected to re-examine the evidence that has been analysed threadbare by the
arbitral Tribunal and interfere only because it is possible to take a different
view. The Court is not persuaded to do so in the present case.
</p>

<p id="p_82">66. The Tribunal's conclusion in the final Award that SAIL had made a
'conscious' decision to procure additional quantities of coal to make up for
the 'lost' quantity calls for no interference.
</p>

<p id="p_83">Quality of risk purchase coal
</p><p id="p_84">67. On the question of the quality of coal, it is submitted by Vale and AMCI
that Para 9 of the GCA required that coal to be purchased in exercise of the
right there under must be "similar" to the coal agreed to be procured under
the Contract. However, SAIL had not led any evidence to establish this.
Further, SAIL had redacted the specifications of the coal in the copies of the
contracts with other suppliers produced by it during discovery. Therefore, it
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 39 of 46</span>
 was not possible to precisely compare the risk purchase coal with the
contracted coal. It is submitted that in Paras 192 and 193 of the Award, the
Tribunal referred to the shipping documents of the other LTSs to compare the
specifications of the alleged risk purchase coal with the contracted coal. In
doing so, the Tribunal ignored that such shipping documents did not contain
complete specifications of the alleged risk purchase coal. Reliance is placed
on the decisions in <a href="/doc/1329002/" id="a_80">Highway Engineering Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India</a> (1997)
1 Arb LR 128 (Delhi); <a href="/doc/421327/" id="a_81">Flowmore Private Limited v. National Thermal
Power Corporation</a> (2009) X AD (Delhi) 486; <a href="/doc/1081943/" id="a_82">Union of India v. Kundra

2008 (3) Arb LR 569 (Delhi). Since SAIL had deliberately and willingly
withheld evidence on specification of material purchased under the alleged
risk purchase action, the Arbitral Tribunal ought to have drawn an adverse
inference against SAIL in terms of <a href="/doc/147127/" id="a_84">Sections 101</a>, <a href="/doc/1505766/" id="a_85">102</a>, <a href="/doc/697566/" id="a_86">106</a> and <a href="/doc/731516/" id="a_87">114</a> of the
Evidence Act, 1872 ("<a href="/doc/1953529/" id="a_88">Evidence Act</a>"). In this regard, reliance is placed on
the decisions in <a href="/doc/573583/" id="a_89">Kamakshi Builders v. Ambedkar Educational Society</a>
(2007) 12 SCC 27, <a href="/doc/1917909/" id="a_90">Gopal Krishnaji Ketkar v. Mohamed Haji Latif</a> (1968) 3
SCR 862; <a href="/doc/202223/" id="a_91">Narayan Govind Gavate v. State of Maharashtra</a> (1977) 1 SCC
</p><p id="p_85">133.


</p><p id="p_86">68. The Tribunal analysed in great detail the descriptions of coal appearing in
the contracts between SAIL and its three LTSs for the period July 2008-June
2009. It also examined the shipping documents and commercial invoices
which indicated two of the factors which were of concern to the parties,
namely moisture and ash content. In regard to the third supplier, the shipping
document gave even more details and these were considered by the Tribunal.
</p>

<p id="p_87">69. The Tribunal discussed the evidence of the expert Dr. Bristow in great
detail about the quality of the coking coal sourced by SAIL from other LTSs.
It did a comparison of the material specifications of the contracted materials
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 40 of 46</span>
 with Vale and AMCI and the coal supplied by BHP, Anglo and Peabody. It
came to the conclusion that "Dr. Bristow viewed that the coal purchased from
BHP and Anglo were superior to the contracted material based on his
personal knowledge of the coal emerging from his familiarity with the coals
that are mentioned in the specifications".
</p>

<p id="p_88">70. Given the extensive documentation already available from which the
Tribunal was able to make a detailed analysis for the purposes of determining
the quality of coal procured by SAIL, the criticism that the Tribunal failed to
specifically rule on the effect of redaction of the documents by SAIL is not
justified. In para 161 of the Award the fact that the copies of the contracts
furnished by SAIL were in a redacted form was noted. Further, the fact that
on the direction of the Tribunal the originals of the said documents were
made available for inspection during the course of oral hearing was also
noted. The entire transcript of the Tribunal's proceedings is available. It
bears out that at the arbitral hearing the complete original un-redacted
agreements were made available to counsel for Vale and AMCI. SAIL's
witnesses were cross-examined extensively regarding the statements made by
them in their affidavits about the purchase of additional quantities of coal
during 2007-08. The case set up in the affidavits of SAIL's witnesses was
severely tested by the counsel for Vale and AMCI. The Court is satisfied that
no procedural irregularity was committed by the Tribunal and that a full
effective opportunity was indeed provided to both Vale and AMCI to
establish their respective cases.
</p>

<p id="p_89">71. After the above detailed analysis of the evidence the Tribunal concluded
that the coal purchased by SAIL from the three LTSs post July 2008 "belong
to the same class of hard coking coal as those of the contracted materials and
were not in fact superior". This was a possible view to take on the evidence
placed on record before the Tribunal. No ground for interference under
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011            Page 41 of 46</span>
 <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_92">Section 34</a> of the Act is made out.
</p>

<p id="p_90">Quantification of damages
</p><p id="p_91">72. As regards the quantification of the damages, it is a settled principle that
the defaulting party is liable to pay the aggrieved party for the breach of
contract. The Bills of Lading and invoices produced by SAIL described the
quantity and quality of the coal procured from the LTSs. The Tribunal in
quantifying the damages referred to the principles enunciated by the Supreme
Court in <a href="/doc/1813747/" id="a_93">Murlidhar Chiranjilal v. Harishchandra Dwarkadas</a> AIR 1962 SC
366 and <a href="/doc/1499847/" id="a_94">Muna Sona Sundaram Chettiar v. Sona Theeanna Chockalingam
Chettiar</a> AIR 1938 Mad 672. The Tribunal went by the chart prepared by
AMCI along with its final submissions and determined the differential price
for the quantity of 753,461 MT of coking coal. It also undertook the exercise
of verifying that the gross quantities and paid tonnages largely corresponded
with the bills of lading and accompanying commercial invoices for each of
the shipments.
</p>

<p id="p_92">73. Whether the disclosure of further specifications than that that were made
available may have led to a different conclusion is a matter of conjecture. The
Tribunal has after discussing the evidence of expert witnesses and analyzing
the documents on record taken a particular view which is a plausible one.
While it may be possible to argue that another view is also possible, that by
itself does not constitute a valid ground for a court to interfere under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_95">Section
34</a> of the Act. Consequently, this Court is unable to find any error in the
quantification of the damages by the Tribunal.
</p>


<p id="p_93">Costs and pendente lite interest
</p><p id="p_94">74. As regards pendente lite interest, cogent reasons have been given by the
Tribunal for awarding 1.25% above the LIBOR rate as regards the pendente

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_41">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011             Page 42 of 46</span>
 lite interest and, therefore, the rate of interest is fixed at 2.335364% per
annum on a simple basis to run from the date of the request for Arbitration
(2nd April 2009) until the date of this award (1 year + 343 days). This has
been computed as USD 6,897,815.48. Even as regards the award of
arbitration and legal costs, this Court is unable to find any 'patent illegality'
in impugned Award.
</p>

<p id="p_95">Post-Award interest
</p><p id="p_96">75. After the making of the Final Award on 10th March 2011, Vale and
AMCI each filed an application under <a href="/doc/1393668/" id="a_96">Section 33</a> (4) of the Act stating that
although the Tribunal had rejected SAIL's prayer for post-Award interest,
this rejection had been omitted from the Award. They accordingly requested
the Tribunal to pass an additional Award under <a href="/doc/1154891/" id="a_97">Section 33(4)</a> of the
Arbitration Act expressly recording that SAIL's claim for post-Award
interest had been rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_97">76. By a decision dated 16 May 2011, the Tribunal dismissed the said
applications by AMCI and Vale on the ground that there was no error in the
final Award. The Tribunal observed that the final Award had clearly rejected
SAIL's prayer for grant of interest in the pre-arbitration period. After
referring to <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_98">Section 31(7)</a> (b) of the Act, the Tribunal observed that it had
"consciously omitted" to make any direction on post-Award interest in the
final Award.
</p>

<p id="p_98">77. AMCI has challenged the aforesaid decision dated 16th May 2011 of the
Tribunal by filing a separate petition OMP No. 451 of 2011 under <a href="/doc/1219022/" id="a_99">Section 34</a>
of the Act inter alia on the grounds that:
</p><p id="p_99">a. The Tribunal made an unnecessary and meaningless reference to <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_100">Section
31(7)</a> (b) of the Act. It was clear from Para 14 of the decision and the
dispositive paragraph (V) of the final Award that the Tribunal had rejected
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_42">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011              Page 43 of 46</span>
 the claim for post-Award interest. <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_101">Section 31(7)</a> (b) of the Act therefore had
no applicability.
</p>

<p id="p_100">b. The decision amounted to a review of the final Award which the Tribunal
was not permitted to do under <a href="/doc/1393668/" id="a_102">Section 33</a> of the Act.
</p>

<p id="p_101">78. Vale has alternatively submitted that post-Award interest of 18% per
annum was contrary to the recent trend in India where courts awarded low
interest rates where the award amount was in USD. Reference is made to the
decisions in <a href="/doc/69709580/" id="a_103">M.M. T. C v. Al Bamar Company Ltd</a>. (2009) 155 PLR 13,
(where this Court was guided by the LIBOR rates where the amount awarded
was in <a href="/doc/237820/" id="a_104">USD) and Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Ltd. v. G. Harischandra
Reddy</a> (2007) 2 SCC 720.
</p>

<p id="p_102">79.     In para 126 of the Statement of Claim, SAIL claimed interest 12.75%
per annum "from April 2008 till the date of its realization". In para 219 of the
impugned final Award the Tribunal discussed the issue of award of interest.
It concluded that the interest could be allowed on the amount of damages in
USD "only from the date of commencement of this arbitration, viz., 2nd April
2009 until the date of this Award." The Tribunal expressly rejected SAIL's
claim for interest @ 12.75% based on the Prime Lending Rate (PLR) of the
State Bank of India since that was applicable only on domestic loans in
Indian currency. It concluded that the LIBOR rates for USD "provides a
better baseline to gauge the costs of funds of USD to the claimant as it
represents the lowest real-world cost of unsecured funding in the London
market." On that basis, it fixed the rate of interest by adding 1.25% to the
LIBOR rate and awarded simple interest at 2.335364% per annum on the
sum awarded as damages. The dispositive para (V) of the Final Award stated
"all other claims are accordingly rejected."

<p id="p_103"> 80. Since the only period for which the Tribunal had awarded interest was
from 2nd April 2009 till the date of the Award, the rejection of all other
claims meant that the Tribunal rejected the claim for interest not only for the
period prior to 2nd April 2009 but for the period after the Award till "till the
date of its realization" which had been prayed for by SAIL. There was no
occasion therefore, for the Tribunal to refer <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_105">Section 31</a> (7) (b) of the Act
since that would have applied, if at all to an international Award, only where
the Award was otherwise silent on the question of post-Award interest. With
the final dispositive para (V) of the Award stating that "all other claims are
accordingly rejected" SAIL's claim for post-Award interest "till the date of
its realization" was in fact rejected.
</p>

<p id="p_104">81. While the Tribunal has correctly, in its Order dated 16th May 2011,
observed that "the Award is clear in its terms that interest prior to the request
for arbitration although claimed is not awarded", it erred in observing that in
the final Award the Tribunal had consciously "omitted to make any direction
on the post-Award interest." Dispositive para (V) of the final Award in fact
rejected all "other claims" which included SAIL's claim for post-Award
interest. The Tribunal also erred in referring to <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_106">Section 31</a> (7) (b) of the Act
since that provision was not attracted. With SAIL not having assailed the
final Award, the Tribunal could not have by its Order dated 16th May 2011,
in the applications filed by Vale and AMCI, clarified that it had "consciously
omitted" to pass an order on post-Award interest. To this limited extent
O.M.P. No.451 of 2011 succeeds.
</p>

<p id="p_105">82. In that view of the matter, it is not required for this Court to consider the
alternative plea of Vale that the rate of post-Award interest was excessive.

<p id="p_106">Conclusion
</p><p id="p_107">83. In conclusion and for the aforementioned reasons,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">O.M.P. 414/2011 with O.M.P. 415/2011 and O.M.P. 451/2011              Page 45 of 46</span>
</p><p id="p_108"> (a) all objections by Vale and AMCI to the impugned Award dated 10th
March 2011 passed by the Tribunal are hereby rejected. OMP Nos. 414 and
415 of 2011 are hereby dismissed with costs of Rs. 1 lakh each to be paid by
each Petitioner to SAIL within four weeks.
</p>

<p id="p_109">(b) The observation of the Tribunal in its Order dated 16th May 2011 to the
extent that it had consciously omitted to issue any direction as regards the
post-Award interest in the final Award is hereby set aside. The reference in
the said Order to <a href="/doc/463976/" id="a_107">Section 31</a> (7) (b) of the Act is also set aside. The final
Award dated 10th March 2011 rejecting "all other claims" of SAIL including
its claim for post-Award interest, is upheld. OMP No. 451 of 2011 is
disposed of in the above terms.
