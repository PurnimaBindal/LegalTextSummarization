<p id="p_4">    3.        The present Plaintiff - Charak Pharma Pvt. Ltd.  was incorporated in the year 

    2000 and started using the mark "EVANOVA" pursuant to a license agreement dated 





    12th April, 2002, executed by the original Plaintiff No.1 in favour of the Plaintiff for 

    the   use   of   the   trademark.     The   Plaintiff   commenced   the   sale   of   the   ayurvedic 

    preparation     from   April,   2002   in   the   form   of   capsules   for   the   treatment   of

    "ECONOVA"   for its new medicinal preparation. The Defendant commenced selling

    treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

<p id="p_6">    5.        According   to   the   Plaintiff,   some   time   in   September,   2006,   it   came     to   its 




                                                                         
    knowledge that the Defendant is manufacturing and selling medicinal preparation 

    under the mark "ECONOVA"   which in the opinion of the Plaintiff was deceptively 




                                                        
    similar to the Plaintiff's registered trademark "EVANOVA".  The Plaintiff therefore by 
                                     
    its notice dated 15th September, 2006, called upon the Defendant to cease and desist 

    from using the trademark "ECONOVA".   The Defendant replied to the said notice by 
                                    
    its letter dated 27th  September, 2006, in which it was stated that the presence of 

    prefix     "ECO" in the Defendant's mark distinguished it phonetically and visually 
           


    from the Plaintiff's mark "EVANOVA". 
</p>        



<p id="p_7">    6.        On 12th June, 2007, the Plaintiff  filed the present Suit against the Defendant 





    for infringement of its trademark "EVANOVA" and passing off  the Defendant's goods 

    as those of the Plaintiff by the Defendant's use of the mark "ECONOVA".  The Plaintiff 

    also took out the above Notice of Motion and moved an application for ad-interim 





    relief. The ad-interim relief as prayed was refused on the ground of delay i.e. from 

    the date of knowledge i.e. September, 2006 till the date of filing of the Suit in June,  

    2007.   Paragraph 8 of the ad-interim order dated 9 th  August, 2007 is reproduced

    November, 2008, original Plaintiff No. 1 assigned the trademark  to the Plaintiff. By a 

    Scheme of Amalgamation approved by this Court on 18 th  December, 2009, original 




                                                     
    Plaintiff No.1 merged with the Plaintiff. As per the Scheme of Amalgamation, all 
                                   
    properties of original Plaintiff No. 1 vested in the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff was also 

    entitled to continue all legal proceedings.

<p id="p_10">    8.        The  Defendant   had     also     applied   for   registration  of   its   mark  "ECONOVA" 
</p>           

<p id="p_11">    sometime in May, 2006. The Registrar objected to the same citing the Plaintiff's mark 
        



    as one of the conflicting marks and brought to the notice of the Defendant that the 

    Defendant's mark is identical with and deceptively similar  to the Plaintiff's mark.  It 

    is submitted by the Plaintiff that even  after the representation of the Defendant, the 





    Registrar did not waive the objections and only issued an advertisement prior to 

    acceptance clearly suggesting that the Registrar persists with the said objection.

<p id="p_12">    9.        On behalf of the Plaintiff, the following contentions were raised:</p><pre id="pre_2">

    9.1       The   Plaintiff   is   the   registered   Proprietor     of   the   mark   "EVANOVA".   The 

    Defendant   is   using   a   deceptively   similar   mark   "ECONOVA"     and   ought   to   be 

    restrained.   The   marks   "EVANOVA"   and   "ECONOVA"     are   visually   and   structurally

    "NOVA".  Phonetically also both the marks  are similar in a manner which is likely to  




                                                                        
    deceive the consumer.   Both the words begin with the letter "E" which has a very 

    emphatic  and prominent sound particularly in the manner in which it is pronounced 

    by most Indians.  Since  both the marks begin with a prominent sound of "E"  and 




                                                                       
    end   with   the   common   word   "NOVA"   ,   there   is   a   likelihood     and   in   any   case   a 

    possibility of the middle words to be slurred over.  The comparison of these  marks 




                                                      
    must be done therefore in the light of the extremely strict test laid down by the 
                                   
    Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of (i) F. Hoffmann - La Roche and Co. Ltd. vs. G.

    of  Cadila Health Care Ltd.  (supra), it is pointed out on behalf of the   Plaintiff that 
     



    both medicinal preparations/products deal with gynaecological issues. The Plaintiff's 

    product   is   an   ayurvedic   preparation   in   the   form   of   capsules   for   treatment   of 





    menopause.  On the other hand, the Defendant's product is  entirely different and is 

    a medicine for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. If as a result of the confusion the 

    wrong drug is administered, it would lead to disastrous consequences.

    medicinal   preparation   which   is   a   patented   product,   meant   for   the   treatment   of 




                                                                                               
    Bacterial Vaginosis that is a condition which disturbs the Natural Vaginal Ecosystem 




                                                                     
    (Vaginal Microbial Flora). The prefix "ECO" is taken out from the word "Ecosystem" 
</p>
<p id="p_26">    and the suffix "NOVA" was added which means "Novel''or "New''.
</p>
<p id="p_27">    10.2      The adoption  of  the  mark  by  the  Defendant  is  honest  and   bona  fide.  The 




                                                                    
    Defendant   had   upon   coining   the   mark,   applied   for   and   obtained   official   search 

    report from the Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai, to ascertain the availability of the 




                                                   
    said mark.  In the Search Report, the Registrar did not cite the Plaintiff's mark  as a 
                                 
    conflicting one as against the Defendant's mark.  Also the Defendant had not come 

    across any existing similar mark  when it made enquiries  in the market to ascertain 
                                
    if any same/similar mark was already in  existence.  
</p>
<p id="p_28">    10.3      Since May, 2006, the Defendant has been extensively using   the trademark 
        


    "ECONOVA"  in relation to the medicinal and pharmaceutical preparation (which is 
     



    manufactured by M/s. Tablets (India) Limited being the exclusive licensees of the 

    product in India) and enjoys immense  reputation and goodwill of its own as can be 





    seen from the sales figures provided by the Defendant. 
</p>
<p id="p_29">    10.4      The Defendant  has spent monies on the promotional activities. 
</p>
<p id="p_30">    10.5      The mark of the Defendant that is "ECONOVA"  is distinct and distinguishable 





    from the mark of the Plaintiff that is "EVANOVA".  In the case of the Defendant, the  

    letters "C" and "O" control the sound of the Defendant's mark, whereas in the case of 

    the Plaintiff, the letters "V" and "A" control the sound of the Plaintiff's mark.  The 

    Court should turn to the principles  laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its 

    judgment   in  Cadila's   case  (supra)   and   the   decision   of   this   Court   in  Burroughs

    applied to such rival marks is the phonetic test.

<p id="p_31">    10.6      The suffix "NOVA''  in the rival marks is common both on the Register as well

    the marks are similar, there is no likelihood of any confusion/deception between the 

    two marks in question, since there is a widespread use of the prefix/suffix "NOVA'' by 
                                  
    several traders in the pharmaceutical trade and the purchasing members will tend to 

    ignore and/or gloss over  and/or give less importance to the common features and 
        


    will always pay more regard to the uncommon part.  The  Defendant has set out the  
     



    differences in the salient features between the two products qua its use, packaging, 

    display on cartons,  catch cover on blister pack and price and has submitted that this 





    added   material   is     sufficient   to   distinguish     the   two   products   and   rules   out   the 

    question of passing off.  In support, the Defendant has relied on the decision of the 

    Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   in   the   case   of  <a href="/doc/529384/" id="a_12">Kaviraj   Pandit   Durga   Dutt   Sharma   vs.

    Defendant   has   been   selling   its   products   since   May,   2006,   however,   till   date   the

    plaintiffs mark is shown to be "in the course of trade,, the question whether there has

    the earlier words "likely to deceive". But this apart, as the question arises in an action  
    for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that the trade mark

    registered, is deceptively similar. This has necessarily to be ascertained by a comparison  
    of   the   two   marks-the   degree   of   resemblance   which   is   necessary   to   exist   to   cause  




                                                                       
    deception   not   being   capable   of   definition   by   laying   down   objective   standards.   The  
    persons who would be deceived are, of course, the purchasers of the goods and it is the  
    likelihood of their being deceived that is the subject of consideration. The resemblance  




                                                       
    may be phonetic, visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiffs mark. The  
    purpose   of   the   comparison   is   for   determining   whether   the   essential   features   of   the  
                                    
    plaintiff's trade mark are to be found in that used by the defendant. The identification  
    of the essential features of the mark is in essence a  question of fact and depends on the  
                                   
    judgment of the Court based on the evidence led before it as regards the usage of the  
    trade. It should, however, be borne in mind that the object of the enquiry in ultimate  
    analysis is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to  
           


    that of the registered mark of the plaintiff."

    in   the   case   of  Charak   Pharmaceuticals   vs.   M.J.   Exports   Private   Limited   (DB) 24  is 





    relevant   where   this       Court   while   considering   two   marks   "MJ   TONE"   and   "M-2

                letters. However, so far as the phonetic test is concerned, there is not  
                much difference in the pronunciation of these two suffixes. The prefix  
                in "PV-DINE" consists of two letters "PV" whereas the pre-fix in the  





                mark "PIODIN" consists of three letters "PIO". However, there is not  
                much difference in the pronouncement of the same. Thus a fast or  
                faint   utterance   of   both   the   marks   is   very   much   likely   to   make   a  
                confusion that they are one and the same. It is a common knowledge  





                that in our country English is not a mother tongue and, therefore,  
                pronunciations   are   different   from   person   to   persons.   For   instance  
                some   people pronounce "school" as "Eschool". Para as "Pera", Bank  
                and Baink, Report as Repot and so on. Therefore, it is not unlikely  
                that the mark "PV-DINE" is likely to be pronounced as "PIODIN". This  
                is not a hypothetical possibility or probability but a practical reality

    Anr.  (supra),  the   Court  was   considering   the   rival   marks   "Brufen"   and   "Crofen". 
</p>
<p id="p_80">    Despite one of the marks starting with the sound 'K', the Court found the marks to be 




                                                                          
    deceptively similar. The Court observed as under:
</p>

<p id="p_81">       "12 .... Applying these 3 tests, I am of the opinion that the mark applied  




                                                          
              for i.e. "CROFEN" is deceptively similar to the registered trade mark of  
                                      
              the petitioner i.e. "BRUFEN". The words "BRUFEN" and 'CROFEN' both  
              are six lettered words having common suffix 'FEN'. The prefixes in both  
                                     
              these words consist of 3 letters one of which i.e. 'R' is common. The  
              same is preceded by different syllable and followed by different vowels.  
              Visually   there   is   some   dis-similarity   in   both   the   prefixes   and  
        

              phonetically   also   there  is  dissimilarity,   since   the  first   letters  of   both  
              these words are different but the vowels 'u' and 'o' which follow the  
     



              letter 'R' are apt to be slurred over. The hurried and fast utterance of  
              the word 'CROFEN' may sound as 'BRUFEN', while that of 'CROFEN' as  
              'BRUFEN'.
</p>




<p id="p_82">            Therefore, it is not unlikely that the word "CROFEN" when pronounced  
              hurriedly or fastly may slur over and pass as 'BRUFEN' and vice-versa. I  
              cannot say whether this is a possibility of probability but it cannot be  





              ignored that it is a fact which is likely to occur. The question which  
              therefore, arises is as to what is the test for assessing whether there is  
              deceptive similarity or not in the two words of mark."</p><pre id="pre_6">

    prima facie  satisfied that the Defendant's mark "ECONOVA" is deceptively 
    similar to the Plaintiff's mark "EVANOVA".  In fact, the Plaintiff's product is 




                                                                        
    an   ayurvedic   preparation   in   the   form   of   capsules   for   treatment   of 
    menopause. On the other hand, the Defendant's product is entirely different 
    and is a medicine for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. If, as a result of the 




                                                                       
    confusion,   the   wrong   drug   is   administered,   it   would   lead   to   disastrous 
    consequences.   The   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court   while   noting   this   aspect   has 
    clearly   held   that   when   the   drugs   have   marked   differences   in   their 




                                                       
    compositions   with   completely   different   side   effects,   the   test   should   be 
    applied   strictly   as   the   possibility   of   harm   resulting   from   any   kind   of 
                                    
    confusion by the consumer can have unpleasant if not disastrous results.   In 
    the   words   of   the   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court,   "Public   interest   would   support  
                                   
    lesser degree of proof showing confusing similarity in the case of trade marks  
    in   respect   of   medicinal   products   as   against   other   non-medicinal   products.  
    Drugs   are   poisons,   not   sweets.   Confusion   between   medicinal   products   may,  
         


    therefore, be life threatening, not merely inconvenient".
</p>      



<p id="p_84">    24.       The Defendant has contended that if this Court holds that the marks 





    are similar, then the Defendant, without prejudice to its contention that the 
    marks are not similar, could submit that in view of the fact that there is a 
    widespread   use   of   the   prefix/suffix   "NOVA"   by   several   traders   in   the 
    pharmaceutical   industry,     the   purchasing   members   will   tend   to   ignore 





    and/or gloss over and/or give less importance to the common feature and 
    will always pay more regard to the uncommon part. It is contended that the 
    consumers   are   therefore   discerning   in   distinguishing   the   same.   In   the 
    course   of   arguments,   it   was   sought   to   be   contended   that   this   is   not   an 
    argument   of   'common   to   trade'   but   of   the   ability   of   a   consumer   to 
    distinguish   in   the   light   of   the   availability   of   larger   number   of   marks

<p id="p_85">    24.1 The aforesaid contention is clearly fallacious. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in

    the series of marks containing the common elements can only assist the defendant 
                                  
    when these marks are in extensive use in the market. The onus of proving such user 

    is of course on the person, who wants to rely on the marks. The Hon'ble Supreme 
                                 
    Court further held that it is possible that the mark may have been registered but not 

    used and therefore it is not possible to draw any inference as to the user from the  
        

    presence of the mark on the register.

    submitted that on the basis of sales of 2009 the court should presume that there 

    were extensive sales in 2006, the Court cannot be asked to presume what were the 
        


    sales figures of 2006. There cannot be any evidence by way of conjectures. Sales of 
     



    products   vary   from   time   to   time   and   year   to   year   depending   on   various   other 

    commercial factors. The Defendant also sought to contend that since the figures are 





    in 0.0 crores, there could be cases where the sales were lesser than Rs.1 lakh. The  

    said   contention   is   hypothetical.   In   any   case,   such   minuscule   sales   would   hardly 

    fulfill   the   requirements   of   extensive   sales.   It   was   also   contended   that   since   the 





    certificate did not cover the sales to hospitals, institutions and dispensing doctors, 

    the Court may presume that there would be further sales to such institutions. The 

    Defendant cannot require the Court to draw presumptions when the Defendant has 

    failed to produce the required evidence. The Defendant has also not explained that 

    when they could get the sales figures of 2009 ORG IMS, why the figures of 2006

<p id="p_99">    24.6 Being cognizant of their burden to bring evidence of extensive sales for the 

    year 2006, the Defendant placed reliance on the judgment of Hon'ble Madras High 

    Court in the case of  <a href="/doc/76332437/" id="a_37">Anji Reddy, Hyderabad-1 vs. Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft</a>  (supra), 




                                                                     
    where   the   Hon'ble   Court   while   considering   the   rival   marks   "NOVIGAN"   vs. 

    "NOVALGIN" observed that the Court had come across many other pharmaceutical 




                                                     
    preparations which start with the letters "NOVA" and "NOV". It was contended by 
                                  
    the Defendant that the said judgment was of 2006, the said observations should be 

    treated as fulfilling the requirements set out in the aforesaid judgments. In my view, 
                                 
    the said contention is clearly erroneous. Before the Hon'ble Madras High Court the 

    contention based on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  Corn  
        


    Products  (supra) and the other judgments was not even raised. The Hon'ble Court 
     



    had therefore no occasion to consider the compliance of the requirements in the 

    said judgments. Further, the Hon'ble Madras High Court merely stated that there 





    were other products in the market. The law as set out hereinabove is not merely to  

    show   presence   in   the   market   but   to   establish   extensive   sales.   In   any   case,   the 

    observations   of   the   Hon'ble   Madras   High   Court   are   that   there   are   products 





    beginning with the word "NOVA" and not "NOVA" as a suffix. As submitted by the 

    Plaintiff, the two situations are not at all comparable and certainly do not enable the 

    customers to discern the differences between the rival marks in the present case.

    advertised the Defendant's mark. It was sought to be contended that thus the expert

    proviso to <a href="/doc/698400/" id="a_41">section 20</a> of the Act.  Under the Trade Mark Act, 1999, the Registrar may 
      



    cause an application to be advertised prior to acceptance, if it relates to a trade mark  

    to which sub section (1) of <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_42">Section 9</a> and sub section (1) and (2) of <a href="/doc/1558275/" id="a_43">Section 11</a> apply.

    <a href="/doc/1158841/" id="a_45">section 9</a> (2), the Registrar may decline to register a mark if it is likely to deceive the

    likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. Thus, the advertisement before

    contention was not advanced during arguments. However, the Plaintiff has correctly 

    submitted that the Plaintiff was not granted ad-interim relief on the ground of delay 
                                
    of just one year in the initiation of court proceedings.  It would therefore not follow  
                               
    that the Plaintiff is not entitled to even interim relief on that ground. In any case, in 

    a case of an infringement action, in the absence of establishing acquiescence, mere 

    delay is never a defence. It is true that the Notice of Motion is taken up for final 
        


    hearing after six years but the Plaintiff cannot be denied relief merely because the 
     



    interim relief application could not be  heard earlier. A similar argument was raised 

    by the Defendant in another case of   Sami Khatib &amp; Anr. vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals

    marks were   derived from a   generic drug. It was in this context held that a party  




                                                       
    cannot have a monopoly over a portion of name which was derived from a generic 
                                   
    drug.  Further, in these cases, the Court held that the test laid down in Corn Products

    judgment, this Court was considering the marks 'Aziwok' and 'Aziwin'. The Court 

    clearly held in paragraph 7 that the drug which was the basis of the products was 





    'Azithromycin' and nobody could claim a monopoly over the word 'Azi' which was a 

    part of the basic drug. This  Court also held that 'Azi' was common to trade. Further, 

    this Court held in paragraph 10 while considering the judgment in the case of Cadila 





    that   since   both   the   products   were   made   of   a   single   ingredient,   the   question   of  

    causing any health problem or side effect really does not arise. None of these factors 

    are applicable in the present case. In the present case, the marks are not derived 

    from the basic drug. Further, the marks are for different ailments which may result in 

    disastrous consequences.

    by the hospitals and not by the consumers, any possibility of confusion is ruled out.

    apparent   that   "Vit"   was   a   well   known   common   abbreviation   used   in   the

    no one can have a monopoly over the right to use the name of the basic drug or a 
        


    part   thereof.   Further,   this   being   only   a   passing   of   action,   this   Court   considered 
     



    various other factors including, the packaging, the price, etc. The present case being 

    one of infringement, no such additional material can be relied upon.   Further, in the
