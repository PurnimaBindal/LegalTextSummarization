                                admitted by the plaintiff in his cross-examination

<p id="p_9">           3.                   This is defendant's second appeal. The plaintiff's suit for

           possession by way of redemption of mortgage dated 28th October, 1997

           succeeded on 4th May, 2005 in Civil Suit No.63 of 5th February, 2003. The

           defendant's appeal failed on 14th January, 2010 by appellate decree. By a

           separate order of even date, the defendant-appellant's application under

           Order 41 Rule 27 CPC seeking permission to allow him to lead additional

           evidence has been dismissed. Even in the court of first instance, the

           defendant had filed an application on 1st February, 2006 for leave to produce

           additional evidence through which it was sought to be proved that the

           defendant was a tenant in the suit premises. The dispute between the parties

           is whether the parties were in a relationship of mortgager and mortgagee or

           of landlord and tenant.

<p id="p_10">           4.                   The plaintiff asserts that the relationship is one of mortgager

           and mortgagee. The defendant denies the relationship and claims that he is a

           tenant in the demised ground floor premises run as a chemist shop by the

           defendant. The documents on which reliance is placed by way of additional

           evidence are part of municipal record being Annexures A-1 to A-4. The

           remaining are tax returns, account books etc. Annexure A-1 is a leaf from

           the Assessment Register maintained under Rule VII-2 of the Municipal

           Rules in Form T.S.1. It relates to the year 1998-99. Plaintiff Inder Kumar is

           the owner of suit property numbered B-II, 729/1 which is a commercial

           shop measuring 20' x 20'. In the column of name and address of occupier, it

           is recorded, "one shop of medicine on rent @ ` 4000/- per month". The

           amount of proposed tax and final assessment are recorded in Annexure A-1.

</p><p id="p_11">           5.                   Annexure A-2 is the House Tax Notice for the year 1998-99

           dated 8th June, 1998 issued by the office of Municipal Council, Sunam,

           addressed to plaintiff Inder Kumar. The property is described as

           commercial/rented and "self-occupied" but shown "on rent one shop at `

           4000/- per month". The total house tax payable is assessed at ` 8565/-. The

           document is signed by the Executive Officer, Municipal Council, Sunam.

</p><p id="p_12">           6.                   Annexure A-3 is the reply of the plaintiff to the notice under

           Sections 65 and 67 of the Punjab Municipal (Amendment) Act, 1994. The

           plaintiff complains that the rental value of that tax assessed is "on very

           higher side whereas its rental value is very less". The plaintiff prayed that

           the rental value be decreased and tax may be waived off. The reply is dated

           4th August, 1998.

           and assessment of tax for the year 1998-99. The decision of the House Tax

           99, the shop in dispute was "on rent" which suggests a reference to a person

           other than owner of property. However, these 4 documents have been ruled

           out of consideration with the dismissal of the application under Order 41

           defendant-appellant, draws the attention of the court to the order dated 14th

           January, 2007 declining the request for producing these 4 documents etc. as

           additional evidence. He argues that this means refusal to admit evidence

           which ought to have been admitted. He submits that these documents were

           special to the knowledge of Inder Singh plaintiff and militated against his

           cause set up in the suit but came to the knowledge of the defendant prior to

           1st February, 2006 when a similar application was filed before the court of

           first instance when the trail was taking place. These documents should have

           been produced by the plaintiff if he were to be seen as approaching the court

           with clean hands and with full disclosure of material facts for consideration

           of the Court. The suit was decreed on 4th May, 2006. It is forthcoming from

           the record that the learned trial court dismissed the application on 4th March,

           2006 against which Civil Revision No.1473 of 2006 was filed before this

           Court by the appellant but the same was dismissed as not pressed.

           necessary to take stock of Civil Revision No.7062 of 2011 which has been

           ordered to be heard with the main appeal and attached with this case for

           final decision. The revision arises out of Civil Suit No.129 dated 24th

           October, 2008 filed by plaintiff Inder Kumar against defendant Yogesh

           Kumar, the present appellant, for mesne profits after decree in Civil Suit

           No.63 of 5th February, 2003 was passed in which petition a prayer was made

           for stay of further proceedings in the civil suit pending revision petition in

           view of the pendency of the present appeal. Having succeeded in the

           previous suit from where this appeal arises, plaintiff Yogesh Kumar filed

           suit in the year 2008 for mesne profits and recovery of ` 2,16,000/- from

           27th October, 2005 to 26th October, 2008 @ ` 6,000/- per month along with

           interest @ 12% per annum for use and occupation of the shop in dispute.

</p><p id="p_19">           11.                  The second suit was filed on the premise that the plaintiff had

           mortgaged the shop in question to Yogesh Kumar and the redemption period

           of 5 years have expired but Yogesh Kumar did not vacate the shop in

           question. On 17th November, 2011, this Court issued notice of motion in the

           revision and notice regarding stay as well after noticing the contention

           based on the assertion that the petitioner is in possession of the shop as a

           tenant and not as a mortgagor. In the present appeal, dispossession of the

           appellant from the premises in dispute was stayed on 29th April, 2010 and

           the appeal was admitted on 8th February, 2011. On 26th March, 2012 in CR

           No.7062 of 2011, this Court directed the trial court to adjourn the case

           beyond the date fixed by this Court. That order has been continued and both

           the cases have been tagged together. It may be noted that on 20th September,

           rejected for the principal reason that a similar application had been declined

           by the High Court and this fact has been concealed by the appellant. Since a

           similar application has been dismissed, then the same evidence cannot be

           allowed to be adduced by the appellant by way of additional evidence when

           the same relief has already been declined by the High Court.

           view has been taken that the application has been filed only to delay the

           the order of the High Court when the revision was dismissed as not pressed.

           It did not mean that the request had been declined in as many words and,

           therefore, the question remained at large before the court of first appeal to

           be decided in accordance with the provisions of Order 41 Rule 27 of the

           CPC. And if the ingredients laid down therein were satisfied then refusal to

           admit evidence which was necessary to be allowed to be adduced was not

           proper or sound exercise of discretion and jurisdiction. It was not that the

           plea of tenancy was not taken in defence to the suit. He submits that the

           defendant had remained in possession since 1992 under Harnam Singh who

           had inducted him as a tenant at rent of ` 1,000/- per month where a chemist

           drugs licence on 9th September, 1992 from the Drug Controller specifically

           qua the questioned shop since the submission of the site plan of a chemist

           shop to the drug authorities is mandatory for the grant of drugs licence.

           Harnam Singh had taken ` 25,000/- as advance security from defendant

           Yogesh Kumar and had got executed an alleged mortgage deed to avoid the

           rent laws. Harnam Singh proposed to sell the property to the plaintiff. On

           15th October, 1997, defendant Yogesh Kumar paid a sum of ` 2,40,000/- to

           the plaintiff by cheque No.281821 drawn on PNB, Sunam which was

           encashed on the same day as proved by the bank statement Ex.D88 at page

           177 of the LCR. This amount was given in anticipation of purchase of shop

           by the plaintiff from Harnam Singh. It is Mr.Singla's submission that the

           payment was made with the understanding that the defendant will continue

           as tenant in the shop in question and that in addition to the old rent of `

           1,000/- per month, interest on the aforesaid amount shall be the additional

           taking actual possession for Inder Kumar, as defendant Yogesh Kumar never

           admitted the alleged receipt Ex.P3 of alleged redemption by Harnam Singh

           had a fiduciary relationship and also because the new landlord plaintiff

           Inder Kumar was in a position of active confidence over existing tenant

           Yogesh Kumar and thus, <a href="/doc/1507203/" id="a_3">Section 111</a> of the Evidence Act comes into play in

           favour of the defendant and onus to prove good faith of the alleged

           mortgage transaction was upon the plaintiff on which count he failed. The

           recital in the deed regarding delivery of possession i.e. Kabza bator murthin

           de ditta hai means possession as murthin/mortgagee delivered and this only

           refers to the symbolic delivery as actual possession was already with the

           defendant which was continuing since 1992 as tenant and otherwise also,

           when Inder Kumar himself obtained symbolic possession only, there is no

           question of actual delivery of possession to the defendant by Inder Kumar of

           the ground floor of the shop in question which is also clear from the

           aforementioned cross-examination of the plaintiff and the defendant.

</p><p id="p_27">           18.                  Mr.Singla further submits that his client, the defendant Yogesh

           Kumar, had remained in possession of the suit shop even after its purchase

           from Harnam Singh by the plaintiff and before the alleged mortgage Ex.P1

           by the plaintiff which is proved from Ex.D8 to D54 which are medicine

           purchase bills and Ex.D58 to Ex.D86- medicine sale bills from 17th October,

           1997 to 28th October, 1997 and Ex.D55 to Ex.D57 receipts dated 28th

           surrendered for the moot 11 days nor was there any merger of tenancy

           rights. Even no money was paid for this alleged mortgage on 28th October,

           1997 and the plaintiff admitted that the money referred in Ex.P1 is the same

           payment on 28th October, 1997 was made, nor on that day possession was

           delivered. So such recitals in Ex.P1 are not correct and it shows use of

           influence as contemplated under <a href="/doc/1507203/" id="a_4">Section 111</a> of the Evidence Act. There is a

           clog on redemption for 5 years in the deed Ex.P1 which further shows that

           the intention behind execution of the said document was the continuation of

           possession and it supports the tenancy theory of the defendant and that real

           transaction between the parties was not that of mortgage and was just a

           subterfuge. The fact that the sale price of the shop 11 days before was only

           ` 50,000/- also indicates that this document does not reflect any actual

           mortgage transaction because actual mortgage value would obviously be

           less than the sale value. It is also implausible that only after 11 days of the

           purchase of the shop on payment of the entire price; the plaintiff was in

           need of money prompting him to mortgage the shop. The prior tenancy did

           not merge in the subsequent alleged mortgage and even on redemption of

           the alleged mortgage, no decree for possession can be passed since the

           tenancy subsists and if it subsists eviction can be had only under statutory

           rent laws.

           possession for 11 days is implausible since the defendant had already made

           payment of ` 2,40,000/- on 15th October, 1997 and no man of ordinary

           are of symbolic possession only and the plaintiff admitted continuous

           possession of the defendant over the suit shop since 1992 in his cross-

           examination and also put a suggestion to the defendant in his cross-

           examination that actual possession only of the roof/first floor of the shop

           was taken. There is no evidence of any person of the locality to prove the

           alleged break in possession for this relevant period.

</p><p id="p_29">           20.                  To buttress his contentions, Mr.Singla has relied on a selection

           of judgments on several issues arising which are put pithily in thumbnail.

           He refers to <a href="/doc/205529/" id="a_5">Sections 91</a> and <a href="/doc/1790262/" id="a_6">92</a> of the Evidence Act in order to show that

           the evidence to prove the real intention of the parties and the real nature of

           the transaction is admissible. When the mortgage transactions are found

           sham in such cases, the defendants have been held to be tenants. For this

           proposition he relies on Bakshi Jaswant Singh v. Pushpa Devi; 1988 (1)

           PLR 478. There can be no merger of prior tenancy with subsequent

           mortgagee. For this legal proposition, he relies on <a href="/doc/975074/" id="a_7">Parmar Kanksinh v.

           interlocutory stage pending trial where rights to challenge orders remain

           alive in the appeal against the decree. On the last question on the

           jurisdiction of the appeal court, he submits that while allowing additional

           evidence, the appeal court can itself record or direct the trial court to do so.

           possession by way of redemption of tenanted shop even in the presence of

           mortgage documents could not have been decreed as the defendant-

           appellant was inducted in the shop as a tenant and the mortgage documents

           were prepared just as a security for performance and also to keep pressure

           upon the tenant. He relies on Bakshi Jaswant Singh and Kaushalya Devi

           cases [supra] to further his point in furtherance of his submissions that the

           defendant could be dispossessed only as per the grounds mentioned in

           Section 13 of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 and the suit

           is clearly barred in the opening line of the said Section which for ready

           shop and no amount of interest was required to be paid to Yogesh Kumar.

           The mortgage was for a period of 5 years, i.e., 28th October, 1997 to 27th

           October, 2002 after the expiry of which period, the suit was instituted.

</p><p id="p_37">           28.                  Mr.Monga criticizes the theory built by the defendant that he

           was a tenant of Harnam Singh till 17th October, 1997 and he never

           relinquished possession of the shop to Harnam Singh though a mortgage

           deed executed between the defendant and the plaintiff on 28th October, 1997

           but actually, he continued as a tenant. This is not correct position in fact.

           The plaintiff filed replication and controverted the theory and pleaded that

           the erstwhile owner Harnam Singh had got the shop redeemed by making

           payment of a sum of ` 25,000/- to defendant Yogesh Kumar on 17th October,

           1997 and possession of the shop was delivered back to him, i.e., to Harnam

           Singh. In this manner, Harnam Singh recovered possession and executed

           sale deed dated 17th October, 1997 in favour of the plaintiff and delivered

           possession to him on the same day. Thereafter, the mortgage deed was

           executed between the plaintiff-respondent and the defendant-appellant on

           28th October, 1997 in lieu of mortgage money to the tune of ` 2,40,000/-.

           failed to produce on record any rent receipt/rent note in order to prove

           himself as a tenant in the shop in question. The documentary evidence

           brought on record by the plaintiff cannot be defeated by oral evidence in

           view of the provisions of <a href="/doc/205529/" id="a_14">Sections 91</a> and <a href="/doc/1790262/" id="a_15">92</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. He

           sell, oral evidence with regard to terms of agreement cannot be accepted.

           Learned counsel then submits that the defendant admitted execution of the

           mortgage deed Ex.P15 in his cross-examination but tried to wriggle out of

           the submission by retracting that his Advocate had wrongly made statement

           regarding the mortgage in the said documents. He refers to page 207 of the

           LCR. Even again, if the defendant maintained that the amount of `

           2,40,000/- was a loan amount and not mortgage money, he never filed any

           suit for recovery of the loan within the period of limitation.

           days gap. Those do not qualify as evidence since the defendant was unable

           to disclose who issued the bills since he had not signed them. Likewise, in

           Ex.D27 to D57, the defendant was unable to say as to whose writing it bore.

           He submits that the Courts below have correctly not relied on those

           documents and have disbelieved them nor can it be ascertained whether

           those bills relate to the same premises. It has also come in evidence that the

           manner, Mr.Monga broaches the subject of the municipal record at

           Annexures A-1 to A-4 and on this; he submits that entries in the assessment

           register with regard to house tax cannot be relied upon to establish tenancy.

           He relies on a ruling of the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/139423/" id="a_17">Dnyaneshwar Ranganath

           Bhandare and another v. Sadhu Dadu Shettigar (Shetty) and another</a>;

           2012 (1) RCR (Civil) 499 (SC). Mr.Monga submits that the municipal

           record might show possession but will not prove tenancy and this is the

           difference and the ratio of the decision in Dnyaneshwar Ranganath. In this

           case which involved the question whether parties were governed by a lease

           or a license with the defendant therein claiming tenancy rights by producing

           some tax receipts of suit property paid to the municipality. However, no rent

           receipts were produced by defendant showing payment of rent to the

           landlord. Moreover, the defendant did not claim that the payment of tax was

           a part of rent. Therefore, it was held that production of tax receipts do not

           prove tenancy and the defendants are gratuitous licencees. Noticeably, in the

           case, there was no admission by the owner of tenancy in the municipal

           record to which the defendant was not a party. I then do not see how this

           case can be of any substantial help to the plaintiff as it is distinguishable on

           facts. There was no admission of tenancy by the landlord.

           bearing on the main issue or is found to be necessary to remove any lacuna

           in evidence and for clearing any doubt for pronouncing judgment and

           required in the interest of justice, it may be allowed. For this see paragraphs

           36 to 49. It would be apt to add that the observation made by the Supreme

           Court also said in the context of pronouncement of judgment that it should

           be "satisfactory judgment" and therein lies the door of perception. This

           binding authority cuts both ways and casts a substantial burden on the

           shoulders of the appellate court to weigh all factors in a balance of justice

           within the ingredients prescribed in Order 41 Rule 27 of the CPC and

           establish from record whether refusal to admit evidence is proper and such a

           determination will have to be made from case to case. The true intent of this

           judgment in fact comes in favour of the defendant on two counts; that it

           cannot be said that Annexures A-1 to A-4 etc. should be lightly brushed

           aside as not worthy of consideration at all and secondly, the reason for

           dismissal should stand the test of judicial scrutiny. But on a reading of the

           impugned order declining the request it cannot be said that relevant

           considerations have gone into making of the order. The order rests on an

           assumption which is incorrect and wholly fallacious because the revision

           was dismissed as not pressed but it did not foreclose reception of additional

           evidence for all times to come and never to be read by a court of law.

           from this case. Delay in proceedings can be taken care of without much

           difficulty and balance it with the demands of substantial justice. Therefore,

           in order to tide over the hardship which may be caused by prolonging
