</p><p id="p_2">1.   The Appellant, M/s Global Energy Private Limited, questioning the

     legality and validity of the impugned order dated 19.12.2014 (herein the

     "impugned order") passed in Petition No. 148 of 2014 on the file of the

     Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (hereinafter referred to as

     "Commission"     or   "Respondent    Commission"      or   "Maharashtra

     Commission") presented this Appeal under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_1">Section 111</a> of the Electricity

     Act 2013.

1.1   The impugned order has been passed by the Respondent No. 1 Commission

      by dismissing the Petition filed by the Appellant herein, bearing Petition

      No. 148 of 2014, wherein the Appellant challenged the arbitrary and illegal

      actions of Tata Power Company Limited (hereinafter "Respondent No. 2"

      or "TPCL") of imposing "temporary / mutual / unregulated" charges and

      other arbitrary charges on consumers opting for a partial open access, for

      the quantum of the retained / remaining contract demand with the

      Respondent No. 2. As per the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_2">Electricity Act</a> 2003 and

      the Regulations framed thereunder, a distribution licensee cannot charge

      any tariff which has not been determined by a Regulatory Commission, for

      an allocated contract demand of a consumer. The same is alleged to be an

      abuse of dominant position, and amounts to put roadblocks, including

      playing with the market in a manner so as to prevent consumers from

      availing open access / partial open access.
</p>
<p id="p_5">1.2   By the aforementioned actions, the Respondent No. 2 licensee is stated to

      have forced the consumers to either take full load open access for their

      entire electricity load, or to source the entire said load from the said

      Respondent without exercising the option of partial open access. Vide its

      impugned order dated 19.12.2014, the Respondent No. 1 Commission

      disposed off the aforementioned petition filed by the Appellant herein, on

      the ground that the Appellant did not have any "locus standi" to maintain

      the said petition.

1.3   It is the case of the Appellant, the Respondent No. 1 Commission failed to

      ascertain that the Appellant was the aggrieved party since its business was

      suffering on account of the above actions of the Respondent No. 2 licensee

      which prevented consumers to exercise the option of open access. Further,

      by its actions, the Respondent No. 2 is said to have abused its monopoly in

      distribution of electricity so as to suppress the competitiveness of the

      market by forcing the consumers not to seek open access.

1.4   Being aggrieved by the impugned order, the Appellant preferred this

      appeal.

<p id="p_10">2.1   Global Energy Private limited, the Appellant herein, is a company

      incorporated under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/1353758/" id="a_3">Companies Act</a>, 1956 having its

      registered office at 104, 10th Floor, Maker Chamber-VI, Nariman Point,

      Mumbai - 400 021, engaged in the business of trading of electricity.

2.2   Respondent No. 1 herein is the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory

      Commission, which is exercising its powers and discharging functions

      under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_4">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 as a sector regulator.

2.3   Tata Power Company Limited, the Respondent No. 2 herein, is a

2.4   Tata Communications Limited, the Respondent No. 3 herein, is a consumer

      of electricity located in the distribution area of Respondent No. 2

2.5   The Respondent No. 3 entered into an agreement, vide an LOI dated

      05.09.2012, with the Appellant, who is a trader of electricity, for

      procurement of energy under open access for its two establishments located

      in Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai and Andheri, Mumbai.

2.6   Thereafter, the Respondent No. 3 made two applications on 28.03.2013 post

      execution of the above agreement with the Respondent No. 2. The source

      generator was mentioned as MSEDCL on account of the fact that a

      substantial portion of the Appellant's energy was lying banked with the

      MSEDCL and it was intended to supply the same to the Respondent No. 3.

      However, the said application was neither considered by the second

      Respondent nor rejected the same.

<p id="p_13">2.7   Under Regulation 5.1 of the MERC (Distribution Open Access)

      Regulations, 2005, for availing open access a mandatory "Connection and

      Use of Distribution System Agreement" has to be entered into between the

      Distribution Licensee, the Consumer seeking Open Access and the Licensee

      intending to give supply to the consumer using the distribution system of

      the Distribution Licensee for wheeling of power.          The format of the

      Agreement is also provided in the said Regulations.

      However, the mandated "Connection and Use of Distribution System

      Open Access Regulations of the Respondent Commission. The Respondent

      No. 2, through an email dated 07.05.2013, circulated a draft Connection and

      Use of Distribution System Agreement.        In the light of the conditions

      imposed by the Respondent No. 2, in November 2013, and being left with

      no option, the agreement for Open Access Terms and Conditions (T &amp; C)

      was entered between the Respondent No. 2 and Respondent No. 3. The

      said agreement of the Respondent No. 2 was contrary to the MERC

      (Distribution Open Access) Regulations 2005, since the same contained

      clauses with respect to the levy of mutual / unregulated / temporary tariff

      for the retained / remaining "contract demand" with the Discom.

2.8   On 25.06.2013, the Appellant, being a trader and supplier of energy under

      the above partial open access transaction, on behalf of Respondent No. 3,

      wrote to the Respondent No. 2 for issuance of No Objection Certificate in

      respect of the grant of partial open access permission. The letter further

      pointed out that the Respondent No. 2's standard terms and conditions for

      open access had already been finalized.

<p id="p_14">2.9   On 28.06.2013, the Respondent No. 2 wrote to the Respondent No. 3 stating

      that the Respondent No. 2 was willing to grant partial open access, and vide

      the said letter, the Respondent No. 2 also intimated that the tariff for such

      open access transaction would have to be "mutually agreed" upon for the

      load continuing with the Respondent No. 2, i.e. retained contract demand.

2.10 On 11.07.2013, the Appellant, on behalf of the Respondent No. 3, wrote to

      the Respondent No. 2 stating that over 100 days had elapsed since the

      application for Open Access was made and delay in issuance of the NOC

      was causing a financial loss. Furthermore, due to the delay caused by the

      Respondent No. 2 while processing the said application, the Appellant's

      LOI with the generator had lapsed.
</p>
<p id="p_16">2.11 On 24.07.2013, the Respondent No. 2 wrote a letter to the Respondent No.

      3 wherein the charges applicable to the consumer for load continued to be

      maintained with Respondent No. 2, i.e. retained contract demand, were

      stipulated. The charges pertained to Contract Demand Charges, Energy

      Charges, Wheeling and Transmission Charges, Wheeling and Transmission

      Losses were not in consonance with the tariff order of the Respondent No. 1

      Commission. At this stage, Respondent No. 2 even proposed to levy Cross

      Subsidy Surcharge on the energy supplied by it to Respondent No. 3. The

      charges so intimated were blatantly in contravention of various orders and

      directions issued by the Respondent No. 1 Commission.

2.12 On 30.07.2013 a letter was issued by the Respondent No. 2 to the Appellant

      emphasizing on a single point contact which clearly ascertained that the

      clear intention of the Respondent No. 2 was to put the Appellant, who is a

      trader, out of picture in any of the open access transactions. For this very

      reason, the Respondent No. 2 was unwilling to sign the Connection and Use

      of Distribution Agreement, which is a tripartite agreement between a

      Discom, Consumer and the Supplier / Trader.
</p>
<p id="p_17">2.13 The Appellant had received two Letters of Intent (LOI) from the

      Respondent No. 3 for supply of power to two different locations. However,

      on account of the adverse situation created by the conduct / actions of the

      Respondent No. 2, the Respondent No. 3 only went for open access for one

      of its locations while dropping the other location.

2.14 Post the delay in grant of NOC, the Respondent No. 3 issued a fresh LOI

      dated 14.08.2013 to the Appellant for procurement of energy under open

      access.
</p>
<p id="p_18">2.15 Post the issuance of the LOI from Respondent No. 3 to the Appellant, the

      said Respondent submitted a fresh application to the Respondent No. 2 on

      19.08.2013 for availing partial open access to the extent of 1.5 MW.

2.16 On 09.10.2013, partial open access was granted to the Respondent No. 3 by

      the Respondent No. 2 after a substantial delay. The said delay was also

      caused as a result of the imposition of conditions by the Respondent No. 2,

      relating to charging of temporary / unregulated / mutual tariff for the

      retained / remaining contract demand, which conditions were contrary to

      the statutory requirements, relating to the retained contract demand. Hence,

      the Respondent No. 2, by such conduct, caused delays in the process of

      securing open access by the Respondent No. 3.

2.17 On 16.01.2014 the Respondent No. 3 vide its correspondence protested

      about the tariff being levied by the Respondent No. 2 on the retained /

      remaining contract demand being availed by the Respondent No. 3, which

      was in contravention to the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_6">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 read with

      the MERC (Distribution Open Access) Regulations 2005.

2.18 On 21.01.2014, the Respondent No. 2 wrote to the Respondent No. 3

      justifying that it had granted partial open access as per the present and

      prevailing regulatory framework.       It was further submitted by the

      Respondent No. 2 that once the Respondent No. 3 availed open access, only

      the wheeling charges determined by Respondent No. 1 Commission were

      applicable. It was also further stated that the charges applicable for supply

      of electricity to the Respondent No. 3 by the Respondent No. 2, for even a

      part of the load, would be as "mutually" agreed between the Respondent

      2, being a trader and supplier of electricity to the various consumers under

      open access, concerns were raised with respect to the aforementioned illegal

      actions of the Respondent No. 2 in demanding a mutually agreed tariff for

      the retained / remaining contract demand. The said action violates the very

      license conditions of the Respondent No. 2 as a distribution licensee cannot

      Appellant responding to all the issues highlighted by the Appellant in its

      letter of 30.01.2014. The arbitrary and illegal acts of the Respondent No. 2

      are further confirmed vide admissions made by them in the said letter.

2.21 As per the Appellant, the Respondent No. 2 has apparently abused its

      dominant position by making concerted efforts to thwart Open Access

      within its Distribution System. The actions of the Respondent No. 2 in

      treating the partial open access customer as a full open access customer are

      arbitrary, illegal and non-est in the light of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_8">Electricity

      Act</a>, 2003, Regulations relating to non-discriminatory open access and

      various orders passed by the Respondent No. 1 Commission and this

      Appellate Tribunal. The Respondent No. 2 has further been raising illegal

      charges vis-à-vis the retained contract demand, which charges have not

      been determined and approved by the Respondent No. 1 Commission.

2.22 The Respondent No. 2 is an entity which enjoys a monopoly in terms of the

      power supply business of its licensed area. Further, the said monopoly

      stands established by the fact that any open access has to be permitted by

      the said Respondent through its lines, and the said permission was being

      withheld on account of the illegal stand of the said Respondent in treating

      the retained / remaining contract demand attracting temporary / mutual

     "mutually" agreed tariff for the retained / remaining contract demand, in

     case of a partial open access, the Appellant was constrained to file a

     petition, being Case No. 148 OF 2014, on the file of the first Respondent

     Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_23">     The Respondent No. 2 also filed a reply dated 21.11.2014 to the petition

the losses it has incurred on account of TPC's actions.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_25">9. The impugned actions of TPC, a Distribution Licensee, relate to
the conditionalities regarding Tariff and charges imposed on its
consumer, TCL. The being the case, the matter is entirely between
TPC and TCL, and not between TPC and the Petitioner. TCL is a
Respondent in these proceedings. The fact that it has chosen not to
appear or participate in them does not give GEPL any locus on its
behalf. It is for TCL alone, as the consumer, to raise a dispute or
grievance in this regard, and it has chosen not to do so before the
Commission or, apparently, elsewhere. If TPC's actions vis-a-vis
TCL have also adversely affected GEPL, as the Trading Licensee
from whom TCL sought Open Access supply, it is the Civil Courts
before whom GEPL may claim compensation or damages.                 This
Petition is, therefore, not maintainable before the Commission.

charges are basic features of the EA, 2003. In the present matter,
TPC has submitted that, on 22 April 2014, it revised the terms on
which partial Open Access was granted to TCL so as to apply the
Commission-approved Tariff to its reduced Contract Demand, and
has refunded the differential amount thereafter.          TPC has also
mentioned that it had applied such Tariff in a subsequent case of M/s
Mahindra and Mahindra also. However, TPC is directed to submit
to the Commission, within a month, details of all applications seeking
Open Access from April, 2013 up to 24th June, 2014 (following which
the new Distribution Open Access Regulations, 2014 were notified),

</p>
<p id="p_28">            The Appellant claims to be the aggrieved party since the business of

      the Appellant was suffering on account of the actions of the Respondent

      No. 2 licensee which prevented consumers to exercise the option of open

      access. Further, by its actions, the Respondent No. 2 abused its monopoly

      in distribution of electricity so as to suppress the competitiveness of the

      market by forcing the consumers not to seek open access. Being aggrieved

      by the impugned order, which is prima facie cryptic and bad in law, the

      Appellant has preferred the instant appeal.

<p id="p_29">3.    Question of Law

      Following questions of law have been raised in the appeal for consideration:

3.1 Whether the Respondent Commission was correct in holding that it had no

     Locus to initiate and maintain Case No. 148 of 2014 despite the fact that a

     legal injury was inflicted on the Appellant?
</p>
<p id="p_30">3.2 Whether the Respondent Commission was correct in holding that it had no

3.3 Whether the Respondent Commission has erred in not considering the fact

    that even a legal injury is enough to initiate proceedings before a court of

    law?

<p id="p_33">3.4 Whether the Respondent No. 2 was correct in levying temporary / mutual /

    potential open access customers from availing the said option of open

3.8 Whether the Respondent Commission ignored the fact that open access is a

      right of a consumer, and not an obligation, and a consumer can choose to

      avail a part of his energy requirement through open access, and for the

      remaining part the said consumer can choose to continue being a consumer

      relate to the conditionalities regarding Tariff and charges
      imposed on its consumer, TCL. That being the case, the matter
      is entirely between TPC and TCL, and not between TPC and
      the Petitioner. TCL is a Respondent in these proceedings. The
      fact that it has chosen not to appear or participate in them

</p>
<p id="p_45">Therefore, the entire issue in the present appeal relates to the fact that the

Respondent Commission in the impugned order has erroneously held that

the petition filed by the Appellant before the Respondent Commission was

not maintainable, and that for adjudication of any disputes between the

Appellant, which is a trading licensee, and the Respondent No. 2, which is a

distribution licensee, the same can only be done by the Civil Courts and not

by the said Commission, which is in the teeth of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_10">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the

      the Respondent Commission which has the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon

      disputes between two licensees.
</p>
<p id="p_46">
4.2   BRIEF BACKGROUND
4.2(a) The factual issue in brief relates to whether the Respondent No. 2, which is

      a distribution licensee and a regulated entity, has the ability to charge

      "temporary / mutual / unregulated" tariff, qua the reduced contract demand,

      from open access consumers who choose to avail power under partial open

      access, from the Appellant. This is outside the regulatory regime as a

      distribution licensee cannot at all charge a tariff from its own consumers

      which is unregulated/ mutually agreed for a contract demand maintained by

      such consumers, as the Respondent No. 2 can only charge a retail tariff

      from its consumers which is approved by a regulatory commission under

      <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_11">Section 62(1)(d)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.

4.2(b) Since the Respondent No. 3 sought to source a part of its power demand

      from the Appellant, which is a trading licensee as per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_12">Section 14</a> of the

      Electricity Act 2003, the said Respondent reduced its contract demand from

      the Respondent No. 2. In the present case, the Respondent No. 2 sought to

      impose temporary / mutually agreed/ unregulated tariff for the said reduced

      contract demand maintained by the Respondent No. 3 (which is a

      consumer) with the Respondent No. 2. This resulted in manipulation of the

      market in a manner which made open access a completely unviable option

      for the end consumers, thereby forcing the said consumers to remain with


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_17">                                                                            Page 17 of 73</span>
                                                      Judgment of Appeal No. 77 of 2015


      the Respondent No. 2 by not availing open access and consequentially

      affecting the business/ functioning of the Appellant who is a trading

      licensee and supplies power to consumers under open access. It is submitted

      that as per the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_13">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 a distribution licensee

      cannot demand charges for supply of power, which have not been

      determined by a regulatory commission

4.2(c) In a partial open access, a consumer (Respondent No. 3) sources a part of

      its electricity requirement from an independent/ 3rd party source of its

      choice (Appellant), and continues to source the remaining part of its

      electricity requirement from its own area distribution licensee (Respondent

      No. 2). For sourcing the part-requirement of electricity from its own area

      distribution licensee, a consumer has to maintain a contract demand which

      is either equal to or more than the said part-requirement of electricity. For

      the remaining part, the said consumer is dependent upon the open access

      source. In such a scenario, a distribution licensee, in terms of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_14">Section

      62(1)(d)</a> of the Electricity Act 2003, can only charge tariff as determined by

      a regulatory commission in its retail tariff order to the extent of power

      sourced by the consumer which is less than or equal to the contract demand

      the said consumer maintains with the said distribution licensee.

      In the event of a consumer drawing power from the area distribution

      licensee which is more than the contract demand maintained with the said




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_18">                                                                          Page 18 of 73</span>

      licensee, and is also not covered under the open access on account of either

      the open access source failing to supply power or the drawl of electricity is

      over and above the said open access source, then the area distribution

      licensee is free to charge a temporary tariff which is also determined by a

      regulatory commission. As such, in no circumstance an area distribution

      licensee can charge a mutually agreed tariff for supply of power to a

      consumer in its licensed area.
</p>
<p id="p_47">4.2(d) On account of the above protocol, the action of the Respondent No. 2 in

      seeking to impose a mutual agreed/ temporary / unregulated tariff upon the

      Respondent No. 3 for the reduced contract demand the said Respondent had

      with the Respondent No. 2, as a result of availing partial open access from

      the Appellant, amounts to an abuse of dominant position and a

      manipulation of market so as to kill open access by making it an expensive

      proposition. In this context reference may be made to the contents of para 7

      of the main appeal. The same further amounts to adversely affect the

      interests of the Appellant as the said Appellant is dependent upon open

      access for trading in electricity. Any action of the Respondent No. 2 which

      directly and materially affects by restraining end consumers from availing

      open access would be amenable to the regulatory jurisdiction of this

      Hon'ble Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_48">4.2(e) Upon being aggrieved by the aforementioned actions of the Respondent No.

      2, the Appellant herein filed a petition, being Case No. 148 of 2014, before


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_19">                                                                         Page 19 of 73</span>

      the Respondent Commission thereby, inter alia, claiming damages /

      compensation on account of loss of business as well as compensation with

      respect to abuse of dominant position by the Respondent No. 2. In the said

      petition, the Respondent Commission passed the impugned order.


4.3   ISSUES INVOLVED FOR ADJUDICATION
4.3(a) In view of the above, the Appellant has submitted that the impugned order

      is wholly erroneous on following counts:
</p>
<p id="p_49">      (i)    The Respondent Commission has wrongly observed that the
             Appellant/ Trading Licensee had no locus to initiate proceedings
             against the Respondent No. 2; and

</p><p id="p_50">      (ii)   The Respondent Commission has wrongly observed that the
             Appellant ought to approach a Civil Court for adjudication of
             disputes, qua claiming of damages / compensation, against a
             distribution licensee / Respondent No. 2.
</p>
<p id="p_51">      The Appellant in the present appeal, is therefore, seeking setting aside of

      the impugned order, as under the provisions of the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_15">Electricity Act</a>, 2003 it is

      only the Respondent Commission which has to adjudicate disputes between

      licensees. As such, the Appellant is further seeking a remand of the entire

      case to the Respondent Commission for a fresh adjudication on merits, as

      there has not been a proper application of mind qua the grievances of the

      Appellant. It is stated that there cannot at all be an adjudication on merits by

      maintainable.

<p id="p_52">
4.4   LEGAL SUBMISSIONS

4.4(a) In the context of the issue involved, the Appellant refers to <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_16">Section 86</a> of

      the Electricity Act, 2003, which is set out herein below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">             "Section 86. (Functions of State Commission): --- (1) The
             State Commission shall discharge the following functions,
             namely: -
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_4">             (f) adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees and
                 generating companies and to refer any dispute for
                 arbitration"
</blockquote>
<p id="p_53">      As per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_17">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the Electricity Act 2003, a State Electricity

      Regulatory Commission is empowered to adjudicate upon disputes between

      licensees and generating companies, and inter-se between the licensees and

      generating companies. In the present case, the Appellant is an inter-state

      trading licensee and the Respondent No. 2 is a distribution licensee.


4.4(b) As per the provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_18">Section 86(1)</a>, sub clauses (a) to (e) and (g) to (k)

      relate to regulatory and administrative powers of the State Electricity

      Regulatory Commission. It is only the sub clause (f) which deals with the

      adjudicatory powers of a regulatory commission. The present case deals

      with the adjudicatory powers of the Respondent Commission under Section




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_21">                                                                          Page 21 of 73</span>

     86(1)(f) to adjudicate a dispute raised between two licensees (Appellant and

     the Respondent No. 2), and to award compensation/ damages. The said

     dispute was on account of the violation of provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_19">Sections 42</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_20">57</a>, <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_21">60</a>,

     <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_22">61</a> and <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_23">62</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003 by the Respondent No. 2 which

     caused a legal and financial injury to the Appellant.


4.4(c) The Respondent Commission was absolutely wrong to hold that the

     Appellant had no locus to institute the proceedings against the Respondent

     No. 2. This is on account of the following:
</p>
<p id="p_54">
     a.    Firstly, the Respondent Commission observed that the Appellant had

           filed the petition on behalf of the Respondent No. 3. This was wrong

           as the Appellant was independently aggrieved on account of the

           actions of the Respondent No. 2; and


     b.    Secondly, the Appellant itself suffered a legal and financial injury on

           account of manipulation of the market by the Respondent No. 2, by

           seeking to impose temporary / mutual / unregulated tariff on an open

           access consumer (Respondent No. 3) for the power drawn against the

           reduced contract demand the said consumer maintains with the

           Respondent No. 2. This created a perception in the market that a

           consumer seeking to avail open access will be subjected to

           imposition of temporary / mutual / unregulated tariff for the power

           drawn against a contract demand maintained with its own area

           distribution licensee, thereby killing the open access market and

           preventing the Appellant from trading in electricity. As per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_24">Section

           42(2)</a>, the Respondent No. 2 has to grant a non-discriminatory open

           access, and the above actions of the said Respondent created

           discrimination between the consumers opting for open access and

           those who do not opt for the same.
</p>
<p id="p_55">
4.4(d) The Respondent Commission is a creature of Statute and has to function

     within the four corners of the said Statute. The jurisdiction to exercise

     power by the Respondent Commission depends upon the existence of a

     "jurisdictional fact" as required by <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_25">Section 86(1)(f)</a>. As per the said

     provision, the jurisdictional fact required to invoke the jurisdiction of the

     Respondent Commission is as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_56">
     a.    The parties before the Respondent Commission have to be either
           licensees and/ or generating companies or both; and

     b.    The party initiating a proceeding has to allege a dispute.

     Once the aforementioned jurisdictional fact is in existence, then a

extraordinary jurisdiction under the <a href="/doc/1712542/" id="a_60">Article 226</a>, an
applicant should ordinarily be one who has a personal
or individual right in the subject matter of the
application. In other words, infringement of some legal
right or prejudice to some legal interest inhering in the
applicant is necessary to give him locus-standi in the
matter.

something or wrongfully affected his title to something.

aggrieved", other than the arraigned party before the

sense or who has suffered a legal grievance. The person
is entitled to file an Appeal.

4.5(a) From the aforementioned submissions, the impugned order is wrong on

      account of the following:

<p id="p_96">
      a.    On account of the existence of the "jurisdictional fact" as per the
            provisions of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_68">Section 86(1)(f)</a>, the Respondent Commission is the
            only adjudicatory body which can adjudicate upon disputes raised
            between two licensees, viz. the Appellant (trading licensee) and the
            Respondent No. 2 (distribution licensee);

            note, raised by the Appellant against the Respondent No. 2;

      c.    The Appellant had the locus to initiate proceedings before the
            Respondent Commission against the Respondent No. 2 licensee on
            account of the legal injury qua denial of a non-discriminatory open
            access as guaranteed under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_70">Section 42(2)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003;

      d.    The Appellant cannot at all be directed to approach a Civil Court for
            claiming damages / compensation from the Respondent No. 2 on
            account of the applicability of <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_71">Section 86(1)(f)</a>.

4.5(b) The present case has to be remanded back to the Respondent Commission

      for a de-novo hearing qua the dispute raised by the Appellant and for the

      purposes of awarding of damages / compensation by the Respondent No. 2.

      The grievance of the Appellant is independent of the grievance of the

      Respondent No. 3 with the Respondent No. 2, and even if the said

      Respondents have settled their disputes, the grievance of the Appellant, qua

      business loss on account of manipulation of market and abuse of dominant

      position by the Respondent No. 2,was required to have been adjudicated by

      the Respondent Commission, and it cannot be directed that the Appellant

      should approach a Civil Court for redressal of its grievances in the light of

      <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_72">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003.


4.5(c) The impugned order ought to be set aside and none of the observations can

      be sustained qua the Appellant as there has not been a proper application of

      mind on account of the observation of the Respondent Commission that the

      petition filed by the Appellant was not maintainable. There cannot at all be

      an adjudication on merits once it has been held that the petition is not

      maintainable. As such, in the light of the submissions made herein above,

      Trading Licensee) and Tata Power (a Distribution Licensee), which had

5.8   During the impugned proceedings, GEPL had failed to show the cause of

      action for filing of the Petition. As is evident from the factual matrix set out

      in the Table above, GEPL's cause of action, if any, related to Tata Power

      charging mutually agreed/ unregulated tariff on the reduced contract

      demand of TCL (i.e. Tata Power's consumer). However, on 22.04.2014,

      Tata Power had revised its position about charging mutually agreed/

      unregulated tariff and had issued a fresh / new proposal to GEPL wherein

      Tata Power had proposed to charge regulated tariff for TCL's reduced

      contract demand. Meaning thereby that, on the date of filing of the Petition

      before Maharashtra Commission (i.e. 30.07.2014), there was no cause of

      action for GEPL and/ or TCL to claim a dispute and initiate the present lis.

      It is submitted that there was no demonstrable dispute between GEPL and

      Tata Power that would warrant the present lis. GEPL has failed to show any

      claim or basis for filing of the present lis and the losses / damages claimed

      by it, for a transaction that pertained to conditionalities of tariff between

      Tata Power (a distribution licensee) and TCL its consumer.

5.9   GEPL had filed the Petition seeking the aforementioned reliefs on

      30.07.2014 and Maharashtra Commission has passed the Impugned Order

      on 19.12.2014. However, as is evident from the factual matrix set out in the

      The reliefs sought by GEPL before the Maharashtra Commission pertained

      to the mutually agreed / unregulated tariff sought to be charged by Tata

      Power on TCL. However, once Tata Power revised its position about

      charging mutually agreed / unregulated tariff and refunded the differential

      amount (by way of credit notes) between the mutually agreed / unregulated

<p id="p_146">5.11 It is in this context that the Maharashtra Commission has passed the

      Impugned Order, holding that if at all GEPL has a grievance against Tata

      Power, then the same should be agitated before a Civil Court. This is further

      evidenced by the fact that in the Impugned Order, Maharashtra Commission

      has noted the fact that Tata Power had paid the differential amount

      (between mutually agreed tariff and regulated tariff) to TCL. Hence,

      Maharashtra     Commission      rightly   understood     that   there     was     no

      demonstrable dispute between Tata Power and GEPL that would require the

      Maharashtra Commission to exercise its adjudicatory powers under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_94">Section

<p id="p_149">(b)   Pursuant to Maharashtra Commission's directions in its Order dated

</p><p id="p_172">      (a)   GEPL has challenged the conduct of Tata Power in a transaction

            between Tata Power (being the distribution licensee) and TCL (being

            the consumer). As stated above, no legal injury has been caused to

            GEPL from the said transaction. This is also rightly understood by

            GEPL, as GEPL in its Petition has sought reliefs on behalf/ in favour

            of/ beneficial to TCL.
</p>
<p id="p_173">      (b)   The charging of mutually agreed tariff by Tata Power, to the extent of

            reduced contract demand of TCL, has nothing to do with GEPL.

</p><p id="p_174">      (c)   There is no contractual relationship between Tata Power and GEPL

            which will give a right to GEPL to initiate proceedings against Tata

            Power. Consequently, there is no demonstrable legal injury being

            caused to GEPL by Tata Power's conduct. As such, GEPL is not an

            'aggrieved person'. Tata Power is not concerned/ liable for any

            alleged indirect losses which may have been incurred by GEPL on

            account of GEPL's commercial arrangement with TCL.

5.18 In this regard, it is submitted that, even on account of TCL, there exists no

      cause of action to allege a dispute with Tata Power, since:-

</p><p id="p_175">      (a)   Tata Power revised its proposal of charging mutually agreed /

            agreed/ unregulated tariff and regulated tariff, by way of credit notes.

</p><p id="p_177">      (c)   TCL acknowledged that no dispute exists between TCL and Tata

            Power.
</p>
<p id="p_178">      Therefore, the present lis is untenable and an abuse of process of the court.

      The present Appeal ought to be dismissed with exemplary costs.

5.19 Without prejudice to the above, it is submitted that the transaction with

      TCL was a unique / standalone transaction by which partial open access

      was provided for the first time. The said transaction lasted for a period of

      five months, i.e. from 01.10.2013 to 28.02.2014. It is submitted that there

      was no other firm power partial open access granted by Tata Power,

      wherein mutually agreed tariff was charged by Tata Power from the

      consumer for reduced contract demand. This is evident from the fact that, in

      compliance of Maharashtra Commission's directions in the Impugned

      Order, on 16.01.2015, Tata Power filed the relevant information with

      Maharashtra Commission. A copy of the relevant information submitted by

      Tata Power is available on the website of Maharashtra Commission.

      Maharashtra Commission was satisfied with information provided by Tata

      Power and no further information or separate proceedings have been

      initiated by Maharashtra Commission and / or any other consumer.

5.20 Therefore, in view of the above, it is submitted that nothing survives in the

      present Appeal that would warrant a remand back to Maharashtra

</p>
<p id="p_187">8.1   Issue No.1
8.1(a) The learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant has submitted that

      the entire issue in the present appeal relates to the fact that the Respondent

      Commission in the impugned order had erroneously held that the Petition

      filed by the Appellant was not maintainable and that for adjudication of any

      dispute between the Appellant which is a trading licensee, and the

      Respondent No. 2 which is a distribution licensee, the same can only be

      done by the Civil Court and not by the Respondent Commission.


8.1(b) In the context of the issue involved, the counsel further relied on the

      <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_111">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003, which is set out below:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">                   "... The State Commission shall discharge the following
                   functions, namely:-

                      and generating companies and to refer any dispute for
                      arbitration"
</blockquote><p id="p_188">      It would thus, appear from the above that a State Electricity Regulatory

      Commission is empowered to adjudicate disputes between licensees and

      generating companies, and inter-se between the licensees and generating

      companies, as in the present case where the Appellant is an interstate

      trading licensee and Respondent No. 2 is a distribution licensee.


8.1(c) The learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant to substantiate his

      submissions, placed reliance on several judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme

      Court and this Tribunal which have, inter alia, held that the State

      Commission has been empowered by the Act to adjudicate all types of

      disputes between the licensees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

                    companies can only be resolved by the Commission or an

<p id="p_190">8.1(e) In view of the well settled law laid down by the apex court and this

     jurisdiction to entertain the dispute between two licensees viz. an interstate

     trading licensee (GEPL) and a distribution licensee (TPCL). It was

     accordingly alleged by the Appellant that the Respondent Commission has

     erred in holding that it had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the case and

      alleged disputes between it and TPCL which had primarily arisen on

      account of TPCL's conduct of charging mutually agreed tariff to TCL (a

      consumer) on its reduced contract demand.         GEPL, a trading licensee

      procures power from various generators to supply power to TCL and other

      open access consumers. While TCL is a consumer located in TPCL's area

      of supply and connected with TPCL's distribution network, GEPL is not a

      consumer of TPCL.
</p>
<p id="p_191">
8.1(g) The learned counsel vehemently submitted that there was no cause of

      action for GEPL and / or TCL to claim a dispute and initiate the present

      appeal in view of the fact that there were no demonstrable dispute between

      GEPL and TPCL. The counsel pointed out that GEPL has failed to show

      any claim or basis for filing of the present appeal and the losses / damages

      claimed by it for a transaction that pertained to conditionalities of tariff

      between TPCL (a distribution licensee) and TCL (its consumer).


8.1(h) The counsel further brought out that well before GEPL filed the petition in

      Maharashtra Commission, TPCL had already revised the tariff and terms as

      per the regulated tariff applicable for TCL and settled all the dues related to

      the difference between the mutually agreed tariff and the regulated tariff for

      the period from 01.10.2013 to 28.02.2014. In view of these facts, the

      petition of GEPL before the Commission is liable to be dismissed as having

      become infructuous.

8.1(i) The counsel highlighted that the Commission has rightly understood that

      there was no demonstrable dispute between TPCL and GEPL that would

      require it to exercise its adjudicatory powers under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_120">Section 86(1)(f)</a> of the

      should be agitated before a jurisdictional Civil Court.

<p id="p_194">8.2   Issue No.2
8.2(a) The learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant submitted that the

      impugned order is erroneous due to the fact that the Respondent

      Commission has wrongly observed that the Appellant had no locus to

      initiate proceedings against the Respondent No. 2 (TPCL). He further

      contended that the Appellant itself had suffered a legal and financial loss on

      account of manipulation of the market by the Respondent No. 2 by seeking

      to impose temporary / mutual / unregulated tariff on an open access

      consumer (Respondent No. 3 - TCL) for the power drawn against the

      reduced contract demand.
</p>
<p id="p_195">8.2(b) The learned counsel further pointed out that the actions of Respondent No.

      2 for imposition of unregulated tariff has created a wrong perception in the

      market, thereby killing the open access market and preventing the Appellant

      from trading in electricity. As per <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_122">Section 42(2)</a> of the Electricity Act, the

      Respondent No. 2 is required to grant a non-discriminatory open access.

      The counsel emphasized that the Respondent Commission is a creation of

      the Statute and has to function within the four corners of the said Statute

      and its jurisdiction to exercise powers depends upon the existence of a

      jurisdictional fact as envisaged under <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_123">Section 86(1)(f)</a>. As a matter of fact,

      Regulatory Commission cannot at all dismiss the proceedings by either

      questioning the locus of the party filing a petition or directing the parties to

      approach a different forum and instead it may finally allow the petition or

      dismiss the same based on the merits of the disputes raised in the case in

      light of the well settled principle of law.
</p>
<p id="p_196">
8.2(c) To support his contentions on the jurisdictional fact, the learned senior

      counsel has cited a number of judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

      The counsel highlighted that from the various decisions of the Hon'ble

      Supreme Court, it is clear that existence of jurisdictional fact is sine qua

      non for the exercise of power. If the jurisdictional fact exists, the authority

      can proceed with the case and take an appropriate decision in accordance

      with law. Accordingly, a person / entity aggrieved by the actions of another

      entity, is entitled to raise a dispute before a court of competent jurisdiction.

      It is a settled principle of law that the party can raise a dispute on account of

      a legal / financial loss.

<p id="p_197">
8.2(d) In support of his contentions, the counsel further cited various judgments of

      the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Tribunal. This Tribunal in the case of

8.2(e) In view of the well settled law laid down in the judgments cited above, the

      learned counsel for the Appellant contended that the Appellant is an

      aggrieved entity and demonstrable legal / financial loss has been caused to

      it by the arbitrary action of the Respondent No. 2. Therefore, he submitted

      that the impugned order passed by the first Respondent Commission is

      liable to be vitiated.
</p>
<p id="p_199">
8.2(f) Per contra, the learned counsel for Respondent No. 2 submitted that the

      present appeal is nothing but an abuse of process the Court and amounts to

      vexatious litigation by GEPL on behalf of TCL.                  The Maharashtra

      Electricity Regulatory Commission had pointed out during the hearing that

      GEPL had failed to demonstrate the legal injury caused to it on account of

      the mutually agreed tariff being levied by TPCL on TCL for the reduced

      contract demand. The counsel referred to the Affidavit dated 21-11-2014

      filed by GEPL, which among others, envisaged that the petition was filed

      on behalf of / at the behest of TCL (Respondent No. 3) based on the email

      exchanged between GEPL and TCL. The counsel pointed out that the

      contents of the Affidavit and email reveal that GEPL has in fact induced

      TCL to permit it to initiate the present appeal.


8.2(g) The counsel had further contended that the prayers of the Appellant sought

      before this Tribunal clearly establish the actual intent of the Appellant

      which is nothing but the case of extracting money. Accordingly, GEPL had

      no locus to file the present appeal initiating a litigation at the behest of

      another person which tantamounts to filing a PIL.


8.2(h) The learned counsel further relied on the Judgment / Order of this Tribunal

      dated 20-12-2012 wherein it has been categorically held that there is no

      provision in the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_125">Electricity Act</a> for filing PIL against the orders of the State

      Commission.      The said Order passed by this Tribunal has also been

      confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its Order dated 19-8-2013 in

      the Civil Appeal No. 7303-7304 of 2013.

      No. 2, which sought to impose temporary / mutual / unregulated tariff for

      the reduced contract demand maintained by Respondent No. 3 has resulted

      into manipulation of the market in a manner which made open access a

      completely unviable option for the end consumers, thereby forcing the said

      various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as this

      Tribunal.     In view of the legal and financial loss caused to the

      Appellant, as an aggrieved entity, it has a right to get adjudicated by

      the Regulatory Commission.         Accordingly, we do not find any

     a distribution licensee cannot deny open access to any consumer and also

     cannot charge any tariff which has not been determined by the Regulatory

     Commission for an allocated contract demand of a consumer. It is alleged

     that the Respondent No. 2 abused its monopoly in distribution of electricity

     so as to suppress the competition in the market by forcing the consumers

     not to seek open access.

     of his energy requirement through open access, and for the remaining part,

     the said consumer can remain to be a consumer of the area distribution

     licensee without levy of any unregulated charges. Even Maharashtra

     TPCL acknowledging receipt of the Credit Notes stating that no dispute

     exists between TCL and TPCL. The counsel further submitted that it is a

     settled principle of law that a dispute between a consumer and a distribution

     licensee cannot be raised before / adjudicated by the State Commission, and

     the consumer if aggrieved, ought to approach the Consumer Grievance

     MERC (Distribution Open Access Regulations), 2005 (DOA Regulations
