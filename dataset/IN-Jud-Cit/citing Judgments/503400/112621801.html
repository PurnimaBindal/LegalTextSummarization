medium to convey a thought, we straightway reproduce the trade dress in
which the Kapurs and the appellant pack the tea which they sell. The
next four pages would be the coloured print out of the packed product.
The packet at the top is that of Kapurs and the one immediately beneath is
that of the appellant.

<p id="p_6"> 6.     From a perusal of the trade dress adopted by the appellant, which
date of adoption is concededly years after the Kapurs did so, it is apparent
that the appellant is using the same shade of Maroon and Blue colour in
the backdrop with a floral design as are the Kapurs; albeit the floral print
being different, but with same golden yellow colour. The third shade,
being a Green colour, forming the backdrop hue of the third trade dress is
also with a floral design; albeit the floral print being different in design as
also colour.     For the fourth colour used, there is complete identity
inasmuch as the same shade of Red without any floral design is used by
the appellant.
</p><p id="p_7">7.     Tested on the well recognized touchstone of the principle of
deception, it would be apparent to the naked eye that any purchaser of tea
with the usual imperfect recollection to which all humans are prone to,
would be deceived when she comes across the tea packaged by the
appellant.
</p><p id="p_8">8.     It is the overall get up and similarity which has to be seen and not
the minor variations because it is similarity which strikes and not the
dissimilarities which distinguish when an ordinary person recollects an
object seen in the past.
</p><p id="p_9">9.     In a well reasoned judgment spanning 18 pages the learned Single
Judge has captured the sales effected by the Kapurs, the advertisements
issued by them to market their product. Orders placed on them in the last
30 years showing tea manufactured by them acquiring such reputation
that when the Prime Minister of India visited Japan in the year 1986, the
Ministry of External Affairs placed an order for the tea manufactured by
the Kapurs. The learned Single Judge has noted the law declared by the
Supreme Court in the decisions reported as 2007 (6) SCC 1 <a href="/doc/1335881/" id="a_1">Heinz Italia
&amp; Anr. vs. Dabur India Ltd</a>.; 2001 (5) SCC 753 Cadila Healthcare

Gupta &amp; Anr</a>. to opine that it is the overall effect of a colour scheme
which has to be the focus of attention in a dispute concerning a packaging
material in which the product is sold.
</p><p id="p_10">10.    The learned Single Judge has distinguished the judgment relied
upon by the appellant reported as 62 (1996) DLT 79 Kellogg Company
Vs. Pravin Kumar Bhadabhai &amp; Anr., to deal with the argument of the
appellant that where a trademark is prominently displayed on a packaging
material there can be no deception. The reason given by the learned
Single Judge, correctly so, is that in said case the decision mainly rested
on the issue of deception with reference to the overall get up of the trade
dress, noting the prominence in which the trademarks were displayed on
the trade dress.
</p><p id="p_11">11.    The argument in the appeal by learned counsel for the appellant
was that the trade dress sought to be protected by Kapurs is functional
and hence not capable of protection. The trademarks are prominently
displayed by Kapurs as also the appellant and thus there cannot be any
deception.     The cause of action was not one of infringement of the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">FAO (OS) No.247/2014                                           Page 8 of 10</span>
 trademark.     The class of buyers was the elite, educated and widely
exposed to the ways of the world.
</p><p id="p_12">12.    We fail to understand as to how can the plaint presented by Kapurs
be treated as claim being founded on the shape of the packet. The
reference to the shape of the two packets in which the tea is sold by
Kapurs and the appellant forms the backdrop of the plea that by using the
fabric sleeve on identical rectangular shaped cuboid the deception gets
aggravated.     Commonsense guides us that if two persons sell their
product in same size rectangular shaped cuboid, nobody can urge that
there is deception, but where the add-on grievance is to fabric sleeve used
over the rectangular shaped cuboid, deception may occur if the overall
similarity in the get up is of the kind that an ordinary purchaser, with the
usual imperfect recollection is likely to be deceived. There is no case law
cited, and we know of none that merely because a trademark is displayed
on the packaging material, notwithstanding a striking similarity in the
packaging material there would be no likelihood of deception. Whilst it
may be true that in issues concerning trade dress the Courts have
considered the display of a trademark, but it is only one of the various
factors put in the weighing basket. It needs no argument to bring home
the point reached by the learned Single Judge that the overall get up of
the trade dress, even taking into account the display of the trademarks, is
likely to cause deception; save and except to look at the packaging of the
two competing products; and this is the reason why we have reproduced
the coloured printout of the packaged product.
</p><p id="p_13">13.    So striking is the theft by the appellant of the packaging used by
the Kapurs that even an elite, educated, widely exposed and travelled
person is likely to be deceived.

<p id="p_14"> 14.    As held in the celebrated decision reported as (1991) 1 PTC 1
Wander Ltd. &amp; Anr. Vs. Antox India Pvt. Ltd. the appellate
reconsideration concerning an injunction order passed by a learned Single
Judge is to see whether the learned Single Judge has applied the correct
principles of law to the stated facts. We find that the learned Single
Judge has correctly applied the legal principles to the stated facts.
</p><p id="p_15">15.    The appeal is dismissed with costs in sum of `25,000/- against the
appellant and in favour of the Kapurs.
