<p id="p_1">                          A.       INTRODUCTION
</p><p id="p_2">                          1.       These three writ petitions which revolve around Para 20 of the Drugs
                          (Price Control) Order, 20131 assail demand notices issued by the
                          respondent National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority2 holding the
                          petitioners guilty of overcharging and thus liable to deposit the overcharged
                          amount together with interest thereon. Bharat Serums the petitioner in
                          W.P.(C) 7946/2018 and 8190/2018 challenges the demand notices dated 26
                          June 2018 and 05 July 2018. The two demand notices relate to non-
                          scheduled formulations named Histoglob and U-Tryp. Bard the petitioner
                          in W.P.(C) 9090/2020 has challenged identical demand notices dated 07
                          November 2019 and 22 October 2020 in respect of 82 medical devices
                          which were produced and distributed by the said petitioner.

                          to be in violation of Para 20 with respect to the sale and distribution of
                          Histoglob for the period February 2014 to July 2018. The allegation of

                          2018. Insofar as Bard is concerned, the respondents allege that medical
                          devices were overcharged during the period January 2015 to January 2018.
</p>
<p id="p_4">                          3.    In order to appreciate the issues which arise, it would, at the outset,
                          be apposite to advert to the provisions of Para 20 which reads thus: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_1">                                 &quot;20. Monitoring the prices of non-scheduled formulations.-(1) The
                                 Government shall monitor the maximum retail prices (MRP) of all the
                                 drugs, including the non-scheduled formulations and ensure that no
                                 manufacturer increases the maximum retail price of a drug more than ten
                                 per cent of maximum retail price during preceding twelve months and
                                 where the increase is beyond ten per cent of maximum retail price, it
                                 shall reduce the same to the level of ten per cent of maximum retail price
                                 for next twelve months.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_2">                                 (2) The manufacturer shall be liable to deposit the overcharged amount
                                 along with interest thereon from the date of increase in price in addition
                                 to the penalty.â€–

</blockquote><p id="p_5">                          4.    Bharat Serums has been found to have overcharged and thus liable
                          for penal action under Para 20 in respect of the two non-scheduled
                          formulations noticed above. It asserts that in the period under scrutiny, it
                          had not overcharged prices and had merely rounded off the price of its drug.
                          Insofar as Bard is concerned, it has taken the stand that the overcharging of
                          medical devices occurred on account of a lack of clarity in respect of the
                          format in which price disclosures were to be made and that the
                          overcharging was neither deliberate nor intentional. Both the writ
                          petitioners have also challenged the interpretation accorded to Para 20 by
                          the respondents and the consequential quantification of overcharging by
                          NPPA. Bard has also questioned the levy of interest asserting that it would
                          be liable to pay the same on the overcharged amount only from the date of
                          the demand being raised as opposed to the date when the overpricing

<p id="p_6">                          5.        Both the writ petitioners assail the correctness of the view taken by
                          the respondents that in case a manufacturer is found to have overcharged
                          and thus acted in breach of Para 20, it would stand denuded of the right to
                          claim a periodic increase which is envisaged under the said provision of the
                          2013 DPCO. As would be evident from a reading of Para 20 of the 2013
                          DPCO, a manufacturer of a non-scheduled formulation is entitled to
                          increase the Maximum Retail Price3 of a drug provided that such increase
                          does not exceed 10% of the MRP which held the field in the preceding
                          twelve months.         The said provision further stipulates that when a
                          manufacturer transgresses the maximum limit of 10%, it shall be liable to
                          reduce the price of the drug to the level which prevailed in the preceding
                          twelve months and maintain it at that level for the next twelve months.
                          Additionally, and in terms of Para 20(2), in case a manufacturer is found to
                          have overcharged and violated the prescriptions contained in Para 20(1), it
                          is liable to deposit the overcharged amount along with interest thereon from
                          the date of increase in price.
</p>
<p id="p_7">                          6.        The respondents while dealing with the issue of overcharging have
                          essentially taken the position that once a manufacturer is found to have
                          violated the restrictions placed in Para 20, it would become disentitled to
                          claim the 10% annual increase till such time that the manufacturer reduces
                          the MRP of the non-scheduled formulation to bring it within the band of the
                          permissible MRP and hold the same for the next twelve months. Dealing

                           with the case of Bharat Serums, the NPPA in its impugned order of 26
                          June 2018, has recorded the following conclusions: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">                                  â€•4. Your company has submitted photocopy of CA certified
                                 quantitative data for the formulation mentioning quantity manufactured /
                                 sold for the period from April 2013 to Jan 2018 of above referred
                                 formulation. From data submitted it is seen that the company has
                                 increased the MRP of the formulation from Rs.82.50/- to Rs.91/- from
                                 batch No.A07415001 manufactured in Feb. 2015 which resulted into
                                 increase of MRP by more than 10% within a period of twelve months in
                                 contravention to provisions of Para 20 of DPCO 2013.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_4">                                 5.    The Company&#x27;s contention that for calculating overcharging
                                 amount NPPA should consider 10% increase year on year basis is not
                                 correct. As per provisions of Para 20 (1) of DPCO 2013, &quot;no
                                 manufacturer increases the maximum retail price of a drug more than
                                 10% of maximum retail price during preceding twelve months and where
                                 the increase is beyond 10% of MRP, it shall reduce the same to the level
                                 of 10% of MRP for next twelve months. In view of the same, 10%
                                 increase is not permissible in respect of above said formulation to the
                                 Company year on year basis until the Company shall reduce the MRP of
                                 said formulation to the level of 10% of MRP for next twelve months (i.e.

                                    may be noted that the question of subsequent notional interest was not
                                    the substantial or direct question involved in the M/s Obsurge and

                           was also contended that up to 24 January 2017 the respondents had also not
                          constructed a database for monitoring of prices of medical devices nor did
                          the industry itself have a mechanism to report price data. On 24 January
                          2017 a proforma for price list (Form V) for drugs falling under Schedule II
                          of the 2013 DPCO came to be notified. The aforesaid notification was
                          followed by an Office Memorandum4 of 12 May 2017 issued by the
                          NPPA requiring medical device manufacturers to provide pricing data with
                          respect to 19 medical devices. Para 3 of the said O.M. recorded that NPPA
                          had developed a format for submission of data and had shared the same
                          with medical device companies and associations. Bard contends that it was
                          in terms of the aforesaid O.M. that NPPA for the first time lent clarity with
                          respect to medical devices to which the 2013 DPCO would be applicable
                          and sought pricing data from manufacturers.

                          pertaining to the year 2015-2016. In response to the said show cause
                          notice, the petitioner in terms of its letter of 5 March 2018 submitted a
                          detailed reply along with statements setting out the batch wise import data
                          of 89 products, sales details and corresponding MRPs&#x27; for the years 2013-
                          14 to 2017-18. The petitioner while replying to the show cause notice also
                          highlighted the fact that they were unaware that medical devices would
                          stand covered under the definition of â€•formulation&quot; and thus fall within the
                          ambit of the 2013 DPCO. NPPA thereafter issued another notice dated 20
                          April 2018 seeking monthly and year wise data for the years 2013-14 to

                          interpretation accorded to Para 20. In terms of its reply of 13 January 2020
                          it also raised issues with respect to the levy of interest on the principal
                          overcharged amount. By its subsequent communication, the petitioner also
                          sought an opportunity of personal hearing which was acceded to and
                          granted by NPPA and the representatives of the petitioner were ultimately
                          heard on 11 August 2020. On 24 August 2020, the petitioners deposited a
                          sum of Rs. 1,31,32,205/- which according to them, represented the
                          overcharged amount that they were liable to pay in terms of Para 20. The
                          impugned order of 22 October 2020 thereafter came to be passed and the
                          final overcharged amount was computed by NPPA to be Rs. 7,60,01,777/-
                          along with interest up to 31 October 2020. It is thereafter that Bard
                          approached this Court and filed the present writ petition.

                           allegation of overcharging came to be laid were Histoglob and U-Tryp. On
                          03 January 2017, the NPPA issued a preliminary notice observing that
                          Bharat Serums had increased the MRP of Histoglob by more than 10%
                          during the period September 2014 to September 2015. It accordingly called
                          upon the said petitioner to respond and to submit the requisite records. The
                          allegations in this preliminary notice were based on the respondents noting
                          that while the price of Histoglob in September 2014 stood at Rs. 82.50/-, in
                          September 2015 the same had come to be raised to Rs. 91/-. Another notice
                          dated 09 January 2017, thereafter came to be issued in respect of U-Tryp.
                          Here too the allegation leveled was of a MRP having breached the
                          permissible 10% during the period January 2015 to December 2016.
                          Bharat Serums while responding to the aforesaid notices pointed out that
                          the MRP for Histoglob after factoring in the permissible 10% increase
                          would have come to Rs. 90.75/-. It submitted that since it would have been
                          impossible for a consumer to pay the aforesaid price, it had merely rounded
                          it off to Rs. 91/-. It its written submissions, Bharat Serums has placed a
                          comparative chart indicating the permissible price under the 2013 DPCO,
                          the price actually charged by it and the permissible MRP which has been
                          taken note of by NPPA in the impugned demand notice which came to be
                          issued.     The two charts relating to Histoglob and U-Tryp are set out

                          all details pertaining to production and sales for the period April 2013 to
                          March 2018. On 20 April 2018 NPPA issued a show cause notice alleging
                          that Bharat Serums had violated the provisions of Para 20 insofar as
                          Histoglob was concerned, since it had sold the said drug at a price of Rs.
                          91/- against the permissible maximum retail price of Rs. 90.75/-.         It
                          accordingly called upon the said petitioner to show cause why it not be held
                          to be liable to pay a sum of Rs. 2,04,59,109/- for the period July 2015 to
                          March 2018 along with interest. It would be pertinent to note that no show
                          cause notice is stated to have been issued to Bharat Serums insofar as U-
                          Tryp is concerned.

<p id="p_32">                          13.   Replying to the said show cause notice, Bharat Serums vide its
                          letter of 22 May 2018 pointed out that during the period under scrutiny the
                          petitioner had charged a MRP which was even lesser than what was
                          permissible and it asserted that this would be evident from the MRP for
                          Histoglob which was fixed between July 2014 and January 2015.             It
                          reiterated its original stand that it had never intended to overcharge or
                          violate the provisions of Para 20 and that it had only rounded off the MRP
                          bearing in mind the practical difficulties which would have been faced by
                          consumers if they were asked to pay a retail price running into decimals.
                          On 26 June 2018, the NPPA issued a demand notice calling upon Bharat
                          Serums to pay a sum of Rs. 2,04,97,767/- towards the overcharging of
                          Histoglob. A similar demand notice came to be issued in respect of U-Tryp
                          with the respondents alleging that Bharat Serums would be liable to pay
                          an aggregate sum of Rs. 4,81,09,809/-. It is these two demand notices,

<p id="p_33">                          D.    SUBMISSIONS OF BARD
</p><p id="p_34">                          14.   Appearing for Bard, Mr. Sibal, learned senior counsel has addressed
                          the following submissions. Mr. Sibal contended that the interpretation
                          accorded by the respondents on Para 20 is not only erroneous but also
                          contrary to the express language of that provision. Learned senior counsel
                          contended that the manner in which the provisions of Para 20 have been
                          interpreted and enforced by the respondents, would clearly amount to a
                          rewriting of the provision itself. The aforenoted submissions were advanced
                          in light of his contention that Para 20 nowhere envisages a forfeiture of the
                          right of the manufacturer to claim a 10% increase over the MRP which may
                          have prevailed in the preceding twelve months. Mr. Sibal submitted that
                          the right to claim that periodical increase does not stand effaced or taken
                          away merely because a manufacturer may have overcharged.
</p>
<p id="p_35">                          15.   He further submitted that where a manufacturer increases the MRP
                          beyond 10% of the price prevailing in the preceding year, Para 20 only
                          empowers the respondents to recover the overcharged amount and to
                          require the manufacturer to roll back the price of the drug at a level which
                          was prevalent prior to the date of the infraction and to hold that price for the
                          next twelve months. Learned senior counsel argued that Para 20 nowhere
                          contemplates the rolled back price being frozen till such time as the
                          infraction is cured. According to learned senior counsel, the respondents

                           have committed a patent error in interpreting Para 20 as mandating the
                          revised price being liable to be maintained till such time as the
                          overcharging is cured. According to Mr. Sibal, the view expressed by the
                          respondents in the impugned order effectively amounts to a rescripting of
                          Para 20 and the creation of a penalty which is not even envisaged therein.
</p>
<p id="p_36">                          16.    Mr. Sibal submitted that Para 20 spells out the consequences which
                          a manufacturer would have to face in case it breaches the 10% maximum
                          permissible limit. It was urged that in such a situation the manufacturer
                          becomes not only liable to deposit the overcharged amount, it is also
                          obligated to deposit the said amount along with interest. It was his
                          submission that once Para 20 had provided for the penal consequences
                          which would ensue an act of overcharging, it was not permissible for the
                          respondents to additionally introduce the concept of the rolled back price
                          being maintained till the breach comes to be ultimately rectified.
</p>
<p id="p_37">                          17.   It was then submitted that Para 20 essentially confers a power on the
                          respondents to &quot;monitor&quot; the price of drugs and in case Para 20 were to be
                          understood in the manner as the respondents have, it would essentially
                          amount to the respondents being recognized to be invested with the power
                          to fix the price of non-scheduled formulations. Stress was laid by Mr. Sibal
                          on the admitted position that in terms of the 2013 DPCO, the respondents
                          can fix the price of scheduled formulations only. Learned senior counsel
                          contended that the direction requiring the petitioner to freeze the MRP at

                          petitioner has been held liable to revert to the price which was prevailing in
                          the twelve months preceding the date of the contravention and to continue
                          to hold the same for twelve months beyond the issuance of the orders by the
                          respondents. It was in the aforesaid backdrop that learned counsel
                          submitted that the action of the respondents has resulted in the petitioner
                          being forced to keep the price of its drugs unchanged right from January
                          2015 to January 2018.

                          been calculated, learned senior counsel submitted that while computing the
                          same, the respondents have proceeded on the basis that once a manufacturer
                          is found to have breached the 10% annual increase which is permitted, it
                          stands deprived of the right to seek a 10% annual increase which is
                          otherwise contemplated and duly sanctioned under the first part of Para 20.
                          Mr. Sibal would submit that once the manufacturer has held the price of the
                          drug at the levels which were existing on the date of the infraction and for
                          twelve months thereafter, any computation of overcharging must be
                          calculated taking into consideration the periodic revision in the MRP which
                          is permitted under Para 20.

                          Bard firstly asserts a right to periodically revise the MRP of a particular
                          drug every twelve months. It is the assertion of the said petitioner that the
                          price which may have been ultimately charged by it and in order to
                          ascertain whether the 10% limit as prescribed under Para 20 was violated,
                          must necessarily be considered in conjunction with the same.            It was
                          submitted that the respondents have incorrectly assumed that merely
                          because a manufacturer may have overcharged in a particular block period,
                          it would stand disentitled to any price revision. Mr. Sibal highlighted the
                          fact that the respondents in the case of Bard have calculated the
                          overcharged amount on the basis of a notionally reduced MRP for the entire
                          period from January 2015 to January 2018. Learned senior counsel laid
                          stress on the fact that while calculating the overcharged amount, Bard has
                          been held liable for violations of Para 20 based on the price which was
                          applicable in 2015 and without considering the 10% increase to which the
                          petitioner was otherwise entitled as per Para 20.

                                     is in the sub paragraph-(2) of paragraph 20, wherein the manufacturer is
                                     being made liable to deposit the overcharged amount along with interest

                                     same to the level of 10% for the period of next twelve months from the

                                     period 2014-15 and incase it is found that the manufacturer has increased

                           petitioner is based on a demand notice of 07 November 2019. The demand
                          was ultimately finalized in terms of the order of 22 October 2020. It was
                          submitted that merely because the alleged infraction was noticed in 2019
                          and further action in terms of Para 20 initiated thereafter, it would be
                          wholly illegal for the respondents to command the petitioner to revise the
                          price of its medical devices for the block period commencing from the date
                          of transgression and right up to the initiation proceedings under the 2013
                          DPCO. Learned senior counsel further submits that for the very same
                          reasons the stand taken by the respondents of the petitioner being liable to
                          hold the price of its medical devices at the revised levels for the twelve

                          overcharged amount, Mr. Sibal argued that the levy of interest from the date
                          of overcharging is in clear violation of the provisions of the <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_10">Essential
                          Commodities Act</a> 19556. It was submitted that holding Bard liable to pay
                          interest @ 15% from the date of contravention till November 2019 is
                          clearly illegal. Learned senior counsel would contend that interest can be
                          charged only from the date of default of payment of any amount that may
                          be computed and demanded by the respondents. Learned senior counsel

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_16">                                    â€•Interest under Section 7A EC Act
                                    As regards charging interest under Section 7A EC Act, the Division
                                    Bench of the Allahabad High Court in T.C. Healthcare pointed out that
                                    the liability to pay simple interest shall arise after a default is committed
                                    in making payment of the demanded amount within the time stipulated
                                    therein. The wording of Section 7A EC Act makes it clear that the
                                    interest has to be paid in the event of default committed by the drug
                                    manufacturer in not paying the demand within time. When a fixed time is
                                    prescribed for making payment of demand, as has been done in the
                                    instant case by the impugned demand letter dated 27th November, 2008
                                    which requires BLPL to make payment by 5th December, 2008, the
                                    failure to pay the amount will arise only after the expiry of that date and
                                    not earlier. In the instant case therefore interest in terms of Section 7A
                                    EC Act could have been charged only for the period after 5th December,
                                    2008. This conclusion is consistent with the decision in T.C. Healthcare

                          levy interest principally flows from <a href="/doc/183785/" id="a_25">Section 7A</a> of the Act. It was contended
                          that since the 2013 DPCO is a piece of subordinate legislation notified
                          under <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_26">Section 3</a> of the Act, it must necessarily yield to the provisions of
                          <a href="/doc/183785/" id="a_27">Section 7A</a>. In light of the position which would flow from <a href="/doc/183785/" id="a_28">Section 7A</a>,
                          learned senior counsel submitted that the question of levy of interest is
                          liable to be decided accordingly.

<p id="p_57">                          29.   Mr. Sibal lastly urged that Bard had neither knowingly nor willfully
                          violated the provisions of Para 20 of the 2013 DPCO. It was his submission
                          that it was essentially a case of inadvertent overcharging of medical devices
                          which occurred during the period 2014-2016. Elaborating on this aspect,
                          Mr. Sibal submitted that during the period in question there was confusion
                          and a lack of clarity with respect to the disclosures and price declarations
                          which were to be submitted by manufacturers of medical devices. It was
                          also pointed out that during that period even the Government had no
                          database for monitoring prices of medical devices. Mr. Sibal submitted that
                          the proforma for price list in respect of medical devices was formulated and
                          notified only on 24 January 2017. Prior to the said notification, Mr. Sibal
                          argued, that there was a complete lack of clarity amongst manufacturers of
                          medical devices with respect to the applicability of the 2013 DPCO. It was
                          further highlighted that it was only in terms of the O.M. of 12 May 2017
                          that the respondents for the first time issued directives seeking the pricing
                          data with respect to 19 medical devices. Drawing the attention of the Court
                          to the aforesaid O.M., it was pointed out that it was in terms of Para 3

                          firstly drew the attention of the Court to the National Pharmaceuticals
                          Pricing Policy 2012 which came to be notified on 07 December 2012.
                          Learned counsel highlighted the key principles which were enumerated and
                          adopted in terms of that Policy and which were explained to be the
                          essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices and the regulatory
                          regime moving to a market-based pricing system as opposed to a cost-based
                          pricing formula which formed the foundation for the Drug Price Control
                          Order 199510 . Mr. Shah laid emphasis on Para 4(xii) of the Policy and
                          submitted that it embodied a clear intent of the respondents to leave non-
                          essential drugs out of the price control regime with their prices being liable
                          to be fixed as per market forces. Mr. Shah submitted that the ultimate
                          provisions which form part of Para 20 are an adoption of the Policy
                          measures which were formulated in Para 4(xii). The aforesaid paragraph is

                          entitled to increase the MRP of drugs annually subject to the singular rider
                          of ensuring that the increase does not exceed more than 10% of the MRP
                          which had prevailed in the preceding twelve months. According to Mr.
                          Shah, this right which stands so conferred on a manufacturer of non-
                          scheduled formulations is not made dependent upon the manufacturer in
                          any particular year overcharging or exceeding the band of 10% as fixed
                          under Para 20. In other words, learned counsel would submit that the
                          manufacturer does not stand deprived of the right to claim such periodic
                          revisions merely because he may have violated that stipulation in a
                          particular year. It was pointed out by Mr. Shah that the consequences
                          which a manufacturer must suffer are clearly set out in the latter part of
                          Para 20 which stipulates that in case it has overcharged, the manufacturer
                          would have to reduce the price of the drug to bring it at par with the MRP
                          which had prevailed in the preceding twelve months. Mr. Shah points out
                          that the said provision additionally prescribes that the manufacturer as a
                          consequence of overcharging, would also have to hold the price of the
                          particular drug at the reduced price for the next twelve months. Mr. Shah
                          submits that the third consequence which stands attached to overcharging is
                          the liability of the manufacturer to deposit the overcharged amount along
                          with interest. It was the submission of learned counsel that the phrases
                          &quot;preceding twelve months&quot; and &quot;next twelve months&quot; as are employed in

                           Para 20 are critical to understanding its scope and intent. According to
                          learned counsel it is these two phrases which constitute the pivotal and
                          focal points for the purposes of understanding the liability which may come
                          to be imposed upon a manufacturer as a consequence of overcharging.
</p>
<p id="p_62">                          32.   Mr. Shah submitted that it must be borne in mind that insofar as non-
                          scheduled formulations are concerned, they are not subject to the price
                          control regime which otherwise stands embodied in the 2013 DPCO.
                          According to Mr. Shah the power to monitor can only be understood as
                          empowering the respondents to oversee and ensure that manufacturers of
                          non-scheduled formulations do not increase retail prices of such drugs
                          beyond the permissible 10%. According to Mr. Shah, the right of the
                          manufacturer to increase the price of non-scheduled formulations is
                          separate and distinct and not subject to the penal consequences which are
                          comprised in the latter part of Para 20. Learned counsel explains the right
                          of a manufacturer to increase the price of drugs in accord with the
                          provisions of Para 20 to be &quot;continual&quot; and &quot;sequential&quot;. According to
                          learned counsel even if a manufacturer were to transgress the provisions
                          made in Para 20, it would always be open to NPPA to take immediate
                          action and call upon the manufacturer to roll back the price of the drug in
                          question. It was vehemently urged that even if an infraction of Para 20
                          comes to be discovered many years after the date of the alleged
                          transgression it is the twin phrases &quot;preceding twelve months&quot; and &quot;next
                          twelve months&quot; which would govern the issue of liability of a manufacturer.
                          The submission in essence was that even if a manufacturer has infringed the
                          injunct placed by Para 20, it would not take away its right to claim a

                           continual and sequential increase of the MRP of a drug. It was additionally
                          argued that the price revision which would have to be mandatorily made by
                          the manufacturer would also have to be with reference to the date of alleged
                          violation and the â€•preceding twelve monthsâ€– and â€•next twelve monthsâ€–
                          being calculated in conjunction with that date. Mr. Shah argued that the
                          respondents would, in any case, not be justified to freeze the price of a
                          particular drug for the preceding and the next twelve months from the date
                          when an infraction may come to be discovered.

<p id="p_63">                          33.       Mr. Shah then invited the attention of the Court to the decision
                          rendered in <a href="/doc/188099693/" id="a_29">Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited v. Union of India and
                          Others11</a> to submit that the Court had clearly held that the power to monitor
                          non-scheduled formulations as envisaged in Para 20 cannot extend to the
                          recognition of a power inhering in the respondents to fix the MRP of a non-
                          scheduled formulation. It would be apposite to notice the following
                          pertinent observations as made in Alembic Pharmaceuticals:

                                     NPPA&#x27;s case is fundamentally flawed. Sub-paragraph (1) of Paragraph 14
                                     of the DPCO, 2013 enables the NPPA to fix ceiling price of â€—scheduled

</p><p id="p_65">                                 14. It is clear from the above that the NPPA has no power to fix the
                                 ceiling price or the MRP of any formulation other than a scheduled
                                 formulation. Concededly, the Formulation had ceased to be a â€—Scheduled
                                 formulation&#x27; with effect from 10.03.2016. Consequently, the power of
                                 the NPPA to fix a ceiling price for the Formulation had also ceased with
                                 effect from 10.03.2016.
</p><p id="p_66">                                 15. Having stated above, it is also necessary to refer Paragraph 20 of the

                                    and ensure that no manufacturer increases the maximum retail price
                                    of a drug more than ten percent of maximum retail price during
                                    preceding twelve months and where the increase is beyond ten
                                    percent of maximum retail price, it shall reduce the same to the
                                    level of ten percent of maximum retail price for next twelve

</p><p id="p_69">                                 16. It is clear from the plain language of Sub-paragraph (1) of Paragraph
                                 20 of the DPCO that the Government is required to monitor the MRP of
                                 all drugs, including the non-scheduled formulations. However, the same
                                 does not empower NPPA (the Government) to fix a MRP for a non-
                                 scheduled formulation. The only restriction placed by virtue of Paragraph
                                 20 of the DPCO is that a manufacturer cannot increase the MRP of any
                                 drug by more than 10% of the MRP as prevailing during the preceding
                                 twelve months. Thus, in terms of Paragraph 20 of the DPCO, the NPPA
                                 would be well within its rights to ensure that the petitioner does not
                                 increase the MRP of the Formulation for a period of twelve months.â€–

                           fixation power. Mr. Shah argued that the power to monitor prices as
                          conferred on authorities under various statutes has never been recognised to
                          extend to or be equated with a price fixation power. In support of his
                          submission, reliance was placed on the following observations as made by
                          this Court in <a href="/doc/48469368/" id="a_30">Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board v.
                          Indraprastha Gas Ltd</a>.,12

                                      â€•11. We are of the opinion that none of the aforesaid clauses can be
                                      construed as prescribing price control/regulation as a function of the
                                      Board. Clause (a) supra while prescribing protection of interest of
                                      consumers limits the same to, by fostering fair trade and competition
                                      amongst entities engaged in distributing, dealing, transporting, marketing
                                      gas. The function of the Board thereunder is of regulating the inter
                                      se relationship of entities under the Act and not to regulate/control the
                                      relationship between the entities under the Act and the consumers.
                                      Similarly, Clause (f) while prescribing function of monitoring prices
                                      limits the same to taking corrective measures to prevent restrictive trade
                                      practices by the entities. Thus only if the Board finds that the marketeers
                                      of gas in a particular area have formed a cartel or are indulging in any
                                      other restrictive trade practices, is the Board empowered to monitor
                                      prices. Such is not the case of the Board in the present instance. The
                                      petitioner even though till date the exclusive marketeer of gas in Delhi,
                                      has not been accused of any restrictive trade practice and the power
                                      exercised also is not in the name of monitoring price. Another sub-clause
                                      of clause (f) of <a href="/doc/1503047/" id="a_31">Section 11</a> confers function on the Board to ensure
                                      display of information about Maximum Retail Price. Again, had the
                                      intent of the legislature been to confer the power on the Board to fix the
                                      Maximum Retail Price, nothing prevented the legislature from providing
                                      so expressly. Instead, functions of enforcing retail service obligations and
                                      marketing service obligations only have been conferred by the
                                      legislature. The definition of retail service obligations and marketing
                                      service obligations in <a href="/doc/1144098/" id="a_32">Sections 2(zk)</a> and (w) also do not include
                                      obligation to sell at the prices fixed by the Board.
</p><p id="p_71">                                      12. That brings us to the question as to whether prices can be
                                      fixed/regulated/controlled and if so, how. Prices are generally
                                      governed/regulated by market forces. Price fixation/regulation/control is
                                      essentially a clog on the freedom of trade and commerce conferred the

                                 Town and Country Planning Department, Haryana</a> (2010) 14 SCC 1,
                                 finding no provision in the statute (Haryana Development and Regulation
                                 of Urban Areas Act, 1975) empowering the Director to fix the sale price,
                                 held directions fixing the sale price to be beyond the limits laid down by
                                 the empowering Act and suffering from lack of power and void. It was
                                 observed that an order which is not within the powers given by the
                                 empowering Act, has no legal legs to stand on and is a nullity. It was
                                 further held that a power of imposing restrictions on profit percentages,
                                 time limit on construction and handing over of such construction does not
                                 encompass within itself the right to exercise power in manner that
                                 inhibits terms of contract and freedom granted therein. Similarly,
                                 in O.N.G.C. v. Association of Natural Gas Consuming Industries of
                                 Gujarat AIR 1990 SC 1851 it was observed that price fixation is a
                                 legislative function. Even the seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court
                                 in <a href="/doc/178640246/" id="a_34">Prag Ice &amp; Oil Mills v. Union of India</a> (1978) 3 SCC 459 had observed
                                 that unless by the terms of a particular statute, price fixation is made a
                                 quasi-judicial function, it is really legislative in character. The Supreme
                                 Court in <a href="/doc/249135/" id="a_35">Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Limited v. Sai
                                 Renewable Power (P) Ltd</a>. (2011) 11 SCC 34 also opined that fixation of
                                 tariff is a statutory function, to be performed by a statutory authority in
                                 furtherance of the provisions of the relevant laws; finding the <a href="/doc/132967048/" id="a_36">Electricity

                                 tariff, it was held to be empowered to do so. In contrast, the Board with
                                 which we are concerned in the present case, as aforesaid is not found to
                                 have been assigned the function of fixing the Network Tariff or the
                                 Compression Charges as it has purported to do. The Supreme Court
                                 in <a href="/doc/1751605/" id="a_37">U.P. Power Corp. Ltd. v. NTPC Ltd</a>. (2009) 6 SCC 235 has held that
                                 regulatory provisions are required to be applied having regard to the
                                 nature, textual context and situational context of each statute.

                                 gas is to be necessarily read as without the power to fix the Maximum
                                 Retail Price. Price fixation being a restriction on fundamental right, such
                                 a power cannot be inferred by conjectures and has to be expressly
                                 conferred. As aforesaid no such power/function has been conferred on
                                 the Board and the learned ASG also during the arguments has struggled
                                 to dig out such a power in the Board by seeking to extrapolate different
                                 provisions of the Act.
</p><p id="p_74">                                 15. The Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1119469/" id="a_41">DLF Qutab Enclave Complex Educational
                                 Charitable Trust v. State of Haryana</a> (2003) 5 SCC 622 held that a
                                 regulatory Act must be construed having regard to the purpose it seeks to
                                 achieve and a statutory authority cannot ask for something which is not
                                 contemplated under the statute. The statute in that case relating to
                                 regulation of user of land was construed to be not imposing any
                                 limitation prohibiting transfer of land not affecting its user. It would thus
                                 be seen that the powers of regulation under a statute were held to be not
                                 unlimited and a right of regulation was held to be confined to the
                                 language of the statute and not all pervasive. The basic rule of
                                 interpretation of statutes that the Court shall not go beyond the statute
                                 unless it is absolutely necessary so to do and that purposive construction
                                 would be resorted to only when literal interpretation leads to manifest
                                 injustice or absurdity, was applied. In our view the principle applied
                                 therein holds good in the facts of the present case also. Merely because
                                 the Board has been conferred with regulatory powers will not be
                                 interpreted to empower the Board to exercise powers which the statute
                                 has not conferred on it.â€–

                          that there was no intent to violate the provisions of Para 20.                    It was
                          submitted that the exercise of rounding off was adopted only to arrive at a
                          convenient MRP which could be paid by consumers. It was contended that
                          the exercise of rounding off was itself based on the decision taken by NPPA
                          in its meeting held on 12 April 2016 where while dealing with Agenda Item
                          No.5 (ii) relating to overcharging, the NPPA had resolved thus:

                                 general mathematical practice and no other mala fide intention on the

</p><p id="p_77">                          36.   Mr. Shah further drew the attention of the Court to the Resolution of
                          the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers dated 29 August 1997 pursuant to
                          which the NPPA itself came to be constituted. The attention of the Court
                          was further drawn to the notification of 30 May 2013 issued by that
                          Ministry transferring the powers of the Union Government as embodied in
                          Paras 4 to 30 and 32 of the 2013 DPCO upon NPPA. Mr. Shah submitted
                          that NPPA has been conferred pivotal authority, duties and obligations
                          under the 2013 DPCO. In light of the statutory conferral of authority on the
                          NPPA and by virtue of the said body being designated as the key regulator,
                          Mr. Shah would contend that Bharat Serums cannot be held to have
                          infracted Para 20 since it was in essence acting in accord with that decision.

<p id="p_78">                          37.   It was lastly urged by Mr. Shah that while Agenda Item 5(ii) may on
                          a facial examination appear to apply to scheduled formulations only, there
                          exists no rationale or justification to deny the benefits of rounding off to
                          manufacturers of non-scheduled formulations. This, more so, in light of the
                          fact that while scheduled formulations are subject to price control, insofar
                          as non-scheduled formulations are concerned, the respondents only exercise
                          the power of monitoring. Mr. Shah also placed reliance on the following
                          observations as were made by the Court in Obsurge Biotech:
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_22">                                 â€•

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_23">                                 14. As far as the rounding up of the MRP is concerned, the submission of
                                 the learned counsel for the respondents cannot be accepted.

                                 intended to regulate the pricing of the essential drugs. The same is also
                                 evident from the â€—National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012&#x27;. The
                                 objectives of the Policy are stated as under:

                                        As stated above in its present form, the Drug Policy of 1994
                                    needs to be modified in the context of changed global environment
                                    for industry as well required changes in the mechanism to make
                                    available essential medicines to the masses. The objective is to put
                                    in place a regulatory framework for pricing of drugs so as to
                                    ensure availability of required medicines - &quot;essential medicines&quot; -
                                    at reasonable prices even while providing sufficient opportunity for
                                    innovation and competition to support the growth of industry,
                                    thereby meeting the goals of employment and shared economic well
                                    being for all. The reasons are further elaborated later in the Policy
                                    Document.&quot;
</p><p id="p_82">                                 16. The drugs that have been placed in the National List of Essential
                                 Medicines (NLEM) have been incorporated by the respondents in form
                                 of the Schedule to the DPCO. The pricing of such drugs is regulated and,
                                 in fact, fixed under the control price regime under the DPCO. For the
                                 Non-Schedule Formulation, paragraph 20 allows the manufacturers of
                                 drugs to fix the MRP based on the market conditions, however, such
                                 prices are to be monitored by the Government and the only condition
                                 imposed is that the increase in the MRP should not be more than 10%.
                                 Therefore, keeping in view the objective of the DPCO and the Policy, it
                                 cannot be accepted that the decision taken in the meeting as referred
                                 hereinabove would be confined only to the Schedule Formulations. If the
                                 Schedule Formulations would be entitled to round of the pricing to the
                                 next whole number, then the same benefit cannot be denied to a Non-
                                 Schedule Formulation who, otherwise, are allowed liberty to fix the MRP
                                 keeping in view the market conditions. Such interpretation, therefore,
                                 would be absurd and is to be avoided.
</p><p id="p_83">                                 17. Even otherwise, the Minutes of Meeting reproduced hereinabove are
                                 for determination of â€—ceiling price&#x27; for â€—formulation&#x27;. â€—Ceiling price&#x27; is
                                 also determined in paragraph 20(1) of the DPCO and the Non-Schedule
                                 Formulation is also a â€—formulation&#x27; under the meaning of the terms in the
                                 DPCO. Therefore, there is absolutely no justification for excluding the
                                 Non-Schedule Formulations from the scope of the decision taken in the
                                 meeting and was, in fact, never so intended.

                          F.        THE RESPONSE OF NPPA
</p><p id="p_85">                          38.       Countering the aforesaid submissions, Mr. Kirtiman Singh, learned
                          CGSC, firstly submitted that in matters concerning the procurement and
                          availability of essential medicines, it is the interest of the consumer which
                          has to be accorded primacy and the regulatory regime must be interpreted
                          accordingly. Mr. Singh submitted that the principal objective underlying
                          <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_42">Section 3</a> of the Act and the various orders which have come to be
                          promulgated thereunder is to secure the equitable distribution of essential
                          commodities and to ensure availability thereof at fair prices. Learned
                          counsel submitted that it is the interest of the consumer and not the
                          producer which must be countenanced as being the determinative factor for
                          the purposes of interpreting the provisions of the 2013 DPCO. Proceeding
                          along these lines, Mr. Singh submitted that the theme and ethos of the
                          <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_43">Essential Commodities Act</a>, 195513 and the various Control Orders which
                          have come to be promulgated thereunder were lucidly explained by the
                          Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/1758272/" id="a_44">Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Union of India14</a> in the

                                         business by imposing reasonable restrictions. The question of fair price to
                                         the consumer with reference to the dominant, object and purpose of the
                                         legislation claiming equitable distribution and availability at fair price is
                                         completely lost sight of if profit and the producer&#x27;s return are kept in the

                          laid down by the Supreme Court in <a href="/doc/178640246/" id="a_46">Prag Ice &amp; Oil Mills v. Union of

                                      order are, therefore, to be found in <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_47">Section 3</a> of the Act. <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_48">Section 3</a> makes

                                      or increasing supplies of an Essential Commodity or for securing its
                                      equitable distribution at fair prices the criteria of validity. It is evident
                                      that an assessment of either the expediency or necessity of a measure, in
                                      the light of all the facts and circumstances which have a bearing on the
                                      subjects of price fixation, is essentially a subjective matter. It is true that
                                      objective criteria may enter into determinations of particular selling
                                      prices of each kilogram of mustard oil at various times. But, there is no
                                      obligation here to fix the price in such a way as to ensure reasonable
                                      profits to the producer or manufacturer. It has also to be remembered that
                                      the object is to secure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices
                                      so that it is the interest of the consumer and not of the producer which is
                                      the determining factor in applying any objective tests at any particular
                                      time. Hence, the most important objective fact in fixing the price of
                                      mustard oil, which is consumed generally by large masses of people of
                                      limited means, is the paying capacity of the average purchaser or
                                      consumer.

                                      where important questions such as the impact of an exercise of a

                                      are concerned. In cases of such a kind, two rules of construction have to
                                      be kept in mind: (1) that courts generally lean towards the

                                      presumption that a legislature would not deliberately flout a
                                      constitutional safeguard or right, and (2) that while construing such an
                                      enactment the court must examine the object and the purpose of the

                                 price and if profit and the producer&#x27;s return were to be kept in the

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_35">                                      â€•43. One finds, therefore, that the price fixation by the Central

                                      the dominant object and purpose of such price fixation is the equitable
                                      distribution and availability of commodities at fair price. The whole idea
                                      behind such price fixation is to control hoarding, cornering or artificial

                                       therefore, find it difficult to accept the construction put to the above
                                      provisions by Mr. S. Ganesh.â€–

</p><p id="p_92">                          42.        The submission in essence was that the provisions of the 2013
                          DPCO must be interpreted in a manner which subserves the essential
                          objectives of the Act, the legislative power of the respondents to control the
                          price of essential commodities and ensuring that the benefits which are
                          envisaged therein flow to the ultimate consumer. It was contended that it is
                          the interest of the consumers which is of significance and import and that
                          the same would clearly override any right or interest which a manufacturer
                          of an essential commodity may claim. According to Mr. Singh, Para 20 has
                          to therefore necessarily be interpreted bearing in mind the fundamental
                          precepts which have been noticed above. Mr. Singh would contend that the
                          fundamental objective of Para 20 is to essentially act as a deterrent upon
                          manufactures from acting contrary to the interest of consumers. It was
                          submitted that the said provision has been promulgated in order to prevent
                          manufacturers from overcharging consumers in respect of non-scheduled
                          formulations. Mr. Singh would submit that the moment a manufacturer is
                          found to have transgressed the maximum parameters which are placed
                          under Para 20, it would lose the right to seek an upward revision of the
                          MRP.

                                  â€•12. The language of paragraph 20(1) of the DPCO, 2013 is
                                 unambiguous. It proscribes the manufacturer from raising a Maximum
                                 Retail Price (MRP) beyond 10% of the MRP as existing during the
                                 preceding twelve months. There is no scope for the petitioner to make
                                 any adjustment on account of the preceding periods for which MRP has
                                 not been raised. It is also relevant to observe that the National
                                 Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy, 2012 brought about a paradigm shift in
                                 the administration of the ceiling prices from a cost based price regime to
                                 a price determined by the market force. Although, in terms of the DPCO,
                                 2013, the ceiling prices are required to be fixed only for scheduled
                                 formulations, the prices of other drugs are also required to be monitored.
                                 This monitoring of the prices is also based on the market forces, and a
                                 manufacturer is free to fix the MRP with the restriction that the same
                                 cannot be increased beyond 10%, over and above the MRP fixed in the
                                 preceding twelve months. This is to ensure that the there is no runaway
                                 increase in the prices of the drugs. Thus, in cases where a manufacturer is
                                 compelled to peg up the MRP on market forces, it would militate against
                                 the very object of paragraph 20(1) of DPCO, 2013 to permit such a
                                 manufacturer to increase a price beyond 10%, taking into account the
                                 period for which such manufacturer was constrained to peg the MRP at a
                                 price below the permissible increase.â€–

</p><p id="p_95">                          44.    Mr. Singh further apprised the Court that while the Union has
                          challenged the judgment in Terumo Penpol on other related aspects,
                          insofar as the interpretation accorded to Para 20 is concerned and as was
                          enunciated in that decision, it is the stand of the respondents that the said
                          judgment correctly expounds the intent of the said provision. Continuing
                          along this thread, Mr. Singh argued that the moment it is found that a
                          manufacturer has violated the maximum permissible increase as
                          contemplated under Para 20, it would necessarily result in a deprivation of
                          the right to seek periodic increases under that provision. For the purposes of
                          elucidating the aforesaid submission, Mr. Singh has also placed on the
                          record a chart showing the consequences of default as per the respondents
                          which is extracted hereinbelow: -

</p><p id="p_97">                           45.   Mr. Singh submitted that in terms of the aforesaid illustration, a
                          manufacturer which breaches the maximum permissible increase of 10%
                          would be liable to be viewed as being in continued violation of Para 20
                          until the default is ultimately remedied. It was submitted that the moment a
                          breach of Para 20 is discovered, the price of the non- scheduled formulation
                          would have to be necessarily rolled back to the permissible MRP and from
                          the year of default till the transgression is ultimately cured, the
                          manufacturer would be liable to hold prices at that level. It was the
                          categorical case of the respondents, and one which was also explained in
                          the illustrations extracted above, that the liability of a manufacturer to
                          revise and roll back prices of a particular drug would have to revert to the
                          year of default and the price thereafter maintained for the entire period till
                          the default may be ultimately cured or a demand raised. According to Mr.
                          Singh, during this period where the manufacturer is statutorily obliged to
                          rectify its conduct, it cannot claim a notional increase of the MRP by 10%.

                           contend that a transgression of Para 20, which essentially constitutes the
                          breach of a civil obligation, does not require mens rea to be proved or
                          established. Mr. Singh referred to the following pertinent observations as
                          made by the Supreme Court in SCM Solifert Ltd. v. CCI,19:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_36">                                      â€•23. There was no requirement of mens rea under <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_75">Section 43-A</a> or an
                                      intentional breach as an essential element for levy of penalty. <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_76">The Act</a>
                                      does not use the expression â€•the failure has to be wilful or mala fideâ€– for
                                      the purpose of imposition of penalty. The breach of the provisions of the
                                      Act is punishable and considering the nature of the breach, it is
                                      discretionary to impose the extent of penalty. Mens rea is important to

                                         contravention of the provisions of a civil act. In our view, the
                                         penalty is attracted as soon as contravention of the statutory
                                         obligations as contemplated by the Act is established and,
                                         therefore, the intention of the parties committing such violation
                                         becomes immaterial. In other words, the breach of a civil
                                         obligation which attracts penalty under the provisions of an Act
                                         would immediately attract the levy of penalty irrespective of the
                                         fact whether the contravention was made by the defaulter with
                                         any guilty intention or not. This apart, unless the language of the
                                         statute indicates the need to establish the element of mens rea, it
                                         is generally sufficient to prove that a default in complying with
                                         the statute has occurred ... the penalty has to follow and only
                                         the quantum of penalty is discretionary....

                                         Act and the Regulations is established and hence intention of the

                                         mens rea must be proved before a penalty can be imposed under
                                         these provisions. Hence, once the contravention is established

                                      criminal. Thus, a penalty has to follow. Discretion in the provision under

<p id="p_102">                                      7. â€•Mens reaâ€– is a state of mind. Under the criminal law, mens rea is

                                      â€•made punishable by any law for the time being in forceâ€–. The
                                      proceedings under Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947 are â€—adjudicatory&#x27; in

                                  but only as â€—administrators&#x27; and â€—adjudicators&#x27;. In the proceedings before
                                 them, they do not try â€—an accused&#x27; for commission of â€•any crimeâ€– (not
                                 merely an offence) but determine the liability of the contravenor for the
                                 breach of his â€—obligations&#x27; imposed under the Act. They impose â€—penalty&#x27;
                                 for the breach of the â€•civil obligationsâ€– laid down under the Act and not
                                 impose any â€—sentence&#x27; for the commission of an offence. The expression
                                 â€—penalty&#x27; is a word of wide significance. Sometimes, it means recovery of
                                 an amount as a penal measure even in civil proceedings. An exaction
                                 which is not compensatory in character is also termed as a â€—penalty&#x27;.
                                 When penalty is imposed by an adjudicating officer, it is done so in
                                 â€•adjudicatory proceedingsâ€– and not by way of fine as a result of
                                 â€—prosecution&#x27; of an â€—accused&#x27; for commission of an â€—offence&#x27; in a criminal
                                 court. Therefore, merely because â€—penalty&#x27; clause exists in <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_89">Section
                                 23(1)(a)</a>, the nature of the proceedings under that section is not changed
                                 from â€—adjudicatory&#x27; to â€—criminal&#x27; prosecution. An order made by an
                                 adjudicating authority under the Act is not that of conviction but of
                                 determination of the breach of the civil obligation by the offender.
</p><p id="p_103">                                 8. It is thus the breach of a â€•civil obligationâ€– which attracts â€—penalty&#x27;

                                 contravened the provisions of <a href="/doc/1943863/" id="a_91">Section 10</a>, FERA, 1947 that would
                                 immediately attract the levy of â€—penalty&#x27; under <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_92">Section 23</a>, irrespective of
                                 the fact whether the contravention was made by the defaulter with any
                                 â€•guilty intentionâ€– or not. Therefore, unlike in a criminal case, where it is
                                 essential for the â€—prosecution&#x27; to establish that the â€—accused&#x27; had the
                                 necessary guilty intention or in other words the requisite â€•mens reaâ€– to
                                 commit the alleged offence with which he is charged before recording his
                                 conviction, the obligation on the part of the Directorate of Enforcement,
                                 in cases of contravention of the provisions of Section 10 of FERA, would
                                 be discharged where it is shown that the â€•blameworthy conductâ€– of the
                                 delinquent had been established by wilful contravention by him of the
                                 provisions of <a href="/doc/1943863/" id="a_93">Section 10</a>, FERA, 1947. It is the delinquency of
                                 the defaulter itself which establishes his â€—blameworthy&#x27; conduct,
                                 attracting the provisions of Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947 without any
                                 further proof of the existence of â€•mens reaâ€–. Even after an adjudication
                                 by the authorities and levy of penalty under Section 23(1)(a) of FERA,
                                 1947, the defaulter can still be tried and punished for the commission of
                                 an offence under the penal law, where the act of the defaulter also
                                 amounts to an offence under the penal law and the bar under <a href="/doc/17858/" id="a_94">Article

                                 conduct for contravention of the provisions of FERA, 1947. We,
                                 therefore, hold that mens rea (as is understood in criminal law) is not an
                                 essential ingredient for holding a delinquent liable to pay penalty under
                                 Section 23(1)(a) of FERA, 1947 for contravention of the provisions of
                                 Section 10 of FERA, 1947 and that penalty is attracted under <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_96">Section

                                 apparently fell in error in treating the â€•blameworthy conductâ€– under the
                                 Act as equivalent to the commission of a â€•criminal offenceâ€–, overlooking
                                 the position that the â€•blameworthy conductâ€– in the adjudicatory
                                 proceedings is established by proof only of the breach of a civil
                                 obligation under the Act, for which the defaulter is obliged to make
                                 amends by payment of the penalty imposed under <a href="/doc/774360/" id="a_98">Section 23(1)(a)</a> of the

                                 without any guilty intention. Our answer to the first question formulated
                                 by us above is, therefore in the negative.â€–

                          and the decision in T.C. Healthcare, Mr. Singh argued that Para 20 in
                          unambiguous terms prescribes that interest would be leviable on the
                          overcharged amount from the date of such overcharge. According to Mr.
                          Singh, Para 20(2) in unequivocal terms employs the phrase &quot;from the date
                          of increase in priceâ€–. In view of the aforesaid, Mr. Singh would submit that
                          there is neither justification nor interpretative space to hold that interest
                          under Para 20 is liable to be computed only from the date when a demand
                          may come to be raised by the NPPA. It was his submission that the decision
                          in T.C. Healthcare proceeded on the basis of the provisions contained in
                          the 1995 DPCO whereas the provisions made in the 2013 DPCO insofar as
                          they relate to interest are clearly distinct. It was argued that penal
                          consequences which follow a transgression of Para 20 and the liabilities
                          created in terms thereof, are not premised on a notice of demand. In view of
                          the above, it was his submission that the decisions relied upon by the

                          No. 5(ii) as considered by the NPPA in its Meeting of 12 April 2016 can
                          have no application to a non-scheduled formulations. Mr. Singh submitted
                          that as is explicit from the Agenda Item itself, NPPA in that meeting was
                          dealing with the overcharging of scheduled formulations. This according to
                          Mr. Singh is evident from the usage of the terms â€•ceiling priceâ€– and
                          Wholesale Price Index [WPI] in that Agenda. Mr. Singh further pointed out
                          that the principle of rounding off essentially flows from the provisions
                          contained in the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules,
                          201122. Drawing the attention of the Court to the 2011 Rules, Mr. Singh

                          up to ninety five paise to the rounded off to fifty paise&quot;. Mr. Singh
                          submitted that while the aforesaid Rules specifically incorporate and adopt
                          the principles of rounding off, no provision under the 2013 DPCO
                          empowers a manufacturer of formulations to follow the same route. It was
                          further pointed out that the aforesaid Rules in any case would have no
                          application bearing in mind the provisions made in Rule 26 thereof and in
                          terms of which drugs covered under the 2013 DPCO have been specifically

                           represents a principled decision taken by the said authority to not pursue
                          prosecutions where overcharging may have occurred solely on account of
                          rounding off of decimal points as per general mathematical practice. It was
                          submitted that while resolving as such, the NPPA had placed a further rider
                          that the aforesaid decision would only apply to those cases where there was
                          no other mala fide intent on the part of a manufacturer. The argument
                          essentially was that the decision of the NPPA which is sought to be relied
                          upon was only permissive and applicable to those cases which could be said
                          to fall within the ambit of Agenda Item 5.2. In any case, Mr. Singh would
                          contend even Agenda Item 5.2 cannot be construed or understood as
                          entitling a manufacturer to round off the prices of non-scheduled
                          formulations as a matter of right.

                          the price control regime insofar as drugs are concerned. Price control
                          measures in respect of medicines and drugs came to be introduced as an
                          aftermath of the Chinese aggression when for the first time the Drugs

                          powers conferred under the Defence of India Act, 1915. In terms of the
                          aforesaid, the prices of drugs came to be frozen at the levels at which they
                          stood on 01 April 1963. Subsequently, a series of Drug Price Control
                          Orders came to be notified, namely, in 1966, 1970, 1979, 1987 and 1995. It
                          would be relevant to note that the aforesaid Control Orders came be issued
                          under the Act. The 1995 DPCO was framed in light of the Drug Policy of

                          production with allowances relating to post production expenses being
                          permitted to be taken into consideration. It was these two factors which
                          were essentially taken into account while fixing the price of drugs. The
                          1995 DPCO created a list of 76 bulk drugs and various formulations based
                          on those drugs which at the time of the announcement of the NPPP 2012
                          stood at approximately 1577.

                          price control was raised from Rs. 4 crores to Rs. 25 crores. It also excluded
                          drugs whose unit price did not exceed Rs. 2 from the ambit of price control.
                          The aforesaid policy, however, came to be challenged before the Karnataka
                          High Court which by its order of 12 November 2002 stayed the
                          implementation thereof. The aforesaid order was ultimately challenged by

                          formulate an appropriate criterion for ensuring essential and life saving

                                 monitorable market data would be the data available with the
                                 pharmaceuticals market data specializing company - IMS Health (IMS).
                                 Wherever required this data would be checked by appropriate survey/
                                 evaluation by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). As
                                 the IMS data gives price figures for stockist level prices hence in order to
                                 arrive at ceiling Price (which will be the maximum retail price), the IMS
                                 price will be further increased by 16% as margin to the retailer so as to
                                 arrive at a reasonable ceiling price chargeable from the consumers.

                                 absence of competition, the overall percentage reduction in the price of

                                 drug whose data is not available in IMS, the NPPA will commission the
                                 data within a reasonable time for determining the Simple Average Prices
                                 also on the basis of prices prevailing six months prior to the Appointed

                                 IMS data and collected by NPPA would be same. Once the Simple
                                 Average Price is fixed, NPPA would monitor its implementation on a

                                 fixed the prices not consistent with the revised ceiling prices, the NPPA

                          catalogued and specified in the First Schedule to the 1995 DPCO. A non-
                          scheduled bulk drug was defined in Para 2(o) to mean a bulk drug not
                          specified in the First Schedule. The 1995 DPCO defined a scheduled
                          formulation to mean a formulation containing any bulk drug specified in the
                          First Schedule either individually or in combination with other drugs.
                          Similarly, a non-scheduled formulation was defined to mean a formulation
                          not containing any bulk drug specified in the First Schedule. The provision
                          contained in the 1995 DPCO empowered the Union to fix the maximum
                          sale price of bulk drugs and scheduled formulations as well as to specify a
                          ceiling price of scheduled formulations. The principles for calculation of
                          the retail price of a formulation was set out in Para 7. The formula which
                          came to be adopted and which embodied the cost-plus principle which was
                          then prevalent required the authority to take into consideration material
                          costs, conversion costs, packaging costs as well as the maximum
                          â€•Aflowable Post Manufacturing Expensesâ€–. Excise duty was also factored
                          in for the purposes of arriving at the retail price. The power to revise the
                          price of bulk drug and scheduled formulations was spelt out in Para 10

                          manufacturers. Insofar as non-scheduled formulations are concerned, they
                          were admittedly kept out of the price control regime and the Government
                          only retained the power to monitor the MRP thereof in terms of Para 20
                          which has been noticed in the introductory parts of this judgment.

</p><p id="p_143">                          62.   Having noticed the salient provisions which were made in the 1995
                          DPCO and those which stand incorporated in the 2013 DPCO, the principal
                          challenge revolving around the scope of Para 20 may then be taken up for
                          consideration.
</p>
<p id="p_144">                          63.   As would be evident from an ex facie reading of the said provision,
                          the manufacturer of a non scheduled formulation is conferred the discretion
                          to increase the maximum retail price of a drug subject to the condition that
                          the said increase does not exceed more than 10% of the MRP which was
                          prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The consequences of an
                          infraction of the aforesaid stipulation contained in Para 20 are prescribed to
                          be the obligation of the manufacturer to not only deposit the overcharged
                          amount but to also reduce the price of the drug in question to that which

                           was prevailing immediately before the event of overcharging and was
                          compliant with Para 20. The manufacturer is further obliged to maintain
                          the price of the drug at that level for the next twelve months. The provisions
                          of Para 20 directly fell for consideration before this Court in Terumo
                          Penpol which too was a case dealing with the issue of overcharging. The
                          order of the NPPA which was impugned therein was assailed firstly on the
                          ground with the petitioners there contending that since they had not
                          increased the MRP of their drugs for the last several years, they were
                          entitled to raise the price cumulatively taking into account the annual
                          increase of 10% which had not been availed of earlier. The second
                          challenge to the order passed by NPPA was based on the assertion that
                          since the actual sale price of the drug was below the MRP for the year
                          2015, no penal consequences would ensue. In Terumo Penpol, the
                          petitioner also sought to assail the action of the NPPA on the ground of
                          inordinate delay in the raising of the demand alleging overcharging. While
                          this Court while dealing with the present batch is not directly concerned
                          with the latter two submissions which were addressed in that matter, it
                          would be apposite to notice what the learned Judge ultimately held with
                          respect to the scope of Para 20. The leaned Judge observed that in terms of
                          Para 20 a manufacturer stands restrained from raising the MRP beyond
                          10% of the price as existing during the preceding twelve months. It was
                          further pertinently observed that it would not be permissible for a
                          manufacturer to make any adjustments on account of the MRP having not
                          been raised in the preceding periods. The spirit behind Para 20 and the
                          periodical increase which is permissible to be availed of by the
                          manufacturer was further expressed by the Court to be aimed at ensuring

<p id="p_145">                          64.   Para 20 of the 2013 DPCO thereafter fell for consideration again in
                          Obsurge Biotech. While dealing with the scope and ambit of that
                          provision, the learned Judge in Obsurge Biotech observed as follows: -
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_72">                                  â€•7. A reading of the above provision would clearly show that a
                                 manufacturer is entitled to increase the maximum retail price of a drug
                                 not more than 10% of the maximum retail price during â€—preceding&#x27;
                                 twelve months. It further provides that where the manufacturer of a drug
                                 increases the price beyond 10% of the maximum retail price, â€—it shall
                                 reduce the same to the level of 10% of maximum retail price for next
                                 twelve months.&#x27; The paragraph uses the word â€—preceding&#x27; and â€—next&#x27; and
                                 clearly, therefore, what is intended is that where the manufacturer
                                 increases the MRP by more than 10%, the Government is empowered to
                                 ensure that the manufacturer reduces the MRP to the level of maximum
                                 10%.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_73">                                 8. The consequence of a manufacturer having increased the MRP and
                                 having obtained certain amounts because of the same from the consumers
                                 is in the sub paragraph-(2) of paragraph 20, wherein the manufacturer is
                                 being made liable to deposit the overcharged amount along with interest
                                 thereon from the date of increase in price in addition to the â€—penalty&#x27;.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_74">                                 9. Clearly by denying the petitioner increase in the MRP which he is
                                 otherwise entitled to, would amount to a penalty being imposed even in
                                 paragraph 20 (1), which does not flow from a bare reading of the
                                 provision nor intended.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_75">                                 10. Paragraph 20(1) of the DPCO in no unambiguous terms provide that
                                 a manufacturer would be entitled to increase the MRP of the drug by a
                                 maximum of 10% of the MRP during the â€—preceding&#x27; twelve months and
                                 incase the manufacturer is found to have increased the MRP beyond the
                                 limit of 10%, the Government would be entitled to direct reduction of the
                                 same to the level of 10% for the period of next twelve months from the
                                 date when the manufacturer became entitled to such increase.</blockquote>
<p id="p_146">                                 11. To put it differently and explaining it by an example, if the MRP of a
                                 drug is Rs. 100 for the period from 2013-14, the manufacturer would be
                                 entitled to increase the MRP of the drug to a maximum of Rs. 110 for the
                                 period 2014-15 and incase it is found that the manufacturer has increased
                                 the MRP beyond the ceiling limit, the Government can direct the
                                 manufacturer to reduce the MRP to the level of Rs. 110 for the period
                                 2014-15 whereafter again, the manufacturer will be entitled to increase
                                 the MRP of the drug by a maximum of another 10% of Rs. 110.â€–

</p><p id="p_147">                           65.   It may be noted in passing that although the ambit of Para 20 was
                          noticed, the learned Judge in Obsurge Biotech did not record any specific
                          findings in respect thereof since in that particular case, the claim of the
                          petitioner had not been denied by the respondents on the ground that it was
                          not entitled to a subsequent increase in the MRP. Obsurge Biotech
                          ultimately came to be decided on the issue of whether the principles of
                          rounding off could be adopted. The judgment in Obsurge Biotech in any
                          case and as was noticed hereinabove, has been placed in abeyance by a
                          Division Bench of the Court in LPA No. 310/2020.

<p id="p_148">                          66.   The power of the NPPA to monitor the price of non-scheduled
                          formulations as distinct from a power to fix a price for drugs which stands
                          reserved in respect of scheduled formulations only was duly noticed and
                          explained in Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited. Dealing with the said
                          aspect, the learned Judge held as under:-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_76">                                 â€•14. It is clear from the above that the NPPA has no power to fix the
                                 ceiling price or the MRP of any formulation other than a scheduled
                                 formulation. Concededly, the Formulation had ceased to be a â€—Scheduled
                                 formulation&#x27; with effect from 10.03.2016. Consequently, the power of
                                 the NPPA to fix a ceiling price for the Formulation had also ceased with
                                 effect from 10.03.2016.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_77">                                 16. It is clear from the plain language of Sub-paragraph (1) of Paragraph
                                 20 of the DPCO that the Government is required to monitor the MRP of
                                 all drugs, including the non-scheduled formulations. However, the same
                                 does not empower NPPA (the Government) to fix a MRP for a non-
                                 scheduled formulation. The only restriction placed by virtue of Paragraph
                                 20 of the DPCO is that a manufacturer cannot increase the MRP of any
                                 drug by more than 10% of the MRP as prevailing during the preceding
                                 twelve months. Thus, in terms of Paragraph 20 of the DPCO, the NPPA
                                 would be well within its rights to ensure that the petitioner does not
                                 increase the MRP of the Formulation for a period of twelve months.â€–

                           question of the correct meaning and purport of Para 20, it would be apposite
                          to advert to the illustrations which had been relied upon and have been
                          extracted above. As per the illustration relied upon by Bard and extracted in
                          paragraph 20 of this decision, it has sought to explain how Para 20 must be
                          interpreted and implemented by asserting that a manufacturer would be
                          entitled to claim a 10% revision in the MRP every twelve months. It also
                          explained a case of overcharging by taking the example of a drug coming to
                          be priced at Rs. 125/- where the allowed MRP in terms of Para 20 would be
                          only Rs. 110/-. In that scenario it is conceded that the overcharged amount
                          would be Rs. 15/-. However, for the next year, the position is explained
                          with the allowed MRP being fixed at Rs. 121/- and thus factoring in the
                          10% increase which is otherwise permissible under Para 20. The case of
                          Bard essentially is that notwithstanding a manufacturer having transgressed
                          the limits prescribed in Para 20 in a particular year, that would not detract
                          from its right to claim an increase in the MRP. The submission additionally
                          was that the amount of overcharge cannot be computed without factoring in
                          the periodic and annual 10% increase which the manufacturer can claim.

<p id="p_150">                          68.   The Court then turns its gaze on the illustration relied upon by Bharat
                          Serums and which has been reproduced in paragraph 11 of this judgment.
                          The case of Bharat Serums stands on a slightly distinct footing since, and
                          as was noticed hereinabove, it has been found to have violated Para 20 on
                          account of having rounded off the permissible MRP under the 2013 DPCO.
                          While explaining the impact of Para 20 in respect of the drug Histoglob,
                          Bharat Serums has firstly contended that mere rounding off cannot be
                          construed as overcharging. It has been argued that if the permissible price

                           of Histoglob be Rs. 90.75/- in February 2015, it was clearly permissible for
                          the petitioner to round it off to Rs. 91/-. It similarly explains the aforesaid
                          position while taking the permissible MRP in February 2016 to be Rs.
                          99.825/-. It was contended that if the aforesaid price were rounded off to
                          Rs. 100/-, it could not be said that it had violated Para 20.           It has
                          additionally taken an objection to the freezing of the price at Rs. 90.75/-
                          which was the MRP prevailing in February 2015. It was urged that even if
                          the infraction had firstly occurred in February 2015, its obligation to hold
                          the price of the drug at that price could have only been for the next twelve
                          months when computed from February 2015. It is urged that from February
                          2017, Bharat Serums must be recognized to be entitled to charge Rs.
                          109.808/- rounded off Rs. 110/- and that it cannot be compelled to charge
                          only Rs. 90.75/-. It was argued that the directive issued by the respondents
                          which essentially compels the manufacturer to roll back the price of the
                          drug to the permissible MRP from the period of infraction and till the
                          issuance of the impugned demand or act of rectification by the
                          manufacturer is clearly contrary to Para 20 of the 2013 DPCO.

                           to hold it that price till the infraction is cured and for twelve months
                          thereafter. The respondents further contend that if the default is ultimately
                          cured after six years, the manufacturer would have to go back to the price
                          which was prevailing in the first year and thereafter continue to hold the
                          same for the entire period of six years. According to them and as is
                          explained by Mr. Singh with the aid of the illustration noticed above, if the
                          default had occurred in 2015 being Year One and is ultimately cured after
                          six years, the manufacturer would have to maintain the price of the drug at
                          the permissible price which was prevalent prior to Year One and hold it at
                          that level throughout the period of the succeeding six years and twelve
                          months even thereafter. It is these rival interpretations advocated with
                          respect to Para 20 which merit consideration.

<p id="p_153">                          71.      Undisputedly, Para 20 of the DPCO 2013 empowers the Government
                          to monitor the retail price of non-scheduled formulations. That authority to
                          oversee and periodically track the price charged by a manufacturer is to
                          ensure that no manufacturer increases the maximum retail price of a drug
                          more than 10% over the maximum retail price that prevailed in the
                          preceding twelve months. The first part of Para 20 thus appears to enable
                          the manufacturer to revise the maximum retail price over a twelve-month
                          cycle. The statute, however, places an injunct by proscribing any revision in
                          price beyond 10% over the price prevailing in the preceding twelve-month
                          cycle.

                           containing any bulk drug specified in the First Schedule either individually
                          or as a combination. A non-scheduled formulation was defined to mean one
                          which did not contain any bulk drug specified in the First Schedule.
                          However, the power to fix the retail price of both the aforenoted categories
                          of drugs stood embodied in Para 7. Insofar as scheduled formulations were
                          concerned, while the computation of the retail price was to abide by the
                          formulae set out in Para 7, the 1995 DPCO dealt with this category of
                          formulations in Para 8 in order to amplify the procedure that it was bound
                          to follow while fixing the retail price of scheduled formulations from time
                          to time. Para 9 then conferred a power on the Government to fix a ceiling
                          price of scheduled formulations. This too was to be guided by the
                          provisions contained in Para 7. The power to revise the retail price of
                          formulations including non-scheduled formulations was recognised and
                          provisioned for in Para 10.

                          fixation shifted from a cost of manufacture principle to a market driven
                          price mechanism. The second significant policy change which was ushered
                          in with the advent of the 2013 DPCO was of the NPPA retaining the power
                          to fix prices in respect of scheduled formulations only. Insofar as non-
                          scheduled formulations were concerned, all that was proclaimed was that it
                          would &quot;monitor&quot; the price of such formulations. This appears to be a result
                          of the variation in the total number of drugs which remained under price
                          control starting from the 1979 DPCO [347 drugs], which was then abridged
                          to 166 in 1987 and brought further down to 142. Under the 1995 DPCO,

                          reviewed in terms of the NPPP 2012 which essentially took the position that
                          all essential drugs would be under price control and as a logical corollary
                          non-essential drugs were to be kept out of the price control regime and their
                          prices being left to be governed by market forces. In order however to keep
                          a check on overall drug prices, non-essential drugs were to be monitored
                          and the restrictive price band of 10% was mooted. These proposals and
                          policy directives which formed the backbone of the NPPP 2012, inform the
                          provisions of Para 20 of the 2013 DPCO.

<p id="p_156">                          74.   From the aforesaid discussion, it is evident that insofar as non-
                          scheduled formulations were concerned, the Government took a conscious
                          decision to leave their prices to be determined by market forces subject to
                          the rider that the annual increase would not exceed 10% and in case of
                          overcharging the manufacturer would have to roll back the prices to the
                          preceding legally permissible price and preserve it at that level for the next
                          twelve months. Viewed in that backdrop it is evident that a manufacturer of
                          a non-scheduled formulation was entitled to fix the price of its drug subject
                          to the singular fetter of the same being compliant with the stipulation of
                          10% which was sanctioned.

                          of its right to that periodical increase and if so for what period of time. The

                           bracket of the permissible 10% increase and that price then maintained for
                          the next twelve months. The aforesaid position which is taken in Bard, is
                          reiterated in Bharat Serum with the respondents noting that it would be
                          ineligible to seek the benefit of the sequential increase of 10% over the
                          prevailing retail price till the price is reduced to fall within the permissible
                          band in terms of Para 20 and held at that level for the next twelve months.
                          Bard while assailing the aforesaid reasoning has contended that the view
                          taken by the respondents has resulted in the freezing of its prices since
                          2018. They further contend that as a result of the impugned order, they had
                          to bring down the prices of their medical devices to the levels prevailing in
                          2014-2015, maintain it for the next twelve months and then commence
                          afresh. The aforesaid grievance is liable to be considered in the backdrop of
                          the demand notice for the period 2015-16 having been issued only in 2019.
                          Similarly, Bharat Serum has demonstrated with the aid of the material
                          existing on the record that it has been held liable to hold the price of its
                          drug at the level prevailing in February 2015 right upto December 2019.

<p id="p_158">                          76.   The respondents essentially appear to have understood Para 20 to
                          mean that the revisions permissible annually would stand forfeited till such
                          time as remedial action in terms of the 2013 DPCO are taken by the
                          manufacturer. However, that interpretation rests principally not on the date
                          when the infraction occurred but on the date when the violation of Para 20
                          may come to be discovered either by the respondents or when corrective
                          action may be taken by the manufacturer itself. It is here that the dispute
                          appears to have arisen between the parties. This is evident from a perusal of

                           alleged violations during the period 2015-16 and the notices dated 26 June
                          2018 and 05 July 2018 alleging overcharging by Bharat Serum during the
                          period February 2014 to December 2019. The question which consequently
                          arises is whether the petitioners are liable to hold the prices of the drugs in
                          question at the permissible retail price for a period of twelve months from
                          the date of issuance of those notices and whether they become disentitled to
                          the periodic increase envisaged under Para 20 for the entire period
                          commencing from the date of overcharging till the expiry of twelve months
                          post the issuance of the impugned notices/demands.

<p id="p_159">                          77.   It becomes important to pause here and note that if the view as taken
                          by the respondents were to be upheld it would essentially amount to
                          recognizing a principle that a manufacturer would be disentitled to claim
                          the 10% annual increase in the retail price which is guaranteed under Para
                          20, if it transgresses the first part of Para 20. Secondly, the manufacturer
                          would have to be held to be obliged in law to freeze or roll back the retail
                          price of the drug to the level which was prevailing prior to the alleged
                          infraction not just from that crucial point in time but to hold it at that level
                          for the entire period commencing from the date of overcharging upto the
                          date of issuance of the demand. Additionally, the manufacturer would have
                          to hold that retail price for the next twelve months from the date of issuance
                          of the demand and the revision permitted thereafter would have to be a 10%
                          increase over the permissible price which prevailed prior to the date of
                          overcharging. It is the correctness of this view that ultimately falls for
                          consideration of the Court.

                           rigours of price control under the 2013 DPCO. That provision simply places
                          an obligation upon the Government to monitor and oversee that the
                          maximum retail price of such formulations does not exceed 10% of the
                          price which was prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The salutary
                          objective underlying this prescription is clearly manifest bearing in mind
                          the fact that drug prices must necessarily be regulated by the Government in
                          order to ensure that patients and consumers do not face the specter of
                          runaway price increases and to control profiteering. However, Para 20
                          undoubtedly permits a manufacturer to increase the maximum retail price
                          annually subject to the singular limitation that the price increase would not
                          exceed 10% of the price which was prevailing in the preceding twelve
                          months. The consequences of a breach of the aforesaid prescription is also
                          not left open to speculation with Para 20 in clear and unequivocal terms
                          prescribing the penalty as well as the remedial measures which must be
                          adopted. This is evident from a reading of the latter part of Para 20 which
                          stipulates that in such a situation, the manufacturer would have to roll back
                          the price charged to the legally permissible price which was prevailing in
                          the twelve months preceding the date of violation of Para 20 and to
                          preserve it at that level for the next twelve months. The penalty is then
                          prescribed by Para 20(2) which provides that the manufacturer would be
                          liable to deposit the overcharged amount along with interest from the date
                          in increase of price.

                          the right to increase the retail price of a drug annually in case of
                          overcharging. Para 20 spells out and stipulates both the consequences as

                          violate its provisions. The stand taken by the respondents to the effect that
                          the right to seek such increase would stand lost till such time as the price is
                          revised and brought down, would not only amount to a recasting of Para 20,
                          it would also and on more fundamental terms, result in the introduction of a
                          penal consequence which neither flows from a plain reading of that
                          provision nor inferentially.

<p id="p_162">                          80.   The Court, thus, finds itself unable to read or interpret Para 20 in the
                          manner as suggested by the respondents for the following reasons. Firstly,
                          Para 20 does not link the sequential increase which a manufacturer can
                          avail of in respect of a non-scheduled formulation to the corrective
                          measures that are liable to be adopted by it if a transgression occurs. The
                          10% factor attached to the right of sequential increase in the first part of
                          Para 20 is the solitary fetter placed on the manufacturer who is otherwise
                          left free to fix the price of its formulation. Para 20 significantly does not
                          postulate that a transgression of that particular stipulation would result in
                          the manufacturer being deprived of the right to claim an annual revision of
                          the MRP. All that it prescribes is that in case of a violation it must revise
                          the MRP, roll it back to the valid price prevailing in the preceding twelve
                          months and hold it at that level for the next twelve months. It is for the next
                          twelve months alone that the price must remain static as per the statutory
                          command enshrined in Para 20. However, that provision neither envisages
                          nor mandates the right to revise the MRP being effaced beyond the next
                          twelve-month period.

                           and distinct identifiable parts. While the former deals with the right of the
                          manufacturer to a sequential increase of 10% annually, the latter deals with
                          the consequences of a violation of the 10% circuit breaker. The latter part of
                          Para 20 kicks into play the moment the manufacturer transgresses the
                          maximum permissible limit of 10%. However, Para 20 nowhere mandates
                          that the right to seek a periodic revision stands lost in case the manufacturer
                          violates the limits prescribed. The Court consequently finds itself unable to
                          accept the interpretation advocated at the behest of the respondents in light
                          of the unambiguous prescription of the consequences of a violation of the
                          former part of Para 20. The language employed by that provision explicitly
                          spells out not just the consequences of a transgression, it also prescribes the
                          period during which remedial measures are to be adopted.

<p id="p_164">                          82.   As was rightly contended on behalf of the petitioners, the crucial
                          expressions which would throw light on the intent of Para 20 are the
                          expressions &quot;preceding&quot; and &quot;next&quot;. The word â€•precedingâ€– acts as a
                          pointer to the date or the period which would constitute the focal point to
                          identify the legally permissible MRP with reference to which an infraction
                          is liable to be examined. The word â€•nextâ€– denotes and prescribes the period
                          during which the MRP of the formulation must be kept static after being
                          rolled back. For the purposes of identifying the valid MRP against which a
                          periodic 10% increase may be claimed, it is the price prevailing in the
                          preceding year which would govern and decide. Similarly, the period
                          during which the MRP must be revised and kept on hold is also prescribed
                          to be the next twelve months when computed with reference to the date or
                          period of the infraction. Both the commencement as well as the termination

                          to be upheld, it would not only amount to the introduction of an additional
                          penal consequence, it would also shift the terminal point as fixed by Para

                          clearly amount to the Court recasting that provision while undertaking an
                          exercise of statutory interpretation and the introduction of a penalty which
                          has neither been provided for nor contemplated. While the Court is
                          conscious of the fact that the issues involved here relate to drugs and the
                          paramount consideration of the said essential commodity being sold and
                          distributed in a fair and equitable manner, it finds itself unable to introduce
                          in or read into Para 20 a penal consequence which has otherwise not been
                          incorporated by the authors of the statute. It is not for this Court to structure
                          or insert a penal consequence on its own understanding or notions of
                          righteousness. The contention of the respondents based on alleged
                          profiteering is also negated by the penal consequences which are provided
                          for in Para 20 itself and which requires the manufacturer to not only deposit
                          the overcharged amount but to do so along with interest from the date of the
                          transgression.

</p><p id="p_169">                          85.   That then takes the Court to deal with the issue of interest as was
                          canvassed on behalf of Bard by Mr. Sibal. It may be noted that insofar as
                          Bharat Serums is concerned, Mr. Shah, learned counsel appearing on their
                          behalf, did not adopt those submissions. The submission relating to interest
                          and as was advanced by Mr. Sibal proceeded along the following lines.
                          According to Mr. Sibal, the power to levy interest on the overcharged
                          amount principally flows from <a href="/doc/183785/" id="a_102">Section 7A</a> of the Act. According to Mr.
                          Sibal, the liability to pay interest in terms of <a href="/doc/183785/" id="a_103">Section 7A</a> can commence
                          only once a manufacturer defaults in paying an amount pursuant to an order
                          or demand which may be raised by the respondents. It was contended that
                          the 2013 DPCO which is essentially a piece of subordinate legislation must
                          yield to the provisions contained in <a href="/doc/183785/" id="a_104">Section 7A</a>. It was in the aforesaid
                          backdrop that it was commended to the Court that the principles as
                          enunciated in T.C. Healthcare and the various decisions which had
                          followed the dictum laid down therein should be reiterated. This Court,

                           13 of the 1995 DPCO which has been extracted hereinabove, made
                          provisions for recovery of overcharged amounts. While dealing with that
                          subject, Para 13 prescribed that the Government shall by notice require
                          manufacturers, importers or distributors to deposit the amount accrued due
                          to charging of prices higher than those fixed or notified by the Government
                          under the provisions of the 1987 and 1995 DPCOs&#x27;. Para 13 thus prescribed
                          and put in place a procedure in terms of which the Government was to place
                          manufacturers, importers or distributors on notice to deposit the amounts
                          which may have accrued due to charging of prices higher than those fixed
                          under the Price Control Orders. However, Para 20 has been worded in a
                          manner which is starkly distinct from Para 13. It becomes pertinent to note
                          that Para 20(1) clearly appears to put in place a self regulatory mechanism
                          which obligates the manufacturer to ensure that the price that it fixes for
                          non-scheduled formulations does not exceed 10% of the price prevailing in
                          the preceding twelve months. The penalty which would visit a manufacturer
                          in case of a violation of the aforesaid provision is clearly and
                          unambiguously spelt out in that provision itself when it stipulates that in
                          case a manufacturer breaches the maximum permissible increase of 10%, it
                          would be under an obligation to deposit the amount overcharged in excess
                          together with interest. Significantly, the compliance with the aforesaid
                          prescriptions is not made dependent upon or subject to an order being made
                          by the NPPA. What places Para 20 in a position distinct from Para 13 of the
                          1995 DPCO is that unlike the latter which envisages interest being leviable
                          from the date when a manufacturer fails to comply with a demand, the
                          former is not premised on a demand being raised at all. Under Para 20, the
                          manufacturer becomes liable to take steps for reparation the moment an

                          act of overcharging itself.

<p id="p_171">                          87.   The Court also bears in mind the duty placed upon manufacturers to
                          issue price lists and supplementary price lists and provide the same to
                          dealers, State Drug Controllers and the Government indicating changes that
                          may be made from time to time in terms of Para 25(2) of the 2013 DPCO.
                          Regard must be had to the fact that since and insofar as non-scheduled
                          formulations are concerned, the Government has only retained the power to
                          monitor prices of such formulations, the 2013 DPCO casts a duty upon that
                          class of manufacturers to ensure that the price of their drugs do not breach
                          the maximum permissible increase which is prescribed. The requirement
                          placed by Para 25(2) is essentially a valuable aid to enable the NPPA to
                          monitor and oversee the movement of prices of drugs. Additionally, it also
                          acts as a constant reminder for manufacturers of their overarching
                          obligation to maintain prices within the permissible limits and to self-
                          regulate.

<p id="p_172">                          88.   More significant, however, are the provisions contained in Para
                          20(2). Sub Para (2) in clear and unequivocal terms mandates that interest
                          shall be payable on the overcharged amount from the date of increase in
                          price. The expression â€•date of increase in priceâ€– must necessarily be
                          understood to be a categorical reference to the date or the period from
                          which interest is ordained to be leviable. Para 20(2) thus appears to leave
                          no room for doubt that interest has to be paid from the date of increase of
                          such price. It may be noticed that while separate provisions have been
                          made in Paras 22 and 23 for recovery of dues which may have accrued

                           under the 1979, 1989 and 1995 DPCOs&#x27;, insofar as cases of overcharging
                          which are referable to the provisions of the 2013 DPCO are concerned, they
                          are mandated and must be understood to be governed by the provisions of
                          Para 20 only.

<p id="p_173">                          89.   It becomes pertinent to highlight that Para 20 neither contemplates
                          the issuance of a notice nor does it adopt the principle of amount â€•accruedâ€–
                          as was envisaged under the 1995 DPCO. T.C. Healthcare and all
                          judgments which followed thereafter were essentially construing the
                          provisions of Para 13 of the 1995 DPCO. However, the trigger point in
                          terms of Para 20 is not a notice or a demand but the event of overcharging
                          itself. Secondly, sub para (2) in unequivocal terms prescribes that the
                          interest shall be leviable from the date of increase of price. The language of
                          Para 20(2) thus leaves no room to introduce the concept of a notice of
                          demand being the precursor to the liability to deposit the overcharged
                          amount along with interest.

                          note that the liability to pay amounts which are due together with interest is
                          related to any sums that may be recoverable in pursuance of any order made
                          under <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_106">Section 3</a> of the Act. The 2013 DPCO, and of which Para 20 is an
                          integral part, is itself an order made under <a href="/doc/158335608/" id="a_107">Section 3</a> of that Act. Thus, the
                          liability to pay interest from the date of increase of price which stands
                          created in light of Para 20 is itself liable to be recognised as one created in

<p id="p_176">                          J. THE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY AND OVERCHARGING
</p><p id="p_177">                          91.   Before closing this chapter and for the completeness of the record,
                          the submission of Bard with respect to a lack of clarity in respect of
                          disclosures liable to be made by manufacturers of medical devices being the
                          cause for the transgression may also be evaluated. To recall, Bard had
                          contended that at the relevant time, there was a lack of clarity with respect
                          to the categories of medical devices which could be said to be covered
                          under the 2013 DPCO. It was also argued that since the respondents
                          themselves had not put in place the requisite mechanism for reporting the
                          prices of medical devices, the allegation of overcharging would not sustain.
                          The Court finds itself unable to accept this submission in light of the candid
                          concession made on behalf of the said petitioner that the medical devices in
                          question did fall within the ambit of the expression â€•drugâ€– as defined. The
                          Court also notes that disposable hypodermic syringes/needles as well as
                          catheters stood duly notified as drugs in terms of notifications dated 17
                          March 1989 and 06 October 2005.
</p>
<p id="p_178">                          92.   There is thus a tacit admission to medical devices falling within the
                          ambit of non-scheduled formulations under Para 20. Consequently, merely
                          because the respondent did not call upon these manufacturers to submit a
                          price list in a particular format, that would not absolve Bard from their
                          obligation to ensure compliance with Para 20. The Court also bears in mind
                          the pertinent observations made by the Supreme Court in Cynamide where
                          it had observed that pharmaceutical manufacturers cannot feign ignorance

                          unaware of the legal obligation to be compliant with Para 20. The reporting
                          mechanism which was developed by NPPA in 2017 was only to aid them in
                          the task of monitoring the price of non-scheduled formulations. The
                          arguments addressed on this score are consequently rejected.

</p><p id="p_180">                          93.   That only leaves the Court to deal with the issue of rounding off. It
                          cannot possibly be disputed that the 2011 Rules clearly do not apply in light
                          of the express exclusion of drugs from their ambit. The Court also bears in
                          mind the submission of Mr. Singh who had contended that Para 5.2 of the
                          NPPA Minutes of Meeting dated 12 April 2016 used the expression â€—ceiling
                          price&quot; and &quot;WPI&quot; and must therefore be understood to be confined to
                          scheduled formulations only. The Court also bears in mind that the
                          extension of the rounding off the principle was one which was considered
                          and ruled upon in Obsurge and which decision presently forms subject
                          matter of challenge in a pending LPA No. 310/2020.

<p id="p_181">                          94.   Notwithstanding the above and without being influenced by the
                          observations in Obsurge, the Court notes that Para 5.2 speaks of
                          overcharging on account of fixation of a price for formulations.
                          Undisputedly, the expression â€žformulationâ€Ÿ would include both scheduled
                          and non-scheduled formulations. The Court also bears in mind that NPPA
                          had decided not to pursue overcharging cases which arose merely on
                          account of the adoption of the rounding off principle and was otherwise not
                          actuated by mala fide. Bharat Serums has in terms of the data placed on

                           merely because it had rounded off the price of its drugs. This is evident
                          from the disclosures made by the said petitioner where the price of Rs.
                          90.75 was rounded off to Rs. 91 and Rs. 109.808 was rounded off to Rs.
</p><p id="p_182">                          110. It becomes pertinent to observe that it is not the case of the respondent
                          that the aforesaid action of Bharat Serums was actuated by mala fides.
                          The issue ultimately boils down to whether the respondents would be
                          justified in taking the position that the principle of rounding off can only
                          apply to scheduled formulations.
</p>
<p id="p_183">                          95.   The Court bears in mind the admitted fact that a manufacturer of
                          non-scheduled formulations is not obliged by statute to seek the approval of
                          the price of its drugs. In fact, that class of formulations is exempt from the
                          rigors of price control altogether as has been noticed in the preceding parts
                          of this decision. The Government has merely retained a power to monitor
                          the price of non-scheduled formulations. Apart from the power of oversight
                          which stands retained by the Government in respect of this class of drugs,
                          the manufacturers thereof are freed from the rigors of price control and are
                          entitled to raise and revise the prices of such formulations provided such
                          increases are within the permissible band of 10%. The Court also cannot
                          lose sight of the practical difficulties that may accompany the price of a
                          drug being fixed at Rs. 99.825, Rs. 109.808, Rs. 2698.30, Rs. 2968.13 or
                          Rs. 3591.43. The fixation of such prices would lead to serious
                          impracticalities when evaluated from a consumer&#x27;s point of view.

                          rounding off which is otherwise and generally accepted by the NPPA itself

                           as a well-recognized mathematical practice would be manifestly arbitrary.
                          The respondents have failed to point out any justifiable or rationale basis on
                          account of which the principle of rounding off would not apply to non-
                          scheduled formulations. The Court finds no justification in the stand taken
                          by the respondents who contend that while it would be open for a
                          manufacturer of a scheduled formulation to round off the price of its
                          products, that benefit should be denied to manufacturers of non- scheduled
                          formulations. Once the NPPA had arrived at the conclusion that rounding
                          off was a well-accepted mathematical principle, the Court finds no
                          justification to discriminate between scheduled and non-scheduled
                          formulations and restrict the application of that practice only to the former.
                          The Court deems it pertinent to observe that if the argument as advanced on
                          behalf of the respondents on this score were to be countenanced, it would
                          not only amount to a hostile discrimination between scheduled and non-
                          scheduled formulations, it would additionally and more fundamentally be
                          patently arbitrary. The Court comes to this firm conclusion since the
                          respondents have abjectly failed to indicate any valid or justifiable ground
                          on the basis of which the principle of rounding off which as per the
                          respondents themselves is a well recognised mathematical practice would
                          not apply to non-scheduled formulations. The Court also bears in mind the
                          fact that the applicability of the aforesaid mathematical practice has been
                          accorded due recognition and acceptance by the NPPA itself. That decision
                          taken by the apex regulatory body cannot and should not be construed as
                          being restricted to scheduled formulations alone. It would be manifestly
                          arbitrary and unjust to uphold an allegation of overcharging against
                          manufacturers of non-scheduled formulations where the infraction of Para

<p id="p_185">                          L.    CONCLUSIONS
</p><p id="p_186">                          97.   Having traversed the issues which were raised in this batch, the Court
                          comes to record the following conclusions: -
</p><p id="p_187">                          A.      The 2013 DPCO represents a conscious decision taken by the
                                 Union to leave the price of non-scheduled formulations to be
                                 determined by market forces subject to the rider that the annual
                                 increase would not exceed 10% and in case of overcharging the
                                 manufacturer would have to roll back the prices to the preceding
                                 legally permissible price and preserve it at that level for the next
                                 twelve months.
</p>
<p id="p_188">                          B.     Viewed in that backdrop it is evident that a manufacturer of a non-
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_78">                                 scheduled formulation was entitled to fix the price of its drug
                                 subject to the singular fetter of the same being compliant with the
                                 stipulation of 10% which was sanctioned.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_189">                          C.     Undisputedly, non-scheduled formulations are not subject to the
                                 rigors of price control under the 2013 DPCO. That provision simply
                                 places an obligation upon the Government to monitor and oversee
                                 that the maximum retail price of such formulations does not exceed
                                 10% of the price which was prevailing in the preceding twelve
                                 months. The salutary objective underlying this prescription is
                                 clearly manifest bearing in mind the fact that drug prices must
                                 necessarily be regulated by the Government in order to ensure that
                                 patients and consumers do not face the specter of runaway price
                                 increases and to control profiteering.

                           D.     However, Para 20 undoubtedly permits a manufacturer to increase
                                 the maximum retail price annually subject to the singular limitation
                                 that the price increase would not exceed 10% of the price which
                                 was prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The consequences
                                 of a breach of the aforesaid prescription is also not left open to
                                 speculation with Para 20 in clear and unequivocal terms prescribing
                                 the penalty as well as the remedial measures which must be
                                 adopted.

<p id="p_191">                          E.     Significantly, Para 20 does not envisage a deprivation of the right to

                                 Para 20 spells out and stipulates both the consequences as well as
                                 the penalties which would visit a manufacturer in case it were to
                                 violate its provisions. The stand taken by the respondents to the
                                 effect that the right to seek such increase would stand lost till such
                                 time as the price is revised and brought down, would not only
                                 amount to a recasting of Para 20, it would also and on more
                                 fundamental terms, result in the introduction of a penal
                                 consequence which neither flows from a plain reading of that

<p id="p_203">                          Q.     Para 20 has been worded in a manner which is starkly distinct from
                                 Para 13. Para 20(1) clearly appears to put in place a self-regulatory
                                 mechanism which obligates the manufacturer to ensure that the
                                 price that it fixes for non-scheduled formulations does not exceed
                                 10% of the price prevailing in the preceding twelve months. The

                                 made dependent upon or subject to an order being made by the
                                 NPPA. What places Para 20 in a position distinct from Para 13 of
                                 the 1995 DPCO is that unlike the latter which envisages interest
                                 being leviable from the date when a manufacturer fails to comply
                                 with a demand, the former is not premised on a demand being
                                 raised at all. Under Para 20, the manufacturer becomes liable to
                                 take steps for reparation the moment an event of overcharging
                                 occurs. The trigger event under Para 20 is thus the act of
                                 overcharging itself.
</p>
<p id="p_205">                          S.     Sub Para (2) in clear and unequivocal terms mandates that interest
                                 shall be payable on the overcharged amount from the date of
                                 increase in price. The expression â€•date of increase in priceâ€– must
                                 necessarily be understood to be a categorical reference to the date
                                 or the period from which interest is ordained to be leviable. Para
                                 20(2) thus appears to leave no room for doubt that interest has to be
                                 paid from the date of increase of such price.
</p>
<p id="p_206">                          T.     Para 20 neither contemplates the issuance of a notice nor does it
                                 adopt the principle of amount â€•accruedâ€– as was envisaged under the
                                 1995 DPCO. T.C. Healthcare and all judgments which followed
                                 thereafter were essentially construing the provisions of Para 13 of
                                 the 1995 DPCO. However, the trigger point in terms of Para 20 is
                                 not a notice or a demand but the event of overcharging itself.
                                 Secondly, sub para (2) in unequivocal terms prescribes that the

                                 itself liable to be recognised as one created in terms of an order
