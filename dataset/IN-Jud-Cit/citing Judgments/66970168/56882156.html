A. THE CASES: THE FOUR WRIT PETITIONS


</blockquote><p id="p_4">1.   In this clutch of writ petitions maintained under

<a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_5">Article 32</a> of the Constitution, the Court is called

upon to consider the true effect of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_6">Article 324</a> and,

in particular, <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_7">Article 324(2)</a> of the Constitution. The

said sub-Article reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_2">     “324(2) The Election Commission shall consist
     of the Chief Election Commissioner and such
     number of other Election Commissioners, if any,
     as the President may from time to time fix and
     the   appointment   of   the   Chief   Election
     Commissioner and other Election Commissioners
     shall, subject to the provisions of any law
     made in that behalf by Parliament, be made by
     the President.”


</blockquote><p id="p_5">2.   A Bench of two learned Judges of this Court in Writ

Petition (Civil) No. 104 of 2015, passed the following

Order on 23.10.2018:
</p>
<p id="p_6">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_3">     “I.A. No.2 for amendment of writ petition;
     raising additional facts, grounds and prayer
     is allowed.

<blockquote id="blockquote_4">     The matter relates to what the petitioner
     perceives to be a requirement of having a full-
     proof and better system of appointment of
     members of the Election Commission.</blockquote><p id="p_7">

     require a close look and interpretation of the
     provisions of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_8">Article 324</a> of the Constitution
     of India. The issue has not been debated and
     answered by this Court earlier. <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_9">Article 145
     (3)</a> of the Constitution of India would,
     therefore, require the Court to refer the
     matter   to   a    Constitution   Bench.    We,
     accordingly, refer the question arising in the
     present proceedings to a Constitution Bench for
     an authoritative pronouncement.

<p id="p_9">     Post the matter before the Hon’ble the Chief
     Justice of India on the Administrative Side for
     fixing a date of hearing.”

B. THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONERS; SHRI GOPAL
   SANKARANARAYANAN, LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL IN
   WRIT PETITION (C) NO. 1043 OF 2017
</p><p id="p_21">8.      In Writ Petition No. 1043 of 2017, Shri Gopal

Sankaranarayanan makes the following submissions:

</p><p id="p_22">     There is a lacuna in the matter of appointment

under     <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_11">Article   324.</a>   Of   the    twelve   categories   of

unelected Constitutional Authorities, it is only the

Election Commission and the National Commission for

Scheduled Castes, where qualifications and eligibility

are not laid down in the Constitution or the Statute.

The words ‘subject to law made’ falls into two broad

categories. In the matter of appointments, they are

represented by Articles 324, 338, 338A and 338B. The

other    category   relates     to    conditions   of   service.

Representative of this group are Articles 146, 148, 229

and 243K. In the first category, <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_12">Article 324</a> assumes
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_7">                                                              7</span>
critical importance. Shri Gopal Sankaranarayanan put

forward the test that if a law could be made under

<a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_13">Article 324</a>, providing for a committee to select CECs

and ECs and also for their qualifications, then, there

is a void. If such a law cannot be made, then, there

is no vacuum. Continuing with the argument about the

presence    of    a    vacuum,    it   is   contended       that    the

underlying rationale for the Court intervening must be

the existence of a fundamental norm or a basic feature

that needs to be secured. In this regard, democracy and

the   concomitant      imperative      to   hold    free    and    fair

elections are projected. It is contended that the other

aspect, which must be borne in mind, is to be not

oblivious to the impact of the existence of the vacuum

on the rights of the members of the public, both

directly    and    indirectly.      Like    the     Judiciary,      the

Election         Commission       must       display         fearless

independence. In the absence of norms regarding the

appointment,      a    central    norm,     viz.,       institutional

integrity    is       adversely    affected.       An     independent

appointment mechanism would guarantee eschewing of even

the prospect of bias. Favouritism would be largely

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_8">                                                                     8</span>
reduced. Right to Vote is a Constitutional Right. With

reference    to   law    prevailing   in   other   South   Asian

countries and in the United Kingdom, it is contended

that   clear      qualification,      as   also    eligibility

conditions, have been put in place. Mandatory tenures

are made available. The removal process, which is

uniform, is rigorous. It is contended that there has

been a sudden change after 2001, in the matter of

appointing   Chief      Election Commissioners.     Successive

Governments have decided to select increasingly older

candidates. This has resulted in casting a shadow on

the much-needed independence, apart from curtailing

their tenure. Inaction on the part of the Election

Commission even in the face of alarming increase of

criminals in public life, must guide this Court. With

reference to the Article, which we have adverted to,

it is pointed out that the Election Commission has

indulged in the alleged misconduct and favouritism. A

vigorous appeal is made to the Court to listen to the

constitutional silence and understand the dire need for

the Court to step-in. In this regard, we are reminded

that this Court has played a very proactive role in

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_9">                                                              9</span>
matters relating to elections and electoral reforms.

Interference was noteworthy in matters relating to

affidavits on assets, criminal antecedents, time-bound

election petition trials, special courts for criminal

trials of M.P.s and M.L.A.s, protection from booth

capturing, freebies and NOTA. The executive underreach

justifies      judicial         oversight            and      activism,

particularly when more than 72 years have gone by. It

is    contended    that   no    mandamus        is   sought     against

Parliament or to implement the Gaikwad Law Commission

Report. The following directions are pressed for until

a law is made. A Committee of five, comprising the

Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition or of the

single   largest    party      in   the   Lok    Sabha,      the    Chief

Justice of India, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and an

eminent jurist selected by the first four to recommend

suitable candidates, is to be appointed for appointment

to the Election Commission. The petitioner would have

the    Court   declare      qualifications,           which     include

citizenship of India, and that a person should have

completed between 45 years and 61 years. The further

qualifications      are     that    the    person          should   have

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_10">                                                                      10</span>
impeccable integrity and high moral character. The

individual    must   have    never     had    affiliation   either

directly or indirectly to any political party. It is

also prayed that the person appointed must have been a

Member of the IAS or the IPS or a Judge of the High

Court. In terms of the two provisos in <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_14">Article 324(5</a>),

the Election Commissioners must be irremovable except

after following the procedure in the first proviso. An

independent    Secretariat      must     be    established.    The

expenditure    of    the    Election    Commission    should    be

brought on par with those of the Supreme Court, the CAG

and the UPSC. The expenditure must be made non-votable

expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.



C. SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF SHRI PRASHANT
BHUSHAN,    LEARNED    COUNSEL     ON    BEHALF    OF
PETITIONER IN WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 104 OF 2015.
</p><p id="p_23">9.   An independent Election Commission is necessary

for a functioning democracy as it ensures Rule of Law

reasonable law. The provision for making a law was

rested on the hope that in due course of time, the

Government would exhibit initiative to make such a law

and ensure independence and integrity of the Members

of the Election Commission. It is contended that there

is a vacuum. No power under the constitution can be

exercised contrary to Part III of the Constitution, be

it   the   Executive   or   the   Legislative   power.   The

Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules,

1961 are silent regarding the process of selection and

on the eligibility criteria. The convention invoked by

the Union of India of appointments being made from

Members of the Bureaucracy, is criticised as being not

a healthy convention. It is for the reason that it is

bereft of transparency, objectivity and neutrality.

This system is inaccessible to public. The Executive

alone being involved in the appointment, ensures that

the Commission becomes and remains a partisan Body and

a branch of the Executive. The independence of the

Commission is intimately interlinked with the process

of appointment. The concepts of power of reciprocity

and loyalty to the appointing Body, referred to in

Another vs. Union of India1</a>, is invoked. With reference

to developments said to have taken place recently,

casting     a   shadow   on     the    conduct    of   the    Election

Commission, the Report of Justice Madan B. Lokur is

relied upon. Several instances of inaction or omission

are pointed out. This is apart from various Commissions

and Committees which have highlighted the need for a

change. This Court has stepped-in on many occasions.

It is further contended that the democracy is a facet

of    the   basic    structure        of   the   Constitution.     The

appointment of Members of the Election Commission is

being done on the whims and fancies of the Executive.

The object of having an independent Election Commission

is defeated. It is further contended that the Election

Commission resolves various disputes between various

political parties including the Ruling Government and

other parties. This means that the Executive cannot be

the sole participator. The practice falls foul of

of the Election Commission, it is pointed out that the

power to register a political party under Section 29A

of the Representative of the People Act, 1951, has come

up for our consideration. The ruling of this Court in

<a href="/doc/1158072/" id="a_19">Indian National Congress v. Institute of Social Welfare

and Others</a>,2 that the Election Commission acts in a

quasi-judicial capacity under Section 29A is relied

upon. The Election Commission is clothed under Rules 6

and     8    of     the    Election      Symbols   (Reservation     and

Allotment) Order, 1968 to recognise political parties

and allot symbols. Rule 15 of the said Order is pressed

into service to highlight that Election Commission is

empowered          to    take   a   decision     with   reference    to

splintered and rival groups arising within already

recognized parties. There is power to withdraw and

suspend recognition for breach of duty to follow the

model       code    of    conduct   or    the   instructions   of   the

Commission (See Rule 16A of the Symbol Order). It is

blessed with the power to enforce the model code of

conduct. The Election Commission can, in exercise of

powers under            <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_20">Article 324(1</a>), ban a candidate from

to remove star campaigners. Reliance is placed on the

various Reports, which we will advert to at a later

from the Second Judges case in Supreme Court <a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_21">Advocates-

D. SUBMISSIONS BY SHRI JAYA THAKUR, PETITIONER
IN WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 998 OF 2022
</p><p id="p_24">10. Shri     Anup   G.   Choudary,   learned   Senior   Counsel

assisted by Virender K. Sharma, appeared on behalf of

the petitioner. It is pointed out that there is ad-

hocism flowing from the legislative vacuum. Regional

Commissioners have never been appointed since 1951. The

role of the Election Commission is such that in a modern

election process, it can be abused by simply playing

with   the    election     schedule.    The    instrument   of

instructions which were sought even at the time of

passage of amendments to the original Article can be

filled in by judicial intervention. Appointment is

reduced only to Bureaucrats, that too, majorly IAS

Officers. The IAS Officers work in close alliance to

their political masters. Appointment must be from a

more broad-based pool of talent like Judicial Members.

The Secretariat must have sufficient manpower.

E.   SUBMISSIONS       OF SHRI KALEESWARAM    RAJ,
LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE INTERVENOR in Writ Petition
(Civil) No. 569 of 2021.
</p><p id="p_25">11. Shri     Kaleeswaram       Raj,      learned   Counsel    for   the

intervenor in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 569 of 2021

would contend that the vacuum, which is projected must

be conceded as a democratic space which the Founding

Fathers of the Constitution, left open for the future

Parliament    to    fill-up.        It     is   contended    that   the

Constituent Assembly not being an elected Body in the

real sense, left many things to Parliament, which could

claim better democratic legitimacy. Relying upon the

Judges’ cases, he would submit that a parallel may be

drawn. It’s a glaring instance of legislative inaction.

Since   denial     of   free    and      fair    elections   vitiates

Fundamental      Rights        of     the       citizens,    judicial

intervention is highly necessary. The Right to Vote is

now a part of the Fundamental Right. It is contended

that, in fact, the Right to Vote is a Constitutional

Right. He invites our attention to instances in other

jurisdictions      including        from    neighbouring     countries

like Sri Lanka.

ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE UNION OF INDIA

submissions:
</p>
<p id="p_28">    Accepting       the      petitioners’          contention        would

involve     nothing       less    than     an     amendment     to     the

provisions of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_25">Article 324.</a> The case of the petitioners

is based on various Reports including that of the

Central Law Commission. The premise of the petitioners’

complaint is the failure of the extant mechanism and

the reluctance or failure of the Union of India to

redress the complaint. A vacuum, which is not existent,

is suggested as the very foundation of the petitioners

claim. There is no such vacuum. The learned Attorney

General    would    point       out   that      introduction    of     the

Collegium    or    Body    of    persons     to    select   the      Chief

Election Commissioner or the Election Commissioner,

would     necessitate      the    Court,        trampling     upon     the

constitutional process of aid and advise of Ministers,

contemplated under <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_26">Article 74</a> of the Constitution of

India.    There cannot be merit in the contention that a

tenure of six years must be inexorably guaranteed.

Judicial intervention in these matters would be at the

expense of causing violence to the delicate separation

of powers between the Legislature, the Executive and

the Judiciary. The cases at hand appear to be supported

with reference to an aspirational ideal as against any

vacuum which is disclosed. A debatably better model of

selection   of     the   Commissioner     cannot    form   the

foundation for this Court to make a foray into the

working of constitutional provisions. <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_27">Article 324(2)</a>

contemplates clear procedure for appointment of a Chief

Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners.

Till a law is made, providing otherwise, the Founding

Fathers have laid down that the appointment of the

Chief   Election     Commissioner   and     other    Election

Commissioners shall be by the President. Indisputably,

the Constitution of India follows the Westminster model

of Government. The powers of the President, it is well-

settled, is to be exercised on the advice of the Council

of Ministers. The President is only the formal Head of

the State. The power under <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_28">Article 324(2)</a> was always

understood to be exercised by the President, acting on

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_20">                                                           19</span>
the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers. <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_29">Article

77</a> provides for the conduct of the business of the

Government       of    India.      Rules      have       been   laid    down

thereunder.        The learned Attorney General does not

dispute    that       under    the    Rules,    as       laid   down,     the

appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the

Election Commissioners is               a matter which need not

engage the attention of the Council of Ministers. The

Rules instead provide that it is the Prime Minister,

who is empowered to decide upon the person to be

appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner or the

Election Commissioner. In other words, the President

exercises    the       power    under      <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_30">Article        324(2)</a>    and   he

proceeds    to    appoint      a     person    as    a    Chief    Election

Commissioner or an Election Commissioner, acting on the

advice of the Prime Minister. The contention is, it is

this system, which has been in place for the last more

than seven decades. There is no room for confusion. A

long array of Chief Election Commissioners and the

Election Commissioners have been appointed by resorting

to the legitimate method contemplated under <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_31">Article

324(2).</a> It is further contended that there exists no

identifiable wrong or trigger point to warrant any

judicial interference. It is pointed out that elections

have been held and voting rights ensured to millions

of eligible voters. Nearly 68 per cent polling took

place.    The     Election   Commission    of    India,       it   is

contended, has entered into various agreements under

the auspices of the United Nations under which the

Election Commission of India shares its expertise and

lends    its     competent   services   for     the    conduct     of

elections in various other countries. This is not a

case     where    the   petitioners     have     been    able      to

demonstrate that the independence of the Chief Election

Commissioner or the Election Commissioner is under

threat. The Election Commission is regulated in the

discharge of its functions by law in every manner. The

matters    relating     to   the   appointment    of    the    Chief

Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioner

have been settled by the decision of this Court in <a href="/doc/1890680/" id="a_32">T.N.

Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991

(hereinafter referred to as, ‘the 1991 Act) does not

deal with the process of selection and all the details

that may be connected to it. It is commended to the

Court   as   a   matter     of     fact    that    the   Election

Commissioners have been appointed from the high-ranking

Members of the Civil Services since no Government so

far has thought it fit to provide for any other source

other than the Civil Services for making appointment

and the Parliament has also not intervened. The system

has worked well under <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_33">Article 324(2).</a> Any aberrations

or illegalities in the matter of appointment or acts

or   omissions   on   the   part   of     the   appointees,   lend

themselves to the correctional jurisdiction of the

superior courts under its powers of judicial review.

Section 4 of the 1991 Act does contemplate a six-year

tenure for both the Election Commissioners’ and the

Chief Election Commissioner. Based on the observations

made in T.N. Seshan (supra), Government has followed a

sound practice of appointing Officers from the Civil

Services. It is contended that those who are considered

for appointment, must be           “ripe” enough ‘for being

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_23">                                                               22</span>
inducted into the Election Commission’. The six-year

tenure is an ideal. However, strict adherence to the

same would have introduced considerable problems. This

being the position, the concept of a composite tenure

has been arrived at. In other words, the separate term

of six years, contemplated in Section 4 of the 1991 Act

of    six   years   each,   has       been    understood       as   been

practically attained with the incumbent being selected

and    appointed    in   such     a    manner    that    the     person

appointed as an Election Commissioner can look forward

to an approximate tenure of six years, even though not

as    Election      Commissioner        but     as      an     Election

Commissioner and as a Chief Election Commissioner.

There is a database of serving/retired Officers of the

rank of Secretary to the Government of India/Chief

Secretaries. The appointees are selected from the said

database. The Minister of Law and Justice recommends a

panel for the Prime Minister and the President from the

database. Unless this Court considers non-adherence to

Section 4 of the 1991 Act, as constituting a subversion

of    the   independence    of        the     Election       Commission

requiring redress thereof, this Court need not consider

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_24">                                                                     23</span>
the   ‘aspirational    propositions’       as   a   principle    to

occupy an ‘imagined vacuum’. The Reports relied upon

by the petitioners are based on systems enshrined in

other    jurisdictions.      It   is   significant     that     the

Constituent      Assembly,    though      conscious    of     other

mechanisms, deliberately chose to adopt the method

found in <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_34">Article 324(2).</a> There is no identifiable

wrong.   There    is   no    continuing    wrong    either.     The

decisions,    laying   down    principles,      empowering    this

Court to lay      down guidelines, are inapposite. The

decisions were rendered by this Court in a situation

where there clearly existed a vacuum. It is further

pointed out that the Court was invited and persuaded

to interfere, more importantly, when a Fundamental

Right was found to exist or a right vouch-saved under

an International Treaty. In the present batch of cases,

there is no      Fundamental Right involved, which can

support any interference by this Court. This is apart

from <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_35">Article 324(2)</a> laying down a procedure, signalling

the absence of any vacuum. The proof of the non-

existence of the vacuum is sought to be established by

the fact that several Chief Election Commissioners and

Election Commissioners have been appointed according

to need in the past. A perceived advancement in the

method of appointment, based on the Reports, including

the Law Commission of India, would scarcely furnish the

foundation for doing violence to the provisions of the

Constitution. We are reminded by the learned Attorney

General that this Court is being invited to apply

principles involved in the context of ordinary Statutes

to the interpretation of the Constitution itself. The

same is impermissible.

a lack of statutory enactment and not a constitutional

of Separation of Powers. Reliance is placed on the

judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/166674506/" id="a_40">Samsher Singh v. State of

constitutional         duty      on    the   part    of     Parliament     to

to    contend        that   the       President     is     the    appointing

Authority and that the Chief Election Commissioner

could     not    claim      to   be    equated      with    Supreme     Court

Judges.        The    Doctrine        of   Separation       of    Powers   is

emphasised. Separation of powers, it is pointed out,

is    a   reflection        of     democracy      itself.        The   learned

Solicitor        General      persuades       the    Court       to    exhibit

judicial restraint. A causus omissus may not justify

judicial        interference.          Matters    relating        to   policy

rightfully must remain immune from the judicial radar.

What      is    involved      in      this   case    is    essentially      a

     In the Government of India Act, 1935, and in
     the earlier statues the conduct of elections
     was left to the executive – the Central or
     Provincial Governments, according as election
     to the Central or State Legislature was
     concerned.   In   the   discussions   in   the
     Constituent Assembly, there emerged almost
     from the beginning a consensus of opinion that
     the right to vote should be treated as a
     fundamental right of the citizen and that, in
     order to enable him to exercise this right
     freely, an independent machinery to control
     elections should be set up, free from local
     pressures and political influences.
</p>
<p id="p_36">     There was considerable discussion on these
     issues in the Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee
     and   the   Minorities   Sub-Committee.   K.M.
     Munshi’s draft articles on fundamental rights
     included the following clause:
</p>
<p id="p_37">     Every citizen has the right to choose the
     Government and the legislators of the Union and
     his State on the footing of equality in
     accordance with the law of the Union or the
     unit, as the case may be, in free, secret and
     periodic elections.
</p><p id="p_38">     This clause was considered by the Fundamental
     Rights Sub-Committee at its meeting held on
     March 29, 1947. The sub-committee approved that
     (1) universal adult suffrage must be guaranteed
     by the Constitution;
</p><p id="p_39">     (2) elections should be free, secret and
     periodic; and
     (3) elections   should   be   managed   by   an
     independent commission set up under Union law.


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_29">                                                           28</span>
To give effect to these conclusions, the
following recommendation was drafted for
inclusion in the sub-committee’s report:
(1) Every citizen not below 21 years of age
shall have the right to vote at any election
to the Legislature of the Union and of any unit
thereof,   or,   where   the   Legislature   is
bicameral, to the lower chamber of the
Legislature, subject to such disqualifications
on the ground of mental incapacity, corrupt
practice or crime as may be imposed, and
subject to such qualifications relating to
residence within the appropriate constituency
as may be required by or under the law.
</p><p id="p_40">(2) The law shall provide for free and secret
voting and for periodical elections to the
Legislature.
</p><p id="p_41">(3) The superintendence, direction and control
of all elections to the Legislature, whether
of the Union or of a unit, including the
appointment of Election Tribunals, shall be
vested in an Election Commission for the Union
or the unit, as the case may be, appointed in
all cases in accordance with the law of the
Union.
</p><p id="p_42">There was some difference of opinion about
vesting so much power in the Union in the
matter of Election Commissions. It will be seen
that, in terms of the recommendation made by
the sub-committee, the appointment of all
Election Commissions, irrespective of whether
they were to function in relation to elections
to the Legislature of the Union or in relation
to elections to the Legislature of a unit was
to be regulated by Union law. Some members of
the sub-committee felt that it would be an
infringement of the rights of the units if such
over-riding authority was given to Union law
in matters relating to elections to the
Legislatures of the units. Nevertheless the
recommendation as included in the draft was
adopted by the sub-committee by a majority
vote’.

<p id="p_43"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_30">                                                  29</span>
The Minorities Sub-Committee considered these
provisions at its meeting held on April 17, and
accepted these recommendations. The only point
that arose at the meeting of this Sub-Committee
was raised by Syama Prasad Mukerjee, who
thought   that   the   minorities   should   be
effectively represented in these Election
Commissions. On the other hand Jairamdas
Daulatram did not think it practicable to
provide   for   separate   representation   for
minorities. He suggested that the Election
Commissions should be so constituted that they
would function as impartial bodies and inspire
confidence among all parties and communities.
Accepting this suggestion, the Minorities Sub-
Committee proposed in its report that Election
Commissions should be independent and quasi-
judicial in character.
</p><p id="p_44">The Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights,
Minorities, and Tribal and Excluded Areas
considered this matter at its meetings of April
20 and 21. There was unanimous acceptance of
the principles formulated by the Fundamental
Rights   Sub-Committee.    Discussion   centred
mainly on the question whether the chapter on
fundamental rights was the proper place for
laying down these matters which pertained to
electoral law. C. Rajagopalachari was of the
view that franchise would not ordinarily be a
part of fundamental rights; and P.R. Thakur
pointed out that the proposal not only made
adult franchise compulsory, but also provided
for direct elections, thereby prejudging the
issue of direct elections; he expressed the
view that the Advisory Committee, dealing as
it did with fundamental rights, could not
appropriate the jurisdiction to decide on this
issue. Ambedkar, on the other hand, was clearly
and emphatically of the opinion that adult
franchise and all provision for its free and
fair exercise should be recognized as in the
nature of fundamental rights. He said:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_31">                                                  30</span>
   So far as this committee is concerned, my
   point is that we should support the
   proposition that the committee is in favour
   of adult suffrage. The second thing that we
   have guaranteed in this fundamental right
   is that the elections shall be free and the
   elections shall be by secret voting ... We
   have not said that they shall be direct or
   they shall be indirect. This is a matter
   that may be considered at another stage ...
</p><p id="p_45">   The    third    proposition    which    this
   fundamental clause enunciates is that in
   order that elections may be free in the
   real sense of the world, they shall be taken
   out of the hands of the Government of the
   day, and that they should be conducted by
   an independent body which we may here call
   an Election Commission. We have also given
   permission in sub-clause (3) of this clause
   that each unit may appoint its own
   Commission. The only thing is that the law
   shall be made by the Union. The reason for
   this is that later on there will be a clause
   in the Constitution which will impose an
   obligation upon the Union Government to
   protect   the    Constitution   framed    by
   themselves for the units. Therefore we
   suggested that the Union should have the
   power of making a law, although the
   administration of that law may be left to
   the different units.
</p><p id="p_46">There was unanimous support for the principles
enunciated by Ambedkar but Rajagopalachari
argued that it would not be proper to deal with
this issue as a fundamental right. It could not
be taken for granted, he said, that the Union
Legislature would be elected by the direct vote
of all citizens from all India. He therefore
suggested that these matters relating to
franchise should be dealt with when they arose
in connection with the Constitution and not be
prejudged as fundamental rights. Eventually a
compromise   solution   suggested   by   Govind

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_32">                                                  31</span>
Ballabh Pant was adopted, and it was decided
that these recommendations need not go as part
of the clauses on fundamental rights; but that
in the letter forwarding the report of the
Advisory Committee the Chairman should make it
clear that the committee recommended the
adoption of these proposals.
</p><p id="p_47">In accordance with this decision the Advisory
Committee recommended that, instead of being
included in the chapter of fundamental rights,
the provision regarding the setting up of an
independent Election Commission, along with
the other two proposals regarding adult
franchise and free and fair elections to be
held periodically, should find a place in some
other part of the Constitution.
</p><p id="p_48">In his memorandum on the principles of a model
Provincial Constitution circulated on May 30,
1947, B.N. Rau, the Constitutional Adviser,
included a provision that the superintendence,
direction and control of elections, including
the appointment of election tribunals, should
be vested in the Governor acting in his
discretion, subject to the approval of the
Council of State. Likewise, in the memorandum
on the Union Constitution, circulated on the
same   date,    he   included    a   similarly
comprehensive provision that the control of
central elections, including the appointment
of election tribunals, should be vested in the
President acting in his discretion; the
intention of this provision was to make
available to the President the advice of the
Council of State.
</p><p id="p_49">The Provincial Constitution Committee in its
report of June 27, 1947, accepted the
suggestions in the Constitutional Adviser’s
memorandum but deleted the reference to the
approval of the Council of State. The Union
Constitution   Committee  deleted   all   the
suggestions for the exercise of discretionary
powers by the President and also the proposal

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_33">                                                 32</span>
for a Council of State. The committee however
took a definite step in the direction of a
centralized   authority   in  the   matter   of
elections: according to its recommendations,
all powers of supervision, direction and
control in respect of the federal as well as
provincial elections would be vested in a
Commission to be appointed by the President.
The Union Powers Committee expanded this
proposal by the inclusion in the Federal
Legislative List of the subject “All Federal
elections:   and    Election   Commission    to
superintend, direct and control all Federal and
Provincial elections”.
</p><p id="p_50">The   provisions   suggested  in   the   model
Provincial Constitution came up for discussion
in the Constituent Assembly on July 18, 1947.
The Constitutional Adviser in his Draft
Constitution of October, 1947 provided that the
superintendence, direction and control of all
elections to the Federal parliament and
Provincial    Legislatures    (including    the
appointment of Election Tribunals for the
decision of doubts and disputes in connection
with elections to Parliament and to Provincial
Legislatures) and of all elections to the
offices of President, Vice-President, Governor
and President. The Drafting Committee altered
this scheme and in its draft the power of
appointing   an    Election   Commission    for
supervising elections to the office of Governor
and to the State Legislature was vested in the
Governor. The Drafting Committee expressed the
definite opinion that the Election Commission
for provincial elections should be appointed
by the Governor. This view underwent a radical
change subsequently and on June 15, 1947, when
the article came up for discussion in the
Constituent Assembly, Ambedkar introduced a
new article which made comprehensive provision
for a Central Election Commission to be in
charge of all Central and State elections.”

     recommendation   of   the    Chief   Election
     Commissioner.”


</p><p id="p_59">18. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had this to state inter alia:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_20">     “The House will remember that in a very early
     stage in the proceedings of the Constituent
     Assembly, a Committee was appointed to deal
     with what are called Fundamental Rights. That
     Committee made a report that it should be
     recognised that the independence of the
     elections and the avoidance of any interference
     by the executive in the elections to the
     Legislature should be regarded as a fundamental

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_37">                                                       36</span>
right and provided for in the chapter dealing
with Fundamental Rights. When the matter came
up before the House, it was the wish of the
House that while there was no objection to
regard   this   matter    as   of   fundamental
importance, it should be provided for in some
other part of the Constitution and not in the
Chapter dealing with Fundamental Rights. But
the House affirmed without any kind of dissent
that in the interests of purity and freedom of
elections to the legislative bodies, it was of
the utmost importance that they should be freed
from any kind of interference from the
executive of the day. In pursuance of the
decision of the House, the Drafting Committee
removed this question from the category of
Fundamental Rights and put it in a separate
part containing articles 289, 290 and so on.
</blockquote><p id="p_60">Therefore, so far as the fundamental question
is concerned that the election machinery should
be outside the control of the executive
Government, there has been no dispute. What
<a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_48">article 289</a> does is to carry out that part of
the decision of the Constituent Assembly. It
transfers the superintendence, direction and
control of the preparation of the electoral
rolls and of all elections to Parliament and
the Legislatures of States to a body outside
the executive to be called the Election
Commission. That is the provision contained in
sub-clause (1).
</p><p id="p_61">Sub-clause (2) says that there shall be a Chief
Election Commissioner and such other Election
Commissioners as the President may, from time
to time appoint. There were two alternatives
before the Drafting Committee, namely, either
to have a permanent body consisting of four or
five members of the Election Commission who
would continue in office throughout without any
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_38">                                                  37</span>
break, or to permit the President to have an ad
hoc body appointed at the time when there is
an election on the anvil. The Committee, has
steered a middle course. What the Drafting
Committee proposes by sub-clause (2) is to have
permanently in office one man called the Chief
Election Commissioner, so that the skeleton
machinery would always be available. Election
no doubt will generally take place at the end
of five years; but there is this question,
namely that a bye-election may take place at
any time. The Assembly may be dissolved before
its period of five years has expired.
</p><p id="p_62">Consequently, the electoral rolls will have to
be kept up to date all the time so that the
new election may take place without any
difficulty. It was therefore felt that having
regard to these exigencies, it would be
sufficient if there was permanently in session
one officer to be called the Chief Election
Commissioner, while when the elections are
coming up, the President may further add to the
machinery by appointing other members to the
Election Commission.
</p><p id="p_63">Now, Sir, the original proposal under <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_49">article
289</a> was that there should be one Commission to
deal with the elections to the Central
Legislature, both the Upper and the Lower
House, and that there should be a separate
Election Commission for each province and each
State, to be appointed by the Governor or the
Ruler of the State. Comparing that with the
present <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_50">article 289</a>, there is undoubtedly, a
radical change. This article proposes to
centralize the election machinery in the hands
of a single Commission to be assisted by
regional Commissioners, not working under the
provincial Government, but working under the
superintendence and control of the central
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_39">                                                  38</span>
     Election Commission. As I said, this is
     undoubtedly a radical change. But, this change
     has become necessary because today we find that
     in some of the provinces of India, the
     population is a mixture…”
                                   (Emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_64">19. Professor Shibban Lal Saksena gave notice of an

amendment to the amendment to <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_51">Article 289</a> which, inter

alia, stated that after the word ‘appoint’ in clause

(2), the words “subject to confirmation by two-third

majority in a joint session of both the Houses of

Parliament” be inserted. He also        proposed that in

clause (4), the words “Parliament may by law determine”

be substituted for the words “President may by rule

determine”.   There   were    certain   other   amendments

proposed by Prof. Saksena. Prof. Saksena further went

on to make the following statement:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_21">     “..Of course it shall be completely independent
     of the provincial Executives but if the
     President is to appoint this Commission,
     naturally it means that the Prime Minister
     appoints this Commission. He will appoint the
     other    Election    Commissioners    on    his
     recommendations. Now this does not ensure their
     independence…”
        Xxx                  xxx                xxx
         “So what I want is this that even the person
     who is appointed originally should be such that
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_40">                                                         39</span>
     he should be enjoying the confidence of all
     parties—his appointment should be confirmed
     not only by majority but by two-thirds majority
     of both the Houses. If it is only a bare
     majority, then the party in power could vote
     confidence in him but when I want 2/3rd
     majority it means that the other parties must
     also concur in the appointment so that in order
     that real independence of the Commission may
     be guaranteed, in order that everyone even in
     opposition may not have anything to say against
     the Commission, the appointments of the
     Commissioners    and    the   Chief    Election
     Commissioner must be by the President but the
     names proposed by him should be such as command
     the confidence of two-thirds majority of both
     the Houses of Legislatures.”
             xxx          xxx           xxx
          “I want that in future, no Prime Minister
     may abuse this right, and for this I want to
     provide that there should be two-thirds
     majority which should approve the nomination
     by the President. Of course there is danger
     where one party is in a huge majority. As I
     said just now it is quite possible that if our
     Prime Minister wants, he can have a man of his
     own party, but I am sure he will not do it.
     Still if he does appoint a party-man, and the
     appointment comes up for confirmation in a
     joint session, even a small opposition or even
     a few independent members can down the Prime
     Minister before the bar of public opinion in
     the world. Because we are in a majority we can
     have anything passed only theoretically. So the
     need for confirmation will invariably ensure a
     proper choice.”

</p><p id="p_67">21. Pandit Hirday Nath Kunzru addressed the following

concerns and suggested as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_22">     “Here two things are noticeable: the first is
     that it is only the Chief Election Commissioner
     that can feel that he can discharge his duties
     without the slightest fear of incurring the
     displeasure of the executive, and the second
     is that the removal of the other Election
     Commissioners      will    depend      on     the
     recommendations of one man only, namely the
     Chief     Election     Commissioner.      However
     responsible he may be, it seems to me very
     undesirable that the removal of his colleagues
     who will occupy positions as responsible as
     those of judges of the Supreme Court should
     depend on the opinion of one man. We are
     anxious, Sir, that the preparation of the
     electoral rolls and the conduct of elections
     should be entrusted to people who are free from
     political bias and whose impartially can be
     relied upon in all circumstances. But, by
     leaving a great deal of power in the hands of
     the President we have given room for the
     exercise   of   political    influence   in   the
     appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner
     and the other Election Commissioners and
     officers by the Central Government. The Chief
     Election   Commissioners    will   have   to be

     appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister,
     and, if the Prime Minister suggests the
     appointment of a party-man the President will
     have no option but to accept the Prime
     Minister&#x27;s nominee, however unsuitable he may
     be on public grounds. (Interruption). Somebody
     asked me suitable why it should be so.”

     “My remedy for the defects that I have pointed
     out is that Parliament should be authorised to
     make provision for these matters by law. Again,
     Sir, this article does not lay down the
     qualifications of persons who are chosen as
     Chief Election Commissioners or as Election
     Commissioners. And, as I have already pointed
     out, in the matter of removal, the Election
     Commissioners are not on the same footing as
     the Chief Election Commissioner.”

</blockquote><p id="p_68">22. Shri K.M. Munshi expressed the following views:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_23">     “Between two elections, normally there would
     be a period of five years. We cannot have an
     Election Commission sitting all the time during
     those five years doing nothing. The Chief
     Election Commissioner will continue to be a
     whole-time officer performing the duties of his
     office and looking after the work from day to
     day, but when major elections take place in the
     country, either Provincial or Central, the
     Commission must be enlarged to cope with the
     work. More members therefore have to be added
     to the Commission. They are no doubt to be
     appointed by the President, but as the House
     will find, they are to be appointed from time
     to time. Once they are appointed for a
     particular period they are not removable at the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_43">                                                       42</span>
will of the President. Therefore, to that
extent their independence is ensured. So there
is no reason to believe that these temporary
Election Commissioners will not have the
necessary measure of independence. Any way the
Chief Election Commissioner an independent
officer, will be the Chairman and being a
permanent   officer    will   have    naturally
directing and supervising power over the whole
Commission. Therefore, it is not correct to say
that independence of the Commission is taken
away to any extent.
</blockquote><p id="p_69">We must remember one thing, that after all an
election department is not like a judiciary, a
quasi-independent organ of Government. It is
the duty and the function of the Government of
the day to hold the elections. The huge
electorates which we are putting up now, the
voting list which will run into several crores—
all these must necessarily require a large army
of election officers, of clerks, of persons to
control the booths and all the rest of them.
Now all this army cannot be set up as a
machinery independent of Government. It can
only be provided by the Central Government, by
the Provincial Government or by the local
authorities as now. It is not possible nor
advisable to have a kingdom within a kingdom,
so that the election matters could be left to
an   entirely   independent    organ   of   the
Government. A machinery, so independent,
cannot be allowed to sit as a kind of Super-
Government to decide which Government shall
come into power. There will be great political
danger if the Election Tribunal becomes such a
political power in the country. Not only it
should preserve its independence, but it must
retain impartiality. Therefore, the Election
Commission must remain to a large extent an
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_44">                                                  43</span>
     ally of the Government; not only that, but it
     must, a considerable extent, be subsidiary to
     Government except in regard to the discharge
     of the functions allotted to it by law.

<p id="p_70">
    “Therefore, the Parliament as well as the State
    Legislatures are free to make all provisions
    with regard to election, subject, of course, to
    this   particular   amendment,    namely,   the
    superintendence, direction and control of the
    Election tribunal.   Today, for instance, the
    elections re controlled by officers appointed
    either by the Center or the Provinces as the
    case may be. What is now intended is that they
    should not be subjected to the day-to-day
    influence of the Government nor should they be
    completely independent of Government, and
    therefore a sort of compromise has been made
    between the two positions; but I agree with my
    honourable Friend, Pandit Kunzru that for the
    sake of clarity, at any rate, to allay any
    doubts clause (2) requires a little amendment.
    At the beginning of clause (2) the following
    words may be added; “subject to the provisions
    of law made in this behalf by Parliament.”

</p><p id="p_71">23. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar made the following remarks:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_24">     “Now with regard to the question of appointment
     I must confess that there is a great deal of
     force in what my Friend Professor Saksena said
     that there is no use making the tenure of the
     Election Commissioner a fixed and secure tenure
     if there is no provision in the Constitution
     to prevent either a fool or a knave or a person
     who is likely to be under the thumb of the
     Executive. My provision—I must admit-—does not
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_45">                                                       44</span>
contain anything to provide against nomination
of an unfit person to the post of the Chief
Election Commissioner or the other Election
Commissioners. I do want to confess that this
is a very important question and it has given
me a great deal of headache and I have no doubt
about it that it is going to give this House a
great deal of headache. In the U.S.A. they have
solved this question by the provision contained
in <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_54">article 2</a> Section (2) of their Constitution
whereby   certain   appointments    which   are
specified in Section (2) of <a href="/doc/1456610/" id="a_55">article 2</a> cannot
be   made   by  the   President   without   the
concurrence of the Senate; so that so far as
the power of appointment is concerned, although
it is vested in the President it is subject to
a check by the Senate so that the Senate may,
at the time when any particular name is
proposed, make enquiries and satisfy itself
that the person proposed is a proper person.
</blockquote><p id="p_72">But it must also be realised that that is a
very dilatory process, a very difficult
process. Parliament may not be meeting at the
time when the appointment is made and the
appointment must be made at once without
waiting. Secondly, the American practice is
likely and in fact does introduce political
considerations in the making of appointments.
Consequently, while I think that the provisions
contained in the American Constitution is a
very salutary check upon the extravagance of
the President in making his appointments, it
is    likely    to     create    administrative
difficulties and I am therefore hesitating
whether I should at a later stage recommend the
adoption of the American provisions in our
Constitution. The Drafting Committee had paid
considerable   attention    to  this   question
because as I said it is going, to be one of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_46">                                                  45</span>
     our greatest headaches and as a via media it
     was thought that if this Assembly would give
     or enact what is called an Instrument of
     Instructions to the President and provide
     therein some machinery which it would be
     obligatory on the President to consult before
     making    any    appointment,  I    think   the
     difficulties which are felt as resulting from
     the American Constitution may be obviated and
     the advantage which is contained therein may
     be secured. At this stage it is impossible for
     me to see or anticipate what attitude this
     House will take when the particular draft
     Instructions come before the House. If the
     House rejects the proposal of the Drafting
     Committee that there should be an Instrument
     of Instructions to the President which might
     include, among other things, a provision with
     regard to the making of appointments, this
     problem would then be solved by that method.
     But, as I said, it is quite difficult for me
     to anticipate what may happen. Therefore in
     order to meet the criticism of my honourable
     Friend Professor Saksena, supported by the
     criticism of my honourable Friend Pandit
     Kunzru, I am prepared to make certain
     amendments in amendment No. 99. I am sorry I
     did   not   have    time  to  circulate   these
     amendments, but when I read them the House will
     know what I am proposing.”

</blockquote><p id="p_77">27. The Constituent Assembly of India can proximately

be traced to the deliberations of the cabinet mission.

The broad features were as follows. The members of the

constituent assembly were to be elected not on the

basis of adult suffrage. At the time, i.e., in 1946,

India was still under British rule. British India

broadly consisted of the Governors provinces and the

Chief Commissioner’s provinces. There were also a large

number of princely states. An interim government, no

doubt, based on elections, was put in place. There were

also at the same time, provincial legislative bodies.

The members of the Constituent Assembly came to be

elected by the members of the provincial assemblies and

they were not directly elected by the people of the

country as such. Shri Kaleeswaram Raj is, therefore,

correct that the Constituent Assembly was not directly

elected by the people. There were changes which were

necessitated by the partition. Suffice it to note that

there were 238 members representing the Governors and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_49">                                                      48</span>
others   provinces.     This    is   besides   89   sent    by   the

princely states. The first meeting of the Assembly was

held on 9th December, 1946. One Shri B.N. Rau was

appointed as the constitutional advisor. He made a

draft constitution. A drafting committee, drawn from

the members of the constituent assembly in turn with

the help of the Secretariat as well, brought out two

drafts further, which in turn, were published. Public

discussion ensued. Thereafter, the draft articles were

discussed   in    the   constituent     assembly.    There       were

further amendments. It is to be noticed also that the

humongous task necessarily led to the                creation of

several committees. The most prominent of them can be

perceived   as    the   drafting     committee,     the    advisory

committee and various sub-committees which included the

sub-committee on fundamental rights.



K. THE USE OF CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY DEBATES
</p><p id="p_78">28.   In regard to the use of Constituent Assembly

debates, the law has not stood still. At any rate,

whatever    may   be    the    controversy,    as   regards      its

employment to discern, the purport of a provision there

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_50">                                                                  49</span>
can be no taboo involved in its use to understand the

history of a provision under the Constitution and the

various    steps     leading   up    to    and   accompanying     its

enactment.    In     this   regard,       we   may   refer   to   the

following view expressed in <a href="/doc/257876/" id="a_59">His Holiness Kesavananda

Bharati Sripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala and Another10</a>:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_26">       “1598. If the debates in the Constituent

       attending its enactment, to ascertain the
       intention of the makers of the Constitution,
       it is difficult to see why the debates are
       inadmissible to throw light on the purpose and
       general intent of the provision. After all,
       legislative history only tends to reveal the
       legislative purpose in enacting the provision
       and thereby sheds light upon legislative
       intent. It would be drawing an invisible
       distinction if resort to debates is permitted
       simply to show the legislative history and the

L.  CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES
INCLUDING THE LIGHT SHED BY THE CONSTITUENT
ASSEMBLY DEBATES
</p><p id="p_81">30.     The   members    of   the   Constituent     Assembly       were

undoubtedly      concerned      over      the    need     to     ensure

independence of the Election Commission. Under the

Government of India Act, 1935, the earlier law, it was

the Executive which was conferred the power to conduct

the election. Initially, there was a consensus of

opinion, in fact, that the right to vote was to be made

a fundamental right. In fact, in the draft Article by

Shri K.M. Munshi, he contemplated providing for right

to choose for every citizen and a free secret and

periodic      election.       The   Fundamental         Rights    Sub-

Committee also approved that there must be universal

adult franchise guaranteed by the Constitution. The

election was to be free, secret and periodic. Most

importantly, the Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee in


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_53">11</span>
     (2021) 8 SCC 1
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_54">                                                                    51</span>
the meeting held on 29.03.1947 contemplated that an

independent Commission must be set up under Union law.

A recommendation providing for an Election Commission

being appointed in all cases with the law of the Union

was made. Further, it becomes clear from a perusal of

the work ‘Framing of India’s Constitution’ by B. Shiva

Rao that some disputes arose relating to so much power

being    conferred         on     the    Union     in   the   matter    of

elections. The dispute essentially related to clothing

the Commission with power                   to conduct     elections in

regard to the State Legislatures, besides the Union

Legislature. The Minority Sub-Committee also made a

report       that    the         Election     Commission      should    be

independent         and    quasi-judicial          in   character.     The

Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights, Minority,

Tribal and Excluded Area also accepted the principles

formulated by the Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee.

However,       the        view     was      expressed    by    Shri     C.

Rajagopalachari that the right to vote should not be a

part    of    fundamental         right.     Dr.   Ambedkar,    however,

specifically opined that in order that election may be

free in the real sense of the word, they shall be taken

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_55">                                                                       52</span>
out of the hands of the government of the day, and be

conducted by the independent body called the Election

Commission.       Shri      C.     Rajagopalachari,        however,

persevered with the theme that the matter relating to

franchise may not find itself among the provisions

providing for Fundamental Rights.              Shri Govind Vallabh

Pant suggested a compromise and the Advisory Committee

thereby recommended that instead of being included in

the   Chapter     on    Fundamental      Rights,   the   provisions

relating to franchise and to an independent Election

Commission should be located in another part of the

Constitution.          In his work, the Framing of India’s

Constitution, by B. Shivarao has not minced words by

commenting that by leaving a great deal of power in the

hands of the President, it gave room for exercising

political influence in the appointment of the Election

Commissioner and other election commissioners.                  The

remedy, it was found, which was contemplated was, that

the Parliament would make a law to regulate the matter.

As    we   have   noticed,       there   was   severe    criticism,

particularly by Shri Kunzuru and Professor Shiben Lal

Saxena, and it was thereupon, that Shri K.M. Munshi

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_56">                                                                53</span>
while supporting Ambedkar’s amendment to the original

article, recommended that the appointment be subject

to the law made by the Parliament. It is on this

fundamental basis that the amendment which was proposed

by Dr. Ambedkar to the original article was adopted.

</p><p id="p_82">31. Professor     Saxena   was   emphatic    that   the   draft

amended <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_60">Article 289</a>, which contemplated appointment

being made by the President, without anything more,

would necessarily mean that the Prime Minister would

end up appointing the Commission. He warned that it

would not ensure their independence. He was clear that

in future, no Prime Minister should abuse the right to

appoint.   Shri    H.V.    Pataskar   felt   <a href="/doc/808995/" id="a_61">Article      289(2)</a>

sufficed. The thought which comforted the Member was

not merely some official of the Government could be

appointed as Election Commissioners but people in the

position of High Court Judges. Pandit Hirday Nath

Kunzru clearly articulated the anxiety and the need for

the preparation of the electoral roll and the conduct

of the elections, being entrusted to people, who were

free from political bias and whose impartiality could

be relied upon ‘in all circumstances’. The plight of

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_57">                                                             54</span>
the President, who has to act on the advice of the

Prime Minister, was highlighted. It was the learned

Member, who suggested the remedy for the defect, that

is that the Parliament should be authorised to make

provisions for these matters, by law. This was also the

view of the Sub-Committee on Fundamental Rights. Shri

K.   M.    Munshi,     took   the   view   that   the   Election

Commission must remain to a large extent an ally of the

Government. The pursuit of independence of the Election

Commission, he felt, should not result in there arising

‘a kingdom within a kingdom’. It was not to be a quasi-

independent organ of the Government. This is on the

basis that the Election Commission would necessarily

have to rely upon Officers, who would have to be

provided    by   the    Government.   Finally,     we   find   Dr.

Ambedkar acknowledging the existence of a great deal

of merit in the fear that guaranteeing a fixed and

secured tenure, was of no use, if there was no provision

in the Constitution, which would stand in the way of

either an incompetent or unfair official, becoming and

running the Election Commission. In particular, Dr.

Ambedkar     foresaw      the   danger     of     the   Election

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_58">                                                               55</span>
Commissioners, being persons who were likely to be

under the control of the Executive. The provision, as

proposed to be amended by Dr. Ambedkar, it was admitted

by Dr. Ambedkar himself, did not provide against an

‘unfit’     person    being   appointed    to    the    Election

Commission. Thereafter, he predicted that the question

will emerge as one of the greatest headaches. He found

solace in the prospect of an instrument of instructions

being issued to the President, which would guide the

President in the matter of appointment to the Election.

Noticing the uncertainty about the prospect, however,

it was and to allay the apprehensions voiced by both

Professor    Saxena    and    Pandit   Kunzru,   that    <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_62">Article

324(2</a>), as it presently obtains, came to be proposed

by way of the amendment to the amendment of the original

Article. In other words, before the words ‘be made by

the President’, the words ‘subject to provisions of any

law made in this behalf by Parliament’. came to be

inserted.

and, finally, of the Constituent Assembly itself, to

be as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_84">      A golden thread runs through these proceedings.

      All   the    Members         were     of   the     clear    view   that

election      must       be        conducted       by     an     independent

Commission. It was a radical departure from the regime

prevailing under the Government of India Act, 1935. The

Members     very       well    understood          that    providing      for

appointment of Members of the Election Commission by

the President would mean that the President would be

bound to appoint the Election Commissioner solely on

the advice of the Executive, which, in a sense, was

understood as on the advice of the Prime Minister. The

model of appointment prevailing in the United States

was deliberated and not approved. Though, Shri K. M.

Munshi      was    not        in        favour     of    giving     complete

independence to the Election Commission and felt that

it should be an ally of the Government, it clearly did

not represent the views of the predominant majority of

the   Members.         Right       to    Vote    was,     to    begin    with,

considered        so    sacrosanct          that    it    was     originally


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_60">                                                                           57</span>
contemplated as a Fundamental Right. However, finally,

as     we    have       already   noticed,      it   was    found     more

appropriate that it should be contained in a separate

part    of       the    Constitution,      which     is    the    position

obtaining under the Constitution. It is equally clear

that the Members of the Committees, including the

Constituent Assembly, wanted the appointment to the

Election Commission not to be made by the Executive.

The     uncertain          prospect        of   an    instrument        of

instructions, finally led the Assembly to adopt the

amendment suggested by Dr. Ambedkar, which, as we have

noticed, was initially the suggestion made by Pandit

Kunzru, and what is more, even seconded by Shri K. M.

Munshi. In short, what the Founding Fathers clearly

contemplated and intended was, that Parliament would

step-in and provide norms, which would                       govern the

appointment to such a uniquely important post as the

post of Chief Election Commissioner and the Election

Commissioners. In this regard, we notice the final

words       of    Dr.    Ambedkar     in    regard    to    the     debate

surrounding <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_63">Article 324</a>, was that he felt sorry that

he did not have time to circulate the amendments.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_61">                                                                       58</span>
</p><p id="p_85">33. It is important that we understand that when the

Founding    Fathers,     therefore,     inserted   the       words

‘subject to the provisions of any law to be made by

Parliament’, it was intended that Parliament would make

a law. While we would not go, so far as to hold that

Parliament was under a compellable duty, which this

Court can enforce by a Mandamus, to make a law, all

that we are finding is that the Constituent Assembly

clearly intended that Parliament must make a law within

the meaning of <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_64">Article 324(2).</a> Such an understanding

of   <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_65">Article    324(2)</a>   may   be   contrasted   with    similar

provisions in the Constitution, which also contemplated

enabling the making of law by Parliament. This brings

us to the question relating to an evaluation of similar

provisions in the Constitution.

Supreme   Court   and   the   members   of   the   Election

Commission. There is no safeguard provided against the

removal as is     contemplated for the Chief Election

Commissioner and Election Commissioners. <a href="/doc/1422498/" id="a_83">Article 148</a>

</p><p id="p_96">41. As far as the appointment of the Comptroller and

Auditor General is concerned, it is governed by <a href="/doc/376795/" id="a_84">Article

148(1)</a> and the Founding Fathers have provided beyond

the pale of any doubt that the appointment of the

Comptroller   and    Auditor   General,    vital       and

indispensable as he is for the affairs of the nation,

his appointment is to be made by the President. The

safeguard, however, considered suitable to ensure his

independence has been declared by providing that the

CAG can be removed only in like manner and on like

grounds as a Judge of the Supreme Court. In stark

contrast, <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_85">Article 324(2)</a> has, while it has provided for

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_67">                                                       64</span>
the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and

the Election Commissioners by the President, it has

been made subject to a law to be made by the Parliament.

No such provision is provided in <a href="/doc/376795/" id="a_86">Article 148(1).</a> We

cannot be oblivious to the fact that this is apart from

providing for the safeguard in the first proviso to

<a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_87">Article 324(5)</a> that the Chief Election Commissioner

shall not be removed except in like manner and like

grounds as a Judge of Supreme Court of India. Still

further,    there   is   a   third   distinguishing    feature

between the Chief Election Commissioner and the CAG

again located in the first proviso to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_88">Article 324(5).</a>

It is declared that the conditions of service of the

Chief Election Commissioner shall not be varied to his

disadvantage after his appointment. The Chief Election

Commissioner and Election Commissioners stand on a far

higher pedestal in the constitutional scheme of things

having regard to the relationship between their powers,

functions    and    duties   and     the   upholding   of   the

democratic way of life of the nation, the upkeep of

Rule of Law and the very immutable infusion of life

into the grand guarantee of equality under <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_89">Article 14.</a>

comparison between the Chief Election Commissioner and

the Election Commissioners contemplated under <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_93">Article

The very fact that Officers covered by <a href="/doc/303447/" id="a_94">Article 229(2)</a>

are not extended any protection against removal, itself

not merely furnishes a significant starting point but

may itself be conclusive of the dissimilarity between

insulated the State Election Commissioner by providing

appointment of the Election Commissioners, which was

clearly in the contemplation of the Founding Fathers

that no law has been made. The old regime continues.

State for the purpose of the Constitution and after

declaring it to be ‘any State’ other than India, makes

it, subject to a proviso, which declares that subject

to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the

President may, by order, declare any State not to be a

foreign State for such purposes, as may be specified

in the Order. The matter is governed fully by the

Constitution (Declaration as to Foreign States) Order,

1950. Apart from the apparent absence of any imperative

need for a law, the matter is governed by an Order,

which is issued under the Constitution, which itself

would be of a statutory nature and also issued under

an enabling provision of the Constitution itself.

   ELECTION COMMISSIONERS AND THE ELECTION
   COMMISSIONERS WHO WERE APPOINTED AND THEIR
   TERMS
</p><p id="p_106">50. In the year 1951, Shri Sukumar Sen was appointed

as the first Chief Election Commissioner of India. He

was a Civil Servant and a former Chief Secretary of the

State of West-Bengal. His term was to last for eight

years and two hundred and seventy-three days. Shri

Kalyan      Sundaram,     the      second     Chief         Election

Commissioner, again a Civil Servant, the first Law

Secretary    and    who   also     chaired    the        Indian   Law

Commission    for   the   period   from     1968    to    1971,   was

appointed as Chief Election Commissioner on 20.12.1958

and his term terminated on 30.09.1967. It is noteworthy

that his term also lasted eight years and two hundred

and eighty-four days.

Commissioner and he was appointed on 01.10.1967 and he

continued till 30.09.1972 (his term lasted for five

years). Shri Nagendra Singh, a Civil Servant and a

Member of the Constituent Assembly and who, later on,

became the Judge of the International Court of Justice,

had   a   short   tenure    as   the   fourth     Chief   Election

Commissioner from 01.10.1972 to 06.02.1973 (his term

lasted for one hundred and twenty-eight days). The

fifth     Chief      Election    Commissioner     was     Shri   T.

become a Cabinet Secretary as well and his stint as

Chief Election Commissioner was from 07.02.1973 to

term commenced on 18.06.1977 and expired on 17.06.1982

(his term lasted for four years and three hundred and

sixty-four days). Shri R. K. Trivedi, the Seventh Chief

Election Commissioner, was also a Civil Servant, and

he had a term of three years and one hundred and ninety-

six days. Shri R.V.S. Perishastri was the Eighth Chief

Election    Commissioner.   He    was   the   Secretary   to

Government and his term lasted from 01.01.1986 till

25.11.1990. It was for the first time that Election

Commissioners, two in number, viz., Shri V. S. Seigell

and Shri S. S. Dhanoa came to be appointed as Election

Commissioners on 16.10.1989. However, as we shall see

in greater detail, the Notification dated 16.10.1989

came to be rescinded on 01.01.1990. The same came to

be challenged by Shri S.S. Dhanao and it culminated in

the Judgment of this Court reported in <a href="/doc/852842/" id="a_124">S.S. Dhanoa v.

Union of India and Others12</a>. A Committee known as the

Goswami Committee, made certain recommendations. On its

heels, Parliament passed an Act titled          ‘The Chief

(Conditions of Service) Act, 1991 (hereinafter referred

to as, ‘the 1991 Act’). It is noteworthy that this is

the law made by Parliament and relatable to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_125">Article

324(5</a>), which contemplated a law made by Parliament

regulating conditions of service of the Chief Election

Commissioner and the Election Commissioners. Smt. V.S.

Ramadevi, who had the shortest tenure as the ninth

Chief Election Commissioner was drawn from the Civil

Services. Her term lasted for sixteen days. The Tenth

Chief Election Commissioner was none other than Shri

T. N. Sheshan, who was the Eighteenth Cabinet Secretary

of India and had a term of six years commencing from

12.12.1990 till 11.12.1996. The 1991 Act came to be

amended, initially, by an Ordinance, and later, by a

law made by Parliament, the Ordinance being published

on   01.10.1993.   Shri   M.S.   Gill   and        Shri     G.V.G.

Krishnamurthy      were     appointed         as          Election

Commissioners, w.e.f., 01.10.1993. The amendment and

the appointments came to be challenged by Shri T. N.

Seshan, the Chief Election Commissioner and others and

the challenge was repelled by a Constitution Bench of

this Court and the Judgment is reported in T.N. Seshan,

(supra). We would observe that what was essentially

contemplated       by   founding     Fathers         was   an    Election

Commission, which was to consist of a permanent figure,

viz., the Chief Election Commissioner and such Election

Commissioners, as may be necessary. For nearly forty

years after the adoption of the Constitution of India,

there were only Chief Election Commissioners. After the

Judgment in T.N. Seshan (supra), it will be noticed

that    thereafter,       the   Election      Commission        of    India

became    a   team      consisting      of     the    Chief      Election

Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners. With

the    term   of   Shri    T.   N.   Seshan     coming      to       an   end

11.12.1996, the trend began of appointing the Election

Commissioners as Chief Election Commissioners. Thus,

Shri M.S. Gill became the Chief Election Commissioner.

Shri M.S. Gill was also a Civil Servant. He served as

Chief Election Commissioner for a period of four years

and    sixty-nine       days,   i.e.,        from    12.12.1996           till

13.06.2001. Shri G.V.G. Krishnamurthy continued till

30.09.1999 (nearly six years) as Election Commissioner.

Shri     James     Michael      Lyngdoh       became       an    Election

Commissioner in the year 1997 and was made the Chief

the term of Shri M.S. Gill, and he continued till

O.  A CLOSER LOOK AT S.S. DANOA (SUPRA), THE 1991
ACT AND T.N. SESHAN (SUPRA)
</p><p id="p_118">53.   It   was   on   07.10.1989   that   the   President,   in

exercise of his powers under Clause 2 of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_126">Article 324</a>


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_91">                                                             78</span>
of the Constitution, fixed            the number       of Election

Commissioners    as     two.   This   was   to    continue      until

further orders. Later on, on 16.10.1989, two persons

of which, one was Shri S.S. Dhanoa, were appointed as

the Election Commissioners. It was for the first time

after Independence that Election Commissioners were

appointed, thereby making the Election Commission of

India a multi-Member Commission. In other words, till

16.10.1989,      the       Chief      Election         Commissioner

constituted    the    Election     Commission     of    India.       The

multi-Member Commission was, however, a short-lived

affair. In less than three months’ time, on 01.01.1990,

exercising power under <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_127">Article 324(2</a>), the President

notified, with immediate effect, the rescinding of the

Notification dated 07.10.1989, by which Notification,

the   two   posts     of   Election    Commissioner       had    been

created.      Another       Notification         rescinding          the

Notification    dated      16.10.1989,      by    which   the        two

Election    Commissioners      were   appointed,       came     to   be

issued. The latter Notifications came to be challenged

by Shri S.S. Dhanoa before this Court. A Bench of two

learned Judges dismissed the Writ Petition. This Court

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_92">                                                                     79</span>
took the view, inter alia, that the framers of the

Constitution did not want to give same status to the

Election Commissioners as was conferred on the Chief

Election Commissioner. In the course of this Judgment

in <a href="/doc/852842/" id="a_128">S.S. Dhanoa v. Union of India</a> and others13, this

Court, inter alia, observed as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_33">       “17. … There is no doubt that there is an
       important distinction between the Council of
       Ministers and the Election Commission in that
       whereas the Prime Minister or the Chief
       Minister is appointed by the President or the
       Governor and the other Ministers are appointed
       by the President or the Governor on the advice
       of the Prime Minister or the Chief Minister,
       the appointment of both the Chief Election
       Commissioner    and    the    other    Election
       Commissioners as the law stands today, is made
       by the President under <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_129">Article 324(2)</a> of the
       Constitution. It has, however, to be noted that
       the provisions of the said article have left
       the matter of appointment of the Chief Election
       Commissioner    and    the    other    Election
       Commissioners to be regulated by a law to be
       made by the Parliament, and the President
       exercises the power of appointing them today
       because of the absence of such law which has
       yet to be made. …”

Thereafter, the Court went on to find that there was

really   no   need   to   have   appointed   the   Election

Commissioners and, still further made the following

observations:
</p>
<p id="p_121">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_34">     “26. There is no doubt that two heads are
     better than one, and particularly when an
     institution like the Election Commission is
     entrusted with vital functions, and is armed
     with exclusive uncontrolled powers to execute
     them, it is both necessary and desirable that
     the powers are not exercised by one individual,
     however, all-wise he may be. It ill conforms
     the tenets of the democratic rule. It is true
     that the independence of an institution depends
     upon the persons who man it and not on their
     number. A single individual may sometimes prove
     capable of withstanding all the pulls and
     pressures, which many may not. However, when
     vast powers are exercised by an institution
     which is accountable to none, it is politic to
     entrust its affairs to more hands than one. It
     helps to assure judiciousness and want of
     arbitrariness. The fact, however, remains that
     where more individuals than one, man an
     institution, their roles have to be clearly
     defined, if the functioning of the institution
     is not to come to a naught.”

</blockquote><p id="p_122">55. The Court found that it was not a case of removal

of the Election Commissioners within the meaning of the

second proviso to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_130">Article 324(5).</a>

<p id="p_123">56. This led to certain changes in the 1991 Act. The

changes were introduced through an Ordinance published

provided for a new Chapter III, which contemplates that

as far as possible, all business shall be transacted

unanimously (Section 10(2) of the 1991 Act). Section

10(3) provides that subject to Section 10(2), in case

of difference of opinion, the matter is to be decided

according to the opinion of the majority. This, it must

be   noticed,   was   introduced   in   the   context   of   the

observations in S.S. Dhanoa (supra). By the Ordinance

dated   01.10.1993,    other   far-reaching     changes      were

introduced, which, inter alia, provided for bringing

the Election Commissioners substantially on par with

the Chief Election Commissioner. The Chief Election

Commissioner, it must be noticed, under the 1991 Act,

was to be paid a salary equal to the Judge of the

Supreme Court. The Election Commissioner was to be paid

the salary equal to the Judge of the High Court. After

the amendment, they stand equated. The 1991 Act also

provided that the Chief Election Commissioner would be

entitled to continue in Office till the age of 65 years

whereas the Election Commissioner was to continue in

Office till he attains the age of 62 years. The age of

superannuation of the Chief Election Commissioner and

the Election Commissioner was brought on par by the

Ordinance insofar as both were entitled to continue for

a period of six years subject to their liability to

vacate Office should they attain the age of 65 years

before the expiry of six years from the date on which

they assumed Office. However, under the first proviso

to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_131">Article 324(5</a>), the Chief Election Commissioner can

be removed from his Office only in the manner and on

the like grounds as the Judge of the Supreme Court of

India. The first proviso also prohibits the conditions

of service of the Chief Election Commissioner being

varied to his disadvantage after his appointment. In

the matter of the removal of the Election Commissioner

or   a   Regional     Commissioner    the   second    proviso    to

<a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_132">Article 324(5)</a> provides the safeguard for the Election

Commissioner     or    a   Regional   Commissioner     that    they

cannot be removed except on the recommendation of the

Chief Election Commissioner. On 01.10.1993, again, in

came to be appointed w.e.f. 01.10.1993. The Ordinance,

which had been passed on 01.10.1993, became Act No. 4

of    1994     on    04.01.1994.     This   led   to    certain    Writ

Petitions being filed calling in question the Ordinance

including at the instance of Shri T.N. Seshan, who, it

must be noticed, was appointed earlier on 12.12.1990

as the Chief Election Commissioner. He challenged the

Ordinance       on    various   grounds.      Matters    engaged   the

attention of the Constitution Bench and its decision

is reported in <a href="/doc/1890680/" id="a_134">T.N. Seshan, Chief Election Commissioner

observations:

<blockquote id="blockquote_35">       “10. The   Preamble    of   our    Constitution
       proclaims that we are a Democratic Republic.
       Democracy being the basic feature of our

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_99">                                                                    84</span>
interference. It is inherent in a democratic
set-up that the agency which is entrusted the
task of holding elections to the legislatures
should be fully insulated so that it can
function as an independent agency free from
external pressures from the party in power or
executive of the day. This objective is
achieved by the setting up of an Election
Commission, a permanent body, under <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_135">Article
324(1)</a>     of     the     Constitution.     The
superintendence, direction and control of the
entire election process in the country has been
vested under the said clause in a commission
called the Election Commission. Clause (2) of
the said article then provides for the
constitution of the Election Commission by
providing that it shall consist of the CEC and
such number of ECs, if any, as the President
may from time to time fix. It is thus obvious
from the plain language of this clause that the
Election Commission is composed of the CEC and,
when they have been appointed, the ECs. The
office of the CEC is envisaged to be a
permanent fixture but that cannot be said of
the ECs as is made manifest from the use of
the words “if any”. Dr Ambedkar while
explaining the purport of this clause during
the debate in the Constituent Assembly said:

“Sub-clause (2) says that there shall be a
Chief Election Commissioner and such other
Election Commissioners as the President may,
from time to time appoint. There were two
alternatives before the Drafting Committee,
namely, either to have a permanent body
consisting of four or five members of the
Election Commission who would continue in
office throughout without any break, or to
permit the President to have an ad hoc body
appointed at the time when there is an election
on the anvil. The Committee has steered a
middle course. What the Drafting Committee
proposes by sub-clause (2) is to have

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_100">                                                  85</span>
     permanently in office one man called the Chief
     Election Commissioner, so that the skeleton
     machinery would always be available.”

     It is crystal clear from the plain language of
     the said clause (2) that our Constitution-
     makers realised the need to set up an
     independent body or commission which would be
     permanently in session with at least one
     officer, namely, the CEC, and left it to the
     President to further add to the Commission such
     number of ECs as he may consider appropriate
     from time to time. Clause (3) of the said
     article makes it clear that when the Election
     Commission is a multi-member body the CEC shall
     act as its Chairman. What will be his role as
     a Chairman has not been specifically spelt out
     by the said article and we will deal with this
     question hereafter. Clause (4) of the said
     article further provides for the appointment
     of RCs to assist the Election Commission in the
     performance of its functions set out in clause
     (1). This, in brief, is the scheme of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_136">Article
     324</a> insofar as the constitution of the Election
     Commission is concerned.”


</p><p id="p_126">57. This Court went on to disagree with certain parts

of the Judgment in S.S. Dhanoa (supra). The Court,

inter alia, held that the Election Commission of India

can be a single-Member Body or a multi-Member Body. It

was further held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_36">     “16. While it is true that under the scheme of
     <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_137">Article 324</a> the conditions of service and
     tenure of office of all the functionaries of
     the Election Commission have to be determined
     by the President unless determined by law made
     by Parliament, it is only in the case of the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_101">                                                       86</span>
CEC that the first proviso to clause (5) lays
down that they cannot be varied to the
disadvantage of the CEC after his appointment.
</blockquote><p id="p_127">Such a protection is not extended to the ECs.
But it must be remembered that by virtue of
the Ordinance the CEC and the ECs are placed
on a par in the matter of salary, etc. Does
the absence of such provision for ECs make the
CEC superior to the ECs? The second ground
relates to removability. In the case of the CEC
he can be removed from office in like manner
and on the like ground as a Judge of the Supreme
Court whereas the ECs can be removed on the
recommendation of the CEC. That, however, is
not an indicia for conferring a higher status
on the CEC. To so hold is to overlook the scheme
of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_138">Article 324</a> of the Constitution. It must be
remembered that the CEC is intended to be a
permanent incumbent and, therefore, in order
to preserve and safeguard his independence, he
had to be treated differently. That is because
there cannot be an Election Commission without
a CEC. That is not the case with other ECs.
They are not intended to be permanent
incumbents. Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_139">Article 324</a> itself
suggests that the number of ECs can vary from
time to time. In the very nature of things,
therefore, they could not be conferred the type
of irremovability that is bestowed on the CEC.
If that were to be done, the entire scheme of
<a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_140">Article 324</a> would have to undergo a change. In
the scheme of things, therefore, the power to
remove in certain cases had to be retained.
Having   insulated   the   CEC   from external
political or executive pressures, confidence
was reposed in this independent functionary to
safeguard the independence of his ECs and even
RCs by enjoining that they cannot be removed
except on the recommendation of the CEC. This
is evident from the following statement found
in the speech of Shri K.M. Munshi in the
Constituent Assembly when he supported the
amended draft submitted by Dr Ambedkar:

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_102">                                                   87</span>
     “We cannot have an Election Commission sitting
     all the time during those five years doing
     nothing. The Chief Election Commissioner will
     continue to be a whole-time officer performing
     the duties of his office and looking after the
     work from day to day but when major elections
     take place in the country, either Provincial
     or Central, the Commission must be enlarged to
     cope with the work. More members therefore have
     to be added to the Commission. They are no
     doubt to be appointed by the President.
     Therefore, to that extent their independence
     is ensured. So there is no reason to believe
     that these temporary Election Commissioners
     will not have the necessary measure of
     independence.”
     Since the other ECs were not intended to be
     permanent appointees they could not be granted
     the irremovability protection of the CEC, a
     permanent incumbent, and, therefore, they were
     placed under the protective umbrella of an
     independent CEC. This aspect of the matter
     escaped the attention of the learned Judges who
     decided Dhanoa case [(1991) 3 SCC 567] . We are
     also of the view that the comparison with the
     functioning of the executive under Articles 74
     and 163 of the Constitution in paragraph 17 of
     the judgment, with respect, cannot be said to
     be apposite.”
                                 (Emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_128">58. Dealing   with   the   argument   that   as   the   Chief

Election Commissioner is designated as the Chairman,

it put him on a higher pedestal, this Court, inter

alia, held as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_37">     “19. … The function of the Chairman would,
     therefore, be to preside over meetings,
     preserve order, conduct the business of the
     day, ensure that precise decisions are taken
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_103">                                                          88</span>
     and correctly recorded and do all that is
     necessary for smooth transaction of business.
     The nature and duties of this office may vary
     depending on the nature of business to be
     transacted but by and large these would be the
     functions of a Chairman. He must so conduct
     himself at the meetings chaired by him that he
     is able to win the confidence of his colleagues
     on the Commission and carry them with him. This
     a Chairman may find difficult to achieve if he
     thinks that others who are members of the
     Commission are his subordinates. The functions
     of the Election Commission are essentially
     administrative     but    there     are    certain
     adjudicative and legislative functions as
     well. The Election Commission has to lay down
     certain    policies,     decide      on    certain
     administrative    matters    of   importance    as
     distinguished    from    routine      matters   of
     administration and also adjudicate certain
     disputes, e.g., disputes relating to allotment
     of symbols. Therefore, besides administrative
     functions it may be called upon to perform
     quasi-judicial      duties      and      undertake
     subordinate legislation-making functions as
     well.    <a href="/doc/1831036/" id="a_141">See Mohinder     Singh     Gill v. Chief
     Election Commr</a> [(1978) 1 SCC 405 : (1978) 2 SCR
     272] . We need say no more on this aspect of
     the matter.”


</blockquote><p id="p_129">59. Still   further,   we   may   notice   the   following

discussion, which brings out the rationale for treating

the Chief Election Commissioner differently from the

Elections Commissioners:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_38">     “21. We have pointed out the distinguishing
     features from <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_142">Article 324</a> between the position
     of the CEC and the ECs. It is essentially on
     account of their tenure in the Election

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_104">                                                          89</span>
       Commission that certain differences exist. We
       have explained why in the case of ECs the
       removability clause had to be different. The
       variation in the salary, etc., cannot be a
       determinative factor otherwise that would
       oscillate having regard to the fact that the
       executive or the legislature has to fix the
       conditions of service under clause (5) of
       <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_143">Article 324.</a> The only distinguishing feature
       that survives for consideration is that in the
       case of the CEC his conditions of service
       cannot be varied to his disadvantage after his
       appointment whereas there is no such safeguard
       in the case of ECs. That is presumably because
       the posts are temporary in character. But even
       if it is not so, that feature alone cannot lead
       us to the conclusion that the final word in
       all matters lies with the CEC. Such a view
       would render the position of the ECs to that
       of mere advisers which does not emerge from the
       scheme of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_144">Article 324</a>.”
                                   (Emphasis supplied)



</blockquote><p id="p_130">60. It is clear that the founding fathers intended that

the    elections   in    the   country    must    be   under      the

superintendence,        direction      and      control     of    an

independent Body. The Body is the Election Commission

of    India.   Under    <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_145">Article   324</a>,    the    Chief     Election

Commissioner is an unalterable feature or figure. A

Commission can consist of           only the      Chief    Election

Commissioner.      A    multi-Member     Commission       was    also

contemplated by the founding fathers. However, the post


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_105">                                                                  90</span>
of Election Commissioner was to be need based. For

nearly     four     decades,      there     was    no   Election

Commissioner. As we have noticed, it is on 16.10.1989

that     the   first   two      Election    Commissioners      were

appointed. In regard to the appointment of the Chief

Election         Commissioner       and       other     Election

Commissioners, the Constitution does not provide for

any criteria. It does not fix any qualifications. It

does not prescribe any disqualifications in the matter

of appointment as either Chief Election Commissioner

or Election Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_131">61. The appointees have been bureaucrats drawn from

the Civil Services. <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_146">Article 324(5)</a> deals with the

conditions of service and tenure of Office of the

Election Commissioners and the Regional Commissioners.

Till Parliament made any law with regard to the same,

the founding fathers clothed the President with power

to lay down the conditions of service and tenure of

Office by Rule. It is to lay down the conditions of

service    and    tenure   of    Office    that   Parliament    has

enacted the 1991 Act. The first proviso to sub-<a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_147">Article

324(5)</a> acts as a guarantee against the removal of the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_106">                                                                91</span>
Chief Election Commissioner except on like grounds and

a similar manner a Judge of the Supreme Court can be

removed.   The    conditions       of   service    of   the    Chief

Election   Commissioner      shall      not   be   varied     to   his

disadvantage after his appointment. This means that

Parliament cannot, nor can the Government by Rule,

either remove the Chief Election Commissioner, except

by   impeaching   him   in   the    manner     provided     for    the

removal of a Judge of Supreme Court nor can Parliament

make law nor Government a Rule to vary the conditions

of service of the Chief Election Commissioner to his

disadvantage, after he is appointed. The first proviso

to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_148">Article 324(5)</a> operates as a singular insulation to

protect the Chief Election Commissioner from either

being arbitrarily removed or his conditions of service

being varied to his disadvantage. But as contemplated

by the founding fathers, protection against arbitrary

removal or protection against varying of conditions of

the appointment were not the sole safeguards. Far more

vital was the appointment of the ‘right man’ and the

need to take it out of the exclusive hands of the

executive.

constituted, what is known as the ‘Vohra Committee’.

It made certain recommendations in regard to the CBI

and the IB. Five years thereafter, in 1998, Government

of India appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship

of Shri Indrajit Gupta Committee on State funding of

elections.      The    Committee         submitted     its    Report    in

December, 1998. The conclusion and summary of the

recommendations are found in Chapter 9 and they include

various    recommendations               relating     to     funding   of

political parties.

<p id="p_147">67. In    the    year       2002,    a    National     Commission      for

reviewing the work of the                  Constitution, under the

Chairmanship of the Former Chief Justice of India, M.N.

which is of relevance to the cases before us is as

follows:

<blockquote id="blockquote_52">      “The Chief Election Commissioner and the other
      Election Commissioners should be appointed on
      the recommendation of a Body consisting of the
      Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition in the
      Lok Sabha, the Leader of the Opposition in the
      Rajya Sabha, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and
      the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. It was
      further recommended that similar procedure
      should be adopted in the case of appointment
      of the State Election Commissioners.”


</blockquote><p id="p_148">68. In the year 2004, the Election Commission of India,

on   02.08.2004   made   certain    proposal    on   electoral

reforms to the Government          of India. The     proposals

included   affidavits    to   be   filed   by   candidates   on

criminal antecedents, their assets, etc. The aspect

about criminalisation of politics is noted as an issue

being raised by the Commission from 1998 onwards. The

Commission was of the opinion that keeping a person

accused of a serious criminal charge and where the

Court had framed charges, out of the electoral arena,

would be a reasonable restriction in greater public

interest. Among the various reforms it proposed, we

notice the following:

“12. COMPOSITION OF ELECTION COMMISSION AND
CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE
COMMISSION AND INDEPENDENT SECRETARIAT FOR THE
COMMISSION

Election Commission of India is an independent
constitutional    body     created    by    the
Constitution of India vide <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_149">Article 324.</a> Clause
(I)   of   <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_150">Article    324</a>    has   vested   the
superintendence, direction and control of the
preparation of electoral rolls for, and the
conduct of, all elections to Parliament and to
the Legislature of every State and of elections
to the offices of President and Vice-President
of India in the Election Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_150">Under Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_151">Article 324</a>, the Election
Commission shall consist of the Chief Election
Commissioner and such number of other Election
Commissioners, if any, as the President may
from to time fix and the appointment of the
Chief Election Commissioner and Election
Commissioners shall, subject to the provisions
of any law made in that behalf by Parliament,
be made by the President.
</p>
<p id="p_151">The President has, by Order dated 1.10.1993
under Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_152">Article 324</a>, fixed the
number of Election Commissioners as two until
further orders.
</p>
<p id="p_152">Although    the   Constitution   permits   the
President to fix the number of Election
Commissioners at any number without any limit,
it is felt that in the interest of smooth and
effective    functioning    of  the   Election
Commission,     the    number   of    Election
Commissioners should not be unduly large and
should remain as two as presently fixed, in
addition to the Chief Election Commissioner.
The three-member body is very effective in
dealing with the complex situations that arise
in the course of superintending, directing and
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_114">                                                  99</span>
controlling the electoral process, and allows
for quick responses to developments in the
field that arise from time to time and require
immediate solution. Increasing the size of this
body beyond the existing three-member body
would, in the considered opinion of the
Commission, hamper the expeditious manner in
which it has necessarily to act for conducting
the elections peacefully and in a free and fair
manner.
</p>
<p id="p_153">In order to ensure the independence of the
Election Commission and to keep it insulated
from external pulls and pressures, Clause (5)
of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_153">Article 324</a> of the Constitution, inter alia,
provides that the Chief Election Commissioner
shall not be removed from his office except in
like manner and on like grounds as a Judge of
the Supreme Court. However, that Clause (5) of
<a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_154">Article 324</a> does not provide similar protection
to the Election Commissioners and it merely
says that they cannot be removed from office
except on the recommendation of the Chief
Election Commissioner. The provision, in the
opinion   of   the   Election  Commission,   is
inadequate and requires an amendment to provide
the very same protection and safeguard in the
matter    of     removability    of    Election
Commissioners from office as is available to
the Chief Election Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_154">The independence of the Election Commission
upon which the Constitution makers laid so much
stress in the Constitution would be further
strengthened if the Secretariat of the Election
Commission consisting of officers and staff at
various levels is also insulated from the
interference of the Executive in the matter of
their appointments, promotions, etc., and all
such functions are exclusively vested in the
Election Commission on the lines of the
Secretariats of the Lok Sabha, and Rajya Sabha,
Registries of the Supreme Court and High
Courts, etc. Independent Secretariat is vital
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_115">                                              100</span>
     to the functioning of the Election Commission
     as an independent constitutional authority. In
     fact, the provision of independent Secretariat
     to the Election Commission has already been
     accepted in principle by the Goswami Committee
     on Electoral Reforms and the Government had,
     in the Constitution (Seventieth Amendment)
     Bill, 1990, made a provision also to that
     effect. That Bill was, however, withdrawn in
     1993 as the Government proposed to bring in a
     more comprehensive Bill.”
                                (Emphasis supplied)


</p><p id="p_155">69. As regards expenses of Election Commission, we find

the following complaint and solution:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_53">     “13. EXPENSES OF ELECTION COMMISSION TO BE
     TREATED AS CHARGED

     The Commission had sent a proposal that the
     expenditure of the Commission should be charged
     on the Consolidated Fund of India. The
     Government had moved in the 10th Lok Sabha “The
     Election Commission (Charging of Expenses on
     the Consolidated Fund of India) Bill, 1994”
     with the objective of providing for the
     salaries, allowances and pension payable to the
     Chief Election Commissioner and other Election
     Commissioners and the administrative expenses
     including salaries, allowances and pension of
     the staff of the Election Commission to be
     expenditure charged upon the Consolidated Fund
     of India. Similar provisions already exist in
     respect of the Supreme Court, Comptroller &amp;
     Auditor General and the Union Public Service
     Commission, which are, like the Election
     Commission, independent constitutional bodies.</blockquote><p id="p_156">
</p><p id="p_157">     To secure its independent functioning the

        which lapsed with the dissolution of the 10th
        Lok Sabha in 1996, needs reconsideration.”

Administrative            Reforms    Commission          Report       made    in

January,       2007.       The     Commission      consisted          of     Shri

Veerappa       Moily,       the     then     Law    Minister,         as     its

Chairperson         and    five     other    Members.          We   find      the

following in the summary of its recommendations, inter

alia. It recommended that the Collegium headed by the

Prime Minister, with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the

leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, the Law

Minister and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha,

as      Members,          should      make      recommendations              for

consideration of the President for appointment of the

Chief        Election       Commissioner           and        the     Election

Commissioners. In the year 2010, the Ministry of Law

and Justice, Government of India, had constituted a

Committee on Electoral Reforms. The Report, it made,

in the year 2010 indicates the background which led to

the constitution of the Committee. Reference is made

to various earlier Reports as also the efforts being

to   legislate,    the    recommendation    of    the   Goswami

Committee in 1990, we find the following discussion:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_56">     “6.10.4 This was followed by the introduction
     of the Constitution (Seventieth Amendment)
     Bill 1990, which was introduced in the Rajya
     Sabha on 30th May 1990 providing that the CEC
     would be appointed by the President after
     consultation with the Chairman of the Rajya
     Sabha, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, and the
     Leader of the Opposition (or the leader of the
     largest party) in the Lok Sabha. The CEC was
     further made a part of the consultative process
     in   the    appointment    of   the    Election
     Commissioners. However, on 13th June 1994, the
     Government moved a motion to withdraw the Bill,
     which was finally withdrawn with the leave of
     the Rajya Sabha on the same day.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_57">     6.10.5 Consequently, in the absence of any
     Parliamentary law governing the appointment
     issue,   the    Election   Commissioners    are
     appointed by the government of the day, without
     pursuing   any   consultation   process.   This
     practice has been described as requiring the
     Law Ministry to get the file approved by the
     Prime Minister, who then recommends a name to
     the President. Thus, there is no concept of
     collegium and no involvement of the opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_58">     6.10.6 The Commissioners are appointed for a
     six year period, or up to the age of 65 years,
     whichever is earlier. Further, there are no
     prescribed     qualifications    for     their
     appointment, although convention dictates that

     only   senior   (serving or retired) civil
     servants, of the rank of the Cabinet Secretary
     or Secretary to the Government of India or an
     equivalent rank, will be appointed. The Supreme
     Court in Bhagwati Prashad Dixit Ghorewala v
     Rajiv Gandhi rejected the contention that the
     CEC should possess qualifications similar to
     that of a Supreme Court judge, despite being
     placed on par with them in terms of the removal
     process.”

Practices’,     the    Report   contains    the   following

discussion:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_59">     “(ii) Comparative practices

     6.11.1 An examination of comparative practices
     is   instructive.   In   South   Africa,   the
     Independent Electoral Commission comprises of
     five members, including one judge. They are
     appointed    by   the    President   on    the
     recommendations of the National Assembly,
     following nominations by a National Assembly
     inter-party committee, which receives a list
     of at least eight candidates. This list of (at
     least) eight nominees is recommended by the
     Selection Committee, which has four members
     being, the President of the Constitutional
     Court; a representative of the Human Rights
     Commission and the Commission on Gender
     Equality each; and the Public Prosecutor.

     of “Elections Canada” is appointed by a House
     of Commons resolution for a non-renewable ten-
     year term, and to protect their independence
     from the government, he/she reports directly
     to Parliament. In the United States, the six
     Federal Election Commissioners are appointed
     by the President with the advise and consent
     of the Senate. The Commissioners can be members
     of a political party, although not more than
     three Commissioners can be members of the same
     party.
</p>
<p id="p_162">     6.11.4 In all these cases thus, it is clear
     that   the   appointment   of   the   Election
     Commissioners or the electoral officers is a

     6.12.1 Given the importance of maintaining the
     neutrality of the ECI and to shield the CEC

     appointment of Election Commissioners becomes
     a consultative process.</blockquote><p id="p_164">

</p><p id="p_165">     6.12.2 To this end, the Commission adapts the
     Goswami Committee’s proposal with certain
     modifications. First, the appointment of all
     the Election Commissioners (including the CEC)
     should be made by the President in consultation
     with a three-member collegium or selection
     committee, consisting of the Prime Minister,
     the Leader of the Opposition of the Lok Sabha
     (or the leader of the largest opposition party

strength) and the Chief Justice of India. The
Commission considers the inclusion of the Prime
Minister is important as a representative of
the current government.

<p id="p_166">6.12.3 Second, the elevation of an Election
Commissioner should be on the basis of
seniority,    unless   the    three   member
collegium/committee,  for   reasons  to   be
recorded in writing, finds such Commissioner
unfit.
</p>
<p id="p_167">6.12.4 Such amendments are in consonance with

     for reasons to be recorded in writing, finds
     such Election Commissioner to be unfit.

     Explanation: For the purposes of this sub-

     House of the People” shall, when no such Leader
     has been so recognised, include the Leader of
     the single largest group in opposition of the

</p><p id="p_174">75. In regard to the aspect about the permanent and

independent Secretariat of the Election Commission of

India, it was noticed that to give effect to the Goswami

Committee recommendation, the Constitution Seventieth

Amendment Bill, 1990 was introduced on 30.05.1990 and

that it was subsequently withdrawn in 1993 in view of

the changed composition of the Election Commission of

India, on it becoming a multi-Member Body pursuant to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_125">                                                    110</span>
the 1991 Act and on the ground that the Bill needed

some amendments. The Bill, however, the Law Commission

noticed, was never introduced. Thereafter, the Law

Commission    referred   to   the    recommendations        of   the

Election Commission itself for seeking appointment of

an    independent   Secretariat.      The     Law   Commission,

accordingly, recommended insertion of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_162">Article 324(2A</a>),

inter alia, providing for a separate, independent and

permanent     secretarial     staff     for     the        Election

Commission. In regard to the need for equating the two

Election     Commissioners    with     the    Chief        Election

Commissioner and noting that Election Commissioners

were clearly superior to the Regional Commissioners,

the   Law   Commission   recommended     changes      in    <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_163">Article

324(5)</a> as well. The amended <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_164">Article 324</a>, as proposed

In the said Report, we find the Article ‘Are Elections

in India Free and Fair’ by Shri M.G. Devasahayan. Under

the head ‘ECI – functioning an autonomy’, we find the

following criticism:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_63">     “
     ▪   ECI has plenipotentiary powers drawn from
     <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_165">Article 324</a> of the Constitution of India to
     conduct free and fair election.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_64">     ▪   In addition, Supreme Court has ruled: “when
     Parliament or any State Legislature made valid
     law relating to, or in connection to elections,
     the Commission, shall act in conformity with,
     not in violation of such provisions, but where
     such law is silent, <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_166">Article 324</a> is a reservoir
     of power to act for the avowed purpose of
     pushing forward a free and fair election with
     expedition…”.
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_65">     ▪   But ECI is just not using such powers,
     because ECs are the appointees of the
     Government of the day and not through an
     independent process of collegium. The case of
     one dissenting EC, who was side-lined and then
     eased out has caused irretrievable damage to
     ECI’s independence and integrity!
     ▪   This compromises the autonomy of the ECI
     and creates doubts about the neutrality of the
     CEC and the ECs, and consequently, the
     neutrality of the Commission itself. This poses
     serious danger to the fairness and integrity
     of not only the elections, but democracy
     itself…”

324(5</a>), being proposals made by the Election Commission

itself.
</p>
<p id="p_184">     “Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_168">Article 324</a> of the Constitution
     provides that the Chief Election Commissioner
     shall not be removed from his office except in
     the same manner and on the same grounds as a
     Judge of the Supreme Court. The Chief Election
     Commissioner     and    the    two     Election
     Commissioners enjoy the same decision making
     powers which is suggestive of the fact that
     their powers are at par with each other.
     However, Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_169">Article 324</a> of the
     Constitution    does   not   provide    similar
     protection to the Election Commissioners and
     it merely says that they cannot be removed from
     office except on the recommendation of the
     Chief Election Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_185">     The reason for giving protection to a Chief
     Election Commissioner as enjoyed by a Supreme
     Court Judge in matters of removability from
     office was in order to ensure the independence
     of Commission from external pulls and pressure.
     However, the rationale behind not affording
     similar    protection    to    other   Election
     Commissioners is not explicable. The element
     of &#x27;independence&#x27; sought to be achieved under
     the Constitution is not exclusively for an
     individual alone but for the whole institution.
     Thus, the independence of the Commission can
     only   be   strengthened    if   the   Election
     Commissioners are also provided with the same
     protection as that of the Chief Election
     Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_186">     Proposed amendment
     The   present   constitutional   guarantee   is
     inadequate and requires an amendment to provide
     the same protection and safeguard in the matter
     of removability of Election Commissioners as
     is    available   to    the   Chief    Election
     Commissioner.”

     interpreting the law, accomplishes in its
     perfect action in a marginal degree of

position obtaining in the United States of America and

Australia. <a href="/doc/679372/" id="a_173">(See In Re. Delhi Laws Act</a>, 191217). The

doctrine of separation of powers, no doubt, has been

eloquently expounded by Montesquieu in his work “The

Spirit of Laws” and the basis on which it rests is the

imperative need to avoid concentration of power in one

or two organs. Undoubtedly, an observance of doctrine

of   separation   of   powers   has   been   traced   to   the

<p id="p_198">78. Separation of powers in one sense is a
limit on active jurisdiction of each organ.
But it has another deeper and more relevant
purpose: to act as check and balance over the
activities of other organs. Thereby the active
jurisdiction of the organ is not challenged;
nevertheless there are methods of prodding to
communicate the institution of its excesses and
shortfall in duty. Constitutional mandate sets
the dynamics of this communication between the
organs of polity. Therefore, it is suggested
to not understand separation of powers as
operating in vacuum. Separation of powers
doctrine has been reinvented in modern times.

</p><p id="p_199">83. If we notice the evolution of separation
of powers doctrine, traditionally the checks
and balances dimension was only associated
with governmental excesses and violations. But
in today&#x27;s world of positive rights and
justifiable social and economic entitlements ,
hybrid    administrative    bodies,    private
functionaries discharging public functions, we
have to perform the oversight function with
more urgency and enlarge the field of checks
and balances to include governmental inaction.

</p><p id="p_200">85. Separation of powers is part of the basic structure

of the Constitution of India. Equally, judicial review

has been recognised as forming a part of the basic

structure. Judicial review of legislation is expressly

provided in <a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_180">Article 13</a> of the Constitution. A court

when it declares a law made by the legislature as

unconstitutional, if it be that, it is within its

bounds,   cannot   be   accused   of   transgressing   the

principle of separation of powers. Declaring even a law

made by the Parliament as unconstitutional forms a part

of its powers. In view of the enunciation of the

doctrine of basic structure in India unlike perhaps in

most countries, even an amendment to the Constitution

can be declared unconstitutional by the court. Such

exercise cannot expose the court to the charge that it

is not observing the limits set by the Constitution.

</p><p id="p_201">86. While it may be true that the Constitution is

supreme and all disputes must finally attain repose
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_146">                                                       122</span>
under the aegis of the Constitution, in one sense the

final arbiter of what is the law must be the court.

While it may be true that by removing the text forming

the premise for a judicial verdict, the lawgiver may

revisit the judgment, it is not open to the legislature

to don the robes of a Judge and arrogate to itself the

judicial function. The theory of separation of powers

in an ultimate analysis is meant to prevent tyranny of

power flowing from the assumption of excess power in

one source. Its value lies in a delicate but skilful

and at the same time legitimate balance being struck

by the organs of the State in the exercise of their

respective powers. This means that the essential powers

which are well understood in law cannot be deliberately

encroached upon by any organ of the State.

</p><p id="p_202">87. Creative judicial activism has been a subject of

both controversy reaching brickbats as also bouquets

to the courts. Under the Constitution which clothes

both   citizens   and   persons   with   fundamental   rights

declared in the Directive Principles, judicial activism

as opposed to a mere passive role may be the much-

sound juridical underpinning and cannot degenerate into

a mere exercise of subjectivism.
</p>
<p id="p_203">88. The learned Solicitor General is right therefore

that judicial restraint may be a virtue in the elevated

region of constitutional law. Being the grundnorm, it

is indeed a rarefied field where the court must tread

wearily (<a href="/doc/47602/" id="a_181">See Divisional Manager, Aravali Golf Club and

Another v. Chander Hass and Another24</a>). This Court

indeed has admonished against the court itself running

the Government. <a href="/doc/1225520/" id="a_182">In Asif Hameed v. State of J &amp; K</a>,25 no

doubt this court refers to the following observations

of Frankfurter, J. in para 18:

<p id="p_204">

     will to adhere to the difference. It is not
     easy to stand aloof and allow want of wisdom
     to prevail to disregard one&#x27;s own strongly held
     view of what is wise in the conduct of affairs.
     But it is not the business of this Court to
     pronounce policy. It must observe a fastidious
     regard for limitations on its own power, and
     this precludes the court&#x27;s giving effect to its
     own notions of what is wise or politic. That
     self-restraint is of the essence in the
     observance of the judicial oath, for the

Sathe, the learned author in the chapter ‘Legitimacy

of Judicial Activism’ observes: -
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_76">     “Legitimacy of Judicial Activism
     The realist school of jurisprudence exploded
     the myth that the judges merely declared the
     pre-existing law or interpreted it and asserted
     that the judges made the law. It stated that
     the law was what the courts said it was. This
     is known as legal scepticism and was really a
     reaction to Austin’s definition of law as a
     command of the political sovereign. According
     to analytical jurisprudence a court merely
     found the law or merely interpreted the law.
     The American realist school or jurisprudence
     asserted that the judges made law, though
     interstitially. Jerome Frank, Justice Holmes,
     Cardozo, and Llewellyn were the chief exponents
     of this school. The Indian Supreme Court not
     only makes law, as understood in the sense of
     the realist jurisprudence, but actually has
     started ‘legislating’ exactly in the way in
     which a legislature legislates. Judicial law-

<p id="p_208">making in the realist sense in what the Court
does when it expands the meanings of the words
‘personal liberty’ or ‘due process of law’ or
‘freedom of speech and expression’. When the
Court   held    that   a   commercial    speech
(advertisement) was entitled to the protection
of freedom of speech and expression, it was
judicial law-making in the realist sense.
Similarly, the basic structure doctrine or the
parameters for reviewing the President’s
action under <a href="/doc/8019/" id="a_184">article 356</a> or the wider meanings
of the words ‘life’, ‘liberty’, and ‘procedure
established by law’ in <a href="/doc/1199182/" id="a_185">article 21</a> of the
Constitution by the Supreme Court are instances
of judicial law-making in the realist sense.
When, however, the Court lays down guidelines
for inter-country adoption, against sexual
harassment of working women at the workplace,
or for abolition of child labour, it is not
judicial law-making in the realist sense these
are instances of judicial excessivism that fly
in the face of the doctrine of separation of
powers. The doctrine of separation of powers
envisages that the legislature should make law,
the executive should execute it, and the
judiciary should settle disputes in accordance
with the existing law. In reality such
watertight separation exists nowhere and is
impracticable. Broadly it means that one organ
of the State should not perform a function that
essentially belongs to another organ. While
law-making    through     interpretation    and
expansion of the meanings of open-textured
expressions such as ‘due process of law’,
‘equal protection of law’, or ‘freedom of
speech and expression’ is a legitimate judicial
function, the making of an entirely new law,
which the Supreme Court has been doing through
directions in the above-mentioned cases, is not
a legitimate judicial function. True, the Court
has not supplanted but has merely supplemented
the legislature through such directions. It has
said in each case that it legislated through

     with situations such as inter-country adoption

     its direction could be replaced by legislation

Cardozo observes under the following subject: -

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_77">     “THE JUDGE AS A LEGISLATOR

     …No doubt the limits for the judge are
     narrower. He legislates only between gaps. He
     fills the open spaces in the law. How far he
     may go without travelling beyond the walls of
     the interstices cannot be staked out for him
     upon a chart. He must learn it for himself as
     he gains the sense of fitness and proportion
     that comes with years of habitude in the
     practice of an art. Even within the gaps,
     restrictions not easy to define, but felt,
     however impalpable they may be, by every judge
     and lawyer, hedge and circumscribe his action.
     They are established by the traditions of the
     centuries, by the example of other judges, his
     predecessors and his colleagues, by the
     collective judgment of the profession, and by
     the duty of adherence to the pervading spirit
     of the law.

     “The true view, as I submit,” he says, “is that
     the Law is what the Judges declare; that
     statues, precedents, the opinions of learned
     experts, customs and morality are the sources
     of the Law.” So, Jethro Brown in a paper on
     “Law and Evolution,” tells us that a statue,
     till construed, is not real law. It is only
     “ostensible” law, Real law, he says, is not
     found anywhere except in the judgment of a
     court…

     ..They have the right to legislate within gaps,
     but often there are no gaps. We shall have a
     false view of the landscape if we look at the
     waste spaces only, and refuse to see the acres
     already sown and fruitful..

<p id="p_212">     ..The judge, even when he is free, is still
     not wholly free. He is not to innovate at
     pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming
     at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty
     or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration
     from consecrated principles. He is not to yield
     to   spasmodic   sentiment,   to    vague   and
     unregulated benevolence. He is to exercise a
     discretion informed by tradition, methodized
     by   analogy,  disciplined   by system,     and
     subordinated to “the primordial necessity of
     order in the social life.” Wide enough in all

in The Judicial Method” by Hon’ble Justice Michael

Kirby, we find of particular interest, the following:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_80">     “The acute needs of the developing countries
     of the Commonwealth have sometimes produced an
     approach to constitutional interpretation that
     is   unashamedly   described   as   “activist”,
     including by judges themselves. Thus in India,
     at least in most legal circles, the phrase
     “judicial activism” is not viewed as one of
     condemnation. So urgent and numerous are the
     needs of that society that anything else would
     be regarded by many – including many judges and
     lawyers – as an abdication of the final court’s
     essential constitutional role.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_81">     One instance may be cited from Indian
     experience: the expansion of the traditional
     notion of standing to sue in public interest
     litigation. The Indian Supreme Court has upheld
     the right of prisoners, the poor and other
     vulnerable groups to enlist its constitutional
     jurisdiction by simply sending a letter to the
     Court. This might not seem appropriate in a
     developed country. Yet it appears perfectly
     adapted to the nation to which the Indian
     Constitution speaks. Lord Chief Justice Woolf
     recently confessed to having been astounded at
     first by the proactive approach of the Indian
     Supreme Court in this and other aspects.
     However, he went on:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_82">     “…I soon realised that if that Court was to
     perform its essential role in Indian society,
     it had no option but to adopt the course it

inextricably intertwined with power to the people. The

ballot, is more potent than the most powerful gun.

Democracy facilitates a peaceful revolution at the

hands of the common man if elections are held in a free

and fair manner. Elections can be conflated with a non-

violent coup capable of unseating the most seemingly

powerful governing parties, if they do not perform to

fulfil the aspirations of the governed.       Democracy is

meaningful only if the sublime goals enshrined in the

preamble to the Constitution receive the undivided

attention of the rulers, namely, social, political and

economic justice. The concepts of liberty, equality and

fraternity must not be strange bedfellows to the ruling

class. Secularism, a basic feature of the Constitution

must inform all actions of the State, and therefore,

cannot be spurned but must be observed in letter and

spirit.   Democracy   can   be   achieved   only   when   the

governing dispensation sincerely endeavours to observe

the fundamental rights in letter and spirit. Democracy

collapse, if only lip service is paid to the rule of

founding fathers have contemplated that not only must

India aspire for a democratic form of government and

life but it is their unambiguous aim that India must

be a Democratic Republic. The conventional definition

of a ‘Republic’ is that it is a Body Polity, in which,

the Head of State is elected. However, the republican

character of our democracy also means that the majority

abides by the Constitution ensuring rights granted

under it and also pursues goals enshrined in it. A

brute majority generated by a democratic process must

conform to constitutional safeguards and the demands

of   constitutional      morality.     A    Democratic   Republic

contemplates that majoritarian forces which may be

compatible with a democracy, must be counter balanced

by protection accorded to those not in the majority.

When we speak about the minority, the expression is not

to   be   conflated   with   or   limited      to   linguistic    or

religious minorities. These are aspects which again

remedy for all ills in a society (see <a href="/doc/1707158/" id="a_187">Common Cause v.

Union of India and Others26</a>) We are equally cognizant

that the courts must not try to run a Government nor

behave like emperors.        We also take notice of the

following words of this Court in <a href="/doc/47602/" id="a_188">Divisional Manager,

restraint has been emphasized.

<p id="p_217">       “33. Judicial restraint is consistent with and
       complementary to the balance of power among the
       three independent branches of the State. It
       accomplishes this in two ways. First, judicial
       restraint not only recognises the equality of
       the other two branches with the judiciary, it
       also fosters that equality by minimising inter-
       branch interference by the judiciary. In this
       analysis, judicial restraint may also be called
       judicial respect, that is, respect by the
       judiciary for the other coequal branches. In
       contrast, judicial activism&#x27;s unpredictable
       results make the judiciary a moving target and
       thus decreases the ability to maintain equality
       with the co-branches. Restraint stabilises the
       judiciary so that it may better function in a
       system of inter-branch equality.”

     “34. Second, judicial restraint tends to
     protect the independence of the judiciary. When
     courts encroach into the legislative or
     administrative    fields   almost     inevitably
     voters,   legislators    and    other    elected
     officials will conclude that the activities of
     judges should be closely monitored. If judges
     act like legislators or administrators it
     follows that judges should be elected like
     legislators or selected and trained like
     administrators.       This        would       be
     counterproductive.   The   touchstone    of   an
     independent judiciary has been its removal from
     the political or administrative process. Even
     if this removal has sometimes been less than
     complete, it is an ideal worthy of support and
     one that has had valuable effects.”

     “38. The moral of this story is that if the
     judiciary does not exercise restraint and
     overstretches its limits there is bound to be
     a reaction from politicians and others. The
     politicians will then step in and curtail the
     powers, or even the independence, of the
     judiciary (in fact the mere threat may do, as
     the above example demonstrates). The judiciary
     should, therefore, confine itself to its proper
     sphere, realising that in a democracy many
     matters and controversies are best resolved in
     non-judicial setting.”

       date. The inquiry into availability of these
       eligibility qualifications, under the Scheme
       of the 1950 Act is to be made at the time of
       preparation of the electoral roll or while
       entering or striking out a name in or from the
       electoral roll. <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_229">Section 62</a> of the 1951 Act does
       not provide that a person who is not qualified
       to be enrolled as an elector in the electoral
       roll shall not be entitled to vote at the
       election. To put it briefly a disqualification
       under <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_230">Section 16</a> of the 1950 Act has a
       relevance for and a bearing on the right to
       vote under <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_231">Section 62</a> of the 1951 Act but being
       not qualified for enrolment in the electoral
       roll under <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_232">Section 27</a> of the 1950 Act has no
       relevance for or bearing on the right to vote
       at an election under <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_233">Section 62</a> of the 1951
       Act. That is the distinction between a
       “disqualification” and “not being qualified”.


       It is, however, relevant to notice that the case

arose from a challenge to the result of an election

held    to   a   legislative   council   and   <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_234">Section   27</a>

Justice M.B. Shah while dealing with the nature of the

learned judge that <a href="/doc/397110/" id="a_242">Section 33B</a> of the amended Act was

illegal and invalid.       Justice P. Venkatarama Reddi in

the same case went on hold as follows:

from the Constitution and in accordance with
the   constitutional   mandate   contained   in
<a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_243">Article 326</a>, the right has been shaped by the
statute, namely the RP Act. That, in my
understanding, is the correct legal position
as regards the nature of the right to vote in
elections to the House of the People and
Legislative Assemblies. It is not very accurate
to describe it as a statutory right, pure and
simple. Even with this clarification, the
argument of the learned Solicitor-General that
the right to vote not being a fundamental
right,   the    information   which   at   best
facilitates meaningful exercise of that right
cannot be read as an integral part of any
fundamental right, remains to be squarely met.
</blockquote><p id="p_240">Here, a distinction has to be drawn between the
conferment of the right to vote on fulfilment
of requisite criteria and the culmination of
that right in the final act of expressing
choice towards a particular candidate by means
of ballot. Though the initial right cannot be
placed on the pedestal of a fundamental right,
but, at the stage when the voter goes to the
polling booth and casts his vote, his freedom
to express arises. The casting of vote in
favour   of   one   or   the  other   candidate
tantamounts to expression of his opinion and
preference and that final stage in the exercise
of voting right marks the accomplishment of
freedom of expression of the voter. That is
where <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_244">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is attracted. Freedom
of voting as distinct from right to vote is
thus a species of freedom of expression and
therefore carries with it the auxiliary and
complementary rights such as right to secure
information about the candidate which are
conducive to the freedom. None of the decisions
of this Court wherein the proposition that the
right to vote is a pure and simple statutory
right was declared and reiterated, considered
the question whether the citizen&#x27;s freedom of
expression is or is not involved when a citizen

      Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari also agreed with the

following conclusion No.2 at para 123 which contains

the judgment of Justice P. Venkatarama Reddi:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_95">       “(2) The right to vote at the elections to the

     “361. The argument of the petitioners is that
     the majority view in People&#x27;s Union for Civil
     Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399] , therefore, was

     Constitution.

     It is clear that a fine distinction was drawn

     while    reiterating    the    view    in <a href="/doc/46932/" id="a_248">Jyoti
     Basu v. Debi Ghosal</a> [(1982) 1 SCC 691] that a
     right to elect, fundamental though it is to

     a common law right, but pure and simple, a
     statutory right.

<p id="p_244">     363. Even otherwise, there is no basis to
     contend that the right to vote and elect
     representatives of the State in the Council of

     merely deals with the manner of election of the

     aspect of the composition of the Council of

       and fair elections” is always in terms of an
       electoral   system   prescribed   by   national

       colour from the right to “free and fair
       elections”; that the right to vote is empty
       without the right to “free and fair elections”.
       It is the concept of “free and fair elections”
       in terms of an electoral system which provides
       content and meaning to the “right to vote”. In
       other words, “right to vote” is not (sic) an
       ingredient of the free and fair elections. It
       is essential but not the necessary ingredient.”

express his disapproval of the candidates who stood for

‘none of the above’ (NOTA). In the course of this

judgment dealing with the first PUCL judgment (supra),

the Court held as follows:

<p id="p_250">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_97">       “After a careful perusal of the verdicts of

       294]    and People&#x27;s     Union     for    Civil
       Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399] , we are of the
       considered view that Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7
       SCC 1] does not overrule the other two
       decisions rather it only reaffirms what has
       already been said by the aforesaid two
       decisions. The said paragraphs recognise that
       right to vote is a statutory right and also
       in People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties [(2003)
       4 SCC 399] it was held that “a fine distinction
       was drawn between the right to vote and the
       freedom of voting as a species of freedom of
       expression”. Therefore, it cannot be said

     that Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] has observed
     anything to the contrary. In view of the whole
     debate of whether these two decisions were
     overruled or discarded because of the opening
     line in para 362 of Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC
     1] i.e. “We do not agree with the above
     submissions” we are of the opinion that this
     line must be read as a whole and not in
     isolation. The contention of the petitioners
     in Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] was that
     majority view in People&#x27;s Union for Civil
     Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399] held that right
     to vote is a constitutional right besides that
     it is also a facet of the fundamental right
     under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_253">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. It
     is this contention on which the Constitution
     Bench did not agree too in the opening line in
     para 362 and thereafter went on to clarify that
     in    fact   in People&#x27;s    Union    for     Civil
     Liberties [(2003)    4   SCC   399],     a    fine
     distinction was drawn between the right to vote
     and the freedom of voting as a species of
     freedom of expression. Thus, there is no
     contradiction as to the fact that right to vote
     is   neither   a   fundamental    right    nor   a
     constitutional right but a pure and simple
     statutory right. The same has been settled in
     a catena of cases and it is clearly not an
     issue in dispute in the present case. With the
     above observation, we hold that there is no
     doubt    or   confusion   persisting     in    the
     Constitution Bench judgment of this Court
     in Kuldip Nayar [(2006) 7 SCC 1] and the
     decisions      in Assn.      for      Democratic
     Reforms [(2002) 5 SCC 294] and People&#x27;s Union
     for Civil Liberties [(2003) 4 SCC 399] do not
     stand impliedly overruled.”

However,    the    words         ‘illegal      practices’       have     been

omitted    by     Act       58     of     1960       w.e.f.    26.12.1960.

if he is disqualified under any law relating to corrupt

practices or      any other offence in connection with

declare that no person shall vote at an election in any

disqualifications referred to in <a href="/doc/127621568/" id="a_295">Section 16</a> of the 1950

       To cast the vote, a person must be included in the

electoral roll of the constituency. However, even if

it be that he is so included, if at the time of the

election, when he casts the vote, he has incurred any

of the disqualifications referred to in <a href="/doc/127621568/" id="a_298">Section 16</a> of

in more than one constituency. In such an eventuality,

notwithstanding the fact that his name is so included,

if he votes in more than one constituency, his ballot

person casting his vote, if he is confined to a prison.

This would mean that while a person’s name may be

included in an electoral roll, which would entitle him,

ordinarily, to cast his vote, however, <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_302">Section 62(5)</a>

deprives him of his right to cast his vote, when he is

so confined. We have noticed that the validity of this

provision has been upheld in Anukul (supra). Also, we

find the same view taken in <a href="/doc/158890876/" id="a_303">Chief Election Commissioner

and    Others   v.   Jan   Chaukidar   (Peoples   Watch)   and

Others40</a>, wherein this Court has upheld the validity of

<a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_304">Section 62(5)</a>. A person may be so confined, if he is

under a sentence of imprisonment or transportation or

otherwise or if he is in the custody of police. We may,

at this juncture, notice one feature. <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_305">Article 326</a>,

undoubtedly, provides for adult suffrage. It declares

that if a person is a citizen and is above eighteen

years of age and he is not disqualified as provided in

<a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_306">Article 326</a> by or under any law, then, such person

electoral roll. It does not expressly say that he shall

have the right to cast his vote. The right to cast the

vote, as such, is expressly conferred under <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_307">Section

62(1)</a>, undoubtedly, on a person, whose name is entered

in the electoral roll. We have already noticed the

interplay of <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_308">Section 62(1)</a> and <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_309">Section 62(2)</a>. Equally,

we may notice that even if a person is included in the

electoral roll, if he is in confinement in a prison,

it would not entitle him or rather it would disentitle

him to cast his vote. In other words, while ordinarily,

the Right to Vote inevitably follows from the inclusion

of a person in the electoral roll, the Right to Vote

may be denied in terms of the law as we have noticed.

The mere inclusion of a person’s name more than once

in an electoral roll in a constituency, it has been

declared, also would not entitle him to vote more than

once [See <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_310">Section 62(4)</a>].    Equally, inclusion of a

person’s name in the electoral roll of more than one

constituency, would not entitle a person to cast his

vote, in terms of such inclusion in more than one

constituency [See <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_311">Section   62(3)</a>]. No doubt, we do

notice that this Court has issued notice in a case,

which is that, he must be so declared by a competent

court. Unsoundness of mind is also to be found in

</blockquote><p id="p_300">131. What are the incidents of a legal right? In Salmond

on Jurisprudence, we find the following discussion

about the characteristics of a legal right:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_201">                                                    170</span>

     the correlative duty. He may be distinguished
     as the person bound, or as the subject of the
     duty, or as the person of incidence.
</p>
<p id="p_302">     (3) It obliges the person bound to an act or
     omission in favour of the person entitled. This
     may be termed the content of the right.
</p>
<p id="p_303">     (4) The act or omission relates to some thing
     (in the widest sense of that word), which may
     be termed the object or subject-matter of the
     right.
</p><p id="p_304">     (5) Every legal right has a title, that is to
     say, certain facts or events by reason of which
     the right has become vested in its owner.”


</p><p id="p_305">132. <a href="/doc/1555093/" id="a_328">Article 168</a> of the Constitution reads as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_119">     “168. Constitution of Legislatures in States

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_202">                                                    171</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_306">133. A perusal of <a href="/doc/1661728/" id="a_329">Article 168(2)</a> would lead us to the

following inevitable conclusion:
</p>
<p id="p_307">    Wherever there are two Houses in a Legislature of

a State, one is designated as Legislative Assembly and

the other is called a Legislative Council. In States,

where there is only one House, it will be called the

Legislative Assembly. So, it is that <a href="/doc/1131530/" id="a_330">Article 170</a> deals

with the composition of Legislative Assemblies whereas

<a href="/doc/1198859/" id="a_331">Article 171</a> deals with the composition of Legislative

Councils. We may bear in mind that <a href="/doc/99012797/" id="a_332">Section 27</a> of the

1950 Act [referred to in Shyamdeo Pd. Singh (supra)]

actually deals with the preparation of electoral roll

for the Legislative Council and not the Legislative

Assembly. We     make this observation only to remind

ourselves that there is a          distinction   between the

Legislature     of   a   State   and   Legislative    Assembly.

<a href="/doc/1555093/" id="a_333">Article   168</a>    deals    with   the   constitution    of   the

Legislatures of the States. Apart from the Governor, a

Legislative Assembly, when there is only one House,

would be the other constituent part of the Legislature

of the State. Therefore, <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_334">Article 326</a> deals with the


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_203">                                                            172</span>
House of the People, and the Legislative Assembly. It

does not deal with Legislative Councils. As far as

<a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_335">Article   327</a>    is     concerned,    it   deals   with   power    of

Parliament to make law with respect to all matters or

relating to election in connection to either House of

Parliament. Equally, Parliament can make law in regard

to   either     House    of    the   Legislature     of   a   State,

including the preparation of electoral roll. However,

there is a caveat. <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_336">Article 327</a> begins with the words

‘subject to the provisions of this Constitution’. This

would mean that <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_337">Article 327</a> is subject to <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_338">Article 326.</a>

Therefore, since <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_339">Article 326</a> provides for the specific

heads of disqualification in regard to election to the

House of the People and to the Legislative Assembly,

the power to make law under <a href="/doc/31824/" id="a_340">Article 327</a> may not be

available, overcoming the limitation as regards the

grounds of disqualification enumerated in <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_341">Article 326.</a>

This limitation is found even in <a href="/doc/873755/" id="a_342">Article 328</a>, which

deals with the powers of the State Legislature.


</p><p id="p_308">134. Undoubtedly,        the   Founding    Fathers   contemplated

conferring the right to participate in elections to the

House of People and the Legislative Assemblies on all
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_204">                                                                  173</span>
citizens, who were of a certain age. The right was,

however, subject to the condition that they were not

to be disqualified. The disqualifications, again, were,

however, limited to what was contained in <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_343">Article 326.</a>

The disqualifications, no doubt, were to be expressly

provided   by   a   law   to   be   made   by   the   appropriate

Legislature.        The    disqualification           or   rather

qualification included the aspect of residence. <a href="/doc/105905118/" id="a_344">Section

20</a> of the 1950 Act elaborates upon the concept of

residence. Likewise, in the matter of corrupt practices

and other crimes in connection with elections, within

the meaning of <a href="/doc/127621568/" id="a_345">Section 16(c)</a> of the 1950 Act, the matter

is to be regulated by the law.
</p>
<p id="p_309">135. Having noticed all the relevant provisions and

bearing in mind the characteristics of a legal right,

we find as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_310">    Since every legal right, which would include a

Constitutional Right, [as the Constitution is also law

though the grundnorm and not law for the purpose of

<a href="/doc/134715/" id="a_346">Article 13</a>,] must have a title, we must ascertain

whether a citizen of India, who is not less than

eighteen years, as, on the ‘qualifying date’, as found
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_205">                                                             174</span>
by us, has a right. Since, the title to a legal right

means, “the facts or events, by reason of which, the

rights become vested in its owner”, who is the person

of inherence, we will explore, whether <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_347">Article 326</a>

contains the facts and reasons and whether it also

contains the content of a Right. In keeping with the

mandate of <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_348">Article 326</a>, Parliament has made the 1950

Act and the 1951 Act. It is thereafter that the first

general elections were held in the country. It may be

true that the 1950 Act and the 1951 Act have been

amended from time to time. At any given point of time,

placing <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_349">Article 326</a> side-by-side with the law made by

Parliament or the law made by the State Legislature,

we would find that, if a person is a citizen of India

and not below eighteen years of age, and if he does not

incur the disqualifications, which cannot be more than

what is provided in <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_350">Article 326</a>, but the content of

which, may be provided by the law made by the competent

Legislature and the citizen not less than eighteen

years does not have the disqualifications, he becomes

entitled to be entered in the electoral roll. Such

person, as is indicated in <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_351">Article 326</a>, indeed, has a

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_206">                                                   175</span>
right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right,

which may be right subject to the restriction. <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_352">Section

62(1)</a> of the 1951 Act, as we have noticed, gives also

the   Right   to   Vote   to    such   a    person.    Any    other

interpretation would whittle down the grand object of

conferring adult suffrage on citizens.


</p><p id="p_311">136. The mere fact that for the creation of a Right,

one needs to lean on certain facts, which may consist

of a law, which, in turn, is in the main respects

dictated to by the constitutional provision, may not

detract from the existence of a Right. <a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_353">Article 19</a>

confers fundamental freedoms, which are understood as

Fundamental   Rights.     The   Fundamental     Rights       can    be

regulated by law made under <a href="/doc/493243/" id="a_354">Article 19(2)</a> to <a href="/doc/626103/" id="a_355">Article

19(6).</a> Could it be said that, in view of the power to

regulate the Fundamental Right, no right exists? We are

conscious that in the case of Fundamental Rights under

<a href="/doc/1218090/" id="a_356">Article 19</a>, it could be said that the Right exists and

it is only made subject to a law, which may be made.

However, could it be said that whenever a law is made

by Parliament, acting even within the boundaries of

<a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_357">Article   326</a>,     by     amending     or     adding     to        the
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_207">                                                                   176</span>
disqualifications,        even    if    it   be   limited      by   the

disqualifications declared in <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_358">Article 326</a>, that such a

law   could   be   described       as     falling       foul   of   the

Constitution, as contained in <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_359">Article 326?</a>

</p><p id="p_312">137. Take for instance, a new corrupt practice is added

by law. Would it be vulnerable on the ground that it

takes away the Constitutional right under <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_360">Article 326?</a>

We would think that it may not. What would be the

position if the Legislature had not provided for any

corrupt practice or a crime as a disqualification. Then

there would be no such disqualification. However, the

appropriate Legislature is also limited in the matter

of the disqualifications by <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_361">Article 326.</a> In that sense,

it    could   be   said    that        <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_362">Article    326</a>    provides     a

constitutional right, subject to restrictions which the

law provides for, which must finally be traced to its

shores. <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_363">Section 62(1)</a> of the 1950 Act provides the

fulfilment of the goal of adult suffrage guaranteed in

<a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_364">Article 326.</a> <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_365">Article 326(3)</a> and <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_366">Article 326(4)</a> are only

meant to provide against the misuse of the right.

<a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_367">Section 62(2)</a> is clearly reconcilable with <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_368">Article 326.</a>

<a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_369">Section 62(5)</a> again appears to be a restriction.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_208">                                                                    177</span>
</p><p id="p_313">138. In regard to <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_370">Article 326</a>, we may observe, when

the Founding Fathers clearly created a right on the

citizen, who was an adult, (the age was originally 21

years and it was lowered to 18 years), to have his name

entered in the electoral roll unless he has incurred

disqualifications, which, in turn, were limited to

those   mentioned        in   <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_371">Article   326</a>,      they    were    to    be

provided by law. It is clear that a law necessarily had

to be made. The law was, indeed, made as we have noted

by the 1950 and 1951 Acts, providing for the true

contours of the disqualification limited to what was

provided      in    <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_372">Article    326.</a>   Imagine     a     situation,      if

Parliament had not passed 1950 and 1951 Acts, it would

have    led    to    a   situation      where     the    foundational

democratic process of holding elections to the House

of the People and the Legislative Assemblies would have

been rendered impossible. A law had to be made and it

was made. Not making the law would have led to a

constitutional breakdown. We make these remarks to

remind ourselves that treating the Constitution as the

grundnorm, providing the very edifice of the State and

the    Legal   System,        the   making   of   the     law    by    the

Legislative Body, which is a power entrusted to the

Legislative Branch, may come with a duty. A conferment

of legislative power, as is done under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_373">Article 245</a> read

with <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_374">Article 246</a> of the Constitution, is not to be

confused with the making of the law under <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_375">Article 326.</a>

The conferment of a legislative power under <a href="/doc/574894/" id="a_376">Article 245</a>

read with <a href="/doc/77052/" id="a_377">Article 246</a> is the essential legislative

powers in terms of the separation of power envisaged

broadly under the Constitution.
</p>
<p id="p_314">139. We have noticed that we cannot and we need not

finally pronounce on this aspect, in view of the fact

that a Constitution Bench of this Court, which we have

noticed in Kuldip Nayar (supra) has proceeded to hold

that there is no Constitutional Right.

T.   DEMOCRACY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTIONS
</p><p id="p_318">142. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar made the following pertinent

observations regarding democracy in the course of his

speech in the Constituent Assembly on 25.11.1949:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_122">     “What we must do is not to be content with mere
     political democracy. We must make our political
     democracy a social democracy as well. Political
     democracy cannot last unless there lies at the
     base of it a social democracy. What does social
     democracy mean? It means a way of life which
     recognizes liberty, equality and fraternity as
     the principles of life. These principles —
     liberty, equality and fraternity — are not to
     be treated as separate items in a trinity. They
     form a union of trinity in the sense that to
     divorce one from the other is to defeat the
     very purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be
     divorced from equality, equality cannot be
     divorced from liberty. Nor can liberty and
     equality be divorced from fraternity. Without
     equality, liberty would produce the supremacy
     of the few over the many. Equality without
     liberty would kill individual initiative.</blockquote><p id="p_319">
</p><p id="p_320">     Without fraternity, liberty and equality could
     not become a natural course of things. It would
     require a constable to enforce them. We must
     begin by acknowledging the fact that there is

       complete absence of two things in Indian
       society. One of these is equality. On the
       social plane, we have in India a society based
       on the principle of graded inequality, which
       means elevation for some and degradation for
       others. On the economic plane, we have a
       society in which there are some who have
       immense wealth as against many who live in
       abject poverty.
</p>
<p id="p_321">       On January 26, 1950, we are going to enter into
       a life of contradictions. In politics we will
       have equality and in social and economic life
       we will have inequality. In politics we will
       be recognizing the principle of one man, one
       vote and one vote, one value. In our social
       and economic life we shall, by reason of our
       social and economic structure, continue to deny
       the principle of one man, one value. How long
       shall we continue to live this life of
       contradictions? How long shall we continue to
       deny equality in our social and economic life?
       If we continue to deny it for long, we will do
       so only by putting our political democracy in
       peril. We must remove this contradiction at the
       earliest possible moment or else those who
       suffer from inequality will blow up the
       structure of political democracy which we have
       so laboriously built up.”

     place other representatives. Democracy further
     contemplates that the elections should be free
     and fair, so that the voters may be in a
     position to vote for candidates of their
     choice. Democracy can indeed function only upon
     the faith that elections are free and fair and
     not rigged and manipulated, that they are
     effective instruments of ascertaining popular
     will both in reality and form and are not mere
     rituals calculated to generate illusion of
     defence to mass opinion. Free and fair
     elections require that the candidates and their
     agents should not resort to unfair means or
     malpractices as may impinge upon the process
     of free and fair elections. Even in the absence
     of unfair means and malpractices, some times

     affected because of the improper rejection of

</p>
<p id="p_325">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_124">     “What is democracy? According to my approach,
     democracy is a rich and complex normative
     concept. It rests on two bases. The first is
     the sovereignty of the people. This sovereignty
     is exercised in free elections, held on a
     regular basis, in which the people choose their
     representatives, who in turn represent their
     views. This aspect of democracy is manifested
     in majority rule and in the centrality of the

     legislative body through which the people’s
     representatives act.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_125">     This is a formal aspect of democracy. It is of
     central importance, since without if the regime
     is not democratic.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_126">     The second aspect of democracy is reflected in
     the rule of values (other than the value of
     majority rule) that characterize democracy.
     The most important of these values are
     separation of powers, the rule of law, judicial
     independence,    human   rights,    and   basic
     principles that reflect yet other values (such
     as morality and justice), social objectives
     (such as the public peace and security), and
     appropriate ways of behavior (reasonableness,
     good faith). This aspect of democracy is the
     rule   of   democratic  values.    This  is   a
     substantive aspect of democracy. It too is of
     central importance. Without it, a regime is not
     democratic.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_127">     Both aspects, the formal and the substantive,
     are necessary for democracy. They are “nuclear
     characteristics.” I discussed them in one case,
     holding that “these characteristics are based
     ... upon the recognition of the sovereignty of
     the people manifested in free and egalitarian
     elections; recognition of the nucleus of human
     rights, among them dignity and equality, the
     existence of separation of powers, the rule of
     law, and an independent judiciary.”

substantive democracy as follows: -

     on the dignity and equality of all human
     beings.    Thus,    in   addition   to   formal
     requirements (elections and the rule of the
     majority),    there    are   also   substantive
     requirements. These are reflected in the
     supremacy of such underlying democratic values
     and principles as separation of powers, the
     rule of law, and independence of the judiciary.
     They are based on such fundamental values as
     tolerance,       good      faith,      justice,
     reasonableness, and public order. Above all,
     democracy cannot exist without the protection
     of individual human rights – rights so
     essential that they must be insulated from the
     power of the majority.
</p>
<p id="p_330">     Democracy is not just the law of rules and
     legislative     supremacy;     it     is     a
     multidimensional    concept.    It    requires
     recognition of both the power of the majority
     and the limitations on that power.”

</p>
<p id="p_332">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_129">     “The Dilemma of Change

     The need for change presents the judge with a
     difficult dilemma, because change sometimes
     harms security, certainty, and stability. The
     judge must balance the need for change with the
     need for stability. Professor Roscoe Pound
     expressed this well more than eighty years ago:</blockquote><p id="p_333">
</p><p id="p_334">     “Hence all thinking about law has struggled to
     reconcile the conflicting demands of the need

     must be stable and yet it cannot stand still.”

       Stability without change is degeneration.
</p><p id="p_335">       Change without stability is anarchy. The role
       of a judge is to help bridge the gap between
       the needs of society and the law without
       allowing the legal system to degenerate or
       collapse into anarchy. The judge must ensure
       stability   with   change,   and   change   with
       stability. Like the eagle in the sky, which
       maintains its stability only when it is moving,
       so too is the law stable only when it is moving.
       Achieving this goal is very difficult. The life
       of the law is complex. It is not mere logic.
       It is not mere experience. It is both logic
       and experience together. The progress of case
       law throughout history must be cautious. The
       decision is not between stability or change.
       It is a question of the speed of the change.
       The decision is not between rigidity or
       flexibility. It is question of the degree of
       flexibility.”

disapproving of the resort to repeated appointments

     this is to draw a direct line of authority from
     the people through the Legislature to the
     executive. The character and content of
     parliamentary   democracy    in  the    ultimate
     analysis depends upon the quality of persons
     who man the Legislature as representatives of
     the people. It is said that “elections are the

     lifeline of the parliamentary system and its

     full import and true meaning, has to be
     appreciated considering the true context in
     which the same are used and the purpose which
     they   seek   to    achieve.  Debates   in   the

     he would cease to be a Minister. It is a settled
     position that debates in the Constituent
     Assembly may be relied upon as an aid to
     interpret a constitutional provision because
     it is the function of the court to find out
     the   intention    of    the  framers   of   the

       of the people exhibiting a sufficient degree
       of cohesion and its successful working depends
       upon the democratic spirit underlying it being

or protracting the election proceedings in
any manner, the invoking of judicial remedy
has to be postponed till after the completing
of proceedings in elections.

amount to “calling in question an election”
if it subserves the progress of the election
and facilitates the completion of the
election. Anything done towards completing or
in furtherance of the election proceedings
cannot be described as questioning the
election.

<p id="p_366">(3) Subject to the above, the action taken
or orders issued by Election Commission are
open to judicial review on the well-settled
parameters which enable judicial review of
decisions of statutory bodies such as on a
case of mala fide or arbitrary exercise of

being shown to have acted in breach of law.

a vital piece of evidence if the same would

          of <a href="/doc/34511/" id="a_422">Article 329(b)</a> but brought to it during
          the pendency of election proceedings. The
          court must guard against any attempt at
          retarding,   interrupting,   protracting   or
          stalling of the election proceedings. Care
          has to be taken to see that there is no
          attempt to utilise the court&#x27;s indulgence by
          filing a petition outwardly innocuous but
          essentially a subterfuge or pretext for
          achieving an ulterior or hidden end. Needless
          to say that in the very nature of the things
          the court would act with reluctance and shall
          not act, except on a clear and strong case
          for its intervention having been made out by
          raising the pleas with particulars and
          precision   and   supporting  the   same   by
          necessary material.

     construed as a summary of our judgment. These

</p><p id="p_369">163. We    would,   therefore,   find   that   the   Election

Commission of India has been charged with the duty and

blessed with extraordinary powers to hold elections to

both Parliament and state legislatures from time to

time. This is an enormous task. The power it possesses

under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_423">Article 324</a> is plenary. It is only subject to any

law which may be made by Parliament or by the State

Legislature.        Undoubtedly, the Election Commission is

duty bound to act in a fair and legal manner. It must

observe the provisions of the Constitution and abide

by the directions of the Court. The same being done,

it can draw upon a nearly infinite reservoir of power.

Once the poll is notified, [which again is a call to

be taken by the Election Commission itself, and indeed

capable   of        being   misused    and     the    subject    of

considerable controversy, if bias or subservience to

the powers that be, is betrayed], it assumes unusual

powers. Its writ lies across Governments over the

length and breadth of the country. Officers of the

Government who come under its charge become subject to

the superintendence of the Commission. The fate of the

political parties and its candidates, and therefore,

of democracy itself to a great measure is allowed to

rest in the hands of the Election Commission. While

there   may    be    officers   who   assist    the   Commission,

vitally important decisions have to be taken by those

at the helm of the affairs. It is the Chief Election

Commissioner and the Election Commissioners at whose

table the buck must stop. It is in this scenario, we

bear in mind that when a decision is taken in the

process of the holding of the poll, that subject to

proceedings which are initiated in courts which conduce

to the effective holding of the poll, any proceeding

which seeks to bring the election process under a

shadow is tabooed. The significance of this aspect is

that   it    adds     to    the   enormity   of     the    powers     and

responsibilities of the Election Commission. Awaiting

the outcome of the poll to question the election before

the tribunal may result in many illegal, unfair and

mala fide decisions by the Election Commission passing

muster for the day. Once the election results are out,

the matter is largely reduced to a fait accompli. In

fact, many a time an omission or a delay in taking a

decision can itself be fatal to the holding of a free

and fair poll. The relief vouchsafed in an election

petition may not by itself provide a just solution to

the conduct of election in an illegal, mala fide or

unfair      manner.    These       observations     have     a    direct

connection     with        the    question   with    which       we   are

concerned      with,       namely,    the    need    to     take      the

W. PURSUIT OF POWER; A MEANS TO AN END OR AN END
  IN ITSELF?
</p><p id="p_371">164. The     basic       and    underlying       principle         central    to

democracy is power to the people through the ballot.

Abrahim Lincoln declared democracy to be Government of

the    people,      by    the        people    and     for   the   people.     A

political party or a group or a coalition assumes

reigns of governance. The purpose of achieving power

is to run the Government. No doubt, the Government must

be     run    in    accordance          with     the     dictate      of     the

Constitution        and        the    laws.     Political      parties       not

unnaturally        come    out        with    manifestos      containing       a

charter      of    promises          they     intend    to   keep.    Without

attaining power, men organised as political parties

cannot achieve their goals. Power becomes, therefore,

a means to an end.              The goal can only be to govern so

that    the       lofty    aims        enshrined        in   the    directive

principles are achieved while observing the fundamental

rights as also the mandate of all the laws. What is

contemplated is a lawful Government. So far so good.

What, however, is disturbing and forms as we understand

the substratum of the complaints of the petitioner is

the pollution of the stream or the sullying of the

electoral process which precedes the gaining of power.

Can ends justify the means? There can be no doubt that

the strength of a democracy and its credibility, and

therefore, its enduring nature must depend upon the

means employed to gain power being as fair as the

conduct of the Government after the assumption of power

by it. The assumption of power itself through the

electoral process in the democracy cannot and should

not be perceived as an end. The end at any rate cannot

justify    the   means.    The    means    to   gain    power   in   a

democracy must remain wholly pure and abide by the

Constitution and the laws. An unrelenting abuse of the

electoral process over a period of time is the surest

way   to   the   grave    of    the   democracy.      Democracy   can

succeed     only    in     so     far     as    all    stakeholders

uncompromisingly work at it and the most important

aspect of democracy is the very process, the electoral

process, the purity of which alone will truly reflect

the will of the people so that the fruits of democracy

are truly reaped. The essential hallmark of a genuine

democracy is the transformation of the ‘Ruled’ into a

citizenry clothed with rights which in the case of the

Indian Constitution also consist of Fundamental Rights,

which   are    also   being    freely     exercised   and     the

concomitant and radical change of the ruler from an

‘Emperor’ to a public servant. With the accumulation

of wealth and emergence of near monopolies or duopolies

and the rise of certain sections in the Media, the

propensity for the electoral process to be afflicted

with the vice of wholly unfair means being overlooked

by those who are the guardians of the rights of the

citizenry     as   declared   by   this   Court   would     spell

disastrous consequences.

by   pre-announced          norms.       It     averts        a    democratic

Government brought to power by the strength of the

ballot     betraying        their    trust      and      lapsing        into    a

Government of caprice, nepotism and finally despotism.

It is the promise of avoidance of these vices which

persuades    men       to   embrace       the    democratic            form    of

Government.       An   Election      Commission          which         does   not

ensure free and fair poll as per the rules of the game,

guarantees the breakdown of the foundation of the rule

of law.    Equally, the sterling qualities which we have

described    which      must    be       possessed       by       an   Election

Commission    is       indispensable          for   an     unquestionable

adherence to the guarantee of equality in <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_424">Article 14.</a>

In   the   wide    spectrum         of   powers,      if      the      Election

Commission exercises them unfairly or illegally as much

as he refuses to exercise power when such exercise

becomes a duty it has a telling and chilling effect on

the fortunes of the political parties. Inequality in

the matter of treatment of political parties who are

otherwise     similarly         circumstanced              unquestionably

breaches the mandate of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_425">Article 14.</a> Political parties

The electorate are ordinarily, supporters or adherents

of one or the other political parties. We may note that

the recognition of NOTA, by this Court enabling a voter

to    express     his     distrust      for    all   the   candidates

exposes the disenchantment with the electoral process

which hardly augurs well for a democracy. Therefore,

any action or omission by the Election Commission in

holding the poll which treats political parties with

an uneven hand, and what is more, in an unfair or

arbitrary manner would be anathema to the mandate of

<a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_426">Article 14</a>, and therefore, cause its breach. There is

an aspect of a citizen’s right to vote being imbued

with the fundamental freedom under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_427">Article 19(1)(a).</a>

The     right    of     the    citizen    to     seek    and    receive

information about the candidates who should be chosen

by him as his representative has been recognised as a

fundamental       right       [See   Public    Interest    Foundation

Y. THE SYMBOLS ORDER; THE MODEL CODE OF CONDUCT
</p><p id="p_374">166. Apart from the 1950 and 1951 Acts,<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_428"> the Code</a> of

Election Rules, 1961 came to be made. In the year 1968,

The Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order,

1968 [hereinafter referred to as, ‘the Symbols Order’]

came to be made by Notification dated 31.08.1968, in

exercise of powers conferred under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_429">Article 324</a> of the

Constitution read with <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_430">Section 29A</a> of the 1951 Act and

Rules 5 and 10 of the Conduct of Elections Rules. The

Symbols Order deals with allotment and classification

of symbols. Political parties are broadly divided into

recognised political parties or unrecognised political

parties. A recognised party may be a national party or

a state party. Conditions for recognition of a party

as national party and state party are separately laid

down.    Paragraph-15   of   the   Symbols   Order   reads    as

follows:
</p>
<p id="p_375">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_142">        “15. Power of Commission in relation to
        splinter groups or rival sections of a
        recognised political party–

     When the Commission is satisfied on information
     in its possession that there are rival sections
     or groups of a recognised political party each
     of whom claims to be that party, the Commission
     may, after taking into account all the
     available facts and circumstances of the case
     and hearing such representatives of the
     sections or groups and other persons as desire
     to be heard, decide that one such rival section
     or group or none of such rival sections or
     groups is that recognised political party and
     the decision of the Commission shall be binding
     on all such rival sections or groups.”


</blockquote><p id="p_376">167. Paragraph-16 deals with power of the Commission in

case of amalgamation of two political parties.

</p><p id="p_377">168. In the very same year, that is 1968, a Model Code

of Conduct also came to be issued. As of date, a large

body of norms, forming part of the Model Code of

Conduct, have been put in place. The Model Code of

Conduct   for    Guidance   of    Political   Parties   and

Candidates provides, inter alia, as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_143">     “1. No party or candidate shall include in any
     activity    which   may   aggravate   existing
     differences or create mutual hatred or cause
     tension    between   different    castes   and
     communities, religious or linguistic.
</blockquote>

</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_145">     3. There shall be no appeal to caste or
     communal feelings for securing votes. Mosques,

     Churches, Temples or other places of worship
     shall not be used as forum for election
     propaganda.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_146">     4. All parties and candidates shall avoid
     scrupulously all activities which are “corrupt
     practices” and offences under the election law,
     such as bribing of voters, intimidation of
     voters, impersonation of voters, canvassing
     within 100 meters of polling stations, holding
     public meetings during the period of 48 hours
     ending with the hour fixed for the close of
     the poll, and the transport and conveyance of
     voters to and from polling station.”


</blockquote><p id="p_378">169. Thereafter, it proceeds to deal with meetings,

processions, polling day conduct. In regard to the

party in power, we find the following as part of the

Model Code of Conduct. Part VII of the Model Code of

Conduct, inter alia, reads as follows:


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_147">     “VII. Party in Power
     The party in power whether at the Centre or in
     the State or States concerned, shall ensure
     that no cause is given for any complaint that

     purposes of its election campaign and in
     particular –

     Government    accommodation   shall    not   be
     monopolized by the party in power or its
     candidates and such accommodation shall be
     allowed to be used by other parties and
     candidates in a fair manner but no party or
     candidate shall use or be allowed to use such
     accommodation (including premises appertaining
     thereto) as a campaign office or for holding
     any public meeting for the purposes of election
     propaganda;
</blockquote><blockquote id="blockquote_151">     4. Issue of advertisement at the cost of public
     exchequer in the newspapers and other media and
     the misuse of official mass media during the
     election period for partisan coverage of
     political   news   and   publicity    regarding
     achievements with a view to furthering the
     prospects of the party in power shall be
     scrupulously avoided.</blockquote><p id="p_379">
</p><p id="p_380">     5. Ministers and other authorities shall not
     sanction grants/payments out of discretionary
     funds from the time elections are announced by
     the Commission; and”


    There   are    other   aspects    relating    to    Election

Manifestos. There is a clear need for a fearless and

independent Election Commission of India to give full

effect to these salutary principles.

Notification dated 18.02.1994, reads as follows:

</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_157">     “When India is said to be a secular State, it
     does not mean that we reject reality of an
     unseen spirit or the relevance of religion to
     life or that we exalt irreligion. It does not
     mean that secularism itself becomes a positive
     religion or that the State assumes divine
     prerogatives. Though faith in the Supreme is
     the basic principle of the Indian tradition,
     the Indian State will not identify itself with
     or be controlled by any particular religion.
     We hold that no one religion should be given
     preferential status, or unique distinction,
     that no one religion should be accorded special
     privileges in national life or international
     relations for that would be a violation of the
     basic principles of democracy and contrary to
     the    best   interests    of    religion   and
     Government. This      view     of     religious
     impartiality,     of      comprehension     and
     forbearance, has a prophetic role to play
     within the national and international life. No
     group of citizens shall arrogate to itself
     rights and privileges, which it denies to
     others. No person should suffer any form of
     disability or discrimination because of his
     religion but all like should be free to share
     to the fullest degree in the common life. This

a powerful weapon in the hands of an independent and

       that the power of resolving a dispute between

ground    that     it    violated      the   Constitution      or   any

also that while exercising its power to register a

quasi-judicially. The Court also set out the three

obtaining registration by practicing fraud or forgery.

We may notice that under Paragraph-16A of the Symbols

Order, the Commission has been empowered to suspend or

withdraw the recognition of a party as a national or a

state party, after giving a reasonable opportunity. One

of the grounds on which it can be so done is refusal

or    defiance,     apart    from    failure       to   observe    the

provisions of the Model Code of Conduct for Guidance.

Therefore,     after      1994,    enormous    powers     have    been

conferred      on   the     Election    Commission        to   ensure

compliance with the Model Code of Conduct for Guidance

of Political Parties issued by the Election Commission

in 1991 or as amended by it from time to time. The

power can also be exercised under Paragraph-16A in

regard    to   failure      or    defiance    in    the   matter    of

following lawful directions and instructions by the

Commission.

Basu</a> v. Debi Ghosal, (1982) 1 SCC 691] . It is
a statutory right. It is also well settled that
the Election Commission has plenary powers and
could exercise the same to ensure free and fair
elections. Clause 18 of the Symbols Order
predicates the facet of such plenary power to
be exercised by the Election Commission. Clause
18 reads thus :

and directions.—The Commission, may issue
instructions and directions—

provisions of this Order;
</p><p id="p_394">(b) for the removal of any difficulty which may
arise in relation to the implementation of any
such provisions; and
</p><p id="p_395">(c) in relation to any matter with respect to
the reservation and allotment of symbols and
recognition of political parties, for which
this Order makes no provision or makes
insufficient provision, and provision is in the
opinion of the Commission necessary for the
smooth and orderly conduct of elections.”

</p><p id="p_396">25. The Election Commission in the past has
exercised plenary powers under Para 18 for
issuing    interim    directions    regarding
allocation of common symbols to the two
factions, when the dispute under the Symbols
Order was still pending before it. It was
argued that the Election Commission cannot do
so once it had finally decided the dispute.
There is no difficulty in agreeing with the
proposition that once the dispute had been
finally decided by ECI, the question of

       invoking powers under Para 18 by it (ECI) would
       not arise. However, if the dispute is pending
       enquiry before ECI or the final decision of ECI
       is sub judice in the proceedings before the
       constitutional   court,    providing   for   an
       equitable arrangement in the interests of free
       and fair elections and to provide equal level
       playing field to all concerned, would be a just
       and fair arrangement.”

powers available to the Election Commission.

by the Constitution and the Parliament. In this regard,

an appeal made to the existence of plenary power under

<a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_447">Article 324</a> did not pass muster. The attempt was to

persuade the Court to direct the Election Commission

to disallow a candidate from contesting on the ground

that    charges    have   been   framed    for   heinous   and/or

grievous offences. It was found that the Parliament had

greatly encouraging evils of booth capturing, rigging

<blockquote id="blockquote_164">      “30. Criminalisation of politics was never an
      unknown phenomenon in the Indian political
      system, but its presence was seemingly felt in
      its strongest form during the 1993 Mumbai bomb
      blasts which was the result of a collaboration
      of a diffused network of criminal gangs, police
      and customs officials and their political
      patrons. The tremors of the said attacks shook
      the entire nation and as a result of the

Committee, Vohra Committee Report, submitted
by Union Home Secretary, N.N. Vohra, in October
1993, referred to several observations made by
official agencies, including Central Bureau of
Investigation, Intelligence Bureau, Research
and Analysis Wing, who unanimously expressed
their opinion on the criminal network which was
virtually running a parallel government. The
Committee also took note of the criminal gangs
who carried out their activities under the
aegis   of  various   political   parties   and
government    functionaries.   The    Committee
further expressed great concern regarding the
fact that over the past few years, several
criminals had been elected to local bodies,
State Assemblies and Parliament. The Report
observed:
</blockquote>
<p id="p_402">“3.2. … In the bigger cities, the main source
of income relates to real estate — forcibly
occupying   lands/buildings,   procuring  such
properties at cheap rates by forcing out the
existing occupants/tenants etc. Over time, the
money power thus acquired is used for building
up contacts with bureaucrats and politicians
and expansion of activities with impunity. The
money power is used to develop a network of
muscle-power which is also used by the
politicians during elections.”

And again:
</p>
<p id="p_403">“3.3. … The nexus between the criminal gangs,
police, bureaucracy and politicians has come
out clearly in various parts of the country.
The existing criminal justice system, which was
essentially   designed   to   deal   with   the
individual offences/crimes, is unable to deal
with the activities of the mafia; the

by Shri C. Rajagopalachari, made way back in 1922,

which has been referred to by the Constitution Bench

in Public Interest Foundation (supra):


</p><blockquote id="blockquote_165">     “40. …

elaborately quoted from the Two Hundred and Forty-

Fourth   Report   of   the   Law   Commission   of   India    on

Electoral     Disqualifications.       This     Court    also

reiterated the role and, thereafter, the powers of the

Election Commission. The Court went on to observe that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_166">     “115. …The best available people, as is
     expected by the democratic system, should not
     have criminal antecedents and the voters have
     a right to know about their antecedents, assets
     and other aspects. We are inclined to say so,
     for    in    a    constitutional     democracy,
     criminalisation of politics is an extremely
     disastrous and lamentable situation. The
     citizens in a democracy cannot be compelled to
     stand as silent, deaf and mute spectators to
     corruption   by    projecting   themselves   as
     helpless. The voters cannot be allowed to
     resign to their fate. The information given by

     a candidate must express everything that is
     warranted by the Election Commission as per
     law. Disclosure of antecedents makes the
     election a fair one and the exercise of the
     right of voting by the electorate also gets
     sanctified. …”


</blockquote><p id="p_406">185. Thereafter, the Constitution Bench went on to hold

as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_167">     “116. Keeping the aforesaid in view, we think
     it   appropriate  to   issue   the  following
     directions which are in accord with the
     decisions of this Court:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_168">     116.1. Each contesting candidate shall fill up
     the form as provided by the Election Commission
     and the form must contain all the particulars
     as required therein.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_169">     116.2. It shall state, in bold letters, with
     regard to the criminal cases pending against
     the candidate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_170">     116.3. If a candidate is contesting an election
     on the ticket of a particular party, he/she is
     required to inform the party about the criminal
     cases pending against him/her.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_171">     116.4. The political party concerned shall be
     obligated to put up on its website the
     aforesaid information pertaining to candidates
     having criminal antecedents.</blockquote><p id="p_407">

</p><p id="p_408">     116.5. The candidate as well as the political
     party concerned shall issue a declaration in

the widely circulated newspapers in the
locality about the antecedents of the candidate
and also give wide publicity in the electronic
media. When we say wide publicity, we mean that
the same shall be done at least thrice after
filing of the nomination papers.
</p>
<p id="p_409">117. These directions ought to be implemented
in true spirit and right earnestness in a bid
to strengthen the democratic set-up. There may
be certain gaps or lacunae in a law or
legislative enactment which can definitely be
addressed by the legislature if it is backed
by the proper intent, strong resolve and
determined will of right-thinking minds to
ameliorate the situation. It must also be borne
in mind that the law cannot always be found
fault with for the lack of its stringent
implementation by the authorities concerned.
Therefore, it is the solemn responsibility of
all concerned to enforce the law as well as
the directions laid down by this Court from
time to time in order to infuse the culture of
purity in politics and in democracy and foster
and   nurture  an informed citizenry, for
ultimately it is the citizenry which decides
the fate and course of politics in a nation
and thereby ensures that “we shall be governed
no better than we deserve”, and thus, complete
information about the criminal antecedents of
the candidates forms the bedrock of wise
decision-making and informed choice by the
citizenry. Be it clearly stated that informed
choice is the cornerstone to have a pure and
strong democracy.
</p>
<p id="p_410">118. We have issued the aforesaid directions
with   immense anguish, for    the  Election

     Commission cannot deny a candidate to contest
     on the symbol of a party. A time has come that
     Parliament must make law to ensure that persons
     facing serious criminal cases do not enter into
     the political stream. It is one thing to take
     cover under the presumption of innocence of the
     accused but it is equally imperative that
     persons who enter public life and participate
     in law making should be above any kind of
     serious criminal allegation. It is true that
     false   cases   are  foisted   on prospective
     candidates, but the same can be addressed by
     Parliament through appropriate legislation.
     The nation eagerly waits for such legislation,
     for the society has a legitimate expectation
     to be governed by proper constitutional
     governance. The voters cry for systematic
     sustenance of constitutionalism. The country
     feels agonised when money and muscle power
     become the supreme power. Substantial efforts
     have to be undertaken to cleanse the polluted
     stream of politics by prohibiting people with
     criminal antecedents so that they do not even
     conceive of the idea of entering into politics.
     They should be kept at bay.”

  It would appear that the grant of relief would have

resulted in the rewriting of the provision.



Z. INDEPENDENCE; A STERLING AND INDISPENSABLE
   ATTRIBUTE

THE CONCEPT OF LEGITIMATE POWER OF RECIPROCITY
</p><p id="p_411">186. What is independence? Independence is a value,

which is only one of the elements in the amalgam of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_265">                                                   226</span>
virtues that a person should possess. The competence

of     a    man    is        not     to       be    conflated       with    fierce

independence. A person may be excellent, i.e., at his

chosen vocation. He may be an excellent Administrator.

He   may     be    honest          but    the      quality     of   independence

transcends         the        contours             of    the       qualities    of

professional            excellence,           as    also     the    dictates    of

honesty. We may, no doubt, clarify that, ordinarily,

honesty       would      embrace          the      quality     of    courage    of

conviction, flowing from the perception of what is

right and what is wrong. Irrespective of consequences

to the individual, an honest person would, ordinarily,

unrelentingly take on the high and mighty and persevere

in the righteous path. An Election Commissioner is

answerable to the Nation. The people of the country

look       forward      to    him        so    that     democracy     is    always

preserved         and    fostered.            We   may     qualify    the    above

observations by stating that true independence of a

Body of persons is not to be confused with sheer

unilateralism. This means that the Election Commission

must act within the Constitutional framework and the

laws. It cannot transgress the mandate of either and

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_266">                                                                               227</span>
still claim to be independent. Riding on the horse of

independence, it cannot act in an unfair manner either.

Independence must be related, finally, to the question

of ‘what is right and what is wrong’. A person, who is

weak    kneed   before      the    powers       that    be,   cannot      be

appointed as an Election Commissioner. A person, who

is in a state of obligation or feels indebted to the

one who appointed him, fails the nation and can have

no place in the conduct of elections, forming the very

foundation of the democracy. An independent person

cannot be biased. Holding the scales evenly, even in

the    stormiest     of   times,    not     being      servile      to   the

powerful, but coming to the rescue of the weak and the

wronged, who are otherwise in the right, would qualify

as    true   independence.        Upholding      the    constitutional

values,      which   are,   in    fact,     a    part    of   the    Basic

Structure, and which includes, democracy, the Rule of

Law, the Right to Equality, secularism and the purity

of elections otherwise, would, indeed, proclaim the

presence of independence. Independence must embrace the

ability to be firm, even as against the highest. Not

unnaturally, uncompromising fearlessness will mark an

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_267">                                                                         228</span>
independent person from those who put all they hold

dear before their Karma. It is in this context that we

feel advised to refer to the following discussion in

Supreme Court <a href="/doc/66970168/" id="a_448">Advocates-on-Record Assn. and another v.

Union of India66</a>:
</p>
<p id="p_412">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_172">       “310. A little personal research resulted in
       the   revelation   of   the    concept    of   the
       “legitimate power of reciprocity” debated by
       Bertram Raven in his article — “The Bases of
       Power and the Power/Interaction Model of
       Interpersonal    Influence”      (this     article
       appeared in Analyses of Social Issues and

</p><p id="p_414">       In addition to having dealt with various
       psychological reasons which influenced the
       personality of an individual, reference was
       also made to the “legitimate power of
       reciprocity”. It was pointed out that the
       reciprocity norm envisaged that if someone does
       something    beneficial    for     another,    the
       recipient   would   feel    an    obligation    to
       reciprocate (“I helped you when you needed it,
       so you should feel obliged to do this for me.”
       — Goranson and Berkowitz, 1966; Gouldner,
       1960). In the view expressed by the author, the
       inherent need of power is universally available
       in the subconscious of the individual. On the
       satisfaction and achievement of the desired
       power, there is a similar unconscious desire
       to reciprocate the favour.”

      It is important that the appointment must not be

overshadowed by even a perception, that a ‘yes man’

will decide the fate of democracy and all that it

promises. Certainty, the darkest apprehensions of the

founding fathers as buttressed by the reports and other

materials, unerringly point to the imperative need to

act.

AA. THE APPOINTMENT OF SHRI ARUN GOEL: A TRIGGER

</p><p id="p_416">187. An application was filed by the petitioner in W.P.

No. 569 of 2021 to seek interim relief to provide for

appointment to fill a vacancy of Election Commissioner

which had arisen on 15.05.2022 by a Committee. The

Bench commenced hearing of these cases on 17.11.2022.

The matter stood posted to 22.11.2022. It would appear

that    on     18.11.2022,      the     vacancy     of     Election

Commissioner came to be filled up by the appointment

of one Shri Arun Goel. This appointment was attacked

by Shri Prashant Bhushan, learned Counsel appearing for

the petitioner, by contending that when the petitioner

had    moved      an   application,    seeking    interim    relief

relating     to    appointment,   it    was   not   open    to   the

thereupon called upon the respondent to produce the

files relating to the appointment. We perused the note

as also the file. It is therein, inter alia, stated

that a vacancy in the post of Election Commissioner

arose upon the appointment of Shri Rajiv Kumar as the

Chief   Election    Commissioner      w.e.f.   15.05.2022.      No

specific   law    has   been   made   under    <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_449">Article   324.</a>    A

convention   is     put   forward,     which     consisted      of

appointing senior Members of the Civil Services, other

serving or retired Officers of the rank of Secretary

to the Government of India/Chief Secretary of State

Government. The convention further comprised of the

appointment of the senior-most Election Commissioner

as the Chief Election Commissioner so far. We found,

undoubtedly, from the perusal of the files that the

respondent was aware of the pendency of Writ Petition

(Civil) No. 104 of 2015 apart from the other Writ

Petitions. The appointment has been made apparently on

the basis that there was no hinderance to the making

of the appointment. Approval was sought on 18.11.2022

for the appointment of one Election Commissioner. On

the very same day, drawing upon the database of IAS

Officers, serving and retired, in the              position of

Secretary to the Government of India, it was accessed.

We found four names, which included at the top of the

list, the present appointee. Three other names were

also considered by the Minister of Law and Justice. One

of the Officers was from Andhra Pradesh and belonged

to   the   1983   Batch.   The   third   Officer    empanelled

belonged to the Telangana State and he belonged to the

1983 Batch and the fourth Officer belonged to the Tamil

Nadu cadre and belonged to the 1985 Batch. The present

appointee belonged to the Punjab Cadre and was of the

1985 Batch. On the same day, i.e., on 18.11.2022, a

Note was seen put-up, wherein the Law Minister had

suggested the panel of four names for the consideration

of the Prime Minister and the President. Therein also,

the absence of a law and the convention, which we have

already referred to, has been noted. We further find

that three of the Officers mentioned had superannuated

during the last two years or so. The appointee, it was

noted was to superannuate in the month of December,

2022 and had taken voluntary retirement, was found to

be the youngest of the four Members of the panel. It

was recommended to the Prime Minister that considering

his   experience,        age,    profile   and     suitability,     the

current appointee may be considered. On the very same

day again, the Prime Minister recommended the name of

the present appointee. We notice further that, on the

same day again, an application is seen made by the

appointee     in    regard       to    voluntary       retirement   and

accepting the same, again, w.e.f., 18.11.2022, and

waiving the three months period required for acting on

the request of voluntary retirement, the Officer’s

request for voluntary retirement came to be accepted

by the Competent Authority. Not coming as a surprise,

on    the   same     day,       his    appointment       as   Election

Commissioner       was    also    notified.       We    are   a   little

mystified    as    to    how     the   officer     had    applied    for

voluntary retirement on 18.11.2022, if he was not in

the know about the proposal to appoint him. Whether

that be, we notice that 18.11.2022 was a Friday and

very next day, after the Court had directed the case

15.05.2022. The Constitution Bench held a preliminary

hearing on 17.11.2022. It was while so on the next day,

i.e., 18.11.2022, when an interim application was also

pending consideration, all the procedures commencing

with the proposal, processing of the same at the hands

of the Minister for Law, the further recommendations

of the concerned Officers, the recommendation of the

Prime Minister, the acceptance of the application of

the appointee seeking voluntary retirement, waiving the

three   months    period       and     the     appointment      by    the

President   under      <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_450">Article       324(2</a>),    which    came    to    be

notified, took place in a single day. No doubt, there

was no interim Order, restraining such appointment but,

at the same time, I.A. No. 63145 of 2021 in Writ

Petition (Civil) No. 569 of 2021, seeking a direction

to   make   appointment        to     the    vacant     post    by     an

independent     Body,    was     pending       consideration.        Shri

Prashant Bhushan would seek the invalidation of the

appointment itself on the said score.
</p>
<p id="p_418">189. Since the Constitution Bench has been constituted

to   consider    the    need     for    a    different    method       of

appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_274">                                                                      234</span>
Election Commissioners, the procedure involved in the

appointment as has been followed throws up certain

pertinent questions. Appointment is, admittedly, made

from a panel of Senior Civil Servants, both retired and

serving. Learned Attorney General would contend that

the appointment is made from a panel of Officers. The

current appointee was due to retire on 31.12.2022. From

the date of birth of the other three persons, who formed

the   panel,   we     find     that    one     of    the   persons   had

superannuated, apparently, in the year 2020. Another

Officer, whose name figured in the panel had also

superannuated in the year 2020. The only other Officer,

who   was    considered        with    the     appointee,     had    also

superannuated in the year 2020. As on 18.11.2022, if

any of the three were considered and appointed, they

would have had a tenure of less than three years. This

is for the reason that, under <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_451">Section 4</a> of the 1991

Act, an Election Commissioner is entitled to a term of

six years, subject, however, to the condition that the

Officer     would   have     to   vacate     the     Office   upon   his

reaching     the    age   of    65    years.    In    fact,   even   the

appointed Officer was due to retire on 31.12.2022, at

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_275">                                                                     235</span>
the age of sixty years. He would have a term of a little

over five years, on the basis of the appointment made

on 18.11.2022. He would be appointed not as a Chief

Election Commissioner but as an Election Commissioner.

Both the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election

Commissioner, as per <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_452">Section 4</a> of the 1991 Act, are to

be appointed for a term of six years.
</p>
<p id="p_419">190. This   brought   up    the     question   of   <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_453">Section    4</a>,

declaring a fixed term of six years from the date of

assumption of Office, for a Chief Election Commissioner

and an Election Commissioner, being observed in its

breach. The learned Attorney General would respond as

follows. He pointed out that since the time, when the

Election    Commission     became   a   multi-Member   team,    a

convention has grown up of making appointments of

persons, initially as Election Commissioners and the

senior-most Election Commissioner, unless considered

unfit, is appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner.

As far as <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_454">Section 4</a>, declaring that the Chief Election

Commissioner and the Election Commissioner are to be

appointed for a term of six years and the appointments

falling foul of the said mandate, the learned Attorney

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_276">                                                              236</span>
General would point out that the term of the Election

Commissioner      and   the   term    as      Chief     Election

Commissioner, for those who are appointed as the Chief

Election Commissioner, is aggregated. In view of the

first proviso to <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_455">Section 4</a> of the 1991 Act, a shortfall,

in terms of the six years stint, may occur. But it is

pointed out that as far as possible, appointments are

being made so as to fulfil the requirements of the law.

In view of the operation of the proviso, resulting in

a compulsory and premature vacating of the Office by

the incumbent on attaining the age of 65 years, the

term may not last for the full six years, even on the

combination of the two appointments, viz., firstly as

Election   Commissioner    and   later   as    Chief    Election

Commissioner. The learned Attorney General would point

out that this Court should not be detained by the said

aspect,    when   the   question,    which    this     Court    is

concerned with, is different. As far as the criticism

launched, both by Shri Prashant Bhushan and Shri Gopal

Sankaranarayanan, that the panel which was considered,

betrayed    sheer   arbitrariness     and     reinforced       the

grievance and the complaint of the Writ Petitioners

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_277">                                                               237</span>
that an undeniable case is made out for this Court to

step in and grant relief so that a fair procedure for

selection and appointment is laid down, till a law is

made by the Parliament, the learned Attorney General

would point out that Civil Servants or IAS Officers are

by dint of the experience gathered in the course of

their    careers,   ideally    suited    for   appointment     as

Election       Commissioners       and     Chief       Election

Commissioners. They have experience in the matter of

the conduct of the elections at different stages of

their career. They operate as observers in States other

than their cadre States. The Election Commission is not

to be conflated with the Chief Election Commissioner

and     the   Election   Commissioners.        The   Commission

functions as a large team. It is in this regard that

Officers of the Civil Services are impeccably poised

for   being   considered   under   <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_456">Article     324(2</a>),   it    is

pointed out.
</p>
<p id="p_420">191. The learned Attorney General would point out that

that the panel of Officers, is born out of the database

of serving and retired IAS Officers in the position of

Secretaries to the Government of India.

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_278">                                                              238</span>
</p><p id="p_421">192. When it was pointed out that it remained a mystery

to the Court that incongruous with the unambiguous

mandate of <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_457">Section 4</a> of the 1991 Act, all the panellists

were either retired (3 out of four) and the person

finally appointed was himself appointed, when he had

less   than   a   month   for   his   60th   birthday,   it   was

submitted that the Court must bear in mind that the

panel was drawn up from the database of Officers in the

rank of Secretaries to the Government of India, both

serving and retired, and drawn up by the Ministry of

Law and Justice.     When it was further queried as to why

the respondent did not appear to exhibit any anxiety

to ascertain whether there were Officers, who could be

appointed who would be assured the full term of six

years, in keeping with the mandate of law, it was

submitted that there is a dearth of such Officers.

</p><p id="p_422">193. Thereupon, it was the contention of both Shri

Prashant Bhushan and Shri Gopal Shankaranarayan that

this may not be the case. It is pointed out by Shri

Prashant Bhushan that there are 160 Officers, who

belonged to the 1985 Batch and some of them are younger

than Shri Arun Goel.
</p>
<p id="p_423"><span class="hidden_text" id="span_279">                                                              239</span>
</p><p id="p_424">194. We have noted that the three Officers in the panel

were described and edged out, noting the factum of

superannuation. On the said basis, it was found that

the appointee was the youngest. Thereafter on the basis

of his experience, age and suitability, the appointee

was recommended and finally appointed.

</p><p id="p_425">195. If the drawing up of the panel itself results in a

fate   accompli,    then,    the    whole     exercise        would    be

reduced to a foregone conclusion as to who would be

finally   appointed.   What       we   find      about    the   method

involved is, even proceeding on the basis that the

Government has the right to confine the appointee to

Civil Servants, that it is in clear breach of the

contemplated   mandate      that       be   it     as    an   Election

Commissioner   or    Chief       Election        Commissioner,        the

appointee   should   have    a     period     of   six    years.      The

philosophy behind giving a reasonably long stint to the

appointee to the post of Election Commissioner or the

Chief Election Commissioner, is that it would enable

the Officer to have enough time to gear himself to the

needs of the Office and to be able to assert his

independence. An assured           term would instil in the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_280">                                                                      240</span>
appointee, the inspiration and the will to put in place

any reforms, changes, as also the inspiration to bring

out his best. A short-lived stint may drain the much-

needed desire besides the time to fulfil the sublime

objects of the high Office of the Election Commissioner

or   the    Chief    Election     Commissioner.   Any   tendency

towards placating the powers that be, would wax as also

the power and the will to assert his independence may

wane,      bearing   in   mind,     the   short   tenure.   This

apparently is the underlying philosophy of the law made

by Parliament, assuring, a term of six years. The term

of six years is separately assured to both the Election

Commissioner and the Chief Election Commissioner. In

other words, the object of the law and its command

would stand defeated and the practice lends strength

to the complaint of the petitioners. We must make it

clear that the observations are not meant to be an

individualised assessment of the appointee, who we do

note, has excellent academic qualifications. But as we

have noted academic excellence which members of the

civil service may possess cannot be a substitute for

values such as independence and freedom from bias from

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_281">                                                            241</span>
political     affiliation.     We   draw     the   following

conclusions:
</p>
<p id="p_426">     Parliament enshrined a term of six years separately

for the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election

Commissioner. This is the Rule, it is found in <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_458">Section

4(1)</a>. A proviso cannot arrogate itself to the status

of the main provision. The exception cannot become the

Rule. Yet, this what the appointments have been reduced

to. It undermines the independence of the Election

Commission. The policy of the law is defeated.



BB. IS THERE A VACUUM IN <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_459">ARTICLE 324?</a> SHOULD THE
COURT INTERFERE, IF THERE IS ONE?
</p><p id="p_427">196. When <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_460">Article 324(2)</a> provides that the appointment

of   the   Chief   Election   Commissioner   and   the   other

Election Commissioners shall, subject to the provisions

of any law, made in that behalf by Parliament, be made

by the President, in view of <a href="/doc/127060/" id="a_461">Article 74</a>, it would,

undoubtedly, mean that the President is bound to make

appointments in accordance with the advice of the

Council of Ministers. Taking into consideration <a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_462">Article

77</a> also and, in view of the Rules of Business made,

Parliament,    would    be   made    by    the   President        in

accordance with advice of the Prime Minister. It was

precisely such an appointment, which was the cause of

unanimous concern to the Members of the Constituent

Assembly, which we have already adverted to.

taken by this Court, which has been referred to in

paragraph-51.     <a href="/doc/551554/" id="a_480">In    Lakshmi    Kant   Pandey   v.    Union    of

attained a legislative effect. The Court found that

inter-country adoption had to be supported but great

care had to be exercised in the matter of giving

children in adoption to foreign parents. The Court

referred to, inter alia, the draft Declaration by the

Commission for Social Development at its twenty-sixth

session, besides the guidelines and draft guidelines,

which were approved on 04.09.1982. The Court notes, at

paragraph-10,    the    absence   of   a   law   providing   for

adoption of an Indian child by the foreign parent.

Thereafter, it elaborated on the materials available

and finally proceeded to lay down certain principles

Patel,   CJM.   Elaborating   his   contention,
learned counsel submitted that once a criminal
case is registered against a person the law
requires that the court should allow the case
to proceed to its normal conclusion and there
should be no interference with the process of
trial. He further urged that this Court has no
power to quash a trial pending before the
criminal court either under<a href="/doc/1569253/" id="a_490"> the Code</a> of
Criminal Procedure or under the Constitution,
therefore, the criminal proceedings pending
against Patel should be permitted to continue.
Learned Attorney General submitted that since
this Court has taken cognizance of the contempt
matter arising out of the incident which is the
subject matter of trial before the criminal
court, this Court has ample power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_491">Article
142</a> of the Constitution to pass any order
necessary to do justice and to prevent abuse
of process of the court. The learned Attorney
General elaborated that there is no limitation
on the power of this Court under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_492">Article 142</a>
in quashing a criminal proceeding pending
before a subordinate court. Before we proceed
to consider the width and amplitude of this
Court&#x27;s power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_493">Article 142</a> of the
Constitution   it   is   necessary  to   remind
ourselves that though there is no provision
like <a href="/doc/1679850/" id="a_494">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code
conferring express power on this Court to quash
or set aside any criminal proceedings pending
before a criminal court to prevent abuse of
process of the court, but this Court has power
to quash any such proceedings in exercise of
its plenary and residuary power under <a href="/doc/427855/" id="a_495">Article
136</a> of the Constitution, if on the admitted
facts no charge is made out against the accused
or if the proceedings are initiated on
concocted facts, or if the proceedings are
initiated for oblique purposes. Once this Court
is satisfied that the criminal proceedings
amount to abuse of process of court it would
quash such proceedings to ensure justice.

the persons named in the FIR. <a href="/doc/1738333/" id="a_497">In Madhavrao

order as is necessary for doing complete
justice in any ‘cause’ or ‘matter’ pending
before it. The expression ‘cause’ or ‘matter’
would include any proceeding pending in court
and it would cover almost every kind of
proceeding   in   court   including    civil  or
criminal. The inherent power of this Court
under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_499">Article 142</a> coupled with the plenary and
residuary powers under Articles 32 and 136
embraces power to quash criminal proceedings

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_295">                                               251</span>

though the powers conferred on this Court under
<a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_502">Article 142(1)</a> are very wide, but in exercise
of that power the Court cannot make any order
plainly    inconsistent    with    the   express
statutory provisions of substantive law. It may
be noticed that in Prem Chand Garg [1963 Supp
1 SCR 885, 899 : AIR 1963 SC 996] and Antulay

observations with regard to the extent of this
Court&#x27;s power under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_503">Article 142(1)</a> were made
in the context of fundamental rights. Those
observations have no bearing on the question
in issue as there is no provision in any
substantive law restricting this Court&#x27;s power
to    quash     proceedings    pending    before
subordinate court. This Court&#x27;s power under
<a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_504">Article 142(1)</a> to do “complete justice” is
entirely of different level and of a different
quality.    Any   prohibition   or   restriction
contained in ordinary laws cannot act as a
limitation on the constitutional power of this
Court. Once this Court has seisin of a cause
or matter before it, it has power to issue any
order or direction to do “complete justice” in
the matter. This constitutional power of the
Apex Court cannot be limited or restricted by
provisions    contained   in    statutory   law.

opinion observed: (SCC pp. 107-08, para 20)

“Very wide powers have been conferred on this
Court for due and proper administration of

conferred on this Court under Articles 32 and
136 of the Constitution I am of the opinion
that this Court retains and must retain, an
inherent power and jurisdiction for dealing

with any extraordinary situation in the larger
interests of administration of justice and for
preventing manifest injustice being done. This
power must necessarily be sparingly used only
in exceptional circumstances for furthering
the ends of justice.”

No enactment made by Central or State
legislature can limit or restrict the power of
this   Court    under   <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_506">Article  142</a>   of   the
Constitution, though while exercising power
under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_507">Article 142</a> of the Constitution, the
Court   must   take into consideration      the
statutory provisions regulating the matter in
dispute. What would be the need of “complete
justice” in a cause or matter would depend upon
the facts and circumstances of each case and
while exercising that power the Court would
take into consideration the express provisions
of a substantive statute. Once this Court has
taken seisin of a case, cause or matter, it
has power to pass any order or issue direction
as may be necessary to do complete justice in
the matter. This has been the consistent view
of this Court as would appear from the

Association and others v. Union of India71</a>              related to

the appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and High

Court and transfer of Judges and Chief Justices. In the

majority opinion of Justice J. S. Verma, we may notice

the following:
</p>
<p id="p_452">
</p><blockquote id="blockquote_179">       “447. When the Constitution was being drafted,
       there   was    general   agreement     that   the
       appointments    of  Judges   in    the   superior
       judiciary should not be left to the absolute
       discretion of the executive, and this was the
       reason   for   the   provision    made   in   the
       Constitution    imposing   the    obligation   to
       consult the Chief Justice of India and the
       Chief Justice of the High Court. This was done
       to achieve independence of the Judges of the
       superior judiciary even at the time of their
       appointment, instead of confining it only to
       the provision of security of tenure and other
       conditions of service after the appointment was
       made. It was realised that the independence of
       the judiciary had to be safeguarded not merely
       by providing security of tenure and other
       conditions of service after the appointment,
       but also by preventing the influence of
       political    considerations    in    making   the

      appointments,   if   left   to   the   absolute
      discretion of the executive as the appointing
      authority. It is this reason which impelled the
      incorporation    of     the    obligation    of
      consultation with the Chief Justice of India
      and the Chief Justice of the High Court in
      Articles 124(2) and 217(1). The Constituent
      Assembly Debates disclose this purpose in
      prescribing for such consultation, even though
      the appointment is ultimately an executive
      act.”
                                          (Emphasis Supplied)
</blockquote><p id="p_453">203. We may at once observe as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_454">     We have noticed in the context of the Constituent

Assembly debates, as also what preceded it in the form

of   Sub-Committee     Reports,     that    there     was   general

agreement that a law must be made by Parliament and the

amended draft <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_512">Article 289</a> came to be, accordingly,

further amended and approved, leading to the insertion

of   the   words    ‘subject   to   the    law   to   be    made    by

Parliament’ in <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_513">Article 324(2).</a> In other words, the

purpose for which the provision was made, as also the

imperative need to make such a law, has been eloquently

articulated    in    the   views    of    the    Members    of     the

Constituent Assembly. The appointment of Judges of the

Superior Judiciary under the Government of India Act,

which preceded the Constitution, was being made in the

absolute discretion of the Crown. This Court took note

of the fact that if left to the absolute discretion of

the Executive, as the appointing Authority, it may lead

to political considerations in making the appointment.

<a href="/doc/1995948/" id="a_514">Article 124(2)</a> dealing with appointments to the Supreme

Court and <a href="/doc/259647/" id="a_515">Article 217(1)</a> which deals with appointments

to the High Courts, was to be made based on what was

described as ‘consultations’ in these Articles. It will

be again noticed that <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_516">Article 324(2</a>), does not provide

for consultation with any one and it appears to place

the power to make appointments, exclusively with the

Executive as the President is bound by the advice of

the Prime Minister. However, it is precisely to guard

against the abuse by the exclusive power being vested

with the Executive that instead of a consultative

process being provided, Parliament was to make a law.

This clearly was the contemplation of the Founding

Fathers. This Court proceeded to lay down norms in the

absence of any specific guidelines. We may, in this

regard, notice paragraph-477:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_180">     “477. The absence of specific guidelines in the
     enacted provisions appears to be deliberate,
     since   the   power    is   vested   in    high

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_301">                                                   256</span>
     constitutional   functionaries   and  it   was
     expected of them to develop requisite norms by
     convention in actual working as envisaged in
     the concluding speech of the President of the
     Constituent    Assembly.    The    hereinafter
     mentioned norms emerging from the actual
     practice and crystallized into conventions —
     not exhaustive — are expected to be observed
     by the functionaries to regulate the exercise
     of their discretionary power in the matters of
     appointments and transfers.”


</blockquote><p id="p_455">204. We may also indicate that this Judgment provides a

situation where this Court has laid down norms, even

in the constitutional realm.
</p>
<p id="p_456">205. It is further of the greatest moment that this

Court noted that it was realised that independence of

the Judiciary had to be protected not merely after

appointment but by the process of appointment. The

Chief Election Commissioner can also be removed only

in the same fashion as a Judge of the Supreme Court.

His conditions of service cannot be varied to his

disadvantage. But unlike the Comptroller and Auditor

General, who also enjoys protection after appointment,

the Founding Fathers clearly intended to also provide

for an independent Election Commission regulating by

consultation provided for Judges.

<p id="p_457">206. <a href="/doc/1031794/" id="a_517">In Vishaka and others v. State of Rajasthan</a> and

others72, a Writ Petition was filed for enforcement of

Fundamental Rights of working women under Articles 14,

19 and 21. The complaint in the Writ Petition was sexual

harassment of working women at work places. An alleged

brutal gangrape of a social worker provided, what may

be described as, an immediate trigger. This Court went

on    to   find   that   an   incident   of     sexual     harassment

violated the Fundamental Rights of General Equality,

under Articles 14 and 15, and a Right to Life and

</p><p id="p_462">207. The Court also drew on an International Convention

providing     for    elimination      of     all     forms    of

discrimination against women. Finally, on the basis of

the Principle that when there is no inconsistency

between a Convention and a Domestic Law and there is a

void in the Domestic Law, and bearing in mind the

meaning and content of the Fundamental Rights, the

Court went on to lay down elaborate guidelines and

norms. The norms included as to what constituted sexual

provide for disciplinary action to be initiated and a

complaint mechanism. The guidelines were, however, made

binding     and   enforceable   in    law,   until     suitable

legislation was enacted. The norms enunciated by this

Court, which      may have been      legislative   in nature,

interestingly, held the field for more than fifteen

years, when Parliament came out with a law.

Judges case), which no doubt, was a Judgement rendered

in    a    Reference   made   under   <a href="/doc/210155/" id="a_519">Article   143(1)</a>   of    the

Constitution, one of the contentions was, whether the

expression, both in Articles 217(1) and 222(1), viz.,

(consultation with the Chief Justice of India required

consultation with the plurality of Judges or the sole

opinion of the Chief Justice sufficed), this Court went

on to answer the question that the sole individual

opinion of the Chief Justice would not              constitute

‘consultation’. It was also laid down that the Chief

Justice of India must consult four senior-most puisne

Judges before making appointment to the Supreme Court

and High Courts. No doubt, it could be said that the

decisions [the Judges cases] could be said to have

sprouted from the construction of the words used in the

relevant       Articles   and,   in   particular,    the      word

this Court, however, there is no magic formula and what

it all amounts to is, the need to maintain a delicate

cannot, without anything more, usurp what is purely a

legislative power or function, in the context of the

Fundamental      Rights   and    provides    for       constitutional

goals to be achieved and inertia of the Legislative

conclusion. The power of appointment of the Members of

the Election Commission, which was charged with the

highest duties and with nearly infinite powers, and

what is more, to hold elections, not only to the Central

Legislature but to all the State Legislatures, was not

to be lodged exclusively with the Executive. It is,

accordingly that the words ‘subject to any law to be

made by Parliament’ were, undoubtedly, incorporated.
</blockquote>
<p id="p_474">216. No law, however, came to be enacted by Parliament.

We have elaborately referred to the noises and voices

eloquently and without a discordant note being struck,

which points to an overpowering symphony, which calls

for the immediate need to fulfil the intention of the

Founding Fathers, starting with the Goswami Committee

in the year 1990, more than three decades ago, the Two

Hundred and Fifty-Fifth Central Law Commission Report

in 2015 and the Reports, both in the Press and other

materials.

what    the   Founding     Fathers    contemplated      also     and

advocated by in various reports.
</p>
<p id="p_476">218. It may be true only Chief Election Commissioners

were    appointed    for   the   first    four   decades   of   the

Republic and, thereafter, since the year 1993, the

Election Commission has become a team, which consists

of the Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election

Commissioners. It may be true that in the sense that

the    President,    acting   on    the   advice   of   the    Prime

Minister, in accordance with the concerned Rules of

Business, has been making appointments.

</p><p id="p_477">219. However, it is equally clear that <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_532">Article 324</a> has

a    unique   background.     The   Founding     Fathers   clearly

contemplated a law by Parliament and did not intend the

executive exclusively calling the shots in the matter

of    appointments    to   the   Election    Commission.       Seven

decades have passed by. Political dispensations of

varying hues, which have held the reigns of power have

not unnaturally introduced a law. A law could, not be

one to perpetuate what is already permitted namely

appointment at the absolute and sole discretion of the

Executive. A law, as Gopal Sankaranarayanan points out,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_318">                                                                268</span>
would have to be necessarily different. The absence of

such a law does create a void or vacuum. This is despite

a chorus of voices even cutting across the political

divide urging divesting of          the exclusive power of

appointment from the Executive.
</p>
<p id="p_478">220. We   have   noticed,   that    while   making    a   law    is

ordinarily a power with the legislative branch and

being a power, it cannot be compelled by a Court, the

making of law may be a constitutional imperative. In

the   context    of   <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_533">Article      326</a>,   making     of   law    as

contemplated     in   <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_534">Article   326</a>,      was   an   unavoidable

necessity. Realising that the statutory framework was

necessary to breathe life into <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_535">Article 326</a> and which

was not to be incongruous with this command, Parliament

enacted the 1950 Act and the 1951 Act. The first General

Election followed. Making          of law by Parliament as

provided for in <a href="/doc/33485/" id="a_536">Article 146</a> and <a href="/doc/875627/" id="a_537">Article 229</a> dealing

with conditions of service of employees of the Supreme

Court and the High Court respectively, was and is a

sheer power and enabling provision. The context and the

purpose signals no imperative need. No intention to

indeed peremptorily provide for a law as is discernible

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_319">                                                                269</span>
in the case of appointment of the members of the

Election Commission of India pervades the Articles. The

vacuum in the case of <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_538">Article 324 (2)</a> is the absence

of the law which Parliament was contemplated to enact.

betray a special interest in not being forthcoming with

the law. The reasons are not far to seek. There is a

crucially vital link between the independence of the

Election Commission and the pursuit of              power, its

consolidation and perpetuation.

concerned, there is, not unnaturally a near insatiable

quest to continue in the saddle. A pliable Election

at the heart of democracy, who obliges the powers that

sections    of     the   media    where    they       appear       to    have

forgotten    their       invaluable       role    and    have       turned

unashamedly partisan, call for the unavoidable and

unpostponable filling up of the vacuum.                 Even as it is

said that justice must not only be done but seen to be

done, the outpouring of demands for an impartial mode

of appointment of the Members require, at the least,

the banishing of the impression, that the Election

Commission is appointed by less than fair means.

</p><p id="p_482">224. We bear in mind the fact that the demand for

putting in place safeguards to end the                        pernicious

effects of the exclusive power being vested with the

Executive     to     make      appointment       to     the        Election

Commission, has been the demand of political parties

across the board. Once power is assumed, however, the

fact of the matter is that, despite the concerns of the

Founding     Fathers     and     the   availability           of    power,

successive    governments        have,    irrespective         of       their

colour, shied away, from undertaking, what again we

find was considered would be done by Parliament, by the

Founding Fathers.

shaken. The impact of ‘big money&#x27; and its power to

Ambedkar, or again in his words, ‘a person under the

thumb of the Executive’, calls the shots in the matter

of holding the elections, which constitutes the very

heart of democracy, even formal democracy, which is

concerned with and the devastating effect of continuing

to leave appointments in sole hands of the Executive

on fundamental values, as also the Fundamental Rights,

we are of the considered view that the time is ripe for

the Court to lay down norms. In other words, the vacuum

exists on the basis that unlike other appointments, it

was   intended    all       throughout   that    appointment

exclusively by the Executive was to be a mere transient

or stop gap arrangement and it was to be replaced by a

law made by the Parliament taking away the exclusive

power of the Executive. This conclusion is clear and

inevitable and the absence of law even after seven

decades points to the vacuum.

This is to be contrasted with the appointment of the

Members of the Election Commission in <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_541">Article 324(2).</a>

On a comparison of both the Articles, the difference

is stark and would justify the petitioners contention

that in regard to the appointment of the Members of the

Election Commission, having regard to the overwhelming

importance and the nearly infinite plenary powers, they

have   in   regard   to   the   most   important   aspect    of

democracy itself, viz., the holding of free and fair

elections, the Founding Fathers have provided for the

unique method of appointment suited to the requirements

of the posts in question. The refusal of Parliament,

despite what was contemplated by the Founding Fathers,

and what is more, the availability of a large number

of Reports, all speaking in one voice, reassures us

that even acting within the bounds of the authority

available to the Judicial Branch, we must lay down

norms, which, undoubtedly, must bear life only till

Parliament steps in. We have found, how appointments

stand fortified that there is an imperative need for

the Court to step in.
</p>
<p id="p_489">229. As regards the exact norm, which should be put in

place, we bear in mind the following considerations:

</p><p id="p_490">      We have before us the various Reports, which we

have referred to. We would think that, while what must

be laid down, must be fair and reasonable, but it must

be what Parliament would or could lay down, if it were

to make a law. Under the Rules of Business made under

<a href="/doc/990669/" id="a_542">Article 77</a>, it is acknowledged that the appointment of

the   Chief   Election    Commissioner    and   the     Election

Commissioners do not engage the Cabinet. We take note

of the fact that for the appointment to the Director

of the Central Bureau of Investigation [which is not a

constitutional   post],    <a href="/doc/157973673/" id="a_543">Section   4A</a>   of    Delhi   Special

Police   Establishment     Act,   1946,   contemplates     that

appointment shall be made by the Central Government on

the basis of recommendation of a committee consisting

of the Prime Minister as the Chairperson, the Leader

of the Opposition recognised in the House of People,

as such, or where there is no such Leader of the

Opposition, then, the Leader of the Single Largest

Opposition Party in the House and the Chief Justice of

India or a Judge of the Supreme Court nominated by him.

Similarly, we find, in regard to the appointment of the

Chairperson and Members of the Lokpal, under the Lokpal

and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, the Chief Justice is one of

the five Members of a Selection Committee, in the

matter of appointment. We deem it appropriate to notice

Section 4 of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, which

reads as follows:

Hundred and Fifty-Fifth) and lay down as follows.

CC. AN ELECTION COMMISSIONER ENTITLED TO SAME
  PROTECTION   AS  GIVEN  TO  CHIEF   ELECTION
  COMMISSIONER?
</p><p id="p_498">232. One of the contentions raised by the petitioners

is this Court must provide for the same protection to

the Election Commissioners as is available to the Chief

Election Commissioners. Even the Report of the Election

Commission itself would appear to endorse the said view

and complaint. We expatiate. It is the contention of
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_328">                                                    278</span>
the petitioners that when the Constitution was framed,

the Founding Fathers contemplated that appointment of

Election Commissioners was to be need based and not a

full-time affair. Contrary to the said view, however,

a multi-Member team, is what the Election Commission

of India has become, in fact, since 1993. It is here

to stay. The distinction between the Chief Election

Commissioner and the Election Commissioners have been

whittled down considerably by the amendments brought

to   the    1991    Act.    However,    when    it   comes    to   the

constitutional protection, it is pointed out that the

second     proviso     to   <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_544">Article    324(5)</a>   only    enacts     the

protection that the Election Commissioner or Regional

Commissioner shall not be removed from Office except

on   the         recommendation   of     the     Chief       Election

Commissioner. An attempt has, in fact, been made to

persuade this Court to hold that, being in the nature

of a further proviso, as the words of the second proviso

begin as ‘provided further’, it is only a further

protection to the Election Commissioner or a Regional

Commissioner. Thus, it is pointed out, the Court must

adopt      the     following   interpretation.         An    Election

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_329">                                                                   279</span>
Commissioner or Regional Commissioner can be removed

only in the like manner and on like grounds as a Judge

of the Supreme Court of India. A further safeguard is,

however, provided to the Election Commissioner, viz.,

that    he   can   be   removed   from   Office   only   on   the

recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner. To

appreciate the argument, we recapture <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_545">Article 324(5).</a>

It reads as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_207">       “324(5) Subject to the provisions of any law
       made by Parliament, the conditions of service
       and   tenure  of   office  of   the  Election
       Commissioners and the Regional Commissioners
       shall be such as the President may by rule
       determine;

       shall not be removed from his office except in
       like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge

       service of the Chief Election Commissioner
       shall not be varied to his disadvantage after
       his appointment:

       Commissioner or a Regional Commissioner shall
       not be removed from office except on the
       recommendation   of   the    Chief   Election
       Commissioner.”


</blockquote><p id="p_499">233. We decode the said provision as follows:

</p><p id="p_500">       The   conditions   of   service   and   tenure    of   the

Election Commissioners and the Regional Commissioners

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_330">                                                              280</span>
was to be such as made by the Rule provided. This,

however, was subject to any law made by Parliament.

Parliament has quickly on the heels of the Goswami

Committee,   stepped   in     with   the   1991   Act.    We   have

already noted the terms of the Act as subsequently

amended. It contemplates salary to be paid, not only

to the Election Commissioner but also to the Chief

Election Commissioners, which is to be equal to the

salary of the Judge of the Supreme Court of India. The

term as we have already noticed, both of the Chief

Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioner,

was to be six years, subject to the proviso, which we

have   noticed.   It   also    provides    for    other   aspects

relating to conditions of service. While unanimity of

views among the members is statutorily contemplated in

<a href="/doc/168934614/" id="a_546">Section 10(1)</a> as a desirable goal, the               inevitable

differences of opinion was contemplated and <a href="/doc/147285372/" id="a_547">Section

10(3)</a> has declared that in such an eventuality, it is

the opinion of the majority of the Members, which would

prevail. We have already noticed how in T.N. Seshan

(supra), this has been found to not militate against

the Chief Election Commissioner being given the power

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_331">                                                               281</span>
to act as the Chairman of the Commission. It may be

true that there is equality otherwise, which exists

between      the    Chief      Election    Commissioner         and     the

Election Commissioners in various matters dealt with

under the Act. However, we must bear in mind, in law,

<a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_548">Article 324</a> is inoperable without the Chief Election

Commissioner [See T.N. Seshan (supra)]. In law, there

may not be an insuperable obstacle for Parliament to

decide     to      do   away     with     the     post     of   Election

Commissioner. In fact, it happened, as can be seen in

the Judgment in Dhanoa (supra) wherein it was found

that   the      termination      of     service    of     the   Election

Commissioners following the abolition of the posts did

not constitute removal of the Election Commissioner

within the meaning of the second proviso to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_549">Article

324(5).</a> More importantly, even on a plain reading of

<a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_550">Article 324(5</a>), we are of the view that in regard to

the prayer that the Election Commissioner must be

accorded the same protection as is given to the Chief

Election     Commissioner,        the    argument        appears   to    be

untenable. This prayer was rejected, in fact, in T.N.

Seshan (supra). It is clear as day light that the first

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_332">                                                                        282</span>
proviso protects the Chief Election Commissioner alone

from removal by providing for protection as is accorded

to a Judge of the Supreme Court of India. It is still

further more important to notice that the first proviso

interdicts varying of the conditions of service of the

Chief Election Commissioner to his disadvantage after

the appointment. It is, thereafter, that the second

proviso appears. The second proviso exclusively deals

with any other Election Commissioner, inter alia. The

word   ‘any   other    Election   Commissioner’       has   been

provided to distinguish him from the Chief Election

Commissioner.     Therefore,       for     the         Election

Commissioners    other     than    the    Chief        Election

Commissioner,    the     protection   which      is     clearly

envisaged, as against his removal is only that it can

be effected only with the recommendation of the Chief

Election Commissioner. We are of the view that in the

context of the provision, the words ‘provided further’

cannot be perceived as an additional protection to the

Election Commissioner. It is intended only to be a

standalone provision, specifically meant to deal with

the categories of persons mentioned therein. In fact,

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_333">                                                            283</span>
the acceptance of the argument of the petitioners would

involve yet another consequence, which to our minds,

would appear to project an anomalous result. To put it

mildly, if the Election Commissioner is accorded the

protection available under the first proviso to the

Chief Election Commissioner, the result will be as

follows.      He   would    be    entitled   to   not    only   claim

immunity from removal except on being impeached like a

Judge of the Supreme Court but he would be conferred

with a further protection even after the impeachment

or   before    the    impeachment       starts,   that    the   Chief

Election Commissioner must also recommend the removal.

We would think that no more need be said and we reject

the contention. However, we only would observe that in

the light of the fact that Election Commissioners have

become part of the Election Commission, perhaps on the

basis of the volume of work that justifies such an

appointment and also the need to have a multi-Member

team otherwise, it is for Parliament acting in the

constituent capacity to consider whether it would be

advisable to extend the protection to the Election

Commissioners        so    as    to   safeguard   and    ensure   the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_334">                                                                  284</span>
independence of the Election Commissioners as well.

This     goes    also    as   regards    variation     of    service

conditions after appointment.

DD. REGARDING INDEPENDENT SECRETERIAT/CHARGING
  EXPENDITURE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FUND OF INDIA
</p><p id="p_502">234. One   of    the    contentions     and,    therefore,   relief

sought     is,    that    there    must    be     an   independent

Secretariat to the Election Commission of India and the

its expenditure must be charged on the Consolidated

Fund of India on the lines of the Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha

Secretariat.

<p id="p_503">235. In this regard, the second respondent (the Election

Commission of India) has filed a counter affidavit in

Writ Petition (C) No. 1043 of 2017, in which Writ

Petition, the contention and the prayer                 have been

incorporated. In the Counter Affidavit of the Election

Commission itself, the stand of the Election Commission

can be stated in a nutshell as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_504">       It has sent a proposal that the expenditure of the

Commission should be charged on the Consolidated Fund

of India. It refers to the Election Commission Charging

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_335">                                                                285</span>
of Expenses on the Consolidated Fund of India Bill,

1994,    which    provided        for     the    various      items    of

expenditure to be charged upon the Consolidated Fund

of India. It reiterated its proposal for an independent

Secretariat as also charging of the expenditure on the

Consolidated Fund of India by letter dated 13.04.2012,

as also in December, 2016. It has also laid store by

the recommendation of the Law Commission, which inter

alia, recommended the insertion of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_551">Article 324(2A</a>),

which    contemplated       the    Election        Commission     being

provided with an independent and permanent secretarial

staff.
</p>
<p id="p_505">
</p><p id="p_506">236. There    cannot   be    any        doubt    that   the    Election

Commission of India is to perform the arduous and

unenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of

subjugation by and interference from the Executive. One

of the ways, in which, the Executive can bring an

otherwise independent Body to its knees, is by starving

it   off     or   cutting    off        the     requisite     financial

wherewithal and resources required for its efficient

and independent functioning. It would not be unnatural

if faced with the prospect of it not being supplied
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_336">                                                                      286</span>
enough funds and facilities, a vulnerable Commission

may cave in to the pressure from the Executive and,

thus, it would result in an insidious but veritable

conquest   of   an   otherwise   defiant   and    independent

Commission. This is apart from the fact that cutting

off the much-needed funds and resources will detract

from its efficient functioning.
</p>
<p id="p_507">237. No doubt, the stand of the Union of India would

appear to be that these are all matters of policy and

no interference is needed or warranted.

</p><p id="p_508">238. We must bear in mind that to elevate it to a

constitutional   provision   and   protection thereunder,

maybe a matter, which must engage the attention of the

Constituent Body. This is again a matter which can also

be provided by way of a law by Parliament. We have no

doubt that there is considerable merit in the complaint

of the petitioner, which apparently, is endorsed by the

Election Commission of India itself.         We    cannot be

oblivious to the need for articulation of details in

regard to the expenditure, which is a matter of policy,

which we refrain from doing. We would only make an

appeal on the basis that there is an urgent need to

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_337">                                                         287</span>
provide for a permanent Secretariat and also to provide

that the expenditure be charged on the Consolidated

Fund of India and it is for the Union of India to

seriously consider bringing in the much-needed changes.

disposed of as follows:
</p>
<p id="p_510">
  I.   We declare that as far as appointment to the

       posts of Chief Election Commissioner and the

       consisting of the Prime Minister of India, the

       the largest Party in the Opposition in the Lok

       Sabha having the largest numerical strength, and

        place a permanent Secretariat for the Election

        Commission of India and charging its expenditure

        to the Consolidated Fund of India is concerned,

        the Court makes a fervent appeal that the Union

        of India/Parliament may consider bringing in the

        necessary   changes   so   that   the   Election

        Commission of India becomes truly independent.

I.   Reference


</p><p id="p_524">3.   This case arises out of a batch of writ petitions, with the initial

petition filed as a public interest litigation by Anoop Baranwal in

January 2015. The petitioner raised the issue of the constitutional

validity of the practice of the Union of India to appoint the members

of the Election Commission. It was argued in the petition that a fair,

just, and transparent method to select the members of the Election

Commission is missing. The petition also referred to several reports,

which we will discuss in due course, to highlight the issue of bringing

reforms in the selection of members of the Election Commission. It

was further highlighted that since the appointment of the members

of the Election Commission was solely on the advice of the

parliamentary executive of the Union, which leads to arbitrariness

and is in violation of <a href="/doc/367586/" id="a_552">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The petition has

also suggested that the process of selection of members of the

Election   Commission     (Chief   Election   Commissioner/Election

Commissioner) should be transparent and with greater scrutiny,

accountability and stability as it is for the other constitutional and

legal authorities including Judges of the Supreme Court and High


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_342">                                                                       3</span>
Courts,   Chief    Information      Commissioner,        Chairpersons         and

Members of the Human Rights Commission, Chief Vigilance

Commissioner, Director of Central Bureau of Investigation, Lokpal,

Members of the Press Council of India. The writ petition made a

prayer for issuing of mandamus to the Union Government to make

law for ensuring a transparent process of selection by constituting a

neutral and independent committee to recommend the names of

Chief Election Commissioner/Election Commissioners. Vide order

dated 23 October, 2018, a two Judge Bench of this Court emphasized

on the importance of the matter, and referred the matter under

<a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_553">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution to the Constitutional Bench. The

order is reproduced as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_210">     “The matter relates to what the petitioner perceives to be a
     requirement of having a full-proof and better system of appointment
     of members of the Election Commission.
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_211">     Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned
     Attorney General for India we are of the view that the matter may
     require a close look and interpretation of the provisions of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_554">Article
     324</a> of the Constitution of India. The issue has not been debated and
     answered by this Court earlier. <a href="/doc/244297/" id="a_555">Article 145 (3)</a> of the Constitution of
     India would, therefore, require the Court to refer the matter to a
     Constitution Bench. We, accordingly, refer the question arising in
     the present proceedings to a Constitution Bench for an authoritative
     pronouncement. Post the matter before the Hon’ble the Chief Justice
     of India on the Administrative Side for fixing a date of hearing.”




<span class="hidden_text" id="span_343">                                                                                4</span>
</blockquote><p id="p_525">4.   A couple of similar writ petitions were tagged with the above

petition. On 29 September 2022, this Constitution Bench started the

hearing of the case. The Bench sat for several days hearing the

arguments of the petitioner side and of the Union government and

Election Commission of India on the respondents’ side.


</p><p id="p_526">5.   The Union Government has opposed this group of petitions on

the premise that the Court must respect the principle of separation

of power between different organs of the State and should refrain

from interfering in the selection process of the Election Commission

under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_556">Article 324.</a> It was argued by the Union that <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_557">Article 324</a> of the

Constitution conferred the power to appoint Election Commissioners

solely upon the Parliament. He made a reference to the Election

Commission (Conditions of Service of Election Commissioners and

Transaction of Business) Act, 1991 (hereinafter being referred to as

the “Act 1991”) to emphasize his point that the Parliament being

cautious of its responsibility protected the condition of service of the

Chief Election Commissioner/Election Commissioners.


</p><p id="p_527">6.   The learned Attorney General Mr. R. Venkataramani suggested

that the absence of any law does not mean that a constitutional

vacuum exists, calling for the interference of the Court. It was also

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_344">                                                                       5</span>
argued by the learned Attorney General that the appointment of the

members of the Election Commission by the President has not

damaged the process of free and fair elections.


</p><p id="p_528">7.   The learned Solicitor General Mr. Tushar Mehta argued that if

there are lacunas in the process of selection/appointment of Election

Commission, then it is for the Parliament and not the Court to look

into the issues. The learned counsel further argued that the

appointment of the Election Commissioners is to be made by the

President, therefore it is not open to the judiciary to interfere with the

power of the executive. Mr. Mehta further argued that there is

something called “independence of the executive” which must not be

interfered with. It was also argued by the counsel for the Election

Commission that since the right to vote is a statutory right and not a

fundamental right, so it does not call any interference for violation of

fundamental rights.
</p>
<p id="p_529">
</p><p id="p_530">8.   It was raised by the petitioners that the issue of appointment of

Election Commission is linked not just with the right to vote but with

the conception of free and fair elections. Reference was also made to

the selection processes in other jurisdictions to emphasize on the

point that a larger set of parameters or factors play an important role

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_345">                                                                         6</span>
in appointment of Commissioners. Points were also debated

regarding the term of the Chief Election Commissioner/Election

Commissioners,     and    the   process    of   removal    of   Election

Commissioners. The petitioners further argued that there must be

constitutional safeguards in the term and tenure of the Election

Commissioners, so that they can function independently.


</p><p id="p_531">9.   This case not only raises certain fundamental questions about

the interpretation of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_558">Article 324</a> of the Constitution but also forces

us to look at the larger perspective about how the process of selection

of Election Commission is linked with the working of a democracy,

the right to vote, idea of free and fair elections, and the importance

of a neutral and accountable body to monitor elections. This Court

ought to make a discussion on these interconnected debatable issues

raised for our consideration. All these points are indeed sacrosanct

for democracy and for maintaining the independence of the Election

Commission.

interpretation needs to be afforded to the above-discussed provisions,

so that the independence of the Election Commission is ensured.

Before dealing with that, we shall deal with the necessity of the

independence which is imperative of the Election Commission.


    III.    Why an independent Election Commission is Necessary

      A. “Working a Democratic Constitution”1


</p><p id="p_541">18. The basic perception of democracy is that it is a government by

the people, of the people, and for the people. “People” is the central

axis on which the concept of democracy revolves. The establishment

of democracy has been linked with the idea of welfare of the people.

Dr BR Ambedkar had once noted that democracy means “a form and

a method of government whereby revolutionary changes in the

economic and social life of the people are brought about without

bloodshed.”2 Democracy is thus linked with the realization of the

aspirations of the people.

</p><p id="p_543">19. According               to    the     celebrated         philosopher          John      Dewey,

“Democracy is not simply and solely a form of government, but a

social and personal ideal”, in other words, it is not only a property of

political institutions but of a wide range of social relationships.3

Democracy is thus about collective decision-making. The principles

of democracy have been held as a part of the basic structure of the

Constitution.4


</p><p id="p_544">20. The             Indian       Constitution           establishes          a     constitutional

democracy. The Preamble to the Constitution clearly lays down the

vision and creates an outline of the structure of democracy that India

envisaged to be, right at the moment of independence. The Preamble

to the Indian Constitution begins with the phrase “We, the People of

India”. This clearly indicates that the foundations of the future of the

Indian Constitution and democracy begin with the people of India at

the core. The phrase also means that the people of India would be in

a deciding position to choose the governments they want. The phrase

also highlights that the structures of governance which were being

created by the Constitution were supposed to act towards the welfare

of the people. The Preamble provides that the people of India have

resolved to constitute India into a “SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST

SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC”. Each term in this phrase

defined the collective vision of not only the founders of the Indian

Constitution but also the collective destiny of the people of India.

These words also denote the kind of democratic structures that we

were going to create. The word “DEMOCRATIC” in the Preamble is

interlinked with the words preceding and succeeding it, that is

“SOVEREIGN”,      “SOCIALIST”,     “SECULAR”,      “REPUBLIC”.      The

Preamble also provides that the people of India are securing for its

citizens “JUSTICE social, economic and political”. The word

“JUSTICE” manifests the vision of undoing hundreds of years of

injustice that was prevalent on Indian soil. Justice was to be based

on three components: social, economic, and political.


</p><p id="p_545">21. Democracy was established in India to fulfill the goals which

have been significantly encapsulated in the terms of the Preamble.

The institutions which were set up were given a role and duty to fulfill

the task as enshrined in the Preamble and the Constitution. While

the three main pillars of the State rest on the legislature, executive,

and judiciary have their designated roles, the Constitution framers

were also visionary in the sense that they envisaged the creation of


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_355">                                                                      12</span>
other institutions, which would be independent in nature and would

facilitate the working of the three pillars by either demanding

accountability or by taking on roles which would maintain the faith

of the people in the three pillars of democracy. The Election

Commission of India is one such institution that has been created

through the text of the Constitution. It is constitutionally an

independent body. The role of the Election Commission of India is to

ensure that the democratic process in India does not come to a

standstill. The task conferred on the Election Commission is

enormous. It has to ensure that periodical elections keep on

happening.
</p>
<p id="p_546">
</p><p id="p_547">22. India has chosen a system of direct elections. This means that

elections are supposed to happen at regular intervals where the

people of India directly participate by exercising their right to vote.

The Constitution also provides for elections where the representatives

of the people are chosen by an indirect method. These include the

elections for the post of President and Vice-President and the

members of State Legislative Councils. The task to maintain the

sanctity of the elections is supposed to be carried out by the Election

Commission in a fair, transparent and impartial manner, and


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_356">                                                                     13</span>
without any bias or favour. The Election Commission has been given

a wide range of powers towards “superintendence, direction, and

control” over the conduct of all elections to Parliament and the

Legislature of every State and of elections to the offices of President

and Vice-President held under this Constitution. The three words

“superintendence”, “direction”, and “control” have not been defined in

the Constitution but were used in a sense to give the widest

responsibility to the Election Commission. In that sense, the Election

Commission becomes one of the most important as well as central

institutions for preserving and promoting the democratic process and

the structures of democracy on Indian soil. The role of the Election

Commission takes much more relevance given the fact that how the

Indian society and polity used to traditionally behave. As a chief

architect of the constitution, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar once said

“Democracy in India is only a top-dressing on an Indian soil, which

is essentially undemocratic.”5


</p><p id="p_548">23. The Election Commission performs its role to ensure that every

person in the society is able to participate in the process of elections

to select the government. Therefore, the Election Commission in its

working needs to demonstrate the highest degree of transparency

and accountability. The decisions taken by the Election Commission

need to generate the trust of the people so that the sanctity of the

democratic process is maintained. If the Election Commission starts

showing any arbitrary decision-making, then the resulting situation

would not just create doubt on the members of the Election

Commission of being biased but would create fear in the minds of the

common citizens that the democratic process is being compromised.

Therefore, the Election Commission needs to be independent and

fully insulated from any external or internal disrupting environment.

The working of the Commission has to generate confidence in the

minds of the people. In a country like India, where millions of people

still struggle to fulfill their basic needs, it is their right to vote which

gives them hope that they would elect a government that would help

them in crossing the boundaries of deprivation. If this power is

compromised or taken away even by one slight bad decision or biases

of the members of the Election Commission, it would undoubtedly

attack the very basic structure of Indian democracy. The Indian

democracy has succeeded because of the people&#x27;s faith and

participation in the electoral process as well as the everyday work of

the institution.    As a constitutional court of the world’s largest
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_359">                                                                          15</span>
democracy, we cannot allow the dilution of people’s faith in

democratic institutions. The country gained and adopted democracy

after decades of struggle and sacrifices, and the gains received by us

cannot be given away because the institutions still continue to

operate in an opaque manner.

B. Right to Vote


</p><p id="p_558">29. The working of democracy depends on whether the people can

decide the fate of the elected form of government. It depends on the

choices which people make in different ways. This choice of people

cannot be compromised, as their mandate in elections changes the

destinies of government. India is democratic because the people

govern themselves. It is a republic because the government’s power

is derived from its people. Through the electoral process and voting,

citizens participate in democracy. By voting, citizens take part in the

public affairs of the country. Thus, citizens by voting enjoy their right

to choose the composition of their government. It is their choice, and

their ability to participate. A nine-judge bench in the case of K.S.

Puttaswamy (Supra) held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_213">     “... it must be realised that it is the right to question, the right to
     scrutinize and the right to dissent which enables an informed
     citizenry to scrutinize the actions of government. Those who are
     governed are entitled to question those who govern, about the
     discharge of their constitutional duties including in the provision of
     socio-economic welfare benefits. The power to scrutinize and to
     reason enables the citizens of a democratic polity to make informed
     decisions on basic issues which govern their rights.”

human right.7 However, this was not always the case. The history of

proposed the incorporation of the right to vote in the fundamental

rights portion. This proposal was initially endorsed in the initial draft

report of the Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee, which was a part

of the Advisory Committee of the Constituent Assembly.11 The draft

provision also included a sub-clause on an independent Election

Commission. Reproduced as follows:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_214">      1. “Every citizen not below 21 years of age shall have the right to vote
         at any election to the Legislature of the Union and any unit thereof,
         or, where the Legislature is bicameral, to the lower chamber of the
         Legislature, subject to such disqualifications on the ground of
         mental incapacity, corrupt practice or crime as may be imposed, and
         subject to such qualifications relating to residence within the
         appropriate constituency, as may be required by or under the law.

         in all cases, in accordance with the law of the Union.”


</blockquote><p id="p_564">33. This shows that the Framers envisaged that the right to vote

must be accompanied by a provision establishing the Election

</p><p id="p_565">34. KT Shah however objected to the idea of a centralized Election

Commission. He argued that, “if adopted, would be a serious

infringement of the rights of Provincial Autonomy; and as such, I

think it ought to be either dropped or reworded, so as not to prejudice

the rights of the Provincial Legislature to legislate on such

subjects.”13 The clause on right to vote and the creation of the

Election Commission as part of the fundamental rights was then

accepted by a majority vote by the Fundamental Rights Sub-

Committee.14 The clause was then forwarded to the Advisory

Committee in the “Report of the Sub-Committee on Fundamental

Rights” dated April 16, 1947.15

Committee dated April 17, 1947, there were two suggestions on the

fundamental right to vote and Election Commission. S.P. Mukherjee

proposed, “Minorities should be adequately represented on the

Election Commissions proposed for the Union and the units”.17

Jairamdas Daulatram suggested that “such bodies should be made

neutral so that they may inspire confidence among all parties and

communities. Separate representation for the minorities may not be

workable.”18 It was also decided by the Minorities Sub-Committee on

April 18, 1947 “to mention in [their] report that the Election

Commission should be an independent quasi-judicial body.”19


</p><p id="p_567">36. After the clause on the right to vote passed by the Fundamental

Rights Sub-Committee and the Minorities Sub-Committee reached

for consideration before the Advisory Committee, there was a serious

debate on whether to keep the clause in the fundamental rights

chapter or not. Dr. Ambedkar argued for retaining it as a

fundamental right.20 He stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_217">        “… so far as this committee is concerned my point is that we should

        secret voting. It shall be by periodical elections... The third
        proposition which this fundamental clause enunciates is that in
        order that elections may be free in the real sense of the word, they
        shall be taken out of the hands of the Government of the day, and
        that they should be conducted by an independent body which we
        may here call an Election Commission.”21


</blockquote><p id="p_568">37. But this view was disagreed with by several members of the

Advisory Committee. They had an apprehension that such a clause

may       be     objected        to    in   the   Constituent   Assembly   by     the

representatives of the Princely States.22 C. Rajagopalachari expressed

that the future method of elections was not clear, and hence it was

not right to keep a detailed clause on the franchise in the

fundamental rights. He said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_218">        “My only point is whether it is proper to deal with this as a
        fundamental right or whether we should leave it, or a greater part of
        it, for the consideration of the whole Assembly. I submit we cannot
        take it for granted that the Union Legislature shall be elected by the
        direct vote from all citizens from all India. It may be a Federation
        Constitution. It may be indirectly elected. The Government of the
        Union may be formed indirectly, so that we cannot assume that
        every adult or any one whatever the description may be, shall have
        a direct vote to the Legislature. We cannot lay down a proposition
        here without going into those details. We cannot therefore deal with
        the subject at all now. Whether there is going to be direct election or
        indirect election, that must be settled first.”23 (sic)

        have adult suffrage for British India, for reasons of some special
        character, the Indian States cannot have adult suffrage, and there
        must be some sort of a restricted suffrage, it will be still open to the
        Constituent Assembly to modify our proposals.”24



</p><p id="p_571">39. Govind Ballabh Pant explained the reason why there was a

concern regarding inclusion of the right to vote in the fundamental

rights chapter. He said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_219">        “The only apprehension is that some people belonging to the States
        may prick the bubble and say that their rights have been interfered
        with and so on. They may not be represented. We will have what we
        desire.”25

Ambedkar:

        shall certainly stick to certain principles and not yield simply to

principles in regard to the framing of the Constitution.”27 While Dr.

Ambedkar insisted on his view, the majority of members of the

Advisory         Committee   including   Sardar   Patel   adopted   Pant’s

suggestion.28

Committee” dated April 21, 1947, it was noted: “Clause 13 to be

deleted from the fundamental rights, but it should be recommended

by the Chairman in his report to the Constituent Assembly on behalf

of the committee, that it be made a part of the Union Constitution.”29

In his letter addressed to the President of the Constituent Assembly,

Sardar Patel presented the interim report of the Advisory Committee,

while also noting that: “While agreeing in principle with this clause,

we recommend that instead of being included in the list of

fundamental rights, it should find a place in some other part of the

Constitution.”30

agreement among the members of the fundamental rights sub-

committee and the minority rights sub-committee that there needs

to be a clause in the fundamental rights chapter which should

provide for the right to vote; and the task to conduct free and fair

elections, there shall be an independent body called the Election

Commission. However, the clause was not retained by the Advisory

Committee as a fundamental right because it was apprehended that

the princely states might not agree to the Union Constitution if that

clause is retained, as India was going through a historical period of

unification where negotiations were being made with the princely

states to become part of a united India. Despite this, the Founders

retained the right to vote as a constitutional right by recommending

that it should find a place in the text of the constitution.

</blockquote><p id="p_597">56. Justice      Venkatarama          Reddi      then     distinguished         the

constitutional right to vote with the act of giving vote/freedom of

<blockquote id="blockquote_227">     “a distinction has to be drawn between the conferment of the right
     to vote on fulfillment of requisite criteria and the culmination of that
     right in the final act of expressing choice towards a particular
     candidate by means of ballot. Though the initial right cannot be
     placed on the pedestal of a fundamental right, but, at the stage when
     the voter goes to the polling booth and casts his vote, his freedom to
     express arises. The casting of vote in favour of one or the other
     candidate tantamounts to expression of his opinion and preference
     and that final stage in the exercise of voting right marks the
     accomplishment of freedom of expression of the voter. That is where
     <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_586">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is attracted. Freedom of voting as distinct from right
     to vote is thus a species of freedom of expression and therefore
     carries with it the auxiliary and complementary rights such as right
     to secure information about the candidate which are conducive to
     the freedom. None of the decisions of this Court wherein the
     proposition that the right to vote is a pure and simple statutory right

</blockquote><p id="p_598">57. Justice DM Dharmadhikari expressed his agreement with the

view taken by Justice Venkatarama Reddi, thus making it a majority

Justice Shah had held that the right of adults to take part in the

the point that Justice Venkatarama Reddi’s opinion in PUCL 2003

that the right to vote is a constitutional right was explicitly concurred

by Justice Dharmadhikari. Therefore, Kuldip Nayar’s view that

PUCL 2003 considered the right to vote/elect as a statutory right

upheld the amendment. However, Justice Chelameswar wrote a

dissenting opinion. The dissenting judge also addressed the counsel

for the Election Commission of India that the right to vote is merely

a statutory right. He held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_232">     “The right to elect flows from the language of Articles 81 and 170

     the Lok Sabha and legislative Assemblies shall be on the basis of
     Adult Suffrage, i.e., every citizen, who is of 18 years of age and is not
     otherwise disqualified either under the Constitution or Law on the
     ground specified in the Article Shall Be entitled to be registered as a

     mandate that the members of the Lok Sabha and Legislative
     Assembly are required to be Chosen by Direct Election from the
     territorial constituencies in the States. The States are mandated to
     be divided into territorial constituencies under Articles 81(2) (b) and
     170(2)17. The cumulative effect of all the above mentioned

          are of 18 years of age and are not otherwise disqualified, by a valid
          law, to be voters. Thus, a Constitutional right is created in all
          citizens, who are 18 years of age to choose (participate in the
          electoral process) the members of the Lok Sabha or the Legislative
          Assemblies. Such a right can be restricted by the appropriate
          Legislature only on four grounds specified under <a href="/doc/1620503/" id="a_596">Article 326</a>.”



</blockquote><p id="p_602">61. Justice Chelameswar also clarified that the question whether the

right to vote or contest at any election to the Legislative Bodies created

by the Constitution did not arise in the case of N.P. Ponnuswami,

which is cited as an authority on the right to vote. He noted:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_233">          “With due respect to their Lordships, I am of the opinion that both

Election Rules, 1961 to the extent that these provisions violate the

secrecy of voting which is fundamental to the free and fair elections.

It was put forward that the Constitution bench judgment in Kuldip

Nayar created a doubt on ADR and PUCL 2003. The three-judge

bench in PUCL 2013 held that “Kuldip Nayar does not overrule the

other two decisions rather it only reaffirms what has already been

said by the two aforesaid decisions”. However, the three-judge bench

went on to note that:

<blockquote id="blockquote_234">     “… there is no contradiction as to the fact that right to vote is neither

</blockquote><p id="p_606">64. While the scope of the right to vote was not before PUCL 2013,

but it went on to observe that the right to vote is only a statutory

right. But, the three-judge bench in PUCL 2013 followed ADR and

PUCL 2003 to reiterate that “[t]he casting of the vote is a facet of the

right of expression of an individual and the said right is provided

under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_598">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India”, and therefore, a

prima facie case existed for the exercise of jurisdiction of this Court

under <a href="/doc/981147/" id="a_599">Article 32.</a> The bench concluded that:

          Without this, democracy will fail to thrive. Therefore, even if the right
          to vote is statutory, the significance attached with the right is
          massive. Thus, it is necessary to keep in mind these facets while
          deciding the issue at hand.”

judgment in <a href="/doc/90671517/" id="a_600">Raj Bala v. State of Haryana and Others</a>.40 Justice

Chelameswar and Justice Sapre gave separate concurring opinions.

After analysing the previous decisions of this Court, Justice

Chelameswar came to the conclusion that “every citizen has a

constitutional right to elect and to be elected to either Parliament or

the State legislatures.” Justice Sapre reiterated the view taken in

PUCL 2003 that the “right to vote” is a constitutional right but not

merely a statutory right.

<p id="p_608">
</p><p id="p_609">66. What emerges from this detailed discussion is that there has

been a conflicting view on the status of the right to vote. This gives

an opportunity for us to authoritatively hold that the right to vote is

not just a statutory right. In our view, we must look beyond that. Our

decision to analyse the contours of the right to vote is facilitated by

the reasoning provided by the nine-judge bench in K.S. Puttaswamy.

in the proceedings of the Advisory Committee. The only reason why

it   was     shifted   from    fundamental       rights    status    to   another

constitutional provision was that the founders did not want to offend

the Princely States, with whom they were negotiating to be a part of

a united India. Otherwise, they had stressed the importance of the

right to vote and universal adult franchise. Seventy-five years after

Independence, we have the opportunity to realize their absolute

accepted direct elections as a method of choosing the government.

there has been no objection to the right to vote.

is the core of the democratic form of government, which is a basic

feature of the Constitution. The right to vote is an expression of the

choice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under <a href="/doc/1378441/" id="a_602">Article

In history, the right to vote was denied to women and those were

socially oppressed. Our Constitution took a visionary step by

Court has previously read India’s obligation to international

          the majority were also agreed that democratic set-up was part of the

          should be periodical election, so that people may be in a position
          either to re-elect the old representatives or, if they so choose, to
          change the representatives and elect in their place other
          representative. Democracy further contemplates that the elections
          should be free and fair, so that the voters may be in a position to
          vote for candidates of their choice. Democracy can indeed function
          only upon the faith that elections are free and fair and not rigged
          and manipulated, that they are effective instruments of ascertaining
          popular will both in reality and form and are not mere rituals

elections and the role of the Election Commission. Justice Krishna

Iyer (speaking for Chief Justice Beg, Justice Bhagwati, and himself)

stated:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_244">     “Democracy is government by the people. It is a continual
     participative operation, not a cataclysmic, periodic exercise. The
     little man, in his multitude, marking his vote at the poll does a social
     audit of his Parliament plus political choice of this proxy. Although
     the full flower of participative Government rarely blossoms, the
     minimum credential of popular Government is appeal to the people
     after every term for a renewal of confidence. So we have adult
     franchise and general elections as constitutional compulsions. “The
     right of election is the very essence of the constitution” (Junius). It
     needs little argument to hold that the heart of the Parliamentary
     system is free and fair elections periodically held, based on adult
     franchise, although social and economic democracy may demand
     much more.”

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_245">     “The Election Commission is an institution of central importance
     and enjoys far-reaching powers and the greater the power to affect

</p><p id="p_627">78. Justice           Goswami     further    emphasized        on   the    need    of

independence of the Election Commission in the following words:

IV. Constitutional and statutory framework: The Constitutional

Vacuum


</p><p id="p_631">81. <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_625">Article 324</a> of the Constitution provides that superintendence,

direction and control of elections shall           be vested in an Election

Commission. Clause 1 of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_626">Article 324</a> provides:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_248">     “The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of
     the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to Parliament
     and to the Legislature of every State and of elections to the offices of
     President and Vice-President held under this Constitution shall be
     vested in a Commission (referred to in this Constitution as the
     Election Commission).”



</blockquote><p id="p_632">82. The composition of the Election Commission is provided under

Clause (2) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_627">Article 324.</a> It provides:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_249">     “The Election Commission shall consist of the Chief Election
     Commissioner and such number of other Election Commissioners,
     if any, as the President may from time to time fix and the
     appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election
     Commissioners shall, subject to the provisions of any law made in
     that behalf by Parliament, be made by the President.”



</blockquote><p id="p_633">83. <a href="/doc/526940/" id="a_628">Article 324(3)</a> states that the Chief Election Commissioner shall

act as the Chairman of the Election Commission.

</p><p id="p_634">84. Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_629">Article 324</a> deals with conditions of service and

tenure of office of the Election Commissioner. It provides that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_250">     “Subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the
     conditions of service and tenure of office of the Election
     Commissioners and the Regional Commissioners shall be such as
     the President may by rule determine: Provided that the Chief
     Election Commissioner shall not be removed from his office except
     in like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme
     Court and the conditions of service of the Chief Election
     Commissioner shall not be varied to his disadvantage after his
     appointment: Provided       further that     any other Election
     Commissioner or a Regional Commissioner shall not be removed
     from office except on the recommendation of the Chief Election
     Commissioner.”


</blockquote><p id="p_635">85. What comes out of this provision is that the Office of the Chief

Election Commissioner stands on a higher constitutional pedestal,

as he is given equivalence to a Judge of the Supreme Court in matters

of removal. The other thing which comes out is that “the conditions

of service of the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be varied to

his disadvantage after his appointment.” That is to say, the

independence cannot be indirectly diluted by creating unwarranted

conditions of service. Lastly, a wide discretion has been vested with

the Chief Election Commissioner to seek removal of any other

Election Commissioner or a Regional Commissioner.

Commissioner and other Election Commissioners, and nothing has

been provided under <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_630">Article 324.</a> It has been argued that as the

Executive (through President) is making these appointments, it

reduces the independence of the Election Commission. Furthermore,

it was pointed out that the term and tenure of the Election

Commissioners also need to be streamlined in order to ensure

absolute independence of the Election Commission and to prevent

any arbitrary or biased decision to be taken by the Chief Election

Commissioner.
</p>
<p id="p_637">
</p><p id="p_638">87. It has been argued by the learned Attorney General that the

conditions of service and tenure of the Chief Election Commissioner

and Election Commissioners is already governed by the Act, 1991.


</p><p id="p_639">88. <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_631">The Act</a> provides “the conditions of service of the Chief Election

Commissioner and other Election Commissioners to provide for the

procedure and for transaction of business by the Election

Commission and for matters] connected therewith or incidental

thereto”. <a href="/doc/55081742/" id="a_632">The Act</a> deals with salary (<a href="/doc/104042451/" id="a_633">Section 3</a>), tenure/term of office

(<a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_634">Section 4</a>), leave (<a href="/doc/186265764/" id="a_635">Section 5</a>), pension (<a href="/doc/199078316/" id="a_636">Section 6</a>), and other

conditions of service (<a href="/doc/195408352/" id="a_637">Section 8</a>).
</p>
<p id="p_640">


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_434">                                                                    48</span>
</p><p id="p_641">89. The term of office provided under <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_638">Section 4</a> for the Chief

Election Commissioner or an Election Commissioner is “of six years

from the date on which he assumes his office”, subject to the proviso

that “where the Chief Election Commissioner or an Election

Commissioner attains the age of sixty-five years before the expiry of

the said term of six years, he shall vacate his office on the date on

which he attains the said age”. <a href="/doc/113890679/" id="a_639">Section 4</a> thus does not provide a

mandatory 6 years of term.
</p>
<p id="p_642">
</p><p id="p_643">90. An analysis of the provisions of the Act also indicates that there

is nothing provided in terms of the selection process of the Chief

Election Commissioner or the Election Commissioners. Thus, what

emerges from this discussion is that both <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_640">Article 324</a> and the Act,

1991 are silent on the selection process of the Chief Election

Commissioner and the Election Commissioners. There also appears

to be a lacunae in ensuring independence as the Act indirectly

provides a discretion to the Executive to appoint someone close to

retirement at the age of 65 as the Chief Election Commissioner or the

Election Commissioner, and thus will not be able to take the full term

of 6 years.

</p><p id="p_645">91. We need to look at the Constituent Assembly Debates to

examine the level of independence which was expected from the

Election Commission. Moving the draft Article on the Election

Commission before the Constituent Assembly on 15 June 1949, Dr

BR Ambedkar explained the vision behind the provision was

independence from the executive in conducting elections. Dr

Ambedkar said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_251">       “... the House affirmed without any kind of dissent that in the
       interests of purity and freedom of elections to the legislative bodies,
       it was of the utmost importance that they should be freed from any
       kind of interference from the executive of the day… Therefore, so far
       as the fundamental question is concerned that the election
       machinery should be outside the control of the executive
       Government, there has been no dispute. What <a href="/doc/69694/" id="a_641">Article 289</a> does is to
       carry out that part of the decision of the Constituent Assembly. It
       transfers the superintendence, direction and control of the
       preparation of the electoral rolls and of all elections to Parliament
       and the Legislatures of States to a body outside the executive to be
       called the Election Commission. That is the provision contained in
       sub-clause (1).”47


</blockquote><p id="p_646">92. The reason behind having a permanent office of Chief Election

Commissioner was explained by Dr Ambedkar as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_252">       “What the Drafting Committee proposes by sub-clause (2) is to have
       permanently in office one man called the Chief Election
       Commissioner, so that the skeleton machinery would always be
       available. Elections no doubt will generally take place at the end of
       five years; but there is this question, namely that a bye-election may
       take place at any time. The Assembly may be dissolved before its
       period of five years has expired. Consequently, the electoral rolls will

     have to be kept up to date all the time so that the new election may
     take place without any difficulty. It was therefore felt that having
     regard to these exigencies, it would be sufficient if there was
     permanently in session one officer to be called the Chief Election
     Commissioner, while when the elections are coming up, the
     President may further add to the machinery by appointing other
     members to the Election Commission.”



</blockquote><p id="p_647">93. The above statement suggests that the office of the Chief

Election Commissioner requires a kind of permanency, which may be

fulfilled by having someone with a stable full term as the Chief

Election Commission.
</p>
<p id="p_648">
</p><p id="p_649">94. Regarding the conditions of service, Dr Ambedkar said:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_253">     “So far as clause (4) is concerned, we have left the matter to the
     President to determine the conditions of service and the tenure of
     office of the members of the Election Commission, subject to one or
     two conditions, that the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be
     liable to be removed except in the same manner as a Judge of the
     Supreme Court. If the object of this House is that all matters relating
     to Elections should be outside the control of the Executive
     Government of the day, it is absolutely necessary that the new
     machinery which we are setting up, namely, the Election
     Commission should be irremovable by the executive by a mere fiat.
     We have therefore given the Chief Election Commissioner the same
     status so far as removability is concerned as we have given to the
     Judges of the Supreme Court. We, of course, do not propose to give
     the same status to the other members of the Commission. We have
     left the matter to the President as to the circumstances under which
     he would deem fit to remove any other member of the Election
     Commission; subject to one condition that-the Chief Election
     Commissioner must recommend that the removal is just and
     proper.”

provision may favour the Executive in the appointment of the Chief

Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners, and

therefore appealed for a change in the provision. He argued:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_254">      “If the President is to appoint this Commission, naturally it means
      that the Prime Minister appoints this Commission. He will appoint
      the other Election Commissioners on his recommendations. Now,
      this does not ensure their independence. Of course once he is
      appointed, he shall not be removable except by 2/3rd majority of
      both Houses. That is certainly something which can instill
      independence in him, but it is quite possible that some party in
      power who wants to win the next election may appoint a staunch
      party-man as the Chief Election Commissioner. He is removable only
      by 2/3rd majority of both Houses on grave charges, which means
      he is almost irremovable. So what I want is this that even the person
      who is appointed originally should be such that he should be
      enjoying the confidence of all parties his appointment should be
      confirmed not only by majority but by two-thirds majority of both
      the Houses…Of course, there is a danger when one party is in huge
      majority. Still, if he does appoint a party-man, and the appointment
      comes up for confirmation in a joint session, even a small opposition
      or even a few independent members can down the Prime Minister
      before the bar of public opinion in the world.”



</blockquote><p id="p_651">96.   On 16 June 1949, Hirday Nath Kunzru echoed a similar

sentiment, and also highlighted the issues regarding the removal of

the Election Commissioners. He said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_255">      “Here two things are noticeable: the first is that it is only the Chief
      Election Commissioner that can feel that he can discharge his duties
      without the slightest fear of incurring the displeasure of the
      executive, and the second is that the removal of the other Election
      Commissioners will depend on the recommendations of one man
      only, namely the Chief Election Commissioner. However responsible
      he may be it seems to me very undesirable that the removal of his
      colleagues who will occupy positions as.responsible as those of
      judges of the Supreme Court should depend on the opinion of one
      man. We are anxious, Sir, that the preparation of the electoral rolls
      and the conduct of elections should be entrusted to people who are
      free from political bias and whose impartiality can be relied upon in
      all circumstances. But, by leaving a great deal of power in the hands

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_439">                                                                                52</span>
     of the President we have given room for the exercise of political
     influence in the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner
     and the other Election Commissioners and officers by the Central
     Government. The Chief Election Commissioner will have to be
     appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, and, if the Prime
     Minister suggests the appointment of a party-man, the President will
     have no option but to accept the Prime Minister&#x27;s nominee, however
     unsuitable he may be on public grounds.”

</blockquote><p id="p_652">97. He warned thus:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_256">     “If the electoral machinery is defective or is not efficient or is worked
     by people whose integrity cannot be depended upon, democracy will
     be poisoned at the source; nay, people, instead of learning from
     elections how they should exercise their vote, how by a judicious use
     of their vote they can bring about changes in the Constitution and
     reforms in the administration, will learn only how parties based on
     intrigues can be formed and what unfair methods they can
     adopt          to       secure         what           they          want.”


</blockquote><p id="p_653">98. Dr Ambedkar agreed with the points made by Saksena and

Kunzru, and said:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_257">     “...with regard to the question of appointment I must confess that
     there is a great deal of force in what my Friend Professor Saksena
     said that there is no use making the tenure of the Election
     Commissioner a fixed and secure tenure if there is no provision in
     the Constitution to prevent either a fool or a knave or a person who
     is likely to be under the thumb of the Executive. My provision—I
     must admit—does not contain anything to provide against
     nomination of an unfit person to the post of the Chief Election
     Commissioner or the other Election Commissioners…”



</blockquote><p id="p_654">99. The solution which Dr Ambedkar gave was that the Constituent

Assembly should adopt as “Instrument of Instructions to the

President”, which may consist of the guidelines according to which

the President has to make the appointments. He said:


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_440">                                                                                  53</span>
     “The Drafting Committee had paid considerable attention to this
     question because as I said it is going, to be one of our greatest
     headaches and as a via media it was thought that if this Assembly
     would give or enact what is called an Instrument of Instructions to
     the President and provide therein some machinery which it would
     be obligatory on the President to consult before making any
     appointment, I think the difficulties which are felt as resulting…
     may be obviated and the advantage which is contained therein may
     be secured.”



</p><p id="p_655">100. He, however, added that since he was unsure whether the

Assembly would adopt his suggestion of Instrument of Instructions,

he suggested an amendment to the effect that “The appointment of

the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners

shall, subject to the Provisions of any law made in this behalf by

Parliament, be made by the President.” This is incorporated currently

in <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_642">Article 324(2).</a> The idea behind this amendment was that the “law

made in this behalf by Parliament” would address the concerns and

fear raised by members of the Constituent Assembly that the

Executive should not have the exclusive say in the appointment of

the Chief Election Commissioner and the Election Commissioners.

However, we find that the Act, 1991 does not cover any aspect

highlighted in the Constituent Assembly. It is for this reason that this

Court needs to lay down certain broader parameters to fill the

constitutional/legislative gap.

V. The Judgment in TN Seshan


</p><p id="p_657">101. It would be relevant to quote the following excerpt from the

Constitution-bench judgment of this Court in <a href="/doc/1890680/" id="a_643">T.N. Seshan, Chief

Election Commissioner of India v. Union of India and Others48</a>:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_258">          “10. The Preamble of our Constitution proclaims that we are a
          Democratic Republic. Democracy being the basic feature of our
          constitutional set-up, there can be no two opinions that free and fair
          elections to our legislative bodies alone would guarantee the growth
          of a healthy democracy in the country. In order to ensure the purity
          of the election process it was thought by our Constitution-makers
          that the responsibility to hold free and fair elections in the country
          should be entrusted to an independent body which would be
          insulated from political and/or executive interference. It is inherent
          in a democratic set-up that the agency which is entrusted the task
          of holding elections to the legislatures should be fully insulated so
          that it can function as an independent agency free from external
          pressures from the party in power or executive of the day.”



</blockquote><p id="p_658">102. In that case, a petition challenged the validity of &quot;The Chief

Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Condition

of Service) Amendment Ordinance, 1993&quot; (hereinafter called &#x27;the

Ordinance’) to amend the Act, 1991.                        While upholding the

amendment, the court discussed the role of the election commission

being a multi member body and the relation between CEC and other

ECs. Some important points highlighted were as follows:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_259">          “The ECs and the RCs have been assured independence of
          functioning by providing that they cannot be removed except on the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_442">48</span>
     (1995) 4 SCC 611

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_443">                                                                                   55</span>
     recommendation of the CEC. Of course, the recommendation for
     removal must be based on intelligible, and cogent considerations
     which would have relation to efficient functioning of the Election
     Commission. That is so because this privilege has been conferred on
     the CEC to ensure that the ECs as well as the RCs are not at the
     mercy of political or executive bosses of the day…. If, therefore, the
     power were to be exercisable by the CEC as per his whim and
     caprice, the CEC himself would become an instrument of oppression
     and would destroy the independence of the ECs and the RCs if they
     are required to function under the threat of the CEC recommending
     their removal. It is, therefore, needless to emphasise that the CEC
     must exercise this power only when there exist valid reasons which
     are conducive to efficient functioning of the Election Commission.”


Held further:
</blockquote>
<blockquote id="blockquote_260">     “15. We have already highlighted the salient features regarding the
     composition of the Election Commission. We have pointed out the
     provisions regarding the tenure, conditions of service, salary,
     allowances, removability, etc., of the CEC, the ECs and the RCs. The
     CEC and the ECs alone constitute the Election Commission whereas
     the RCs are appointed merely to assist the Commission…”


Furthermore:</blockquote>

<blockquote id="blockquote_261">     “17. Under clause (3) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_644">Article 324</a>, in the case of a multi-member
     Election Commission, the CEC “shall act” as the Chairman of the
     Commission. As we have pointed out earlier, <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_645">Article 324</a> envisages a
     permanent body to be headed by a permanent incumbent, namely,
     the CEC. The fact that the CEC is a permanent incumbent cannot
     confer on him a higher status than the ECs for the simple reason
     that the latter are not intended to be permanent appointees. Since
     the Election Commission would have a staff of its own dealing with
     matters concerning the superintendence, direction and control of
     the preparation of electoral rolls, etc., that staff would have to
     function under the direction and guidance of the CEC and hence it
     was in the fitness of things for the Constitution-makers to provide
     that where the Election Commission is a multi-member body, the
     CEC shall act as its Chairman. That would also ensure continuity
     and smooth functioning of the Commission.”



Also, held:
</blockquote>
<span class="hidden_text" id="span_444">                                                                              56</span>
<p id="p_659">          “21. We have pointed out the distinguishing features from <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_646">Article
          324</a> between the position of the CEC and the ECs. It is essentially
          on account of their tenure in the Election Commission that certain
          differences exist. We have explained why in the case of ECs the
          removability clause had to be different. The variation in the salary,
          etc., cannot be a determinative factor otherwise that would oscillate
          having regard to the fact that the executive or the legislature has to
          fix the conditions of service under clause (5) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_647">Article 324.</a> The only
          distinguishing feature that survives for consideration is that in the
          case of the CEC his conditions of service cannot be varied to his
          disadvantage after his appointment whereas there is no such
          safeguard in the case of ECs. That is presumably because the posts
          are temporary in character. But even if it is not so, that feature alone
          cannot lead us to the conclusion that the final word in all matters
          lies with the CEC. Such a view would render the position of the ECs
          to that of mere advisers which does not emerge from the scheme of
          <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_648">Article 324</a>.”

                                                                 (emphasis added)



</p><p id="p_660">103. The judgment in T.N. Seshan did not directly consider the

issues which are before this Bench. Furthermore, the observations

made in T.N. Seshan indicate that the Election Commissioners were

not mere advisors, but have a crucial constitutional role.

       been accepted in principle by the Goswami Committee on Electoral
       Reforms and the Government had, in the Constitution (Seventieth
       Amendment) Bill, 1990, made a provision also to that effect. That
       Bill was, however, withdrawn in 1993 as the Government proposed
       to      bring     in     a      more     comprehensive       Bill.”


D.     Report of Second Administrative Reform Commission

(2009)52

       “In recent times, for statutory bodies such as the National Human
       Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Central Vigilance Commission
       (CVC) , appointment of Chairperson and Members are made on the
       recommendations of a broad based Committee. Given the far
       reaching importance and critical role of the Election Commission in
       the working of our democracy, it would certainly be appropriate if a
       similar collegium is constituted for selection of the Chief Election
       Commissioner        and       the     Election      Commissioners.”

       similar protection to the Election Commissioners and it only says
       that they cannot be removed from office except on the
       recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner. The provision,
       in the opinion of the Election Commission, is inadequate and

F.     Law Commission of India Report, 2015 (255th Report)54


</p><p id="p_665">104. Taking note of the important role played by the Election

Commission of India i.e., the task of conducting elections throughout

the country, the Law Commission in its 255th Report emphasized that

the Commission should be completely insulated from political

pressure or executive interference to maintain the purity of elections,

inherent in a democratic process, and recommended:

     the Chief Election Commissioner, unless the Committee mentioned
     in sub-section (1) above, for reasons to be recorded in writing, finds
     such Election Commissioner to be unfit.
     Explanation: For the purposes of this sub-section, “the Leader of the
     Opposition in the House of the People” shall, when no such Leader
     has been so recognised, include the Leader of the single largest
     group in opposition of the Government in the House of the People.”


</blockquote><p id="p_666">105. The Law Commission also recommended the formation of an

independent     and     permanent       Secretariat     staff    for   Election

Commission and suggested that:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_265">     “The Election Commission shall have a separate independent and
     permanent secretarial staff. The Election Commission may, by rules
     prescribed by it, regulate the recruitment, and the conditions of
     service of persons appointed, to its permanent secretarial staff.”



</blockquote><p id="p_667">106. These reports clearly indicate the need for reforms in the

working of the Election Commission, in particular in the process of

selection and removal of the members of the Election Commission.


VII. Comparative framework - Foundational parameters


</p><p id="p_668">107. An examination of practice for appointment of the head of

election-conducting bodies across the world shows some trends that

include amongst others, the inclusion of members of the opposition.

In most jurisdictions, such appointments are a consultative process,

involving members/ nominees of both the ruling party and the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_455">                                                                              61</span>
opposition party.            The presence of opposition in various critical

decision-making processes of governance is a sine qua non for a

healthy democracy. It not only provides a system of accountability of

the ruling party but also ensures a much-crucial deliberative

process. This, in turn, plays a pivotal role in preserving the true

essence of democracy by raising the concerns of the people of the

country. In addition, some jurisdictions also have Constitutional

functionaries such as Speakers of the house of Parliament/

Legislature, and Judges of the Highest Court in the country in a

multi-member Committee.                   Relevant details of electoral bodies of

some countries are as follows:</p><pre id="pre_8">

guidelines for autonomy of CBI and other special investigating

agencies in the case of Vineet Narain and Others v Union of India

Rajasthan and Others,69 this Court laid down guidelines to ensure

prevention of sexual harassment of women at workplace. Another

judgment in this regard is Vishwa Jagriti Mission Through

for educational institutes to prevent the menace of ragging.


</p><p id="p_688">111. This Court in the case of Prakash Singh and Others v Union

of India and Others,71 after studying various committee reports on

police reforms, laid down certain directions in the nature of police

reforms to be operative until the new <a href="/doc/1158685/" id="a_671">Police Act</a> is to be framed. It is

necessary to quote the following excerpt from the judgment:

</blockquote><p id="p_689">112. This Court has also laid down guidelines to streamline and

facilitate the institutional apparatus and procedural system. In the

case of Laxmi v Union of India and Others,72 this Court intervened

to prevent cases of acid violence, and laid down guidelines on sale of

acid and the treatment of victims of acid attack. A three-judge bench

decision in Shakti Vahini v Union of India and Others73 issued

guidelines to check unlawful interference by Khap panchayat in

interfaith and inter caste marriages. The Court held:

power of this Court under <a href="/doc/500307/" id="a_675">Article 142</a> of the Constitution.


</p><p id="p_691">114. Our decision is therefore to lay down parameters or guidelines

for the selection process for the appointment of the Chief Election

Commissioner and the Election Commissioner. This decision is

supported by the two-judge judgment in <a href="/doc/103003427/" id="a_676">State of Punjab v. Salil

Sabhlok and Others</a>.74 In this case, it was pointed out that no

parameters or guidelines have been laid down in <a href="/doc/317644/" id="a_677">Article 316</a> of the

Constitution for selecting the Chairperson of the Public Service

Commission and no law has been enacted on the subject with

reference to Schedule VII List II Entry 41 of the Constitution. In his

concurring opinion, Justice Madan Lokur, for the bench, relied on

Mohindhr Singh Gill case to reiterate that:

</p><blockquote id="blockquote_268">          “... wide discretion is fraught with tyrannical potential even in high
          personages. Therefore, the jurisprudence of prudence demands a
          fairly high degree of circumspection in the selection and
          appointment to a constitutional position having important and
          significant ramifications.”



</blockquote><p id="p_692">115. Justice Lokur also analysed the previous judgments of this

Court on judicial review of the selection process, and noted:

     “115. In Centre for PIL [Centre for <a href="/doc/310431/" id="a_678">PIL v. Union of India</a>, (2011) 4 SCC
     1 : (2011) 1 SCC (L&amp;S) 609] this Court struck down the appointment
     of the Central Vigilance Commissioner while reaffirming the
     distinction between merit review pertaining to the eligibility or
     suitability of a selected candidate and judicial review pertaining to
     the recommendation-making process.…Acknowledging this, this
     Court looked at the appointment of the Central Vigilance
     Commissioner not as a merit review of the integrity of the selected
     person, but as a judicial review of the recommendation-making
     process relating to the integrity of the institution. It was made clear
     that while the personal integrity of the candidate cannot be
     discounted, institutional integrity is the primary consideration to be
     kept in mind while recommending a candidate. It was observed that
     while this Court cannot sit in appeal over the opinion of HPC, it can
     certainly see whether relevant material and vital aspects having
     nexus with the objects of the Act are taken into account when a
     recommendation is made. This Court emphasised the overarching
     need to act for the good of the institution and in the public interest.
     Reference in this context was made to <a href="/doc/1792264/" id="a_679">N. Kannadasan [N.
     Kannadasan v. Ajoy Khose</a>, (2009) 7 SCC 1 : (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 1] .”
     (emphasis added)



</p><p id="p_694">116. It was also held that the selection process of a constitutional

post cannot be equated with the selection process of a bureaucratic

functionary. If the Executive is left with the exclusive discretion to

select the candidate, it may destroy the fabric of the constitutional

institution. This Court held:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_269">     “A constitutional position such as that of the Chairperson of a Public
     Service Commission cannot be equated with a purely administrative
     position—it would be rather facetious to do so. While the Chief
     Secretary and the Director General of Police are at the top of the
     ladder, yet they are essentially administrative functionaries. Their
     duties and responsibilities, however onerous, cannot be judged
     against the duties and responsibilities of an important
     constitutional authority or a constitutional trustee, whose very
     appointment is not only expected to inspire confidence in the
     aspirational Indian but also project the credibility of the institution
     to which he or she belongs. I am, therefore, unable to accept the

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_504">                                                                               81</span>
     view that the suitability of an appointee to the post of Chairperson
     of a Public Service Commission should be evaluated on the same
     yardstick as the appointment of a senior administrative
     functionary… The Chairperson takes the oath of allegiance to India
     and to the Constitution of India—not an oath of allegiance to the
     Chief Minister. An appointment to that position cannot be taken
     lightly or on considerations other than the public interest.
     Consequently, it is not possible to accept the contention that the
     Chief Minister or the State Government is entitled to act only on the
     perceived suitability of the appointee, over everything else, while
     advising the Governor to appoint the Chairperson of the Public
     Service Commission. If such a view is accepted, it will destroy the
     very fabric of the Public Service Commission.” (para 119 and 125)



</blockquote><p id="p_695">117. It was concluded that the Court can frame guidelines till the

Legislature steps in. To quote:
</p>
<blockquote id="blockquote_270">     “136. In the light of the various decisions of this Court adverted to
     above, the administrative and constitutional imperative can be met
     only if the Government frames guidelines or parameters for the
     appointment of the Chairperson and Members of the Punjab Public
     Service Commission. That it has failed to do so does not preclude
     this Court or any superior court from giving a direction to the State
     Government to conduct the necessary exercise within a specified
     period. Only because it is left to the State Legislature to consider
     the desirability or otherwise of specifying the qualifications or
     experience for the appointment of a person to the position of
     Chairperson or Member of the Punjab Public Service Commission,
     does not imply that this Court cannot direct the executive to frame
     guidelines and set the parameters. This Court can certainly issue
     appropriate directions in this regard, and in the light of the
     experience gained over the last several decades coupled with the
     views expressed by the Law Commission, the Second
     Administrative Reform Commission and the views expressed by
     this Court from time to time, it is imperative for good governance
     and better administration to issue directions to the executive to
     frame appropriate guidelines and parameters based on the
     indicators mentioned by this Court. These guidelines can and
     should be binding on the State of Punjab till the State Legislature
     exercises its power.” (emphasis added)

Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners which

shall, subject to the provisions of any law made in that behalf by

Parliament, be made by the President. It contemplates that the

Parliament makes a law laying down the procedure of selection for

appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election

Commissioners, but such law has not been made by the Parliament,

even after 73 years since the adoption of the Constitution. In order

to fill the legislative vacuum, i.e. the absence of any law made by the

Parliament for the appointment of members of the Election

Commission and in the light of the views expressed in various reports

of the Law Commission, Election Commission, etc., this Court is of

the considered view that the instant case thus aptly calls for the

exercise of the power of this Court under Article 142 to lay down

guidelines to govern the process of selection and removal of Chief

Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners, till the

Legislature steps in.

insulated from the executive interference. This is envisaged under the

proviso to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_681">Article 324(5)</a> which reads:

     disadvantage after his appointment:
     Provided further that any other Election Commissioner or a Regional
     Commissioner shall not be removed from office except on the
     recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner.”



</blockquote><p id="p_699">120. There are two procedural safeguards available regarding the

removal of the CEC: (i) shall not be removed from his office except in

like manner and on the like grounds as a Judge of the Supreme

Court;   (ii)   the   conditions   of   service   of   the   Chief    Election

Commissioner shall not be varied to his disadvantage after his

appointment. However, second proviso to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_682">Article 324(5)</a> postulates

that the removal of the Election Commissioners could be made only

on the recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner. The

protection available to the Chief Election Commissioners is not

available to other Election Commissioners. Various reports have

       Chief Election Commissioner shall not be removed from his office

       Supreme Court. However, that Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_684">Article 324</a> does not
       provide similar protection to the Election Commissioners and it
       merely says that they cannot be removed from office except on the

       in the opinion of the Election Commission, is inadequate and

     Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_685">Article 324</a> of the Constitution, inter alia, provides that
     the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be removed from his office
     except in like manner and on like grounds as a Judge of the
     Supreme Court. However, Clause (5) of <a href="/doc/950881/" id="a_686">Article 324</a> does not provide
     similar protection to the Election Commissioners and it only says
     that they cannot be removed from office except on the
     recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner. The provision,
     in the opinion of the Election Commission, is inadequate and
     requires an amendment to provide the very same protection and
     safeguard in the matter of removability of Election Commissioners
     from office as is provided to the Chief Election Commissioner. The
     Election Commission recommends that constitutional protection be
     extended to all members of the Election Commission.
     The Election Commission also recommends that the Secretariat of
     the Election Commission, consisting of officers and staff at various
     levels is also insulated from the interference of the Executive in the
     matter of their appointments, promotions, etc., and all such
     functions are exclusively vested in the Election Commission on the
     lines of the Secretariats of the Lok Sabha, and Rajya Sabha,
     Registries of the Supreme Court and High Courts etc.
     The third recommendation of the Election Commission is that its
     budget be treated as “Charged” on the Consolidated Fund of India.”

</p><p id="p_704">123. The office of the Election Commission is an independent

constitutional body which has been vested with the powers of

superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral

rolls and the conduct of all parliamentary and State Legislatures’

elections and that of the office of President and Vice-President in

terms of <a href="/doc/359300/" id="a_687">Article 324(1)</a> of the Constitution. In terms of <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_688">Article 324(2</a>),

the office of Election Commission comprises of Chief Election

Commissioner and “such number of other Election Commissioners, if

any, as the President may from time to time fix” and by an Order dated

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_511">                                                                                86</span>
01 October, 1993, the President has fixed the number of Election

Commissioners to two until further orders. Since 1993, it is a multi-

member Commission with equal participation in transacting the

business of the Election Commission as provided under Chapter III

of the Act, 1991 to ensure the smooth and effective functioning of the

Election Commission.

<p id="p_705">
</p><p id="p_706">124. <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_689">Article 324(5)</a> of the Constitution is intended to ensure the

independence of the Election Commission free from all external

political interference and, thus, expressly provides that the removal

of the Chief Election Commission from office shall be in like manner

as on the grounds as of a Judge of the Supreme Court. Nevertheless,

a similar procedure has not been provided for other Election

Commissioners under second proviso to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_690">Article 324(5)</a> of the

Constitution. The other conditions of the service of Chief Election

Commissioner/other Election Commissioners have been protected by

the Legislature by the Act 1991.

<p id="p_707">
</p><p id="p_708">125. In the facts and circumstances, keeping in view the importance

of maintaining the neutrality and independence of the office of the

Election Commission to hold free and fair election which is a sine qua

non for upholding the democracy as enshrined in our Constitution, it

<span class="hidden_text" id="span_512">                                                                    87</span>
becomes    imperative   to   shield   the   appointment    of   Election

Commissioners and to be insulated from the executive interference.

It is the need of the hour and advisable, in my view, to extend the

protection available to the Chief Election Commissioner under the

first proviso to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_691">Article 324(5)</a> to other Election Commissioners as well

until any law is being framed by the Parliament.


XI. Directions



</p><p id="p_709">126. Until the Parliament makes a law in consonance with <a href="/doc/1970615/" id="a_692">Article

324(2)</a> of the Constitution, the following guidelines shall be in effect:


  (1) We declare that the appointment of the Chief Election

     Commissioner and the Election Commissioners shall be made

     on the recommendations made by a three-member Committee

     comprising of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition of

     the Lok Sabha and in case no Leader of Opposition is available,

     the Leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha in

     terms of numerical strength and the Chief Justice of India.


  (2) It is desirable that the grounds of removal of the Election

     Commissioners shall be the same as that of the Chief Election


<span class="hidden_text" id="span_513">                                                                      88</span>
    Commissioner that is on the like grounds as a Judge of the

    Supreme Court subject to the “recommendation of the Chief

    Election Commissioner” as provided under the second proviso

    to <a href="/doc/1724768/" id="a_693">Article 324(5)</a> of the Constitution of India.


  (3) The conditions of service of the Election Commissioners shall

    not be varied to his disadvantage after appointment.
